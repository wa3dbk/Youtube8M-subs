another method for catching animals in a

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:07.530 
another method for catching animals in a
survival<00:00:05.920> situation<00:00:06.040> is<00:00:06.670> using<00:00:07.149> what<00:00:07.240> is<00:00:07.330> kind

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.540 
survival situation is using what is kind

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.230 
survival situation is using what is kind
of<00:00:07.630> deadfall<00:00:08.099> identify<00:00:09.099> is<00:00:09.370> pretty<00:00:10.120> much

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:10.240 
of deadfall identify is pretty much

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:12.600 
of deadfall identify is pretty much
sounds<00:00:10.480> like<00:00:10.599> it<00:00:10.750> Sal<00:00:11.169> is<00:00:11.379> what<00:00:11.620> it<00:00:11.709> sounds<00:00:12.070> we

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.610 
sounds like it Sal is what it sounds we

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.239 
sounds like it Sal is what it sounds we
have<00:00:12.790> a<00:00:12.820> heavy<00:00:13.330> object<00:00:13.709> like<00:00:14.709> here<00:00:15.039> and<00:00:15.160> this

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:15.249 
have a heavy object like here and this

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:17.310 
have a heavy object like here and this
heavy<00:00:15.459> object<00:00:15.849> could<00:00:16.240> be<00:00:16.299> like<00:00:16.780> this<00:00:17.020> you<00:00:17.289> know

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
heavy object could be like this you know

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.160 
heavy object could be like this you know
several<00:00:17.860> logs<00:00:18.580> lashed<00:00:19.000> together<00:00:19.180> or<00:00:19.570> it<00:00:20.050> could

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:20.170 
several logs lashed together or it could

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.430 
several logs lashed together or it could
be<00:00:20.260> a<00:00:20.290> a<00:00:20.620> large<00:00:21.120> tree<00:00:22.120> log<00:00:22.330> or<00:00:22.630> even<00:00:22.870> a<00:00:22.930> rock<00:00:23.140> and

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:23.440 
be a a large tree log or even a rock and

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.220 
be a a large tree log or even a rock and
pretty<00:00:24.040> much<00:00:24.220> the<00:00:24.400> all<00:00:24.580> the<00:00:25.240> all<00:00:25.600> dead<00:00:26.020> falls

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
pretty much the all the all dead falls

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.620 
pretty much the all the all dead falls
have<00:00:26.440> the<00:00:26.590> same<00:00:26.770> thing<00:00:26.920> in<00:00:27.010> common<00:00:27.400> with<00:00:27.630> they

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
have the same thing in common with they

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.200 
have the same thing in common with they
have<00:00:28.900> a<00:00:29.260> large<00:00:29.860> object<00:00:30.100> held<00:00:30.820> up<00:00:30.940> with<00:00:31.180> a

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
have a large object held up with a

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.380 
have a large object held up with a
trigger<00:00:31.540> and<00:00:32.169> the<00:00:32.739> idea<00:00:33.100> is<00:00:33.309> that<00:00:33.579> once<00:00:34.180> the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
trigger and the idea is that once the

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.060 
trigger and the idea is that once the
animal<00:00:34.809> comes<00:00:35.050> into<00:00:35.530> the<00:00:35.620> deadfall

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
animal comes into the deadfall

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.119 
animal comes into the deadfall
and<00:00:36.309> and<00:00:36.999> starts<00:00:37.929> to<00:00:38.019> take<00:00:38.170> the<00:00:38.350> bait<00:00:38.559> which<00:00:38.980> is

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
and and starts to take the bait which is

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.700 
and and starts to take the bait which is
on<00:00:39.249> the<00:00:39.399> trigger<00:00:39.640> then<00:00:40.329> this<00:00:40.870> will<00:00:41.050> set<00:00:41.260> up<00:00:41.469> and

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
on the trigger then this will set up and

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.399 
on the trigger then this will set up and
then<00:00:42.399> this<00:00:42.999> object<00:00:43.269> is<00:00:43.570> heavy<00:00:43.780> object<00:00:44.260> will

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:44.409 
then this object is heavy object will

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:47.069 
then this object is heavy object will
fall<00:00:44.649> down<00:00:44.980> onto<00:00:45.399> the<00:00:45.699> animal<00:00:46.030> and<00:00:46.749> thereby

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
fall down onto the animal and thereby

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.500 
fall down onto the animal and thereby
killing<00:00:47.140> it<00:00:47.589> so<00:00:48.100> we're<00:00:48.999> gonna<00:00:49.059> set<00:00:49.420> this

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
killing it so we're gonna set this

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.599 
killing it so we're gonna set this
deadfall<00:00:49.719> off<00:00:50.079> for<00:00:50.739> you<00:00:50.859> to<00:00:50.980> see<00:00:51.159> how<00:00:51.309> it<00:00:51.339> works

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
deadfall off for you to see how it works

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:53.130 
deadfall off for you to see how it works
and<00:00:51.819> then<00:00:51.969> we're<00:00:52.390> going<00:00:52.510> to<00:00:52.569> show<00:00:52.929> you<00:00:52.989> how

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
and then we're going to show you how

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:03.829 
and then we're going to show you how
it's<00:00:53.289> made

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.540 

okay<00:01:04.839> so<00:01:04.900> now<00:01:05.229> what<00:01:05.650> I'd<00:01:05.740> like<00:01:05.770> to<00:01:06.010> show<00:01:06.220> you<00:01:06.250> is

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:06.550 
okay so now what I'd like to show you is

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.110 
okay so now what I'd like to show you is
how<00:01:06.810> assembled<00:01:07.810> this<00:01:08.650> deadfall<00:01:09.220> and<00:01:09.760> the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.120 
how assembled this deadfall and the

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.490 
how assembled this deadfall and the
technical<00:01:10.540> name<00:01:10.659> for<00:01:10.810> this<00:01:10.900> deadfall<00:01:11.140> is<00:01:11.470> a

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
technical name for this deadfall is a

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.380 
technical name for this deadfall is a
balanced<00:01:12.070> long<00:01:12.430> deadfall

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
balanced long deadfall

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.230 
balanced long deadfall
what<00:01:14.110> I've<00:01:14.229> done<00:01:14.350> is<00:01:14.500> I've<00:01:14.619> taken<00:01:14.650> five

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
what I've done is I've taken five

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.969 
what I've done is I've taken five
relatively<00:01:16.240> heavy<00:01:16.479> heavy<00:01:16.869> logs<00:01:17.170> and<00:01:17.470> I've

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
relatively heavy heavy logs and I've

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.100 
relatively heavy heavy logs and I've
lashed<00:01:18.190> them<00:01:18.340> together<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.880> make<00:01:18.909> one<00:01:19.510> large

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
lashed them together to make one large

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.940 
lashed them together to make one large
heavy<00:01:21.009> object<00:01:21.550> for<00:01:22.030> our<00:01:22.060> deadfall<00:01:22.830> almost<00:01:23.830> a

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
heavy object for our deadfall almost a

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.580 
heavy object for our deadfall almost a
substitute<00:01:24.460> as<00:01:24.850> if<00:01:25.150> it<00:01:25.300> was<00:01:25.450> a<00:01:25.479> boulder<00:01:26.350> or<00:01:26.530> a

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
substitute as if it was a boulder or a

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.290 
substitute as if it was a boulder or a
rocket<00:01:27.180> okay

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
rocket okay

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.670 
rocket okay
so<00:01:28.450> what<00:01:28.659> I've<00:01:28.780> done<00:01:28.900> is<00:01:29.080> I've<00:01:29.200> added<00:01:29.409> some

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
so what I've done is I've added some

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.830 
so what I've done is I've added some
support<00:01:30.159> beams<00:01:30.310> perpendicular<00:01:31.180> to<00:01:31.210> my<00:01:31.540> logs

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
support beams perpendicular to my logs

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.770 
support beams perpendicular to my logs
and<00:01:32.170> I've<00:01:32.979> done<00:01:33.190> a<00:01:33.220> modified<00:01:33.759> square<00:01:34.210> lashing

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
and I've done a modified square lashing

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.100 
and I've done a modified square lashing
on<00:01:35.170> all<00:01:35.860> of<00:01:36.070> them<00:01:36.250> together<00:01:36.660> and<00:01:37.660> so<00:01:37.869> I<00:01:37.899> have

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
on all of them together and so I have

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.499 
on all of them together and so I have
this<00:01:38.289> perpendicular<00:01:39.009> support<00:01:39.580> me<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:39.940> I've

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
this perpendicular support me and I've

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.200 
this perpendicular support me and I've
wrapped<00:01:40.810> around<00:01:41.020> each<00:01:41.800> beam<00:01:42.220> and<00:01:42.580> back<00:01:42.970> around

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
wrapped around each beam and back around

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.139 
wrapped around each beam and back around
the<00:01:43.390> support<00:01:43.750> beam<00:01:44.460> all<00:01:45.460> the<00:01:45.520> way<00:01:45.729> to<00:01:45.789> the<00:01:45.970> end

00:01:46.139 --> 00:01:46.149 
the support beam all the way to the end

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:48.840 
the support beam all the way to the end
I<00:01:46.479> started<00:01:47.320> with<00:01:47.410> us<00:01:47.530> with<00:01:47.890> a<00:01:47.920> clove<00:01:48.280> hitch<00:01:48.310> and

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
I started with us with a clove hitch and

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.450 
I started with us with a clove hitch and
I'm<00:01:49.360> going<00:01:49.539> to<00:01:49.570> finish<00:01:49.780> it<00:01:49.929> after<00:01:50.590> I<00:01:50.979> tighten

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
I'm going to finish it after I tighten

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.520 
I'm going to finish it after I tighten
it<00:01:51.660> I'll<00:01:52.660> go<00:01:52.899> around<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.470> loops<00:01:55.380> take<00:01:56.380> them

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
it I'll go around the loops take them

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.680 
it I'll go around the loops take them
down<00:01:56.679> on<00:01:56.890> them<00:01:59.940> you<00:02:00.940> can<00:02:01.030> really<00:02:01.270> crank<00:02:01.479> down

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
down on them you can really crank down

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.249 
down on them you can really crank down
hard<00:02:01.990> on<00:02:02.110> this<00:02:02.200> left<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:07.689> then<00:02:08.019> I'm<00:02:08.110> gonna

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
hard on this left and then I'm gonna

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.430 
hard on this left and then I'm gonna
finish<00:02:08.530> also<00:02:08.950> with<00:02:09.880> a<00:02:09.910> clove<00:02:10.209> hitch<00:02:10.299> the<00:02:11.200> same

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
finish also with a clove hitch the same

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.460 
finish also with a clove hitch the same
I<00:02:11.650> started<00:02:12.010> with<00:02:15.239> okay<00:02:16.239> so<00:02:16.630> now<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:17.200> that's

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
I started with okay so now that that's

balance beam support beam here and then

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.590 
balance beam support beam here and then
your<00:02:29.709> pedestal<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.820> it's<00:02:30.970> going<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.150> rest<00:02:31.360> on

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
either latched onto or used a natural

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.670 
either latched onto or used a natural
branch<00:02:42.280> off<00:02:42.549> of<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:44.260> I'll<00:02:44.470> show<00:02:44.620> you

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
branch off of it and and I'll show you

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.630 
branch off of it and and I'll show you
how<00:02:44.860> that<00:02:44.920> all<00:02:45.280> goes<00:02:45.519> together<00:02:45.700> here<00:02:46.150> so

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
how that all goes together here so

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.750 
how that all goes together here so

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
you're gonna pick up your you're your

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.930 
you're gonna pick up your you're your
weight

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
weight

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:02.740 
weight
and<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.450> can<00:02:54.630> lean<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:54.990> against<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:56.630> pedestal

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.030 

once<00:03:03.750> you've<00:03:03.870> got<00:03:04.020> it<00:03:04.050> resting<00:03:04.590> pretty<00:03:04.830> well

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
once you've got it resting pretty well

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.310 
you can hold it with just the one side
and<00:03:09.870> this<00:03:10.110> is<00:03:10.260> where<00:03:10.670> it<00:03:11.670> gets<00:03:11.790> kind<00:03:12.000> of<00:03:12.090> tricky

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320
