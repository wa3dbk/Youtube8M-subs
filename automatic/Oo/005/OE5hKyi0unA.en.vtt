00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
the price was a bit shocking for me at

the price was a bit shocking for me at
49<00:02:10.300> thousand<00:02:10.780> dollars<00:02:10.990> but<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.320> truth<00:02:11.530> is

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
49 thousand dollars but the truth is

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.620 
49 thousand dollars but the truth is
there's<00:02:12.310> nothing<00:02:12.580> on<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.060> market<00:02:13.090> like<00:02:13.570> this

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
there's nothing on the market like this
