00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
that and you do have flick fire on the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.560 
that and you do have flick fire on the
side<00:02:41.500> here<00:02:41.530> which<00:02:42.010> is<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.640> little<00:02:43.330> bit

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
side here which is a little bit

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.930 
side here which is a little bit
difficult<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:44.110> push<00:02:44.320> down<00:02:44.550> but<00:02:45.550> if<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.760> push

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
difficult to push down but if you push

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.940 
difficult to push down but if you push
really<00:02:46.240> hard<00:02:46.390> you<00:02:46.990> can<00:02:47.110> get<00:02:47.230> it<00:02:47.320> to<00:02:47.410> fire<00:02:47.650> like

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
really hard you can get it to fire like

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.130 
really hard you can get it to fire like
that<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.400> I've<00:02:49.090> completely<00:02:49.510> lost<00:02:49.630> that<00:02:50.020> now

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
that and I've completely lost that now

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.750 
that and I've completely lost that now
so<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.290> have<00:02:50.350> no<00:02:50.620> idea<00:02:50.770> where<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.070> went<00:02:51.220> but

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
so I have no idea where that went but

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.480 
so I have no idea where that went but
anyway<00:02:52.270> this<00:02:53.020> is<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.320> supervillain<00:02:54.220> jet

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
anyway this is the supervillain jet

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.550 
anyway this is the supervillain jet
which<00:02:55.030> is<00:02:55.680> pretty<00:02:56.680> cool<00:02:57.010> actually<00:02:57.430> um<00:02:58.260> but<00:02:59.260> I

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
which is pretty cool actually um but I

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.140 
which is pretty cool actually um but I

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
thought it was going to be a little bit

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.940 
thought it was going to be a little bit
