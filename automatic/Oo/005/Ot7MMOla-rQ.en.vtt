good morning everybody today this video

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.590 
good morning everybody today this video
is<00:00:04.920> gonna<00:00:05.040> be<00:00:05.130> on<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.520> upper<00:00:05.819> register<00:00:06.270> on<00:00:06.509> the

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
is gonna be on the upper register on the

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.220 
is gonna be on the upper register on the
clarinet

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
clarinet

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.390 
clarinet
now<00:00:08.160> we've<00:00:08.460> worked<00:00:08.790> on<00:00:09.000> the<00:00:09.120> lower<00:00:09.300> register<00:00:09.510> C

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
now we've worked on the lower register C

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.870 
now we've worked on the lower register C
B<00:00:11.400> natural<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:12.769> GFE<00:00:13.769> all<00:00:14.070> those<00:00:14.400> fun<00:00:14.700> notes

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
B natural a GFE all those fun notes

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.980 
B natural a GFE all those fun notes
cdefg<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:16.460> now<00:00:17.460> we're<00:00:17.820> kind<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.390> reaching

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
cdefg a now we're kind of reaching

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.689 
cdefg a now we're kind of reaching
towards<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.380> upper<00:00:19.800> register<00:00:19.949> where<00:00:20.490> the

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
towards the upper register where the

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.900 
towards the upper register where the
register<00:00:21.240> key<00:00:21.270> comes<00:00:21.630> into<00:00:21.840> play<00:00:22.640> now<00:00:23.640> what's

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
register key comes into play now what's

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.700 
register key comes into play now what's
so<00:00:24.150> different<00:00:24.359> about<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.810> for<00:00:25.650> this

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
so different about this for this

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.050 
so different about this for this
register<00:00:26.130> compared<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.699> lower<00:00:26.849> register

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
register compared to the lower register

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.230 
register compared to the lower register
is<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:28.010> the<00:00:29.010> airspeed<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:29.910> going<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.119> be

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
is that the airspeed is going to be

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.319 
is that the airspeed is going to be
faster<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.109> like<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.099> did<00:00:32.250> earlier<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:33.149> lower

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
faster so like we did earlier the lower

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.709 
faster so like we did earlier the lower
register<00:00:33.600> we're<00:00:34.170> going<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.350> be<00:00:35.630> you<00:00:36.630> know

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
register we're going to be you know

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.119 
register we're going to be you know
remember<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.079> blowing<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.620> tunnel<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
remember the blowing the tunnel of the

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.420 
remember the blowing the tunnel of the
air<00:00:38.450> now<00:00:39.450> when<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.469> get<00:00:40.620> higher<00:00:40.980> on<00:00:41.010> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
air now when you get higher on the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.430 
air now when you get higher on the
clarinet<00:00:41.730> when<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.149> pitch<00:00:42.420> gets<00:00:42.660> higher<00:00:42.809> than

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
clarinet when the pitch gets higher than

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.770 
clarinet when the pitch gets higher than
the<00:00:43.559> upper<00:00:43.829> register<00:00:44.010> yeah<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.270> needs<00:00:45.420> more

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
the upper register yeah it needs more

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.680 
the upper register yeah it needs more
air<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.920> reed<00:00:47.100> vibrate<00:00:47.640> more<00:00:47.879> now

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
air to have the reed vibrate more now

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.560 
air to have the reed vibrate more now
the<00:00:48.750> reed<00:00:48.989> vibrates<00:00:49.020> more<00:00:49.649> because<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:51.239> pitch

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
the reed vibrates more because the pitch

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.410 
the reed vibrates more because the pitch
is<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.079> higher<00:00:52.350> register<00:00:52.949> notes<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:54.390> a

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
is the higher register notes have a

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.470 
is the higher register notes have a
higher<00:00:54.840> frequency<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.949> frequency<00:00:56.520> means<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
higher frequency and frequency means the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.330 
higher frequency and frequency means the
amount<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.870> vibrations<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> reed<00:00:59.129> does

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
amount of vibrations that the reed does

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.709 
amount of vibrations that the reed does
in<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.520> amount<00:00:59.699> of<00:00:59.730> vibrations<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> sound

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
in the amount of vibrations the sound

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.009 
in the amount of vibrations the sound
makes<00:01:01.199> per<00:01:01.949> second<00:01:02.489> when<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.239> ear<00:01:03.449> hears<00:01:03.809> it

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
makes per second when the ear hears it

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.310 
makes per second when the ear hears it
in<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.439> ear<00:01:04.619> drum<00:01:05.420> now<00:01:06.420> that's<00:01:06.689> why<00:01:06.960> it<00:01:07.020> needs

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
in the ear drum now that's why it needs

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.969 
in the ear drum now that's why it needs
to<00:01:07.500> create<00:01:07.680> more<00:01:08.070> air<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:09.000> that's<00:01:09.210> why<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:10.020> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
to create more air so that's why on the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.830 
to create more air so that's why on the
clarinet<00:01:11.280> we<00:01:11.610> need<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.970> put<00:01:12.299> more<00:01:12.570> air<00:01:12.810> through

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
clarinet we need to put more air through

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.450 
clarinet we need to put more air through
our<00:01:13.229> mouthpiece<00:01:13.470> without<00:01:13.920> changing<00:01:14.369> our

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
our mouthpiece without changing our

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.760 
our mouthpiece without changing our
embouchure<00:01:14.820> to<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.810> those<00:01:16.049> high<00:01:16.259> notes<00:01:16.320> come

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
embouchure to have those high notes come

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.160 
embouchure to have those high notes come
out<00:01:16.890> now<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.880> really<00:01:18.240> great<00:01:18.540> way<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.750> work<00:01:18.960> on

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
out now a really great way to work on

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.830 
out now a really great way to work on
these<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:20.009> do<00:01:20.159> long<00:01:20.400> tones<00:01:20.700> now<00:01:21.360> long<00:01:21.570> tones

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
these is to do long tones now long tones

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.710 
these is to do long tones now long tones
is<00:01:22.020> where<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.290> take<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.560> lower<00:01:22.920> note<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:23.670> eat

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.510

and you're going to hold on you're just
gonna<00:01:28.700> slide<00:01:29.360> your<00:01:29.630> pinkie<00:01:29.899> on<00:01:30.110> the<00:01:30.320> register

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
gonna slide your pinkie on the register

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:32.170 
gonna slide your pinkie on the register
key<00:01:30.829> so<00:01:31.070> what<00:01:31.189> you<00:01:31.310> press<00:01:31.579> on<00:01:31.759> the<00:01:31.850> register

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
key so what you press on the register

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.179 
key so what you press on the register
key<00:01:32.210> and<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.899> note<00:01:33.079> comes<00:01:33.320> out<00:01:33.500> so<00:01:34.009> it'll

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
key and the note comes out so it'll

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:43.520 
key and the note comes out so it'll
sound<00:01:34.399> like<00:01:34.549> this

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.900 

this<00:01:44.530> creates<00:01:44.980> you<00:01:45.130> to<00:01:45.250> create<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.700> lower

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
this creates you to create the lower

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.240 
this creates you to create the lower
register<00:01:46.180> and<00:01:46.690> then<00:01:47.410> to<00:01:47.620> try<00:01:47.830> to<00:01:47.890> get<00:01:48.130> the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
register and then to try to get the

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.650 
register and then to try to get the
upper<00:01:48.460> register<00:01:48.730> out<00:01:48.880> by<00:01:49.030> pushing<00:01:49.300> the<00:01:49.510> air

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
upper register out by pushing the air

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.660 
upper register out by pushing the air
through<00:01:49.960> while<00:01:50.560> keeping<00:01:50.980> your<00:01:51.160> air<00:01:51.340> steady

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
through while keeping your air steady

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.410 
through while keeping your air steady
flow<00:01:52.110> your<00:01:53.110> air<00:01:53.440> flow<00:01:53.770> steady<00:01:54.130> excuse<00:01:54.640> me<00:01:54.790> you

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
flow your air flow steady excuse me you

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.990 
flow your air flow steady excuse me you
want<00:01:55.660> to<00:01:55.840> make<00:01:55.990> sure<00:01:56.020> your<00:01:56.410> air<00:01:56.740> flow<00:01:57.220> is<00:01:57.550> as

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
want to make sure your air flow is as

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.240 
want to make sure your air flow is as
steady<00:01:58.300> as<00:01:58.540> possible<00:01:59.260> so<00:01:59.770> the<00:01:59.890> note<00:02:00.070> either

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
steady as possible so the note either

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.560 
steady as possible so the note either
comes<00:02:00.760> out<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.860> creates<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:04.060> right<00:02:04.210> tone

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
comes out and and creates the right tone

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.870 
comes out and and creates the right tone
now<00:02:05.229> if<00:02:05.380> you<00:02:05.500> stop<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:06.070> air<00:02:06.280> you'll<00:02:06.550> have<00:02:06.729> to

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
now if you stop the air you'll have to

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.490 
now if you stop the air you'll have to
set<00:02:07.119> your<00:02:07.240> own<00:02:07.300> assure<00:02:07.660> all<00:02:07.840> over<00:02:08.110> again

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
set your own assure all over again

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.680 
set your own assure all over again
breathe<00:02:08.830> in<00:02:09.100> and<00:02:09.340> blow<00:02:10.060> through<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.450> horn

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
breathe in and blow through the horn

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.840 
breathe in and blow through the horn
again<00:02:10.959> so<00:02:11.410> you<00:02:11.470> ain't<00:02:11.740> doing<00:02:12.040> this<00:02:12.190> long<00:02:12.490> tone

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
again so you ain't doing this long tone

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.970 
again so you ain't doing this long tone
exercise<00:02:13.660> is<00:02:13.930> very<00:02:14.260> helpful<00:02:14.620> because<00:02:14.709> it

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
exercise is very helpful because it

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.130 
exercise is very helpful because it
helps<00:02:15.250> keep<00:02:15.310> your<00:02:15.640> air<00:02:15.790> going<00:02:16.180> now<00:02:16.930> you're

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
helps keep your air going now you're

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.979 
helps keep your air going now you're
going<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.320> do<00:02:17.470> that<00:02:17.620> chromatically<00:02:18.370> going<00:02:18.760> up

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
going to do that chromatically going up

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.710 
going to do that chromatically going up
so<00:02:19.989> you're<00:02:20.080> going<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.230> do<00:02:20.350> e<00:02:20.680> then<00:02:21.400> F<00:02:21.730> then<00:02:22.390> F

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
so you're going to do e then F then F

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.740 
so you're going to do e then F then F
sharp<00:02:22.780> G<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:24.040> so<00:02:24.730> on<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.150> you'll<00:02:25.300> just<00:02:25.510> press

the upper register make sure you do this

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.760 
the upper register make sure you do this
long<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:54.000> an<00:03:54.090> exercise<00:03:54.480> it's<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.260> it's<00:03:55.560> the

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
long to an exercise it's the it's the

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.710 
long to an exercise it's the it's the
simplest<00:03:56.190> way<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:56.460> get<00:03:56.730> it<00:03:56.880> to<00:03:57.450> get<00:03:57.570> the

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
simplest way to get it to get the

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.870 
simplest way to get it to get the
process<00:03:58.200> going<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:59.040> then<00:03:59.280> once<00:03:59.460> you<00:03:59.610> do<00:03:59.760> the

process going and then once you do the

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.630 
process going and then once you do the
long<00:04:00.030> tone<00:04:00.240> exercise<00:04:00.840> try<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.680> do<00:04:01.920> some<00:04:02.190> skips

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
long tone exercise try to do some skips

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.000 
long tone exercise try to do some skips
to<00:04:02.940> try<00:04:03.210> to<00:04:03.270> go<00:04:03.450> from<00:04:03.690> one<00:04:03.930> note<00:04:04.170> to<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.980> next

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
to try to go from one note to the next

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.680 
to try to go from one note to the next
to<00:04:05.580> the<00:04:05.670> note<00:04:05.820> to<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.120> next<00:04:06.150> so<00:04:06.390> it'll<00:04:06.570> sound

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
to the note to the next so it'll sound

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:13.870 
to the note to the next so it'll sound
like<00:04:06.780> this

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.590 

so<00:04:14.880> take<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.420> long<00:04:15.630> tone<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:17.450> sticker<00:04:18.450> and

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
so take the long tone and sticker and

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.810 
so take the long tone and sticker and
tongue<00:04:19.140> on<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.680> second<00:04:20.040> note<00:04:20.190> instead<00:04:20.670> of

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
tongue on the second note instead of

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.130 
tongue on the second note instead of
blowing<00:04:21.210> your<00:04:21.360> air<00:04:21.600> through<00:04:21.840> and<00:04:21.989> just
