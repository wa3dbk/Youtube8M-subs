kind<00:00:51.760> of<00:00:51.909> what<00:00:52.030> motivates<00:00:52.510> them<00:00:52.719> what<00:00:52.780> drives

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
kind of what motivates them what drives

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:55.500 
kind of what motivates them what drives
them<00:00:53.530> well<00:00:53.949> I<00:00:54.039> think<00:00:54.129> they<00:00:54.399> had<00:00:54.579> more<00:00:54.789> soul<00:00:55.299> of

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
them well I think they had more soul of

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.959 
them well I think they had more soul of
the<00:00:55.719> player<00:00:56.019> the<00:00:56.409> exact<00:00:57.190> position<00:00:57.370> in<00:00:57.760> mind

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
the player the exact position in mind

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:59.789 
the player the exact position in mind
when<00:00:58.479> they<00:00:58.510> designed<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:59.019> dog<00:00:59.229> the<00:00:59.409> jerseys

00:00:59.789 --> 00:00:59.799 
when they designed the dog the jerseys

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:04.260 
when they designed the dog the jerseys
in<00:00:59.949> the<00:00:59.979> actual<00:01:00.879> pant<00:01:01.289> meaning<00:01:03.150> emoted<00:01:04.150> to

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:04.270 
in the actual pant meaning emoted to

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.890 
in the actual pant meaning emoted to
whatever<00:01:04.740> shapes<00:01:05.740> in'<00:01:06.010> and<00:01:06.220> whatever<00:01:07.210> be<00:01:07.870> a

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
whatever shapes in' and whatever be a

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.390 
whatever shapes in' and whatever be a
body<00:01:08.140> beans<00:01:08.440> and<00:01:08.710> things<00:01:08.830> like<00:01:09.010> that<00:01:09.130> nature

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
body beans and things like that nature

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.850 
body beans and things like that nature
so<00:01:09.610> they<00:01:10.170> pretty<00:01:11.170> much<00:01:11.320> left<00:01:11.620> no<00:01:11.800> stone

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
so they pretty much left no stone

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.730 
so they pretty much left no stone
unturned<00:01:12.450> all<00:01:13.450> of<00:01:13.810> this<00:01:13.930> provides<00:01:14.200> an

unturned all of this provides an

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
information that we can then use to turn

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:28.929 
information that we can then use to turn
into<00:01:21.720> incredibly<00:01:22.720> innovative<00:01:23.440> design

I'm a designer I work with a company

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.100 
I'm a designer I work with a company
called<00:02:28.010> Nike<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.940> response<00:02:29.390> of<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:29.690> person

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
called Nike the response of the person

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.259 
called Nike the response of the person
was<00:02:30.260> what<00:02:30.620> more<00:02:30.860> can<00:02:31.069> you<00:02:31.220> do<00:02:31.430> with<00:02:31.940> shoes<00:02:32.239> that

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
was what more can you do with shoes that

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:33.849 
was what more can you do with shoes that
hasn't<00:02:32.870> already<00:02:33.049> been<00:02:33.200> done

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 
hasn't already been done

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.580 
hasn't already been done
and<00:02:34.329> I<00:02:35.329> think<00:02:35.600> about<00:02:35.840> that<00:02:35.989> and<00:02:36.260> I<00:02:36.319> kind<00:02:36.560> of

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
and I think about that and I kind of

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.770 
and I think about that and I kind of
laugh<00:02:36.829> a<00:02:37.040> bit<00:02:37.069> because<00:02:37.430> today<00:02:38.180> I<00:02:38.209> see<00:02:38.569> more

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
laugh a bit because today I see more

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.780 
laugh a bit because today I see more
opportunity<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.680> innovate<00:02:39.829> than<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:40.459> ever<00:02:40.549> have

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
opportunity to innovate than I ever have

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.819 
opportunity to innovate than I ever have
before<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.390> shoes<00:02:41.600> I'm<00:02:41.810> wearing<00:02:41.840> are<00:02:42.290> knit

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
before the shoes I'm wearing are knit

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.960 
before the shoes I'm wearing are knit
they're<00:02:43.010> called<00:02:43.190> fly<00:02:43.459> net<00:02:43.670> shoes<00:02:44.269> it's<00:02:44.750> an<00:02:44.870> old

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
they're called fly net shoes it's an old

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.699 
they're called fly net shoes it's an old
craft<00:02:46.970> knitting<00:02:47.900> but<00:02:48.350> we've<00:02:48.530> actually

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
craft knitting but we've actually

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.979 
craft knitting but we've actually
modernized<00:02:49.639> it<00:02:49.910> and<00:02:50.120> brought<00:02:50.630> some<00:02:50.870> new

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
modernized it and brought some new

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.900 
modernized it and brought some new
technology<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.859> it<00:02:52.010> so<00:02:52.430> now<00:02:52.459> we<00:02:52.639> can

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
technology to it so now we can

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.180 
technology to it so now we can
completely<00:02:53.420> change<00:02:53.930> how<00:02:54.260> shoes<00:02:54.560> are<00:02:54.739> made<00:02:54.920> and

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
completely change how shoes are made and

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.580 
completely change how shoes are made and
actually<00:02:55.970> raise<00:02:56.389> the<00:02:56.420> level<00:02:56.870> of<00:02:56.900> performance

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
actually raise the level of performance

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.220 
actually raise the level of performance
significantly<00:02:58.459> at<00:02:58.609> the<00:02:58.700> same<00:02:58.910> time<00:02:59.180> so<00:03:00.019> it's<00:03:00.170> a

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
significantly at the same time so it's a

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.110 
significantly at the same time so it's a
revolution<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:01.040> think<00:03:01.280> not<00:03:01.459> only<00:03:01.489> in<00:03:01.819> terms<00:03:02.000> of

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
revolution I think not only in terms of

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.970 
revolution I think not only in terms of
manufacturing<00:03:02.530> but<00:03:03.530> in<00:03:03.680> terms<00:03:03.859> of

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
manufacturing but in terms of

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.520 
manufacturing but in terms of
performance<00:03:04.489> design<00:03:04.850> there's<00:03:05.389> virtually<00:03:06.019> no

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
performance design there's virtually no

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.670 
performance design there's virtually no
waste<00:03:06.859> in<00:03:07.160> the<00:03:07.579> upper<00:03:07.940> material

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
waste in the upper material

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.440
