00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.830
 in this video tutorial we will see how easy and fast it is that armani 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.269
 using ps3 flash 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.269
 for example the pot of a ball 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:16.839
 before we start we will draw a simpler ball 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:20.089
 we click with the left button on the rent rectangle and what 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.089
 keep pressed to see the menu 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:28.569
 we click on armenta ovalo 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:33.649
 and now we draw the ball 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.110
 Now that we have a frame with the ball drawn, let's copy it and 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.360
 add it in order to have three identical frames that we will eject 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.360
 to create our first nor nation 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.340
 we click or right click on frame 1 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 and we select copy frames 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.040
 now we select empty recessed for now what do we click with the 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.040
 right button 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.940
 we chose the option vega frames 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:15.370
 we repeat the steps for the third frame 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.920
 since it simulates we see the ball pot the first and last frame 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.240
 represent the ball in its highest position while the second 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.440
 frame represented the ball when touching the ground 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.440
 we select a second frame 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.030
 and using the selection tool we move the ball down 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.410
 now we extend the time the ball is in its respective positions 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.920
 during the course 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.100
 and we are left with a few clicks the animation that will make the Swedish ball 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.810
 he pretends to be voting 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.360
 the process and its meaning are explained in detail during the course 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:24.149
 we have already created the image that we look for the base ball and its life as if 

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:25.959
 I was voting easy truth
