we<00:00:09.690> have<00:00:09.900> this<00:00:10.080> crazy<00:00:10.559> paradox<00:00:11.430> where<00:00:11.760> we

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
we have this crazy paradox where we

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.919 
we have this crazy paradox where we
trust<00:00:12.389> you<00:00:12.690> but<00:00:13.620> we<00:00:13.830> don't<00:00:14.389> understand<00:00:15.389> what

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
trust you but we don't understand what

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
you do now I think that's a problem for

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.939 
you do now I think that's a problem for
school<00:00:20.340> nurses<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.109> students<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.350> their

school nurses and students and their
families<00:00:23.430> I<00:00:23.640> think<00:00:23.910> it's<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.240> problem<00:00:25.199> for

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
families I think it's a problem for

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.290 
families I think it's a problem for
hospital<00:00:26.220> nurses<00:00:26.580> it's<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.820> problem<00:00:27.269> for

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
hospital nurses it's a problem for

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.810 
hospital nurses it's a problem for

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
nurses everywhere they are because this

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.970 
nurses everywhere they are because this
social<00:00:32.820> paradox<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.600> paradox<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.260> trust<00:00:34.680> and

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
social paradox is paradox of trust and

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.940 
social paradox is paradox of trust and
lack<00:00:35.220> of<00:00:35.400> understanding<00:00:36.200> means<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.620> we

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
lack of understanding means that we

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.270 
lack of understanding means that we

is very different and the reason why I

very particular sentimentalized
emotionalized<00:01:26.400> way<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.530> not<00:01:28.530> only<00:01:28.950> because

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
emotionalized way is not only because
