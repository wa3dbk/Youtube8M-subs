that<00:02:32.010> well<00:02:32.190> if<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.430> wasn't<00:02:32.550> for<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.790> co2<00:02:32.970> fire

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
that well if it wasn't for the co2 fire

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.490 
that well if it wasn't for the co2 fire
clean<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.630> had<00:02:33.720> been<00:02:33.840> on<00:02:33.960> their<00:02:34.140> prior<00:02:34.380> to

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
clean that had been on their prior to

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.620 
clean that had been on their prior to
the<00:02:34.590> fire<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:35.430> was<00:02:35.550> my<00:02:35.700> carry<00:02:35.940> gun<00:02:36.210> now<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.480> do

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
the fire that was my carry gun now I do

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.060 
the fire that was my carry gun now I do
have<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.840> go<00:02:36.990> home<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.230> clean<00:02:37.500> it<00:02:37.620> up<00:02:37.770> in<00:02:37.920> the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
have to go home and clean it up in the

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.420 
have to go home and clean it up in the
refi<00:02:38.820> are<00:02:38.940> clean<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.150> reapply<00:02:39.600> but<00:02:40.470> uh<00:02:40.500> yeah

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
refi are clean and reapply but uh yeah

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.060 
refi are clean and reapply but uh yeah
so<00:02:41.610> that's<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.820> testament<00:02:42.240> to<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:43.380> block<00:02:43.620> and

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
so that's a testament to the block and

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.640 
so that's a testament to the block and
fire<00:02:44.670> clean<00:02:44.910> fire<00:02:45.210> clean<00:02:45.360> helps<00:02:45.720> break

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
fire clean fire clean helps break

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.380 
fire clean fire clean helps break
through<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.340> guess<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.700> could<00:02:47.820> say<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.030> lot<00:02:48.150> of

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
through I guess you could say a lot of

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.890 
through I guess you could say a lot of
that<00:02:48.510> crud<00:02:48.890> cool
