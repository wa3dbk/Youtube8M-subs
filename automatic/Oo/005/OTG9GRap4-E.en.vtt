00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
replace the coolant temperature sensor

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.110 
replace the coolant temperature sensor
Oh<00:00:04.740> ring<00:00:05.040> for<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:05.879> 2003<00:00:06.779> BMW<00:00:07.940> 330i

which is located down there remove this
plastic<00:00:13.980> from<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.910> air<00:00:15.540> filter<00:00:15.839> so<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.859> we

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
plastic from the air filter so that we

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.510 
plastic from the air filter so that we
can<00:00:17.220> have<00:00:17.430> more<00:00:17.730> space<00:00:18.619> there's<00:00:19.619> two<00:00:19.890> plastic

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
can have more space there's two plastic

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.950 
can have more space there's two plastic
screws<00:00:21.000> from<00:00:21.270> here<00:00:21.720> on<00:00:21.930> here<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.949> one<00:00:23.070> here<00:00:23.960> we

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
screws from here on here and one here we

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.040 
screws from here on here and one here we
use<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.260> screwdriver<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.859> pop<00:00:26.130> them<00:00:26.279> out

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.900 

there<00:00:31.050> we<00:00:31.140> go

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:31.910 
there we go

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.959 
there we go
then<00:00:32.910> just<00:00:33.600> remove<00:00:33.809> it<00:00:34.910> this<00:00:35.910> way<00:00:36.149> like<00:00:36.510> this

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
then just remove it this way like this

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.170 
then just remove it this way like this
so<00:00:38.969> here's<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.600> above<00:00:40.140> screw<00:00:40.820> once<00:00:41.820> we<00:00:42.000> use

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
so here's the above screw once we use

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.029 
so here's the above screw once we use
the<00:00:42.300> screwdriver<00:00:43.250> just<00:00:44.250> pull<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.700> out<00:00:46.039> so

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the screwdriver just pull it out so

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.779 
the screwdriver just pull it out so
here's<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.610> screw<00:00:47.960> which<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.399> t25<00:00:50.399> or<00:00:50.899> Torx<00:00:51.899> 25

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
here's the screw which is t25 or Torx 25

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:54.860 
here's the screw which is t25 or Torx 25
we're<00:00:53.789> going<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.090> remove<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.510> electric

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
we're going to remove the electric

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.970 
we're going to remove the electric
connections<00:00:56.660> the<00:00:57.660> tricky<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.379> this<00:00:58.620> one

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
connections the tricky one is this one

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.340 
connections the tricky one is this one
so<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.579> push<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.030> back<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:00.539> way<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.050> then

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
so you push it back this way and then

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.969 
so you push it back this way and then
and<00:01:01.590> then<00:01:02.100> back<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.940> way<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.780> this<00:01:04.409> way<00:01:05.570> and

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
and then back that way so this way and

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.820 
and then back that way so this way and
look<00:01:07.979> at<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:09.090> one<00:01:09.330> is<00:01:09.420> simple<00:01:09.780> just<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.590> couple

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
look at this one is simple just a couple

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.520 
look at this one is simple just a couple
of<00:01:10.950> clips<00:01:11.400> right<00:01:11.640> here<00:01:11.990> and<00:01:12.990> pull<00:01:13.229> out<00:01:13.350> like

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
of clips right here and pull out like

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.210 
of clips right here and pull out like
that<00:01:14.299> nonno<00:01:15.299> very<00:01:15.570> simple<00:01:15.960> just<00:01:16.409> do<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.100> out

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
that nonno very simple just do it out

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.000 
that nonno very simple just do it out
like<00:01:17.640> that

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.230 

so<00:01:21.730> this<00:01:22.420> is<00:01:23.220> where<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:24.430> leakiness<00:01:24.790> coming

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
so this is where the leakiness coming

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.770 
so this is where the leakiness coming
from<00:01:25.480> and<00:01:25.840> so<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:27.460> just<00:01:27.700> need<00:01:27.910> to<00:01:27.970> remove<00:01:28.480> that

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
from and so we just need to remove that

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.160 
from and so we just need to remove that
clip<00:01:30.000> from<00:01:31.000> the<00:01:31.560> coolant<00:01:32.560> temperature<00:01:32.980> sensor

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
clip from the coolant temperature sensor

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.280 
clip from the coolant temperature sensor
so<00:01:35.170> in<00:01:35.590> this<00:01:35.770> case<00:01:36.100> I<00:01:36.370> use<00:01:36.820> these<00:01:37.630> long<00:01:37.930> pliers

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
so in this case I use these long pliers

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.630 
so in this case I use these long pliers
to<00:01:39.130> pull<00:01:39.340> out<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:39.610> clip<00:01:40.920> blow<00:01:41.920> the<00:01:41.980> switch

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
to pull out the clip blow the switch

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.530 
to pull out the clip blow the switch
simple<00:01:43.120> as<00:01:43.210> that<00:01:44.190> here's<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:45.520> or<00:01:45.940> ring<00:01:46.180> that<00:01:46.510> I

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
simple as that here's the or ring that I

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.780 
simple as that here's the or ring that I
want<00:01:46.780> to<00:01:46.870> replace<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.810> two<00:01:50.230> clips<00:01:50.790> you're

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
want to replace the two clips you're

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.460 
want to replace the two clips you're
going<00:01:51.910> to<00:01:51.970> push<00:01:52.120> at<00:01:52.300> the<00:01:52.330> same<00:01:52.420> time<00:01:52.810> and<00:01:53.110> pull

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
going to push at the same time and pull

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.500 
going to push at the same time and pull
it<00:01:53.620> out<00:01:56.190> here's<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.460> echoing<00:01:57.790> temperature

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
it out here's the echoing temperature

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.570 
it out here's the echoing temperature
sensor<00:01:58.900> and<00:02:00.240> here's<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.540> all<00:02:02.380> or<00:02:03.040> ring<00:02:03.280> that

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
sensor and here's the all or ring that

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.830 
sensor and here's the all or ring that
we're<00:02:03.730> going<00:02:03.940> to<00:02:04.060> replace<00:02:04.300> now<00:02:05.430> here's<00:02:06.430> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
we're going to replace now here's the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:15.030 
we're going to replace now here's the
sensor<00:02:07.840> with<00:02:08.200> a<00:02:08.230> new<00:02:08.649> o-ring<00:02:13.500> push<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.710> all<00:02:14.980> the

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
sensor with a new o-ring push it all the

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.430 
sensor with a new o-ring push it all the
way<00:02:15.220> until<00:02:15.550> you<00:02:15.700> hear<00:02:15.910> click<00:02:16.300> and<00:02:16.600> just

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
way until you hear click and just

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.260 
way until you hear click and just
assemble<00:02:17.920> everything<00:02:18.430> back<00:02:18.700> in<00:02:18.970> reverse

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
assemble everything back in reverse

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.540 
assemble everything back in reverse
order
