protein and potatoes I was born in 1969
and<00:00:04.529> I<00:00:04.830> have<00:00:05.370> been<00:00:05.490> working<00:00:05.670> in<00:00:05.879> architecture

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
and I have been working in architecture

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.720 
and I have been working in architecture
since<00:00:06.600> 1994<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:08.220> one<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.639> interesting

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
since 1994 and one of the interesting

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.490 
since 1994 and one of the interesting
things<00:00:09.240> about<00:00:09.360> my<00:00:09.660> background<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:10.139> that<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.380> was

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
things about my background is that I was

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.959 
things about my background is that I was
doing<00:00:10.740> music<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.160> architecture<00:00:11.280> at<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.759> same

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
doing music and architecture at the same

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.340 
doing music and architecture at the same
time<00:00:12.240> so<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:13.530> eventually<00:00:14.360> could<00:00:15.360> have<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.509> little

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
time so I eventually could have a little

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.890 
time so I eventually could have a little
mix<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.710> both<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.190> enriched<00:00:17.880> or<00:00:18.180> enhanced<00:00:18.720> my

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
mix of both that enriched or enhanced my

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.340 
mix of both that enriched or enhanced my
architectural<00:00:19.529> experience<00:00:19.830> so<00:00:21.320> 2001<00:00:22.320> I

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
architectural experience so 2001 I

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.970

out the door and you're in the street

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.050 
out the door and you're in the street
and<00:01:42.000> how<00:01:42.380> public<00:01:43.380> transport<00:01:43.950> works<00:01:44.189> in<00:01:44.430> in<00:01:44.670> how

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
and how public transport works in in how

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.910 
and how public transport works in in how
parts<00:01:45.420> are<00:01:45.570> lived<00:01:45.810> or<00:01:46.140> how<00:01:46.380> buildings<00:01:46.619> are

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
parts are lived or how buildings are

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.660 
parts are lived or how buildings are
designed<00:01:47.520> then<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.659> think

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
designed then I think

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.310 
designed then I think
you're<00:01:50.120> not<00:01:50.240> taking<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:50.600> full<00:01:50.780> advantage<00:01:50.900> or

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
you're not taking the full advantage or

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.050 
you're not taking the full advantage or
addressing<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:51.800> full<00:01:52.430> concept<00:01:52.820> of

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
addressing the full concept of

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.930 
addressing the full concept of
architecture<00:01:53.690> the<00:01:54.230> architect<00:01:54.830> starts<00:01:55.370> in<00:01:55.640> the

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
architecture the architect starts in the

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.460 
architecture the architect starts in the
way<00:01:56.090> you<00:01:56.150> see<00:01:56.450> life<00:01:56.660> in<00:01:56.960> the<00:01:57.050> way<00:01:57.170> you<00:01:57.230> see

way you see life in the way you see

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.860 
way you see life in the way you see
around<00:01:58.070> you<00:01:58.250> so<00:01:58.760> I<00:01:59.000> would<00:01:59.510> definitely

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
around you so I would definitely

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.600 
around you so I would definitely
recommend<00:02:00.020> that<00:02:00.410> that<00:02:00.620> you<00:02:00.740> take<00:02:00.950> it<00:02:01.070> on<00:02:01.190> as<00:02:01.310> a

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
recommend that that you take it on as a

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.430 
recommend that that you take it on as a
way<00:02:01.790> of<00:02:01.820> life<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.570> try<00:02:02.870> to<00:02:02.930> be<00:02:03.080> concerned

especially because because of the real
estate<00:02:30.530> boom<00:02:30.739> right<00:02:30.950> now<00:02:31.160> there's<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:32.360> much

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
estate boom right now there's so much

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.960 
estate boom right now there's so much
opportunity<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:33.290> do<00:02:33.410> architecture<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.370> and

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
opportunity to do architecture and and

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.350 
opportunity to do architecture and and
I'm<00:02:35.450> very<00:02:36.220> happy<00:02:37.220> about<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:38.150> use<00:02:38.330> of

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
I'm very happy about the use of

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.660 
I'm very happy about the use of
technology<00:02:38.540> with<00:02:39.530> with<00:02:39.860> everything<00:02:40.280> with<00:02:40.640> a

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
technology with with everything with a

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.430 
technology with with everything with a
lot<00:02:40.850> of<00:02:40.910> people<00:02:41.120> investing<00:02:41.540> in<00:02:41.630> real<00:02:41.930> estate<00:02:41.959> I

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
lot of people investing in real estate I

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.210 
lot of people investing in real estate I
think<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:42.830> opportunity<00:02:43.400> now<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:43.900> design<00:02:45.220> more

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
think the opportunity now to design more

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.940 
think the opportunity now to design more
extreme<00:02:46.930> buildings<00:02:47.930> or<00:02:48.110> design<00:02:48.410> more<00:02:48.590> extreme

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
extreme buildings or design more extreme

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.520 
extreme buildings or design more extreme
geometries<00:02:49.489> is<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:50.180> time<00:02:50.420> because<00:02:51.170> we<00:02:51.380> have

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
geometries is the time because we have

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.500 
geometries is the time because we have
the<00:02:51.650> technology<00:02:51.770> we're<00:02:52.370> designing<00:02:52.670> in<00:02:52.880> 3d<00:02:53.269> and

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
the technology we're designing in 3d and

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.670 
the technology we're designing in 3d and
then<00:02:53.630> from<00:02:53.810> our<00:02:53.870> computers<00:02:54.230> we<00:02:54.260> can<00:02:54.380> pass

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
then from our computers we can pass

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.920 
then from our computers we can pass
along<00:02:55.010> this<00:02:55.610> really<00:02:56.030> designs<00:02:56.390> of<00:02:56.540> companies

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
along this really designs of companies

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.310 
along this really designs of companies
that<00:02:57.049> eventually<00:02:57.320> will<00:02:57.680> build<00:02:58.310> or<00:02:59.320> fabricate

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
that eventually will build or fabricate

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.050 
that eventually will build or fabricate
in<00:03:00.560> their<00:03:00.709> shops<00:03:00.980> all<00:03:01.310> these<00:03:01.640> elements<00:03:02.000> or

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
in their shops all these elements or

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.630 
in their shops all these elements or
special<00:03:02.390> elements<00:03:02.780> that<00:03:03.140> that<00:03:03.350> will<00:03:03.640> complete

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
special elements that that will complete

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.140 
special elements that that will complete
the<00:03:04.760> building<00:03:05.060> once<00:03:05.269> it's<00:03:06.310> it's<00:03:07.310> done<00:03:07.610> before

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
the building once it's it's done before

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.180 
the building once it's it's done before
we<00:03:08.480> can<00:03:08.660> do<00:03:08.870> that<00:03:09.049> everything<00:03:09.440> had<00:03:09.709> to<00:03:09.739> be<00:03:09.890> done

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
we can do that everything had to be done

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.880 
we can do that everything had to be done
in<00:03:10.580> 2d<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:11.630> then<00:03:11.810> cut<00:03:12.019> in<00:03:12.140> shaft<00:03:12.410> so<00:03:12.739> I<00:03:12.769> think

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
in 2d and then cut in shaft so I think

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.340 
in 2d and then cut in shaft so I think
wherever<00:03:13.160> were<00:03:13.549> entering<00:03:14.299> a<00:03:14.510> stage<00:03:14.810> or<00:03:14.989> a<00:03:15.049> face

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
wherever were entering a stage or a face

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:17.620 
wherever were entering a stage or a face
in<00:03:15.560> architecture<00:03:16.280> which<00:03:16.400> is<00:03:16.549> which<00:03:17.120> has<00:03:17.330> to<00:03:17.480> do

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
in architecture which is which has to do

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.050 
in architecture which is which has to do
with<00:03:17.660> with<00:03:18.320> this<00:03:18.799> thinking<00:03:19.730> on<00:03:19.880> this

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
with with this thinking on this

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.850 
with with this thinking on this
technology<00:03:20.709> experimenting<00:03:21.709> with<00:03:21.829> new

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
technology experimenting with new

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.500 
technology experimenting with new
materials<00:03:22.519> because<00:03:22.760> I<00:03:22.850> think<00:03:23.060> there<00:03:23.209> has

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
materials because I think there has

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.990 
materials because I think there has
never<00:03:23.690> been<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:24.829> many<00:03:25.040> materials<00:03:25.370> around<00:03:25.880> to

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
never been so many materials around to

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.479 
never been so many materials around to
experiment<00:03:26.480> with<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:26.840> people<00:03:27.489> constantly

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
experiment with and people constantly

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.569 
experiment with and people constantly
trying<00:03:29.150> to<00:03:29.410> get<00:03:30.410> new<00:03:30.590> materials<00:03:31.040> so<00:03:31.430> I<00:03:31.459> think

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
trying to get new materials so I think

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:32.860 
trying to get new materials so I think
we<00:03:31.730> can<00:03:31.790> start<00:03:32.030> seeing<00:03:32.299> structures<00:03:32.720> that<00:03:32.810> are

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
we can start seeing structures that are

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.720 
we can start seeing structures that are
made<00:03:33.079> of<00:03:33.170> carbon<00:03:33.500> fiber<00:03:33.769> instead<00:03:33.980> of<00:03:34.280> regular

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
made of carbon fiber instead of regular

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.569 
made of carbon fiber instead of regular
steel<00:03:35.239> or<00:03:35.600> regular<00:03:36.049> concrete<00:03:36.320> and<00:03:36.769> who<00:03:37.400> knows

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
steel or regular concrete and who knows

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.440 
steel or regular concrete and who knows
maybe<00:03:37.720> as<00:03:38.720> we're<00:03:39.260> seeing<00:03:39.850> a<00:03:40.850> couple<00:03:41.299> of<00:03:41.360> years

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
maybe as we're seeing a couple of years

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.600 
maybe as we're seeing a couple of years
ago<00:03:41.829> translucent<00:03:42.829> concrete's<00:03:43.310> and<00:03:43.459> all<00:03:43.519> these

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
ago translucent concrete's and all these

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.009 
ago translucent concrete's and all these
materials<00:03:44.030> that<00:03:44.120> eventually<00:03:44.360> will<00:03:44.660> make<00:03:44.690> us

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
materials that eventually will make us

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.170 
materials that eventually will make us
see<00:03:45.500> buildings<00:03:45.890> as<00:03:46.310> we<00:03:46.489> have<00:03:46.640> never<00:03:46.910> seen

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
see buildings as we have never seen

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.930 
see buildings as we have never seen
before<00:03:47.299> so<00:03:47.720> I'm<00:03:48.230> very<00:03:48.260> excited<00:03:49.040> and<00:03:49.549> happy<00:03:49.730> of

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
before so I'm very excited and happy of

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.310 
before so I'm very excited and happy of
this<00:03:50.150> time<00:03:51.019> we're<00:03:51.200> living<00:03:51.410> in<00:03:51.709> architecture
