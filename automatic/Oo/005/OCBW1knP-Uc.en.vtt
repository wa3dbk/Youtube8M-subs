definitely<00:00:18.779> my<00:00:18.930> favorite<00:00:18.990> trick<00:00:19.350> shotting

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
definitely my favorite trick shotting

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.140 
definitely my favorite trick shotting
maps<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.010> just<00:00:20.160> maps<00:00:20.369> all<00:00:20.640> around<00:00:20.939> in<00:00:21.060> the

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
maps and just maps all around in the

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.609 
maps and just maps all around in the
game<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.480> feel<00:00:21.630> like<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:21.840> map<00:00:21.990> would<00:00:22.109> be<00:00:22.260> even

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
game I feel like this map would be even

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.290 
game I feel like this map would be even
cooler<00:00:22.800> though<00:00:23.039> if<00:00:23.160> they<00:00:23.279> added<00:00:23.760> something<00:00:24.180> to

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
cooler though if they added something to

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.460 
cooler though if they added something to
this<00:00:24.420> map<00:00:24.600> like<00:00:24.840> where<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.109> could<00:00:25.289> get

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
this map like where you could get

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.200 
this map like where you could get
outside<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.189> map<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.580> prison<00:00:26.939> door<00:00:27.119> is

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
outside of the map the prison door is

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.759 
outside of the map the prison door is
open<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.810> there's<00:00:27.930> like<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> prison<00:00:28.470> break<00:00:28.560> or

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
open and there's like a prison break or

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
open and there's like a prison break or
something<00:00:28.980> like<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.250> mean<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.460> could<00:00:29.699> be

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
something like that I mean that could be

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.790 
something like that I mean that could be
a<00:00:29.820> really<00:00:30.060> cool<00:00:30.179> little<00:00:30.359> deal<00:00:30.990> see<00:00:31.230> map<00:00:31.529> pack

lot more and I've gotten a lot better at
sniping<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.559> free-for-all<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.250> couple<00:00:38.520> of

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.889 
sniping in free-for-all and a couple of
games<00:00:38.730> we've<00:00:38.940> actually<00:00:39.120> had<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.360> pretty<00:00:39.510> sick

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
games we've actually had a pretty sick

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.479 
games we've actually had a pretty sick
clip<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.440> I<00:00:40.500> was<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.680> recording<00:00:41.010> face<00:00:41.160> cam<00:00:41.370> or

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
anything I was just playing by myself

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.450 
anything I was just playing by myself
and<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.050> hit<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.320> clip<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.739> was<00:00:43.890> happy<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.280> I

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
and I hit that clip and I was happy so I

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.310 
and I hit that clip and I was happy so I
saved<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.969> clip<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.329> literally<00:00:45.629> after<00:00:46.170> that

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
saved the clip and literally after that

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.500 
saved the clip and literally after that
game<00:00:46.620> I<00:00:46.829> opened<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> Supply<00:00:47.520> Drop<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:48.030> I<00:00:48.239> wasn't

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
game I opened a Supply Drop and I wasn't

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.790 
game I opened a Supply Drop and I wasn't
recording<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.079> was<00:00:49.170> one<00:00:49.289> of<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.440> like

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
recording and it was one of the like

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.290 
recording and it was one of the like
best<00:00:50.039> supply<00:00:50.370> drops<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.760> I've<00:00:50.879> gotten<00:00:51.210> on

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
best supply drops that I've gotten on

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.970 
best supply drops that I've gotten on
this<00:00:51.510> game<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.899> got<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> six<00:00:52.440> sniper<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.800> I'm

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
this game I got the six sniper that I'm

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.799 
this game I got the six sniper that I'm
using<00:00:53.190> right<00:00:53.430> now<00:00:53.460> called<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.120> pummel<00:00:54.539> er<00:00:54.629> and

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
using right now called the pummel er and

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.420 
using right now called the pummel er and
it<00:00:54.870> has<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> little<00:00:55.289> bit<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.710> faster<00:00:55.949> fire

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
it has a little bit of a faster fire

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.010 
it has a little bit of a faster fire
rate<00:00:56.460> which<00:00:56.850> i<00:00:56.969> think<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.300> awesome<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.930> has

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
rate which i think is awesome and it has

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.470 
rate which i think is awesome and it has
minus<00:00:58.530> one<00:00:58.859> damage<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.460> minus<00:00:59.730> one<00:00:59.910> accuracy

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
minus one damage and minus one accuracy

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.910 
minus one damage and minus one accuracy
but<00:01:00.660> until<00:01:00.960> now<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.440> hasn't<00:01:01.710> really

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
but until now that hasn't really

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.619 
but until now that hasn't really
affected<00:01:02.550> me<00:01:02.670> at<00:01:02.730> all<00:01:02.820> now<00:01:02.969> personally<00:01:03.270> I

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
affected me at all now personally I

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.870 
affected me at all now personally I
think<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> plus<00:01:04.589> or<00:01:04.769> minus<00:01:05.159> damage<00:01:05.640> has

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
think that the plus or minus damage has

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.730 
think that the plus or minus damage has
to<00:01:06.090> do<00:01:06.270> with<00:01:06.479> wallbangs<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.380> if<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.560> shoot

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
to do with wallbangs like if you shoot

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.200 
to do with wallbangs like if you shoot
somebody<00:01:08.070> through<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.340> wall<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.820> either<00:01:09.030> like

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
somebody through a wall it's either like

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.300 
somebody through a wall it's either like
plus<00:01:09.510> or<00:01:09.720> minus<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.170> damage<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> sniper

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
plus or minus the damage of the sniper

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.340 
plus or minus the damage of the sniper
and<00:01:11.520> as<00:01:11.880> for<00:01:12.119> accuracy<00:01:12.600> I'm<00:01:12.720> pretty<00:01:12.960> sure<00:01:13.200> that

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
and as for accuracy I'm pretty sure that

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.380 
and as for accuracy I'm pretty sure that
has<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.650> do<00:01:13.799> with<00:01:13.920> no<00:01:14.189> scopes<00:01:14.520> if<00:01:14.670> it's<00:01:14.790> like<00:01:14.880> +1

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
has to do with no scopes if it's like +1

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.030 
has to do with no scopes if it's like +1
accuracy<00:01:15.900> than<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.259> no<00:01:16.409> scopes<00:01:16.710> like<00:01:16.890> go

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
accuracy than the no scopes like go

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.499 
accuracy than the no scopes like go
straighter<00:01:17.369> or<00:01:17.460> more<00:01:17.790> accurate<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.390> got

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
straighter or more accurate so I got

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.429 
straighter or more accurate so I got
this<00:01:18.570> plumber<00:01:18.869> out<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.110> Supply<00:01:19.380> Drop

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
this plumber out of the Supply Drop

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.050 
this plumber out of the Supply Drop
right<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.009> I<00:01:20.070> was<00:01:20.159> pretty<00:01:20.340> excited<00:01:20.490> because

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
right and I was pretty excited because

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.789 
right and I was pretty excited because
I'd<00:01:21.240> never<00:01:21.630> had<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:22.020> before<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.350> this<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.680> like

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
I'd never had it before and this is like
