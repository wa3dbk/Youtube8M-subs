00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340
 commotion until we get what we said 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.490
 to touch us 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.799
 the more or less baquedano ing our parish priest 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:12.799
 in what we are going to do 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:15.719
 in let's go 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.029
 toward 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.560
 our tool 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.390
 d his resignation his country 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.230
 and let's military what he wrote 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.220
 In the box 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.609
 nerea the small 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.300
 p touches us chair is called inclusion its division 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.500
 what this does is how we see 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.500
 so the somewhat secular outline of the star 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.120
 canastota rock 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.250
 in addition his total support 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.460
 in knowing a render to see how to do so that our sell more or 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.210
 less you see this way 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.310
 because then 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.360
 let's continue 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.180
 percent 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.180
 let's insert what would be our 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.500
 percent 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.070
 it is not all 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.840
 material for 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.960
 our image 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.960
 but first let's create a plane 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.150
 of economy Moscow - an annual plan of these centers for 200 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.810
 with a slow 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.450
 one million 20 unier 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.840
 they are sexy 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.610
 I saw the moss line 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.600
 villa equaled zero 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.600
 so that it is centered 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.910
 well let's both 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.650
 load 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.830
 at our 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.979
 they are not materials that a material is going to be our plank fruit of this round 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.150
 the second contest in our plan did not 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.940
 drag me mossos canastota ronny step more towards our planet 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.330
 while on the table 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.030
 do as I had already done in the option to go from the constant text 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.030
 let's drag what is the spectacular towards the diffuser 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.670
 so that it is copied and they are created white color 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.090
 we are going to enable the option of set pieces the transparency of our 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.579
 material 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:13.579
 it has not given us not to speculate more about the 120 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.489
 and a few years or so 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.989
 percent of yielding a set 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:25.129
 a few hundred or less 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.749
 spa spread combine a bit more what would be the brightness 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.039
 head we can not only go down if we want 

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:35.339
 it was enough mental shine of fans in 90 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:36.769
 and we are going to 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.369
 avoid the option of tuzsa 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:43.339
 patna then but let's expand the opacity 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:46.999
 in 50 percent or so 

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.029
 it should not be like that 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:51.639
 ok let's go to our maps 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:54.709
 in these maps only in this consumption saints 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:58.169
 activates leprosy fraction 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:02:59.629
 if we go to 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.439
 the fourth ocu 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.979
 the rubbery bent 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:07.039
 a hard and coastal map 'blue map' does not appear 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:10.959
 because it's because he has not avoided the pitu well 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.949
 okay the rendering 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.709
 let's go to the torrents 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.669
 ii what we were going 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.649
 what do you want? 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:24.649
 two functions 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.589
 in who says production 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:33.580
 we just select 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.119
 I had him king 

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:37.469
 Nicholas and ready 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:40.469
 we close we start our 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:42.359
 To our materials 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.379
 bashir in spare 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.370
 let's find it nixon that says vr ymad 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:51.059
 what is this 

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:52.229
 we go 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:53.669
 click 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:56.669
 and we see that this form is seen let's select 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:58.949
 a colour 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:01.949
 percent blue color 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:05.709
 we enable this that is moored fracc 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:09.689
 18 - the stolen heart 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.329
 that it was going to be a light blue 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.329
 no more no less 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.189
 Moscow - how 

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:24.289
 how this equipment is moved by the needle our windows as your mentor are the 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:27.529
 accommodations what they like about 'very affair 

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:31.649
 that yes something then the floors between white and blue had to create this 

00:04:31.649 --> 00:04:35.029
 shape 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:38.169
 the one that we are 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:39.539
 in him we can 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.789
 after performing a render to be able to live as it is left 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.789
 in these we sell about 1500 this way 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:49.479
 I think that she 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:52.479
 is that now we are going to 

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:55.449
 so join our 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.050
 a texture that I did not find 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.919
 that day 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.249
 to contribute the put on when 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:06.430
 that we were going to a harlequin ourselves in the background 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.320
 if we are going to press on this firing crisis by material 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:18.599
 i go before being material 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:21.389
 of cÃºber rey hmr and 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.059
 no clicks 

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:25.330
 p we are going to new 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:27.919
 and we look for it to our 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.919
 our computer 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.309
 this siamak kitchen prof 

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:46.309
 let's open fire go select 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.849
 the option of the spherical the loot of a robbery a nonsense not only seems that 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:52.919
 it is expeditious 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:58.069
 they come to apply it is not what we need is famous at least rendering 

00:05:59.089 --> 00:06:02.740
 and in the option erick lee environment 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.439
 or with the number 8 key 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:07.159
 we can converse for this window 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:08.869
 we simply drag 

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:11.809
 other material asia does not tell me 

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:14.809
 a script more valued sucre branches 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:18.039
 and everything would be saved 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:20.930
 when they speak we will see led to look what would be this Tuesday 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.330
 hopkins 

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.500
 flat banesto 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.669
 therefore we select the material of our plane 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:29.779
 indigo album we drag 

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:35.019

 how is he creating 

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:51.779
 this Sunday we are almost seeing what surprises us 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:56.569
 arpey no day is ending what would be this round we can 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:58.430

 obama from baradel states that will now look better 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:08.319
 with a vault also to improve what would be the 

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:10.059
 image 

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:11.249
 millions 

00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:15.529
 this would be all with this we learn to create a jar scares me 

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:19.789
 - very complicated and without occupying a lot of materials 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.189
 but you liked it 

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:23.279
