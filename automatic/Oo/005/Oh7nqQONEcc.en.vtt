00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.389
 my dear friends and today I 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.070
 I'll show you quite interesting and very 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.809
 practical watermelon farm 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.950
 let's start the company itself 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.439
 represents such a construction 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.810
 which is located in rectangle 4 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.060
 10 blocks fully automatic 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.220
 watermelon farm based on a baht candle then 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.110
 there is on the block update tester like 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.480
 only in our company will grow watermelon 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.040
 the company will automatically throw it in the funnel 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.440
 which will ferry him to our chest 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.300
 so the growing questions will be 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.860
 automatically assemble instantly and 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.690
 pile up in our chest 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.700
 which I have already accumulated here 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.440
 serious amount and now get down 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.540
 buildings as I told us 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.550
 you will need a base 10 by 4 blocks and in 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.260
 this basis we have to knock out right away 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.000
 8 blocks that we fill 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.250
 automatically land which will be 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.760
 grow our watermelons and grow our 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.890
 sprouts 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.380
 Now you can do this specific 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.360
 put the sprout in the first block and immediately 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.090
 grow it because we didn't put water 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.399
 in two blocks we make two more pits and 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.090
 grow a couple of watermelon here 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:09.290
 sprouts it needs to be done instantly and 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.600
 we spread the last block we will plant here 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.460
 watermelon and grow it to a maximum of 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.950
 we had a foundation basis which 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.110
 we will grow watermelons cut down even 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.940
 one row we put here a chest and here 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.680
 funnel funnels that will look 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.450
 each other in such a way that 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.100
 here is such a ticker and 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.840
 just in case you can position the funnel 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.490
 here but it is not necessarily very easy 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.470
 can check our system if in 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.360
 the last funnel we put the funnel a 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.280
 she will be through some example 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.170
 chests means we all built right and 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.000
 never made a mistake well, now let's get started 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.740
 to lead risky to start 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.810
 put a sticky plunger here on him 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.520
 we put the boiler and pour water into it 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.070
 will be the basis for our baht candle 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.110
 here we need to arrange the pistons 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.119
 ordinary that will work too 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.710
 how our blood candles and these 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.200
 pistons necessarily as they will 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.210
 units and the whole system after that 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.979
 we are already doing specifically redstone itself here 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.110
 we put a couple of blocks like this 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.090
 and here we stick corporates which will be 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.430
 read signal from this boiler to this 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.410
 block we set ourselves the honor 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.240
 stone skin and here we have 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.070
 that's the way the block that will be 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.230
 pass this redstone signal under it 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.580
 stick another block and here is Crimea 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.800
 Peter who will read it 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.510
 signal that is fed through com 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.760
 parade further we have this 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.740
 striped from the blocks and pour it on 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.290
 our red dust that is redstone 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.270
 after the system , it is ready for 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.870
 work and now assumption on it 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.000
 watermelon 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.590
 it will automatically fold to 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.330
 our funnel system and hereinafter 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.890
 pile up in the chest you can 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.660
 leave this farm either build 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.640
 several such firms and leave them 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.350
 work while you yourself collect 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.150
 what are interested and so on firms 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.800
 automatically you will collect a large 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.020
 number of questions and you never 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.150
 will need food but on this pit 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.280
 jay say goodbye to you and tell you before 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.350
 dates thank you for watching this 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.570
 video if we get to a particular point 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.090
 which is the inhabitants of the head then we 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:59.489
 cause critical damage which will 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.489
 accompanied by this inscription headshots
