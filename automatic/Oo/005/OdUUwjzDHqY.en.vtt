00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
comes with the stop motion pro CD is

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.799 
comes with the stop motion pro CD is
also<00:00:49.829> available<00:00:50.039> on<00:00:50.340> our<00:00:50.370> website<00:00:50.670> now<00:00:51.629> let

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
what's happening ok so along here we

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.870 
what's happening ok so along here we
have<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:01.530> audio<00:01:01.739> tracks<00:01:02.750> displayed<00:01:03.750> as<00:01:04.080> a

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
have the the audio tracks displayed as a

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.950 
have the the audio tracks displayed as a
waveform<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.270> can<00:01:06.420> see<00:01:06.630> where<00:01:06.840> these

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
waveform so you can see where these

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.530 
waveform so you can see where these
footsteps<00:01:07.439> occur<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:08.939> drag<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.420> mouse

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
footsteps occur and I can drag the mouse

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.780 
footsteps occur and I can drag the mouse
over<00:01:09.780> those<00:01:10.049> them<00:01:10.290> hear<00:01:10.560> them<00:01:10.640> over<00:01:11.640> here

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
over those them hear them over here

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.980 
over those them hear them over here
we've<00:01:11.880> got<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.060> big<00:01:12.270> noise<00:01:12.479> which<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.869> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
we've got the big noise which is the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.380 
we've got the big noise which is the
crash<00:01:16.040> and<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.310> can<00:01:17.549> hear<00:01:17.670> how<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:18.090> drag

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
crash and you can hear how I can drag

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.200 
crash and you can hear how I can drag
the<00:01:18.659> slider<00:01:19.650> over<00:01:20.189> those<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.610> listen<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.000> a

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
the slider over those and listen to it a

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.270 
the slider over those and listen to it a
frame<00:01:21.570> at<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.810> time<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.740> good<00:01:22.890> for<00:01:23.070> doing

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
frame at a time this is good for doing

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.830 
frame at a time this is good for doing
lip<00:01:23.640> sync<00:01:25.130> ok<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.939> we've<00:01:27.119> got<00:01:27.210> our<00:01:27.240> audio<00:01:27.570> track

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
lip sync ok so we've got our audio track

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.390 
lip sync ok so we've got our audio track
what<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.170> want<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.380> do<00:01:28.500> now<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.680> decide<00:01:28.950> where<00:01:29.369> I

what I want to do now is decide where I

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.210 
what I want to do now is decide where I
want<00:01:29.490> my<00:01:29.990> animation<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.200> come<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:31.979> start

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
want my animation to come in and start

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.899 
want my animation to come in and start
from<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.329> look<00:01:34.170> let's<00:01:34.619> say<00:01:34.979> i<00:01:35.340> went<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.880> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
from so look let's say i went to the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.730 
from so look let's say i went to the
whole<00:01:36.119> track<00:01:36.420> i'll<00:01:36.630> just<00:01:36.780> start<00:01:36.960> halfway<00:01:37.140> in<00:01:37.560> I

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
whole track i'll just start halfway in I

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.520 
whole track i'll just start halfway in I
just<00:01:38.310> click<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> sync<00:01:38.790> button<00:01:39.380> here<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
just click the sync button here on the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.749 
just click the sync button here on the
bottom<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.920> audio<00:01:41.159> window<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.640> that

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
bottom of the audio window and that

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.749 
bottom of the audio window and that
synchronizes<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.710> audio<00:01:43.710> frame<00:01:44.070> start<00:01:44.460> point

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
synchronizes the audio frame start point

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.450 
synchronizes the audio frame start point
with<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.750> first<00:01:46.290> frame<00:01:46.560> of<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.799> animation<00:01:46.829> or

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
with the first frame of the animation or

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.889 
with the first frame of the animation or
whatever<00:01:47.909> frame<00:01:48.119> of<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.329> animation<00:01:48.360> you're

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
whatever frame of the animation you're

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.260 
whatever frame of the animation you're
looking<00:01:49.170> at<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.829> can<00:01:49.950> see<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> little<00:01:50.310> dot<00:01:51.060> down

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
looking at you can see a little dot down

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.670 
looking at you can see a little dot down
here<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.630> become<00:01:51.960> highlighted<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.470> little

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
here is become highlighted a little

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.710 
here is become highlighted a little
frame<00:01:52.979> marker<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.729> as<00:01:54.119> we<00:01:54.270> film<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
frame marker and as we film the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.760 
frame marker and as we film the
animation<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.350> will<00:01:55.500> will<00:01:55.829> advance<00:01:57.439> also<00:01:58.439> on

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
animation that will will advance also on

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.280 
animation that will will advance also on
another<00:01:59.040> note<00:01:59.219> here<00:01:59.579> I've<00:01:59.729> set<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.290> capture

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
another note here I've set the capture

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.719 
another note here I've set the capture
too<00:02:01.710> you're<00:02:02.009> going<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.219> set<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.399> capture

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
too you're going to set the capture

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.539 
too you're going to set the capture
rather<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.149> capture<00:02:03.689> two<00:02:03.869> frames<00:02:04.259> with<00:02:05.219> every

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
rather to capture two frames with every
