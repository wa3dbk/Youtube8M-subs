little bit mushy you can tell it's just
not<00:02:17.140> healthy<00:02:17.290> anymore<00:02:17.650> there's<00:02:18.459> no<00:02:18.700> real

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
not healthy anymore there's no real

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:21.750 
not healthy anymore there's no real
damage<00:02:19.120> there's<00:02:19.599> no<00:02:19.720> spots<00:02:20.189> the<00:02:21.189> back<00:02:21.370> side<00:02:21.640> as

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
damage there's no spots the back side as

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.339 
damage there's no spots the back side as
well<00:02:21.939> I<00:02:21.970> don't<00:02:22.329> see<00:02:22.450> any<00:02:22.599> bugs<00:02:22.780> or<00:02:22.989> anything

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
well I don't see any bugs or anything

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:24.960 
well I don't see any bugs or anything
like<00:02:23.379> that<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:23.860> check<00:02:24.010> out<00:02:24.220> no<00:02:24.459> holes<00:02:24.700> in<00:02:24.879> the

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
like that to check out no holes in the

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.179 
like that to check out no holes in the
leaf<00:02:25.120> so<00:02:25.810> I'm<00:02:26.140> going<00:02:26.379> to<00:02:26.439> guess<00:02:26.709> that<00:02:26.739> this

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
leaf so I'm going to guess that this

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:29.550 
leaf so I'm going to guess that this
leaf<00:02:27.459> it's<00:02:28.120> just<00:02:28.480> it's<00:02:28.750> old<00:02:28.930> it's<00:02:29.200> probably<00:02:29.500> a

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
leaf it's just it's old it's probably a

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.830 
leaf it's just it's old it's probably a
few<00:02:29.769> years<00:02:29.950> old<00:02:30.159> now<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.519> it's<00:02:31.329> time<00:02:31.420> that<00:02:31.599> it

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
few years old now and it's time that it

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.949 
few years old now and it's time that it
got<00:02:31.930> removed<00:02:32.909> so<00:02:33.909> I'm<00:02:34.359> going<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.540> do<00:02:34.659> the<00:02:34.780> same

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
got removed so I'm going to do the same

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:42.330 
got removed so I'm going to do the same
with<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.230> other<00:02:35.260> side<00:02:35.769> here<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:41.200> again<00:02:41.680> no

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
with the other side here and again no

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.610 
with the other side here and again no
real<00:02:42.609> damage<00:02:42.639> to<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.299> this<00:02:43.870> leaf<00:02:44.109> is<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.319> little

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
real damage to it this leaf is a little

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.970 
real damage to it this leaf is a little
bit<00:02:44.739> older<00:02:45.069> again<00:02:45.690> but<00:02:49.440> now<00:02:50.440> marks<00:02:50.769> like<00:02:50.950> this

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
bit older again but now marks like this

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.530 
bit older again but now marks like this
the<00:02:51.970> other<00:02:52.090> thing<00:02:52.269> to<00:02:52.359> take<00:02:52.480> into

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
the other thing to take into

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.740 
the other thing to take into
consideration<00:02:53.500> is<00:02:53.650> what<00:02:54.310> happened<00:02:54.670> first<00:02:54.879> are

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
consideration is what happened first are

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.569 
consideration is what happened first are
these<00:02:55.959> marks<00:02:56.260> appearing<00:02:56.709> because<00:02:56.829> the<00:02:57.280> leaf

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
these marks appearing because the leaf

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.000 
these marks appearing because the leaf
is<00:02:57.730> old<00:02:58.030> or<00:02:58.239> always<00:02:58.930> a<00:02:58.959> leaf<00:02:59.230> turning<00:02:59.859> yellow

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
is old or always a leaf turning yellow

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.190 
is old or always a leaf turning yellow
because<00:03:00.400> these<00:03:00.549> marks<00:03:00.879> appeared<00:03:01.269> and<00:03:01.840> again

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
because these marks appeared and again

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.379 
because these marks appeared and again
i'm<00:03:02.319> going<00:03:02.500> to<00:03:02.590> guess<00:03:02.739> with<00:03:03.010> this<00:03:03.159> leaf<00:03:03.389> that

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
i'm going to guess with this leaf that

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:06.449 
i'm going to guess with this leaf that
it's<00:03:04.870> just<00:03:05.139> an<00:03:05.230> older<00:03:05.500> leaf<00:03:05.650> it's<00:03:06.010> had<00:03:06.189> a<00:03:06.220> few

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
it's just an older leaf it's had a few

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.000 
it's just an older leaf it's had a few
years<00:03:06.700> of<00:03:06.760> life<00:03:06.879> and<00:03:07.359> it's<00:03:07.510> time<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:08.010> get

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
years of life and it's time to get

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:16.789 
years of life and it's time to get
chopped<00:03:09.280> off<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:14.680> there<00:03:14.889> we<00:03:15.040> go<00:03:15.160> we<00:03:15.639> have<00:03:15.849> a

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
chopped off and there we go we have a

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.180 
chopped off and there we go we have a
happy<00:03:17.799> healthy<00:03:18.040> phalaenopsis<00:03:19.919> i'm<00:03:20.919> sure

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
happy healthy phalaenopsis i'm sure

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.860 
happy healthy phalaenopsis i'm sure
within<00:03:21.370> the<00:03:21.579> next<00:03:21.699> few<00:03:22.030> months<00:03:22.180> i'm<00:03:22.480> going<00:03:22.720> to
