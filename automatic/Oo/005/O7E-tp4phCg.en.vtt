00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.240
 good afternoon members of sophie la 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.820
 Spanish association of plants 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.619
 carnivorous this afternoon bored me and 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.800
 decided to make exquisite venus 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:19.820
 flycatcher I said a lot because I do not 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.430
 He recorded a small video like that 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.289
 how it is made equal to someone helps her 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.689
 some new total does not have any 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.000
 mystery is not very easy is simply 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.560
 tear off the leaf by taking a bit of the 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.760
 bottom part of the rhizome that looks 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.640
 white color and put it in blonde peat or 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.300
 moss spag not just keep it moist 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:43.820
 with light and new templates come out 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.640
 made some cuttings made of fuci 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:50.440
 to the are here 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.440
 from the bohemian garnett 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.829
 and some more out there that left me 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.080
 knee to the net also made one and now 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.180
 I'm going to do one of the 52 b state here 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.180
 what to start this sheet that is already 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.730
 old lady 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.740
 and I'm going to start simply and 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.740
 I'm going to plant has no more 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.770
 we take the plant 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.020
 simply the only thing to do 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.719
 is to throw 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.179
 a little bit that hard so that 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:24.520
 leave with rhizome delivery 

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.130
 we trade the plant clear because if 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.439
 I do not cloud a business 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.760
 that is thrown with door closes the 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.230
 mouth 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:38.580
 you will feel entity and it comes out 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:41.070
 I'm a fucking genius, that's how you should not 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.950
 out you have to go out with a piece of 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.750
 rhizome below best short and I do 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.750
 well because with one hand it is fucked 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.840
 that's how it should come out that you see a 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.450
 chub 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.610
 whitish color that is small piece of 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.560
 rhizome here you see 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.010
 he approached a lot focuses but the tip 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.010
 it's white 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:18.030
 as yellowish much more yellow 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.370
 that the sheet itself and this now 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.940
 just take it 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:27.299
 it comes around here I have them here with 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.519
 some backs in a tupper with a little 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:33.430
 of moss out there that is growing and I'm going 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:35.890
 removing simply I take it here 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.860
 a little bit that 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.209
 that the white part is in contact with 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.110
 which is the part of the rhizome be in 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:45.870
 contact with moss 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.090
 so without covering either because you can 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.090
 simply rot that is a little 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.890
 with the blonde mob that serves him 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.530
 likewise and I have other cuttings that 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:02.209
 I have done and without more and with a handle of the 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.209
 that they escape sis 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.370
 more nothing hot gas is a spatula 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.120
 you're out there lost from the ones that come out 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.489

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.220

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.990

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.610

 the little girl directly in the world 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.630

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.450
 tiny and without more that has been all 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.180
