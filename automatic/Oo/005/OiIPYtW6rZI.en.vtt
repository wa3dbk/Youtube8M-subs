if<00:02:52.370> you<00:02:52.489> want<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.790> upgrade<00:02:53.000> this<00:02:53.239> beyond<00:02:53.900> four

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
if you want to upgrade this beyond four

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:55.720 
if you want to upgrade this beyond four
gigabytes<00:02:54.859> you're<00:02:55.069> going<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.400> have<00:02:55.549> to

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
gigabytes you're going to have to

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.030 
gigabytes you're going to have to
replace<00:02:55.970> a<00:02:56.359> couple<00:02:57.049> of<00:02:57.260> those<00:02:57.500> dims<00:02:57.799> back

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
replace a couple of those dims back

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.830 
replace a couple of those dims back
there<00:02:58.220> you're<00:02:58.280> gonna<00:02:58.430> find<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:59.150> 320

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840

actually located right here as you can
see<00:03:22.579> on<00:03:22.669> the<00:03:22.760> back<00:03:22.910> there<00:03:23.209> is<00:03:23.239> a<00:03:23.810> antenna

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
see on the back there is a antenna

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.400 
see on the back there is a antenna
waiting<00:03:25.549> for<00:03:25.760> you<00:03:25.879> right<00:03:26.150> there<00:03:26.510> but<00:03:27.290> the

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
waiting for you right there but the

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.770 
waiting for you right there but the
actual<00:03:27.620> wireless<00:03:27.919> card<00:03:28.459> is<00:03:28.790> right<00:03:29.090> up<00:03:29.359> here

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
actual wireless card is right up here

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.059 
actual wireless card is right up here
and<00:03:30.079> that<00:03:30.260> actually<00:03:30.530> attaches<00:03:30.889> to<00:03:30.980> the

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
and that actually attaches to the

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.000 
and that actually attaches to the
motherboard<00:03:31.459> via<00:03:31.959> USB<00:03:32.959> so<00:03:33.650> you're<00:03:33.799> not

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
motherboard via USB so you're not

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.569 
motherboard via USB so you're not
wasting<00:03:34.609> one<00:03:35.180> of<00:03:35.419> your<00:03:35.720> PCI<00:03:36.199> slots<00:03:36.709> for<00:03:37.519> your

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
wasting one of your PCI slots for your

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.390 
wasting one of your PCI slots for your
wireless<00:03:38.359> connectivity<00:03:39.079> which<00:03:39.440> is<00:03:39.650> kind<00:03:40.340> of

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
wireless connectivity which is kind of

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.800 
wireless connectivity which is kind of
nice<00:03:40.549> if<00:03:40.760> you're<00:03:40.970> planning<00:03:41.180> on<00:03:41.359> expanding

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
nice if you're planning on expanding

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.589 
nice if you're planning on expanding
your<00:03:42.139> machine<00:03:42.739> so<00:03:43.160> there<00:03:43.669> you<00:03:43.760> have<00:03:43.790> it<00:03:43.970> it's<00:03:44.419> a
