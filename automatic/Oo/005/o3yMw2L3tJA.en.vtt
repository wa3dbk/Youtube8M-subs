doing a drop test with the Xperia Z so
yeah<00:00:11.309> let's<00:00:12.059> check<00:00:12.389> this<00:00:12.630> ready<00:00:14.089> all<00:00:15.089> right

now do you know is it a if it fell on
the<00:00:21.240> front<00:00:21.540> or<00:00:21.690> the<00:00:21.750> back<00:00:21.780> on<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.230> front<00:00:22.380> on

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
yes so this has a shadow proof sheet on

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.430 
yes so this has a shadow proof sheet on
there<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.490> if<00:00:27.450> you<00:00:27.570> do<00:00:27.720> happen<00:00:27.870> to<00:00:28.050> break<00:00:28.260> it

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
at least you're able to keep the pieces

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.650 
at least you're able to keep the pieces
inside<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.870> screen

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
inside the screen

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
yeah they will not tell me which glass

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.119 
yeah they will not tell me which glass
is<00:01:00.390> on<00:01:00.540> this<00:01:00.780> thing<00:01:01.140> here<00:01:01.469> but<00:01:01.649> I'm<00:01:01.769> betting

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
is on this thing here but I'm betting

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.479 
is on this thing here but I'm betting
that<00:01:02.159> it's<00:01:02.399> not<00:01:02.610> Corning's<00:01:04.009> I've<00:01:05.009> done<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.309> lot

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
that it's not Corning's I've done a lot

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.529 
that it's not Corning's I've done a lot
of<00:01:05.549> fun<00:01:05.820> stuff<00:01:06.000> with<00:01:06.330> Corning<00:01:06.630> Gorilla<00:01:06.750> Glass

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:08.539 
of fun stuff with Corning Gorilla Glass

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:11.540 
of fun stuff with Corning Gorilla Glass
now<00:01:09.539> is<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.990> bezel<00:01:10.470> what<00:01:11.009> is<00:01:11.130> what<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.399> this

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
now is that bezel what is what is this

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.609 
now is that bezel what is what is this
made<00:01:11.789> of<00:01:11.820> entirely<00:01:12.300> Secession<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.380> like

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
made of entirely Secession it's like

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.639 
made of entirely Secession it's like
it's<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.429> glass<00:01:14.729> fiber<00:01:15.090> pali<00:01:15.509> mine<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:16.470> that's

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
it's a glass fiber pali mine so that's

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.040 
it's a glass fiber pali mine so that's
quite<00:01:16.830> we're<00:01:17.009> really<00:01:17.159> hard<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.750> just

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
quite we're really hard so is that just

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.660 
quite we're really hard so is that just
the<00:01:19.170> glass<00:01:19.380> or<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.310> extras<00:01:20.550> just

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
the glass or is that the extras just

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.550 
the glass or is that the extras just
that's<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.390> exoskeleton<00:01:21.869> here<00:01:22.319> that<00:01:22.440> you

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
that's this exoskeleton here that you

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.930 
that's this exoskeleton here that you
see<00:01:22.740> wrapping<00:01:23.130> around<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.429> entire<00:01:23.670> device

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
see wrapping around the entire device

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.020 
see wrapping around the entire device
right<00:01:24.830> nice<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.069> that<00:01:26.190> gives<00:01:26.369> us<00:01:26.460> its<00:01:26.640> strength

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
right nice so that gives us its strength

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.960 
right nice so that gives us its strength
and<00:01:27.390> part<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.840> its<00:01:27.960> durability

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
and part of its durability

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.820 
and part of its durability
it<00:01:29.480> seems<00:01:29.660> that<00:01:29.750> you've<00:01:29.870> got<00:01:30.020> a<00:01:30.050> little<00:01:30.500> bit<00:01:30.650> of

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
it seems that you've got a little bit of

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.550 
it seems that you've got a little bit of
a<00:01:30.890> lip<00:01:31.100> here<00:01:31.460> so<00:01:32.240> that<00:01:32.510> it<00:01:32.630> doesn't<00:01:32.840> smack

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
a lip here so that it doesn't smack

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.710 
a lip here so that it doesn't smack
directly<00:01:34.280> on<00:01:34.400> that<00:01:34.580> glass<00:01:34.850> which<00:01:35.240> is<00:01:35.270> really

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
directly on that glass which is really

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.030 
directly on that glass which is really
nice

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.340 

so<00:01:38.430> what<00:01:38.580> happens<00:01:38.940> then<00:01:39.120> if<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.390> were<00:01:39.510> to<00:01:39.750> do

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
so what happens then if you were to do

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.020 
so what happens then if you were to do
it<00:01:40.470> directly<00:01:40.770> on<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:40.980> glass<00:01:41.130> rather<00:01:41.610> than<00:01:41.850> on

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
it directly on the glass rather than on

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.230 
it directly on the glass rather than on
the

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.320 

not<00:01:46.600> so<00:01:46.810> bad<00:01:47.380> so<00:01:47.950> yeah<00:01:48.159> this<00:01:48.850> thing<00:01:49.090> is

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
not so bad so yeah this thing is

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.240 
not so bad so yeah this thing is
waterproof<00:01:49.990> you<00:01:50.350> need<00:01:50.500> to<00:01:50.590> make<00:01:50.740> sure<00:01:50.979> that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
waterproof you need to make sure that

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.880 
waterproof you need to make sure that
you're<00:01:51.400> keeping<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:52.420> port's<00:01:52.750> closed<00:01:53.110> again

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
you're keeping the port's closed again

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.890 
you're keeping the port's closed again
keep<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.580> board's<00:01:54.880> closed<00:01:55.119> oh<00:01:55.390> that<00:01:55.750> was<00:01:55.869> a

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
keep the board's closed oh that was a

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.960 
keep the board's closed oh that was a
question<00:01:56.320> that<00:01:56.350> I<00:01:56.500> had<00:01:56.680> maybe<00:01:56.860> you<00:01:57.070> know<00:01:57.250> so

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
way to see that I wasn't able to produce

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.940 
way to see that I wasn't able to produce

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.880 
don't think we can produce it live on
this<00:03:02.480> phone<00:03:02.690> but<00:03:02.900> one<00:03:03.350> of<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.500> things<00:03:03.650> that<00:03:03.800> we
