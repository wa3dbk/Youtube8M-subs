00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
practice it is I would get a metal bar

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.459 
practice it is I would get a metal bar
put<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:44.760> on<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> weight<00:00:45.120> rack<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.629> just<00:00:46.050> work<00:00:46.289> on

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
put it on a weight rack and just work on

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.920 
put it on a weight rack and just work on
pulling<00:00:46.829> up<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.129> dropping<00:00:47.640> down<00:00:47.820> um<00:00:48.180> and
