so this is AutoCAD on the iPad sort of
i'm<00:00:05.520> using<00:00:05.970> logmein<00:00:06.529> to<00:00:07.529> connect<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:08.540> a<00:00:09.540> laptop

i'm using logmein to connect to a laptop
PC<00:00:10.950> that<00:00:11.370> is<00:00:11.550> running<00:00:12.059> autocad<00:00:12.630> so<00:00:14.120> it<00:00:15.139> really

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
PC that is running autocad so it really

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.260 
PC that is running autocad so it really
it's<00:00:16.379> not<00:00:16.590> running<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.340> iPad<00:00:17.730> isn't<00:00:18.090> running

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
it's not running the iPad isn't running

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.200 
it's not running the iPad isn't running
out<00:00:18.480> of<00:00:18.510> cat<00:00:18.810> it's<00:00:19.050> my<00:00:19.740> laptop<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.490> I'm<00:00:20.910> just

out of cat it's my laptop and I'm just
sort<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.689> taking<00:00:22.170> control<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:23.000> through<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
sort of taking control of it through the

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.679 
sort of taking control of it through the
iPad<00:00:25.519> and<00:00:26.810> this<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.930> me<00:00:28.109> logging<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:29.689> my

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
iPad and this is me logging in to my

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:38.690 
iPad and this is me logging in to my
laptop<00:00:32.090> and<00:00:33.469> there's<00:00:34.469> AutoCAD<00:00:37.550> first<00:00:38.550> thing

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
laptop and there's AutoCAD first thing

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.180 
laptop and there's AutoCAD first thing
I'm<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:38.969> do<00:00:39.180> here<00:00:39.920> is<00:00:40.920> try<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.640> draw<00:00:41.969> a

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.190 
I'm going to do here is try to draw a

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.260 
I'm going to do here is try to draw a
rectangle<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.280> as<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.460> can<00:00:44.610> see<00:00:44.640> when<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.059> move

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
rectangle and as you can see when I move

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.040 
rectangle and as you can see when I move
the<00:00:45.420> cursor<00:00:45.950> it's<00:00:46.950> not<00:00:47.190> under<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.239> my<00:00:48.629> fingers

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
the cursor it's not under the my fingers

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.459 
the cursor it's not under the my fingers
it's<00:00:49.350> sort<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.399> way<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:52.170> kind<00:00:52.379> of

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
it's sort of a way and you kind of

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.220 
it's sort of a way and you kind of
detached<00:00:52.800> from<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.399> cursor

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:56.230 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.830 

there's<00:00:57.190> the<00:00:57.340> rectangle<00:00:57.940> I'm<00:00:58.450> going<00:00:58.540> to<00:00:58.630> draw

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
there's the rectangle I'm going to draw

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.880 
there's the rectangle I'm going to draw
another<00:00:59.079> one<00:00:59.350> here<00:00:59.680> this<00:01:00.520> time<00:01:00.760> I'm<00:01:00.880> going<00:01:01.059> to

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
another one here this time I'm going to

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.270 
another one here this time I'm going to
actually<00:01:04.229> input<00:01:05.229> the<00:01:05.350> dimensions<00:01:05.890> of<00:01:06.130> the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.280 
actually input the dimensions of the

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.180 
actually input the dimensions of the
rectangle<00:01:07.229> I'll<00:01:08.229> start<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.650> first<00:01:08.860> corner

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
rectangle I'll start the first corner

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.540 
rectangle I'll start the first corner
and<00:01:09.400> then<00:01:09.490> bring<00:01:09.820> up<00:01:09.970> the<00:01:10.650> key<00:01:11.650> CAD<00:01:11.890> and<00:01:12.900> then

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
and then bring up the key CAD and then

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:24.230 
and then bring up the key CAD and then
type<00:01:15.550> in<00:01:15.729> the<00:01:15.850> dimensions

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.560 

and<00:01:24.689> it's<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.670> five<00:01:26.670> wide<00:01:26.970> by<00:01:27.240> 6<00:01:27.540> hi<00:01:28.460> rectangle

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
and it's a five wide by 6 hi rectangle

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.039 
and it's a five wide by 6 hi rectangle
and<00:01:30.649> here<00:01:31.649> I'm<00:01:31.770> bringing<00:01:32.040> up<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:33.049> shortcut

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
and here I'm bringing up the shortcut

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.910 
and here I'm bringing up the shortcut
menu<00:01:34.080> to<00:01:34.850> pan<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.880> view

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.680 

right<00:01:40.759> click<00:01:41.000> is<00:01:41.210> actually<00:01:41.659> a

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
right click is actually a

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.840 

two<00:01:44.500> finger<00:01:45.540> tap

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.149 

on<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.600> iPad

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.599 

and<00:01:53.549> here<00:01:54.299> I'm<00:01:54.390> switching<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.840> zoom<00:01:55.369> zoom<00:01:56.369> real

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
and here I'm switching to zoom zoom real

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:59.030 
and here I'm switching to zoom zoom real
time

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.910 

so<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.730> can<00:01:59.850> get<00:01:59.940> a<00:02:00.000> better

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
so I can get a better

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.270 
so I can get a better
better<00:02:02.490> view<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.909> rectangle<00:02:04.040> I'm<00:02:05.040> going

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
better view of the rectangle I'm going

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.859 
better view of the rectangle I'm going
to<00:02:05.340> erase<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.820> first<00:02:06.060> rectangle<00:02:06.540> because

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
to erase the first rectangle because

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.419 
to erase the first rectangle because
it's<00:02:07.080> kind<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.470> in<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.619> way

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.979 

as<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.209> can<00:02:11.359> see<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:14.150> ribbon<00:02:14.450> actually<00:02:14.810> works

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
as you can see the ribbon actually works

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.600 
as you can see the ribbon actually works
pretty<00:02:15.109> well<00:02:15.319> with<00:02:15.739> with<00:02:16.730> the<00:02:18.069> iPad

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
pretty well with with the iPad

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.260 
pretty well with with the iPad
you<00:02:21.060> just<00:02:21.410> point<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.470> cursor<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.950> a

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
you just point the cursor to a

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:30.860 
you just point the cursor to a
to<00:02:24.810> an<00:02:24.930> icon<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.530> tap<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.400> to<00:02:27.270> start<00:02:27.540> a<00:02:27.630> command

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.610 

now<00:02:31.470> i'm<00:02:31.980> going<00:02:32.129> to<00:02:32.190> offset<00:02:32.670> this<00:02:32.819> rectangle

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
now i'm going to offset this rectangle

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.430 
now i'm going to offset this rectangle
give<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:34.799> distance<00:02:35.190> for<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.459> offset<00:02:36.440> using

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
give it a distance for the offset using

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.160 
give it a distance for the offset using
the<00:02:37.560> keypad

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.610 

and<00:02:44.240> I've<00:02:45.240> said<00:02:45.540> toward<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.900> middle

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
and I've said toward the middle

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.860 
and I've said toward the middle
double<00:02:48.340> tap

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
double tap

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.120 
double tap
hangs<00:02:50.500> it

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
hangs it

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.270 
hangs it

there's<00:04:58.750> a<00:04:58.870> little<00:04:59.080> bit<00:04:59.169> of<00:04:59.199> a<00:04:59.350> lag<00:04:59.560> between

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
there's a little bit of a lag between

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.999

so except

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.150 
so except
those<00:05:11.010> locations<00:05:11.400> and<00:05:11.820> there<00:05:12.000> it<00:05:12.120> is
