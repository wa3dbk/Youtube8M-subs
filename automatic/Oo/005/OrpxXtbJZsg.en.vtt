00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
 These are these ensures that the standard result in football Thuringia 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.230
 in front of a good 800 men Erfurt with his third league home game against Jena yesterday 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.810
 Evening kick and Carl Zeiss around and defeated red-white for one 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.009
 exciting quarterfinals in the ThÃ¼ringenpokal with 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.699
 2 2 1 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.300
 the decisive goal Ronny Nikol scored by foul-eleven meters in the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.369
 renewal 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.689
 that then floated in seventh heaven and the Erfurt 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:29.669
 you pissed off 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:31.940
 in the first place on yourself then 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.090
 A good two hours before, things looked a bit different 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.290
 Red and white had the cup match under control 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.460
 clearly dominating in the first half 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.500
 logically 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.770
 against the team of coach Stefan Emmerling also with 1 0 in the lead Tino 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.160
 Semmer was 17 minutes faster than Moses Sichone 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.879
 and it seemed like that 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.220
 as on Erfurt would do justice to his favorite role in the cable sports field 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.980
 especially since the host in the first half hardly anything was visible 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.110
 We have big problems that should first be 20 minutes 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.060
 Dolge the route they want to move you 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.090
 However, the plans would have wanted 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.050
 but this picture changed completely in the second half now played 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.020
 only the FC Carl Zeiss and worked out a scoring opportunity after the 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.040
 other 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.840
 but the ball was not all over the post in the way was or Erfurt 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.950
 strong goalkeeper Dirk Orlishausen 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.580
 but the Jenaer pressure he was getting bigger and therefore was the 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.820
 equalizer 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.540
 then only a matter of time 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.220
 promoted or clock dense shrubbery 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.780
 now would 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.420
 so will immediately be punished over necessary crew and went through 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:39.860
 anyway 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.790
 but everyone knows had to wait until 76 minutes before Moses Sichone per 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.440
 Header goal that 1 2 1 succeeded 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.650
 He also gave Erfurt's defender Merkel a slight push 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.050
 the hit counted and it went into extra time 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.850
 and in the downhill again Erfurt first at the press Jena could from 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.940
 Fortunately, after passing by Malura, two red and white players are playing on the ball 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.490
 slipped past in the extension 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.069
 he makes the first mistake that would lose this game and the mistake 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.080
 made Erfurt defensive boss Martin Pohl by putting Lenas Mayombo in the penalty area of 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.620
 brought the legs if you absolutely had to give penalties was there 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.999
 but it was not full anyway 

00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.600
 he turned the penalty safely 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.670
 and led Jena to the semi-finals of the Thuringia Cup's uptrend 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.130
 under coach Wolfgang Frank continues with it
