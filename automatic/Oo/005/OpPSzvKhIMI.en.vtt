to<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.170> really<00:00:43.440> fluid<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.239> that's<00:00:45.239> kind<00:00:45.600> of

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
to be really fluid and that's kind of

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.430 
to be really fluid and that's kind of
what<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:45.870> try<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.380> do<00:00:46.590> with<00:00:46.770> my<00:00:46.980> hand<00:00:47.250> style

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
growing up I was always influenced by

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.590 
growing up I was always influenced by
the<00:00:51.000> filly<00:00:51.480> hand<00:00:51.840> style<00:00:52.110> which<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> really

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
the filly hand style which is a really

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.430 
the filly hand style which is a really
long<00:00:54.600> hand<00:00:55.110> style<00:00:55.410> at<00:00:56.370> least<00:00:56.610> vertically<00:00:57.440> it's

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
long hand style at least vertically it's

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.310 
long hand style at least vertically it's
got<00:00:58.680> really<00:00:58.890> swooping<00:00:59.840> letters<00:01:00.840> if<00:01:01.170> that

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
got really swooping letters if that

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.950 
got really swooping letters if that
makes<00:01:01.559> sense<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.640> yeah<00:01:03.059> that's<00:01:03.390> kind<00:01:03.720> of<00:01:03.780> how<00:01:03.840> I

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960
