00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:03.280
 capello 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.280
 a wasteland 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.530
 two of the detainees time has seen that with this type of product 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:12.590
 the technology 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.719
 your candidate 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:16.219
 gorostiaga 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.130
 like banners that constantly update their forests a message of 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.269
 text to this conflict all and all per capita 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.650
 everything you always wanted to be technology and never dared to 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:28.749
 ask 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:31.879
 while it is a statement 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:33.780
 / m 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.340
 we all remember the amount of ballots and the many colors that a kettle has 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.460
 we all have ever knew we handled a calculator 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.070
 and we saw on their screens that we added figures that we did not even know 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.110
 pronounce 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.210
 we build the fortune of playing with a remote-controlled toy 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.620
 ap man is ingenious created 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.860
 many machines I always wanted to make things easier for daily life 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.350
 today we will talk about one of his wonderful devices that has come to us 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.230
 very well 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.390
 because they help us and knowledge and even help us minister life itself 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.850
 welcome immediately followed 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.840
 everything you always wanted to know about technology but never dared to 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.550
 ask 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.380
 they are only miranda and this in the explora park in Medellin today we will talk about 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.060
 the computer 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.640
 that circus drawer that seems very complex 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.310
 I am going to show you how understanding some of its parts we will understand 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.180
 as a function the rest 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.180
 the computer or the computer is a machine 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.630
 it's like a human body 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.980
 that like a human body like this 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.800
 Part by part 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.480
 if it's like a human body the computer has a heart with a 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.900
 nervous and muscular system 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.729
 dr 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:53.630
 perfect 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.630
 it also has its powerful brain to be able to think quickly 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.719
 besides the heat that died 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:04.120
 short memories 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.120
 long term 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:13.319
 the computer needs holes to be able to communicate with the entrance and 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.789
 of output as the body to be heard 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:19.699
 about to see 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:21.759
 would need 

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:24.759
 a respiratory system 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.059
 already with all this nothing else 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:29.079
 a good skeleton 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.419
 the brief that is exported all those organs 

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:34.629
 Of course, the computer has other elements that we hope one day 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.799
 this electronic body has why I do not know if cost are called 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.099
 and also how he has no thought 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.099
 the energy data that are called your acting are you 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.310
 that is just limited to turning it on 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.640
 and you get scared when you hear how this chassis happened in Asia 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:56.240
 but calm 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.540
 because I'm going to tell 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.659
 how this electronic body works 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.839
 from the first collision of energy and power of the machine bursts begins 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:05.879
 compute 

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:09.769
 to execute millions of simple solutions designed by programmers in 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.099
 a specialized language that the machine turns into a year 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:14.449
 in zeros and one 

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:18.409
 because if men can write everything based on 10 numbers 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:19.419
 machine 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.069
 you can do everything in emptied 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:24.919
 and can even read and write the colors 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:25.779
 the solids 

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:29.849
 is able to recreate many things in the life of man with only a few fish 

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:35.729
 but what are those bodies these basic parts of which we are 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:36.330
 talking 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.739
 this the board 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.729
 or the mother card that is the support 

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:43.369
 without it the other parts could not exist 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:46.329
 there is also the processed 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.619
 who is like the general manager of the machine 

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:52.399
 lc that receives the orders that are given the clicks that are given 

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:54.139
 for example 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.629
 please now in this file 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:58.279
 now close it 

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:01.089
 now bring the mail please 

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:03.359
 now in the closing of this account 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.769
 today I did not mistake control z 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.769
 is the ram that is like a secretariat 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:13.950
 yaguaraparo palace marqués de la peña paco paco even 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.130
 clear that if the patient and his group work for this session now 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.550
 While the machine is running, she remembers all the operations 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.159
 that he usually does 

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:27.780
 and stores them in the computer when it is turned on to be the 

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:31.039
 processor work quickly at higher speed 

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.230
 on the other hand there is also the hard drive 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.610
 acs with a giant file cabinet where all the stored information is 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:40.710
 abi the rubble a long-term memory 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.180
 are all the files or the data in all the villages and the heroes 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.059
 here one searches and finds all the information in thousandths of seconds 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:54.989
 the machine although very technological needed external devices 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:59.919
 by mouse that is with which we give click activates the options that appear 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.080
 the computer 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.960
 when you die click if you participate cover cancel 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.160
 there is also the keyboard that is with which we visit with our media the 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.220
 numbers symbols or words for example the there is a program called 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.330
 fraternal conflict 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.099
 perfect 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:16.289
 we can also insert for memory 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.210
 or any device being a camera a video camera 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.330
 through its many that are called 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.800
 ports a precedent 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.650
 that is, it has a connection 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.699
 universal 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:29.030
 or when we put in for example I saw 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.180
 houzi 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.790
 or when we connect to the internet 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.140
 all this information that comes through wires through the air is 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.000
 transformed into a hospi in zeros 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.910
 the machine processes them and quickly converts them sometimes into thousandths of 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:41.600
 seconds 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.310
 until it is transformed into an image that appears on the screen 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.680
 an image that can be seen 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.569
 will take you anywhere 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:53.310
 what you brought what you did what you left what was sent now is 

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:56.839
 putin information that you can easily use millions of times 

00:05:58.499 --> 00:06:01.490
 they are machines to work 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.320
 that get sick like every body 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.409
 that line up like every system 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:09.580
 in the street we use appliances in the house we have appliances and in the 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.840
 industry there robots that are used daily robots that are finally 

00:06:13.839 --> 00:06:17.520
 computers that condemn millions of processes to make us all life 

00:06:17.519 --> 00:06:19.809
 much much easier 

00:06:19.809 --> 00:06:21.879
 computers have a useful life 

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:24.499
 everything depends on our daily demands 

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:26.710
 said isaac asimov 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.409
 we can look to the future 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:31.020
 since humanity will be free from all work 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.689
 that is not an insult 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:36.169
 what we should do is leave these areas to 

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:39.169
 and dedicate ourselves to associate with creativity 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:41.119
 to infection 

00:06:41.119 --> 00:06:44.520
 that seems a machine can not perform 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.520
 that was all we have seen
