00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
of goodness that's actually wasn't that

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.490 
of goodness that's actually wasn't that
good<00:00:16.890> because<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.180> took<00:00:18.390> me<00:00:18.600> about<00:00:19.140> eight

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
good because it took me about eight

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.660 
good because it took me about eight
tries<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.460> finally<00:00:21.000> get<00:00:21.210> into<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.689> servers

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
tries to finally get into the servers

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.349 
tries to finally get into the servers
yeah<00:00:23.670> it's<00:00:23.910> pretty<00:00:24.300> overloaded<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:26.359> you

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
yeah it's pretty overloaded and you

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.580 
yeah it's pretty overloaded and you
can't<00:00:27.599> really<00:00:27.689> do<00:00:27.840> anything<00:00:28.050> about<00:00:28.199> it<00:00:28.349> right

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
can't really do anything about it right

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.439 
can't really do anything about it right
now<00:00:28.619> there's<00:00:29.070> no<00:00:29.310> way<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.000> can<00:00:30.179> really

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
now there's no way that you can really

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.340 
now there's no way that you can really
avoid<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:32.120> this<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.510> not<00:00:33.750> all<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.140> them<00:00:34.230> of

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
avoid it so this is not all of them of

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.500 
avoid it so this is not all of them of
course<00:00:34.380> because<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:34.920> took<00:00:35.160> me<00:00:35.370> about<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.360> half

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
course because it took me about a half

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.590 
course because it took me about a half
an<00:00:37.140> hour<00:00:37.290> actually<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.460> lot<00:00:39.030> more<00:00:39.329> than<00:00:39.480> that

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
way too long what I did is I dashed in a

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.550 
way too long what I did is I dashed in a
couple<00:02:43.680> times<00:02:43.860> I<00:02:44.130> loaded<00:02:44.490> up<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.850> story<00:02:45.180> and

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
couple times I loaded up the story and

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.180 
couple times I loaded up the story and
once<00:02:46.560> I<00:02:46.680> loaded<00:02:46.950> up<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.250> story<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:48.830> selected<00:02:49.830> the

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
once I loaded up a story I selected the

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.140 
once I loaded up a story I selected the
place<00:02:50.820> solo<00:02:51.330> I<00:02:52.550> figured<00:02:53.550> that<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:53.940> won't<00:02:54.090> have

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
place solo I figured that you won't have

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.330 
place solo I figured that you won't have
to<00:02:54.300> wait<00:02:54.450> for<00:02:54.630> any<00:02:54.750> players<00:02:55.020> you<00:02:55.950> enough<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.250> do

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
to wait for any players you enough to do

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.860 
to wait for any players you enough to do
anything<00:02:56.580> like<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:57.140> so<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.170> loaded<00:02:58.440> up<00:02:58.650> solo

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
anything like that so I loaded up solo

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.720 
anything like that so I loaded up solo
it<00:03:00.870> didn't<00:03:01.170> work<00:03:01.320> I<00:03:01.590> didn't<00:03:02.190> understand<00:03:02.550> why<00:03:02.700> I

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
it didn't work I didn't understand why I

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.670 
it didn't work I didn't understand why I
just<00:03:02.850> didn't<00:03:03.210> work<00:03:03.330> it<00:03:03.570> got<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.960> both<00:03:04.410> the

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
just didn't work it got to both the

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.140 
just didn't work it got to both the
screens<00:03:04.950> actually<00:03:05.160> when<00:03:05.520> the<00:03:05.580> guy<00:03:05.730> pulls<00:03:06.000> up

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
screens actually when the guy pulls up

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.530 
screens actually when the guy pulls up
after<00:03:06.740> but<00:03:07.740> for<00:03:08.550> some<00:03:08.730> reason<00:03:09.090> it<00:03:09.180> just<00:03:09.390> said

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
after but for some reason it just said

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.200 
after but for some reason it just said
no<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:10.710> so<00:03:10.740> I<00:03:10.980> dashed<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:11.490> of<00:03:11.640> course

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
no and so I dashed it of course

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.500 
no and so I dashed it of course
and<00:03:12.900> after<00:03:13.530> I<00:03:13.560> dashed<00:03:13.830> it<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.280> loaded<00:03:15.030> back<00:03:15.300> up

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
so it comes up right when I'm done but

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.280 
so it comes up right when I'm done but
it<00:03:51.120> comes<00:03:51.300> up<00:03:51.480> with<00:03:51.570> a<00:03:51.600> screen<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:51.930> customize

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
it comes up with a screen you customize

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.540 
it comes up with a screen you customize
your<00:03:52.320> car<00:03:52.590> first<00:03:52.920> of<00:03:53.010> all<00:03:53.100> it<00:03:53.160> don't<00:03:53.310> pick<00:03:53.430> the

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
your car first of all it don't pick the

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.370 
your car first of all it don't pick the
last<00:03:53.700> car<00:03:53.970> because<00:03:54.150> absolutely<00:03:54.630> sucks<00:03:55.050> in<00:03:55.260> my

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
last car because absolutely sucks in my

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.460 
last car because absolutely sucks in my
opinion<00:03:55.830> so<00:03:56.580> you<00:03:56.640> do<00:03:56.850> that<00:03:57.090> and<00:04:00.230> you<00:04:01.230> pick<00:04:01.440> a

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
opinion so you do that and you pick a

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.500 
opinion so you do that and you pick a
car<00:04:01.740> you<00:04:01.950> can<00:04:02.130> put<00:04:02.700> a<00:04:02.730> color<00:04:03.000> you<00:04:03.150> can<00:04:03.300> put<00:04:03.480> a

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
car you can put a color you can put a

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.140 
car you can put a color you can put a
thing<00:04:04.290> if<00:04:04.410> you<00:04:04.500> win<00:04:04.740> I<00:04:05.010> did<00:04:05.340> not<00:04:05.490> win<00:04:05.730> because<00:04:05.940> I

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
thing if you win I did not win because I

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.030 
thing if you win I did not win because I
kind<00:04:06.690> of<00:04:06.750> drove<00:04:06.959> off<00:04:07.110> the<00:04:07.230> track<00:04:07.470> because<00:04:07.830> it's

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
kind of drove off the track because it's

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.920 
kind of drove off the track because it's
a<00:04:08.160> shitty<00:04:08.550> car<00:04:08.850> and<00:04:11.270> it<00:04:12.270> doesn't<00:04:12.570> matter<00:04:12.690> if

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930
