00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
style the most which would look like

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.529 
style the most which would look like
this<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:53.010> has<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.250> two<00:00:53.579> pucks<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.180> fingers

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
this it has the two pucks on the fingers

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.660 
this it has the two pucks on the fingers
you're<00:00:54.870> able<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> move<00:00:55.289> these<00:00:55.440> around<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:56.100> hand

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
you're able to move these around a hand

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.279 
you're able to move these around a hand
 you<00:00:57.210> can<00:00:57.360> put<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> wrist<00:00:57.809> puck<00:00:58.020> if<00:00:58.199> you

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
 you can put a wrist puck if you

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.639 
 you can put a wrist puck if you
would<00:00:58.440> like<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.949> didn't<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.690> thumb<00:01:00.930> buck<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
would like I didn't and a thumb buck the

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.959 
would like I didn't and a thumb buck the
thumb<00:01:01.859> puck<00:01:02.070> doesn't<00:01:02.430> have<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:02.789> big

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
thumb puck doesn't have to be big

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.520 
thumb puck doesn't have to be big
because<00:01:03.210> really<00:01:03.570> you<00:01:03.719> just<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:03.960> one<00:01:04.260> contact

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
because really you just have one contact

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.060 
because really you just have one contact
point<00:01:05.070> which<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.880> near<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.570> side<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:07.140> your<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
point which is near the side of your the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:16.700 
point which is near the side of your the
outside<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.549> your<00:01:08.640> finger<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:16.200> then<00:01:16.380> cut<00:01:16.680> out

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
outside of your finger you then cut out

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.880 
outside of your finger you then cut out
cut<00:01:17.580> out<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.939> pox<00:01:18.240> with<00:01:18.509> either<00:01:18.659> jigsaw<00:01:19.650> or<00:01:19.680> a

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
cut out the pox with either jigsaw or a

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.280 
cut out the pox with either jigsaw or a
handsaw<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.610> used<00:01:21.150> two<00:01:21.240> jigsaw<00:01:21.689> because<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.020> have

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
handsaw I used two jigsaw because I have

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.109 
handsaw I used two jigsaw because I have
one<00:01:22.530> here<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.920> lot<00:01:23.070> faster<00:01:23.280> than<00:01:23.610> handsaw

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
one here it's a lot faster than handsaw

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.730 
one here it's a lot faster than handsaw
but<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> results<00:01:25.140> are<00:01:25.229> about<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.530> same

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
but the results are about the same

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.520 
but the results are about the same
coming<00:01:26.729> up<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.030> is<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> tricky<00:01:27.570> part<00:01:27.869> lots<00:01:28.380> of

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
coming up this is a tricky part lots of

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.319 
coming up this is a tricky part lots of
people<00:01:28.710> say<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.100> hot<00:01:29.369> glue<00:01:29.549> gun<00:01:29.640> doesn't<00:01:30.060> work

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
people say a hot glue gun doesn't work

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.330 
people say a hot glue gun doesn't work
because<00:01:30.540> after<00:01:31.200> they<00:01:31.320> glue<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.740> pox<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:32.159> they

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
because after they glue the pox on they

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.460 
because after they glue the pox on they
don't<00:01:32.430> stay<00:01:32.790> stuck<00:01:33.090> that's<00:01:34.020> because<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
don't stay stuck that's because the

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.960 
don't stay stuck that's because the
whole<00:01:34.650> purpose<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.250> cutting<00:01:35.549> board<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:35.909> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
whole purpose of a cutting board just to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.969 
whole purpose of a cutting board just to
prepare<00:01:36.180> food<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> board<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.619> designed

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
prepare food on so the board is designed

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.340 
prepare food on so the board is designed
to<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.220> nonstick<00:01:38.810> but<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.930> way<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.110> bypass

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
to be nonstick but the way to bypass

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.440 
to be nonstick but the way to bypass
this<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.100> take<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.610> knife<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.119> just

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
this is to take the knife and just

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.819 
this is to take the knife and just
scratch<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:43.020> side<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.380> puck<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.770> you

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
scratch the side of the puck that you

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.380 
scratch the side of the puck that you
want<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.040> glue<00:01:44.340> until<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.090> looks<00:01:45.270> pretty

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
want to glue until it looks pretty

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.960 
want to glue until it looks pretty
mangled<00:01:45.890> this<00:01:46.890> will<00:01:47.130> give<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.640> glue

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
mangled this will give the glue

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.850 
mangled this will give the glue
something<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.479> bond<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.140> they<00:01:49.380> will<00:01:49.590> not

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
something to bond to and they will not

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.270 
something to bond to and they will not
come<00:01:50.159> off<00:01:50.250> your<00:01:50.490> fall<00:01:50.759> off<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.619> cover<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
come off your fall off so you cover the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.429 
come off your fall off so you cover the
first<00:01:53.759> hot<00:01:54.090> glue<00:01:54.360> stick<00:01:55.110> your<00:01:55.229> hand

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
first hot glue stick your hand

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.550 
first hot glue stick your hand
into<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.740> glove<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.540> you<00:01:57.540> push<00:01:57.780> down<00:01:57.810> your

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
into the glove and you push down your

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.780 
into the glove and you push down your
gloves<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.070> top<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.729> glue<00:01:59.939> cover<00:02:00.180> pucks<00:02:00.540> I

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
gloves on top of the glue cover pucks I

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.550 
gloves on top of the glue cover pucks I
recommend<00:02:02.790> doing<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.090> one<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.509> time<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:04.200> it's

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
recommend doing this one in time so it's

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.089 
recommend doing this one in time so it's
most<00:02:04.770> accurate<00:02:05.310> oh<00:02:06.409> it<00:02:07.409> will<00:02:07.530> hurt<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.890> bit<00:02:08.039> but

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
most accurate oh it will hurt a bit but

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.249 
most accurate oh it will hurt a bit but
it's<00:02:08.399> definitely<00:02:08.580> worth<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.360> end<00:02:09.420> just

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
it's definitely worth it in the end just

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.080 
it's definitely worth it in the end just
continue<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.770> process<00:02:11.039> until<00:02:11.310> all<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.879> pox

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
continue this process until all the pox

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.770 
continue this process until all the pox
to<00:02:12.270> glue<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.510> onto<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.840> gloves

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
to glue it onto the gloves

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.300 
to glue it onto the gloves
recommend<00:02:14.260> leaving<00:02:14.440> them<00:02:14.680> to<00:02:14.830> cool<00:02:15.010> for<00:02:15.250> about

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
recommend leaving them to cool for about

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.640 
recommend leaving them to cool for about
15<00:02:15.880> minutes<00:02:16.090> before<00:02:16.209> using<00:02:16.720> them<00:02:16.959> so<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.440> glue

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
15 minutes before using them so the glue

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.559 
15 minutes before using them so the glue
