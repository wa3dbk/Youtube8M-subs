really just have to don't have to worry
about<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.859> catching<00:01:02.640> edges<00:01:02.940> or<00:01:03.059> things<00:01:03.270> like

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
about the catching edges or things like

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.789 
about the catching edges or things like
that<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.690> cool<00:01:03.840> thing<00:01:04.019> about<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.320> deck<00:01:04.559> it's

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
that the cool thing about this deck it's

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.000 
that the cool thing about this deck it's
what<00:01:05.610> they<00:01:05.700> call<00:01:05.729> rail<00:01:06.150> ready<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.380> what

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
what they call rail ready and so what

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.280 
what they call rail ready and so what
that<00:01:08.040> means<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.670> edges<00:01:08.970> are<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.810> know<00:01:09.900> set

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
that means is the edges are you know set

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.359 
that means is the edges are you know set
up<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.650> they're<00:01:10.890> not<00:01:10.979> going<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.220> catch

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
up so that they're not going to catch

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.460 
up so that they're not going to catch
nearly<00:01:11.790> as<00:01:11.880> much<00:01:12.030> also<00:01:12.840> another<00:01:13.020> thing<00:01:13.140> that

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
nearly as much also another thing that

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.480 
nearly as much also another thing that
they're<00:01:13.590> having<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.070> one<00:01:14.189> of<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.340> only

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
they're having this is one of the only

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.179 
they're having this is one of the only
Burton<00:01:15.119> decks<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.450> does<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:16.710> doesn't<00:01:16.950> have

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
Burton decks it does it it doesn't have

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.280 
Burton decks it does it it doesn't have
a<00:01:17.220> fully<00:01:17.520> wrapped<00:01:17.820> edge<00:01:18.479> on<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.930> metal<00:01:19.080> edge

a fully wrapped edge on the metal edge

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.679 
a fully wrapped edge on the metal edge
so<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.560> nose<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.580> tail<00:01:20.700> here<00:01:21.000> there's<00:01:21.450> no

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
so the nose and tail here there's no

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.810 
so the nose and tail here there's no
metal<00:01:22.380> edging<00:01:22.770> around<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.100> side<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.700> it

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
metal edging around the side so that it

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.580 
metal edging around the side so that it
if<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.240> run<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.540> into<00:01:24.750> something<00:01:24.990> it's<00:01:25.500> not
