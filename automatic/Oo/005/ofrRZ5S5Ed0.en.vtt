always a lot more complicated than you
can<00:01:30.240> possibly<00:01:30.420> imagine<00:01:30.780> we've<00:01:31.590> got<00:01:31.799> much<00:01:32.040> up

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
can possibly imagine we've got much up

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
and he's just trying to figure so

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.640 
and he's just trying to figure so
diamond<00:01:35.970> formation<00:01:36.330> that<00:01:37.110> will<00:01:37.290> help<00:01:37.440> us<00:01:37.619> to

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
diamond formation that will help us to

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.499 
diamond formation that will help us to
get<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.340> right<00:01:38.490> full<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:38.850> shape<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.479> our

we've god there's this fantastic range

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.120 
we've god there's this fantastic range
of<00:02:52.420> a<00:02:52.510> sports<00:02:52.780> supercharged<00:02:53.319> and<00:02:53.620> the

of a sports supercharged and the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
infiniti fx50 that you see back there

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.770 
infiniti fx50 that you see back there
now<00:02:57.040> on<00:02:57.220> paper<00:02:57.550> they're<00:02:58.030> pretty<00:02:58.270> close<00:02:58.450> this

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
now on paper they're pretty close this

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.080 
now on paper they're pretty close this
is<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:58.930> 5-liter<00:02:59.530> obviously<00:03:00.340> supercharged<00:03:00.880> and

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
is a 5-liter obviously supercharged and

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.220 
is a 5-liter obviously supercharged and
that's<00:03:01.569> a<00:03:01.660> 5-liter<00:03:02.080> as<00:03:02.260> well<00:03:02.440> both<00:03:03.010> of<00:03:03.190> v8<00:03:04.230> 390

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
that's a 5-liter as well both of v8 390

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.600 
that's a 5-liter as well both of v8 390
horsepower<00:03:05.430> versus<00:03:07.260> 510<00:03:08.260> horsepower<00:03:08.610> then

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
horsepower versus 510 horsepower then

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.640 
horsepower versus 510 horsepower then
and<00:03:09.850> also<00:03:10.090> about<00:03:10.180> 461<00:03:11.019> pounds<00:03:11.260> for<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.440> tour

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
and also about 461 pounds for the tour

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.170 
and also about 461 pounds for the tour
now<00:03:12.069> you<00:03:12.130> would<00:03:12.370> think<00:03:12.400> that<00:03:12.610> would<00:03:12.819> make<00:03:13.000> this

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
now you would think that would make this

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.059 
now you would think that would make this
a<00:03:13.450> lot<00:03:13.510> quicker<00:03:13.840> than<00:03:14.050> that<00:03:14.260> actually<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:15.040> is

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
a lot quicker than that actually that is

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.059 
a lot quicker than that actually that is
slightly<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:16.000> smaller<00:03:16.300> and<00:03:16.630> lighter<00:03:17.050> car<00:03:17.470> so

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
slightly the smaller and lighter car so

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.979 
slightly the smaller and lighter car so
it's<00:03:18.190> actually<00:03:18.280> 0<00:03:18.580> to<00:03:18.640> 100<00:03:18.940> about<00:03:19.090> 6.2<00:03:19.780> for

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
it's actually 0 to 100 about 6.2 for

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.960 
it's actually 0 to 100 about 6.2 for
this<00:03:20.110> around<00:03:20.410> six<00:03:20.680> seconds<00:03:21.069> versus<00:03:21.760> about

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
this around six seconds versus about

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.240 
this around six seconds versus about
what<00:03:22.150> we've<00:03:22.269> got<00:03:22.390> to<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.569> other<00:03:22.690> one<00:03:22.840> about

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
what we've got to the other one about

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.850 
what we've got to the other one about
5.6<00:03:24.250> it's<00:03:24.819> a<00:03:24.880> slightly<00:03:25.120> closer<00:03:25.450> met<00:03:25.720> now<00:03:26.440> if

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
5.6 it's a slightly closer met now if

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.350 
5.6 it's a slightly closer met now if
it's<00:03:27.040> just<00:03:27.190> pure<00:03:27.640> speed<00:03:27.910> that<00:03:28.090> you're<00:03:28.239> after

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
it's just pure speed that you're after

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.940 
it's just pure speed that you're after
this<00:03:29.019> is<00:03:29.080> really<00:03:29.350> going<00:03:29.590> to<00:03:29.650> make<00:03:29.799> you<00:03:29.920> think

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
this is really going to make you think

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.940 
this is really going to make you think
because<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:30.819> price<00:03:31.060> of<00:03:31.269> this<00:03:31.680> desirable<00:03:32.680> as

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
because the price of this desirable as

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.100 
because the price of this desirable as
it<00:03:33.069> is<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.430> I<00:03:33.459> would<00:03:33.489> have<00:03:33.760> won<00:03:33.940> today<00:03:34.150> is<00:03:34.269> 115

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
it is and I would have won today is 115

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.530 
it is and I would have won today is 115
thousand<00:03:35.920> dollars<00:03:36.190> plus<00:03:36.459> that<00:03:37.239> one<00:03:37.390> over

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
thousand dollars plus that one over

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:50.040 
thousand dollars plus that one over
there<00:03:37.780> less<00:03:38.680> than<00:03:38.920> 65

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.320 

so<00:03:50.980> Tom<00:03:51.160> what<00:03:51.280> was<00:03:51.460> that<00:03:51.580> all<00:03:51.730> about<00:03:51.760> them<00:03:52.120> I

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
so Tom what was that all about them I

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.120 
so Tom what was that all about them I
was<00:03:52.750> just<00:03:52.930> testing<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.770> off-road

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
was just testing the off-road

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.070 
was just testing the off-road

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.620 
joking aside that's where this car
scores<00:04:03.490> over<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:03.880> other<00:04:04.000> two<00:04:04.210> doesn't<00:04:04.540> it

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
scores over the other two doesn't it

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.240 
scores over the other two doesn't it
because<00:04:04.960> you<00:04:05.260> can<00:04:05.410> actually<00:04:05.440> do<00:04:05.800> that<00:04:05.830> in<00:04:06.130> this

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
because you can actually do that in this

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.890 
because you can actually do that in this
car<00:04:06.460> but<00:04:06.580> with<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.820> others<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.210> mean<00:04:07.660> even<00:04:07.720> the

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
car but with the others I mean even the

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
car but with the others I mean even the
Porsche<00:04:08.140> could<00:04:08.350> do<00:04:08.440> but<00:04:08.560> the<00:04:08.620> bitch<00:04:08.770> of

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
Porsche could do but the bitch of

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.320 
Porsche could do but the bitch of
pressures<00:04:09.250> really<00:04:09.370> isn't<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:09.760> yeah<00:04:10.090> I<00:04:10.120> think

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
pressures really isn't it yeah I think

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.580 
pressures really isn't it yeah I think
this<00:04:10.480> is<00:04:10.540> the<00:04:10.660> only<00:04:10.870> one<00:04:11.080> that<00:04:11.110> would<00:04:11.380> actually

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
this is the only one that would actually

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.500 
this is the only one that would actually
be<00:04:11.830> able<00:04:12.040> to<00:04:12.190> be<00:04:12.340> to<00:04:12.640> do<00:04:12.790> that<00:04:12.970> without<00:04:13.150> you

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
be able to be to do that without you

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.480 
be able to be to do that without you
