00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
there and we're going to start on the

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.150 
there and we're going to start on the
outside<00:00:42.120> under<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.840> eye<00:00:43.079> and<00:00:43.559> you're<00:00:44.010> just

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
outside under the eye and you're just

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.650 
outside under the eye and you're just
going<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.309> push<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.030> give<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.360> little

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
going to push and give it a little

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.010 
going to push and give it a little
wiggle<00:00:46.320> I<00:00:46.969> like<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.120> twist<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.690> little<00:00:48.719> bit

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
wiggle I like to twist it a little bit

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.959 
wiggle I like to twist it a little bit
so<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> colors<00:00:49.620> blend<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.280> then<00:00:50.789> we're<00:00:50.940> just

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
so the colors blend and then we're just

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.430 
so the colors blend and then we're just
going<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.210> keep<00:00:51.390> doing<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:54.079> layering<00:00:55.079> it<00:00:55.410> a

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
going to keep doing that layering it a

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.410 
going to keep doing that layering it a
little<00:00:55.800> bit<00:00:55.980> over<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.489> other<00:00:56.670> one<00:00:56.969> and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
little bit over the other one and

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.720 
little bit over the other one and
remember<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:58.020> give<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.320> little<00:00:58.469> wiggle<00:00:58.730> so

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
remember to give it a little wiggle so

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.860 
remember to give it a little wiggle so
it<00:00:59.879> blends<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:01.670> just<00:01:02.670> reload<00:01:03.120> as<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.629> need

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
it blends and just reload as you need

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.630 
it blends and just reload as you need
but<00:01:04.199> make<00:01:04.710> sure<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.129> match<00:01:05.369> up<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
but make sure that you match up the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.750 
but make sure that you match up the
colors<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.450> sponge<00:01:07.130> to<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> colors<00:01:08.580> in

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
colors on the sponge to the colors in

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:19.310 
colors on the sponge to the colors in
the<00:01:08.909> cake<00:01:12.560> spray<00:01:13.880> reload<00:01:17.659> push<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.930> wiggle

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
the cake spray reload push and wiggle

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.940 
the cake spray reload push and wiggle
now<00:01:20.250> we're<00:01:20.400> going<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.549> go<00:01:20.729> up<00:01:20.970> over<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:22.290> nose

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.539 

like<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:27.530> so<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.650> looks<00:01:28.680> like<00:01:28.950> it's<00:01:29.220> crawling

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
like this so it looks like it's crawling

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:39.950 
like this so it looks like it's crawling
up<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:30.210> little<00:01:30.390> bit<00:01:32.210> there<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.390> go<00:01:37.909> and<00:01:38.960> then

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
up a little bit there you go and then

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.389 
up a little bit there you go and then
remember<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.439> overlap<00:01:41.100> them<00:01:43.250> coming<00:01:44.250> back

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
remember to overlap them coming back

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.100 
remember to overlap them coming back
down<00:01:44.670> to

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.300 

I<00:01:50.430> think<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.549> nose<00:01:51.729> is<00:01:51.939> the<00:01:52.060> hardest<00:01:52.390> part

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.499 

this<00:01:57.310> one's<00:01:57.490> good<00:01:57.670> for<00:01:57.850> girls<00:01:58.119> and<00:01:58.330> boys

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
this one's good for girls and boys

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:00.899 
this one's good for girls and boys
obviously<00:01:58.990> don't<00:01:59.830> do<00:02:00.040> the<00:02:00.189> lips<00:02:00.399> on<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.729> boys

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
obviously don't do the lips on the boys

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:10.440 
obviously don't do the lips on the boys
push<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:02.049> wiggle<00:02:09.090> remember<00:02:10.090> give<00:02:10.269> it<00:02:10.360> a

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
push and wiggle remember give it a

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:24.809 
push and wiggle remember give it a
little<00:02:10.660> twist

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:37.260 

bring<00:02:25.819> the<00:02:25.940> body<00:02:26.090> up<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.660> side

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.090 

and<00:02:37.360> then<00:02:38.020> we're<00:02:38.290> going<00:02:38.380> to<00:02:38.440> switch<00:02:38.710> to<00:02:38.740> the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
and then we're going to switch to the

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.890 
and then we're going to switch to the
larger<00:02:39.670> one<00:02:39.850> for<00:02:40.090> his<00:02:40.240> head<00:02:42.450> now<00:02:43.450> this<00:02:43.630> one<00:02:43.810> is

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
larger one for his head now this one is

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.900 
larger one for his head now this one is
a<00:02:43.930> little<00:02:44.170> bigger<00:02:44.380> so<00:02:44.740> I'm<00:02:45.220> going<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.400> squeeze

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
a little bigger so I'm going to squeeze

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.050 
a little bigger so I'm going to squeeze
it<00:02:46.180> and<00:02:46.710> load<00:02:47.710> it<00:02:47.890> back<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.220> forth<00:02:48.460> like<00:02:48.640> that

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.070 

and<00:02:52.560> then<00:02:54.090> remember<00:02:55.090> keeping<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.540> darker<00:02:55.930> on

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
and then remember keeping the darker on

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.000 
and then remember keeping the darker on
the<00:02:56.110> bottom<00:02:56.650> for<00:02:56.890> a<00:02:56.950> little<00:02:57.160> bit<00:02:57.250> of<00:02:57.370> shadow

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.560 

and<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:03.130> can<00:03:03.280> use<00:03:03.430> smaller<00:03:03.730> ones<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.210> make<00:03:04.450> it

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
and you can use smaller ones to make it

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.910 
and you can use smaller ones to make it
a<00:03:04.630> little<00:03:04.810> bit<00:03:04.930> smaller<00:03:05.640> there<00:03:06.640> we<00:03:06.730> go<00:03:07.860> now<00:03:08.860> I'm

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
a little bit smaller there we go now I'm

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.400 
a little bit smaller there we go now I'm
going<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.160> load<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.640> number<00:03:10.060> three<00:03:10.660> lo<00:03:10.990> Cornell

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
going to load a number three lo Cornell

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.370 
going to load a number three lo Cornell
with<00:03:11.680> some<00:03:11.830> black<00:03:12.930> we're<00:03:13.930> just<00:03:14.080> going<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.260> make

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
with some black we're just going to make
