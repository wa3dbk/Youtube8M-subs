and then a little bit chord we're just

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.370 
and then a little bit chord we're just
gonna<00:01:51.700> be<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.600> first<00:01:52.780> finger<00:01:52.990> playing<00:01:53.260> the

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
gonna be the first finger playing the

pinky playing the fourth fret of the B

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.850 
pinky playing the fourth fret of the B
string<00:02:00.510> so<00:02:01.510> you<00:02:01.570> can<00:02:01.690> almost<00:02:01.960> break<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.590> first

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
string so you can almost break the first

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.530 
string so you can almost break the first
part<00:02:03.250> of<00:02:03.310> into<00:02:03.490> these<00:02:03.610> little<00:02:03.910> three<00:02:04.240> note

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
part of into these little three note

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:13.710 
part of into these little three note
groups<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:12.370> that's<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.730> next<00:02:12.970> one<00:02:13.120> we're

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
groups so that's the next one we're

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.970 
groups so that's the next one we're
gonna<00:02:13.780> be<00:02:13.900> playing<00:02:14.020> that<00:02:14.170> openness<00:02:14.680> from<00:02:14.860> the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
gonna be playing that openness from the

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.890 
gonna be playing that openness from the
end<00:02:15.190> almost<00:02:15.610> reversing<00:02:16.300> that<00:02:16.420> pattern<00:02:16.780> we

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
end almost reversing that pattern we

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.950 
end almost reversing that pattern we
just<00:02:17.110> did<00:02:18.360> open<00:02:19.360> a<00:02:19.510> open<00:02:19.780> high<00:02:20.350> D<00:02:20.550> middle<00:02:21.550> and

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
just did open a open high D middle and

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.240 
just did open a open high D middle and
then<00:02:22.960> index<00:02:23.230> plays<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.680> second<00:02:23.950> fret<00:02:24.130> of<00:02:24.220> the

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
then index plays the second fret of the

then index plays the second fret of the
high<00:02:24.310> E<00:02:25.290> but<00:02:26.290> instead<00:02:26.530> of<00:02:26.590> going<00:02:26.770> to<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:26.890> beat

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
high E but instead of going to the beat

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.160 
high E but instead of going to the beat
we're<00:02:27.250> going<00:02:27.370> to<00:02:27.430> go<00:02:27.490> to<00:02:27.550> a<00:02:27.730> G<00:02:28.060> chord

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
we're going to go to a G chord

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.510 
we're going to go to a G chord
and<00:02:30.350> once<00:02:30.680> it<00:02:30.800> ended<00:02:31.040> using<00:02:31.280> my<00:02:31.340> middle

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
and once it ended using my middle
