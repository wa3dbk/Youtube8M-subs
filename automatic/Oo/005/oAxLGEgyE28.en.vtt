00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
the first mistake people make is they

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.240 
the first mistake people make is they
keep<00:00:23.670> their<00:00:23.939> standing<00:00:24.570> foot<00:00:24.869> straight<00:00:25.740> they

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
keep their standing foot straight they

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.009 
keep their standing foot straight they
keep<00:00:26.460> their<00:00:26.640> toe<00:00:26.880> points<00:00:27.269> straight<00:00:27.570> forward

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
keep their toe points straight forward

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.050 
keep their toe points straight forward
you<00:00:28.199> can't<00:00:28.800> point<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.279> straight<00:00:29.550> forward<00:00:29.789> you

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
you can't point it straight forward you

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.999 
you can't point it straight forward you
have<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.330> point<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:30.929> side<00:00:31.289> like<00:00:31.980> that

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
have to point it to the side like that

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.700 
have to point it to the side like that
so<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.759> should<00:00:32.910> be<00:00:32.940> parallel<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.350> side<00:00:34.590> of

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
so it should be parallel to the side of

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.970 
so it should be parallel to the side of
your<00:00:34.800> body<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.540> that<00:00:36.540> way<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.840> have<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.620> bigger

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
your body and that way you have a bigger

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.030 
your body and that way you have a bigger
surface<00:00:38.250> area<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:39.390> slap<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.960> ball<00:00:40.079> up<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.950> you

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
surface area to slap the ball up so you

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.610 
surface area to slap the ball up so you
need<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.399> stand<00:00:41.820> sideways<00:00:42.210> like<00:00:42.690> this<00:00:42.750> you're

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
ball is literally almost scraping the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.620

ground<00:01:03.780> okay<00:01:04.500> way<00:01:04.830> down<00:01:05.040> there<00:01:05.299> that's<00:01:06.299> what

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
ground okay way down there that's what

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.179 
ground okay way down there that's what
you<00:01:06.720> have<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.900> do<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.229> get<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.470> maximum<00:01:07.950> height

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
you have to do to get the maximum height

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.750 
you have to do to get the maximum height
and<00:01:08.220> control<00:01:08.880> on<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.240> ball<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:10.760> you're

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
and control on the ball so you're

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.000 
and control on the ball so you're
planted<00:01:12.240> foot<00:01:12.420> needs<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.110> follow<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.830> ball

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
planted foot needs to follow the ball

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.310 
planted foot needs to follow the ball
that's<00:01:14.369> how<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.820> do<00:01:14.970> more<00:01:15.240> than<00:01:15.299> one<00:01:15.689> so

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
that's how you can do more than one so

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.620 
that's how you can do more than one so
wherever<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.979> ball<00:01:17.159> goes<00:01:17.430> you're<00:01:17.880> planted

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
wherever the ball goes you're planted

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.780 
wherever the ball goes you're planted
foot<00:01:18.869> just<00:01:19.350> follows<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.040> for<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.369> next<00:01:20.549> one

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
foot just follows it for the next one

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.410 
foot just follows it for the next one
like<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.930> tried<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.290> exaggerate<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:23.040> lot<00:01:23.250> of

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
like this I tried to exaggerate a lot of

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.550 
like this I tried to exaggerate a lot of
movements<00:01:24.420> so<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.600> can<00:01:24.810> see<00:01:24.990> look<00:01:25.380> I'm
