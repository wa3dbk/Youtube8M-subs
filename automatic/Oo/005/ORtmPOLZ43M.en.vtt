00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 hello to all and smells today 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.780
 following several requests on twitter 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.799
 I will tell you about the new Samsung 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.420
 galaxy s 5 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.130
 presented at the mobile world congress of 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.360
 barcelona so before you start if that 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.010
 been doing some time as you follow my 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.780
 videos you know I'm not a 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.889
 big fan of samsung but unlike 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.940
 to that many people can come 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.240
 especially in the comments of my 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.130
 videos 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.109
 yes I love apple I'm really a fan 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.220
 apple products I say but 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.670
 it is not for all that I renounce the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.080
 other brands 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.660
 I love what htc or nokia 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.760
 there I speak in any case of telephony and 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.779
 when apple has flaws and he has some 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.910
 say it but samsung 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.769
 really I hate already including his 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.640
 products that I do not like these products 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.540
 in any case they want telephony 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.980
 you can see that I have a TV 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.969
 samsung I am very happy but I 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.500
 does not like his products and his 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.790
 phones the samsung phones and 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.960
 especially in his politics his way 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.040
 to initiate lawsuits that are often 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.690
 against apple but also against others 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.129
 marks he also loses very 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.500
 often samsung lost a lot 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.719
 of money because of these lawsuits but 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.940
 also in his apple addiction even though 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.070
 the firm for a little bit of an air of 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.239
 is rebels enic the apple 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.140
 if you pay attention or not 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.789
 because it's clearly 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.739
 visible in every pub of the range 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.760
 galaxy there is an iphone and there is a 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.219
 reason for that which is not elsewhere 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.960
 a bad reason in fact 5 his will 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.700
 leave all his communication thanks to 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.439
 apple is by leaning in opposing 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.000
 to the telephony giant that we become 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.200
 telephony is by talking 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.970
 of her from her phones thanks to 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.200
 many lawsuits and at the pub those missing 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.000
 clearly from apple and especially from 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.110
 the iphone that sam king did talk 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.340
 of them and it does not stop there since 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.590
 the numbers continue to rise 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.240
 michael gregorio said when we found 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.100
 the good thing is that we dig next 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.400
 when we found the right apple tree 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.360
 accounts pick next to other strong point 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.860
 of this strategy 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.939
 you have certainly noticed that on 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.390
 the very social networks of your 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.159
 entourage 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.780
 there is a samsung war against apple 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.250
 a telephone war and that's it 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.600
 chance it was not always like that 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.680
 it's the peak we see every month see 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.750
 every week in our site 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.759
 news favorite samsung attack 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.720
 apple samsung makes fun of the iphone and 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.610
 somewhere we can not help it 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.329
 it's not very smart it's like 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.740
 the war of the consoles 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.939
 there are those who defend their products 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.229
 like their kids with swords and 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.520
 shields which brings real 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.380
 arguments and those who remain neutral 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.119
 do not ruin how you do it 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.649
 personally as technophiles 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.850
 undisputed fans of apple and especially 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.990
 when I hear the nonsense that 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.729
 can hear on apple 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.170
 I can not help but bring my 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.430
 point of view to give my arguments on 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.079
 hear a lot of criticism about 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.820
 apple put this price in a phone 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.450
 they copied everything on android on 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.770
 samsung 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.240
 it was better with steve jobs 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.380
 seriously guys then 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.520
 firstly you have to know that one too 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.770
 big transnational brand like 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.000
 apple at 5 or even 10 ahead of the 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.290
 products that she will present and therefore 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.690
 it was better with steve jobs 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.430
 I think that appeals like everything that creates 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.050
 the buzz is simply a victim of 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.510
 its wave popularity that's why when 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.830
 a group an artist a brand becomes 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.900
 popular for many people 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.670
 it was better before maybe to say 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.200
 I am not fashionable in a little 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.670
 rebel you are all sheep or 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.690
 maybe to brag about me 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.160
 knew well before it became 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.330
 known you are besides samsung is in 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.890
 going back into this popularity 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.630
 which somewhere is negative since 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.400
 many android users 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.780
 it is said that samsung disappoints them before 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.860
 start talking about the galaxy and May 5 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.690
 but let it be known that this is not a 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.880
 revolution it's more an evolution by 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.870
 report to his predecessor the s4 that's 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.220
 by the way to avoid this kind of 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.240
 misunderstandings that apple created the four 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.560
 aces 5s etc 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.120
 yes you will see there is going to be a 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.630
 number of apple comparison in 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.920
 this video 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.150
 just now I was reading that samsung is 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.140
 laugh a lot of the iphone but we will 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.850
 see that for these galaxies 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.260
 they are inspired a lot firstly 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.220
 at the level of colors as I do you 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.900
 had spoken in my chronicle 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.030
 presenting the iphone 5 pieces apple 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.010
 presented the colors black white and gold 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.680
 with this new product samsung presents 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.970
 the colors black white gold and blue when 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.620
 even we must not push the cap too much 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.240
 far to Mauritius for that matter 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.620
 regards the color gold I'm not even 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.120
 sure that such jeans and say people 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.590
 since we're on the back shell we're going 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.000
 just go back and get 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.040
 remember that samsung make fun of the 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.570
 iPhone 5 case that was found 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.130
 only this shell is optional 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.570
 whereas here it is the initial hull of the 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.770
 phone that has a lot of little holes 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.030
 do not worry the netizens get 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.650
 have already seized the sphere in 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.070
 comparing the gold version a pieces of 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.510
 plaster 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.100
 as for the finish found 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.720
 the usual plastic at samsung 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.190
 finally the polycarbonate on their eggs 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.720
 it's the same feeling it's just that 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.860
 it's classier in the mouth but they 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.180
 have added a touch of 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.840
 imitation leather which is still more 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.740
 pleasant 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.360
 strong point of this hull she is 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.440
 resistant to dust and water 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.760
 falls well since they have 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.960
 still a little bit increased the size 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.730
 of the screen we will soon be able to 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.590
 serve as boats increase of 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.180
 the screen towards a diagonal of 5.1 inches 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.010
 which gives a weight of 145 g more 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.720
 heavy that the cats of 15 g the screen remains 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.530
 the same always very contrasted which 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.940
 gives the impression of 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:01.290
 better photos than the iphone example 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.550
 randomly against the inside of the 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.960
 phone has been improved with a 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.320
 new more powerful processor more 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.700
 quick 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.930
 good I tease a little samsung on the 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.340
 photo but it's really the big point 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.810
 strong of this galaxy s 5 and have it 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.130
 clearly announced they have tremendously 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.290
 worked on the photo the sensor 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.610
 backward change from 13 to 16 megapixels to 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.810
 note though that mega pixels 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.980
 are not a guarantee of quality 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.479
 but what makes all the strength of this 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:20.549
 sensor is the speed of autofocus 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.780
 ie flat management of the area of 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.610
 sharpness and blur area 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.230
 which takes place in 03 seconds according to the 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.820
 constructor for the video camera no 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.800
 change we stay on 2 megapixels 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.600
 it remains correct for a video camera 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.520
 another good idea from samsung 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.260
 Ultra power saving mode that covers 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.850
 the entire collections reduces the 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.169
 brightness and even passes the phone in 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.010
 black and white mode to push the 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.540
 battery in his last 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.040
 entrenchments the firm could have by 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.389
 against calming a little bit about the name 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.340
 we're not in a michael bay movie 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.470
 ultra power saving mode 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.120
 attention big novelty a sensor 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.570
 fingerprint hidden under the 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.190
 home button 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.450
 like it's funny like on the iphone 5 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.290
 is presented four months ago to note 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.000
 that one of the biggest sites of 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.410
 technology called the world a 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.880
 already judged this function as little 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.500
 reliable and given the size 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.970
 monstrous of the phone he is 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.710
 can not use this function at 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.060
 one only on the canvas and 8/10 and 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.280
 like what apple wanted to head for 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.680
 fitness health visibly 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.850
 symptoms outpaced with a 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.830
 heart rate monitor or is finally 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.450
 ultra power saving mode it was not bad 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.220
 how then a heart rate monitor that 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.130
 is that it makes it possible to 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.930
 measure heartbeat 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:20.160
 that's it that's all 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.479
 knowing that the applications allowed 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.680
 already to do it with the flash of 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.790
 phone but it's probably more 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.050
 accurate, then it's true we are 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.550
 not think right away but measured his 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.090
 pulse when playing flapi bird it can 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:28.770
 save lives 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.660
 I could still talk to you about 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.800
 Samsung and its Galaxy S 5 during 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.790
 hours but I'm stopping there 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.410
 do not hesitate to tell me what you 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.970
 think of galaxy s worried of samsung 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.169
 in general in the comments then 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.280
 I know there are some who will moan and 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.120
 it's all to your credit as long as 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.289
 it's constructive 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.910
 it is true that I criticize a lot 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.680
 samsung and its products a school and 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:45.090
 good points I note this is not my 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.289
 fault if he does not know that good at least I 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:47.910
 am honest you have my opinion and 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.169
 I look forward to yours for 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.760
 restart a debate if possible 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.229

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.850

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:57.620
