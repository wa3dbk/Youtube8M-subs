models I think it probably works I've
gotta<00:01:09.970> admit<00:01:10.299> I<00:01:10.360> find<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:10.900> design

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
gotta admit I find the design

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.350 
gotta admit I find the design
evolutionary<00:01:12.250> a<00:01:12.460> lot<00:01:12.909> more<00:01:13.150> than

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
evolutionary a lot more than

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.060 
evolutionary a lot more than
revolutionary<00:01:13.690> but<00:01:14.619> i<00:01:14.680> think<00:01:14.920> it's

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
revolutionary but i think it's

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.310 
revolutionary but i think it's
intriguing<00:01:15.520> if<00:01:15.940> you<00:01:16.270> take<00:01:16.540> it<00:01:16.570> in<00:01:16.780> separate

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
intriguing if you take it in separate

intriguing if you take it in separate
