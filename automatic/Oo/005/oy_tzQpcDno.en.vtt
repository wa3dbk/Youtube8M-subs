tutorial I'm just going to dig straight
down<00:00:38.720> which<00:00:39.500> is<00:00:39.530> of<00:00:39.890> course<00:00:39.920> the<00:00:40.280> one<00:00:40.550> rule<00:00:40.820> in

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
down which is of course the one rule in

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.730 
down which is of course the one rule in
Minecraft<00:00:41.420> you're<00:00:41.960> not<00:00:42.140> allowed<00:00:42.350> to<00:00:42.410> stick

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740 
Minecraft you're not allowed to stick

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.710 
Minecraft you're not allowed to stick
straight<00:00:42.980> down<00:00:43.190> but<00:00:43.850> since<00:00:44.240> we<00:00:44.420> don't<00:00:44.450> have

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:44.720 
straight down but since we don't have

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.870 
straight down but since we don't have
caves<00:00:45.290> and<00:00:45.590> anything<00:00:45.980> we<00:00:46.340> don't<00:00:46.460> have<00:00:46.670> any

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
caves and anything we don't have any

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
danger in microphone kit edition which

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.220 
danger in microphone kit edition which
will<00:00:49.730> probably<00:00:49.970> be<00:00:50.150> changed<00:00:50.660> in<00:00:50.840> open

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.230 
will probably be changed in open

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.380 
will probably be changed in open
nine-point-oh<00:00:51.710> so<00:00:52.520> all<00:00:52.730> we<00:00:52.850> have<00:00:52.880> to<00:00:52.970> do<00:00:53.180> is

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
nine-point-oh so all we have to do is

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.560 
nine-point-oh so all we have to do is
dig<00:00:53.750> straight<00:00:54.110> down<00:00:54.400> all<00:00:55.400> the<00:00:55.730> way<00:00:55.880> to<00:00:56.420> the

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:56.570 
dig straight down all the way to the

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.510 
dig straight down all the way to the
bottom<00:00:56.690> and<00:00:56.990> it's<00:00:57.590> really<00:00:57.860> easy<00:00:58.070> to<00:00:58.220> find

00:00:58.510 --> 00:00:58.520 
bottom and it's really easy to find

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.420 
bottom and it's really easy to find
diamonds<00:00:58.850> if<00:00:59.300> we<00:00:59.690> use<00:00:59.930> the<00:01:00.260> way<00:01:00.500> I<00:01:00.800> am<00:01:00.950> going<00:01:00.980> to

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
diamonds if we use the way I am going to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.710 
diamonds if we use the way I am going to
show<00:01:01.640> you<00:01:01.900> so<00:01:03.220> once<00:01:04.220> we<00:01:04.670> are<00:01:04.909> getting<00:01:05.269> a<00:01:05.570> little

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
show you so once we are getting a little

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.029 
show you so once we are getting a little
bit<00:01:05.960> lower<00:01:08.289> which<00:01:09.289> can<00:01:09.499> of<00:01:09.560> course<00:01:09.740> to<00:01:09.859> take<00:01:09.979> a

00:01:10.029 --> 00:01:10.039 
bit lower which can of course to take a

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:17.770 
bit lower which can of course to take a
while<00:01:15.729> so<00:01:16.729> lets<00:01:16.909> me<00:01:17.179> give<00:01:17.359> you<00:01:17.569> some

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
while so lets me give you some

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.499 
while so lets me give you some
information<00:01:18.549> right<00:01:19.549> now<00:01:19.579> about<00:01:19.999> diamonds

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
information right now about diamonds

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.899 
information right now about diamonds
diamonds<00:01:21.079> of<00:01:21.170> course<00:01:21.380> found<00:01:21.740> a<00:01:21.950> really<00:01:22.069> low<00:01:22.310> on

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
diamonds of course found a really low on

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.679 
diamonds of course found a really low on
the<00:01:23.450> ground<00:01:23.689> so<00:01:23.929> and<00:01:24.170> they<00:01:24.889> are<00:01:25.189> also<00:01:25.520> I<00:01:26.329> think

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
the ground so and they are also I think

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.569 
the ground so and they are also I think
they're<00:01:27.109> the<00:01:27.380> highest<00:01:27.530> amount<00:01:28.039> they<00:01:28.310> are<00:01:28.429> able

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
they're the highest amount they are able

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.389 
they're the highest amount they are able
to<00:01:28.850> spawn<00:01:29.090> in<00:01:29.299> as<00:01:29.479> in<00:01:29.659> nine<00:01:29.960> so<00:01:30.560> at<00:01:31.130> some<00:01:31.340> point

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
to spawn in as in nine so at some point

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:34.090 
to spawn in as in nine so at some point
you're<00:01:31.700> coming<00:01:32.119> to<00:01:32.569> this<00:01:32.749> rock<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:33.649> this<00:01:33.859> rock

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
you're coming to this rock and this rock

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.550 
you're coming to this rock and this rock
is<00:01:34.249> indestructible<00:01:34.700> in<00:01:35.299> survival<00:01:36.049> but<00:01:36.289> it<00:01:36.439> is

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
is indestructible in survival but it is

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.599 
is indestructible in survival but it is
in<00:01:36.740> creative<00:01:37.280> so<00:01:38.319> this<00:01:39.319> is<00:01:39.499> the<00:01:39.649> lowest<00:01:39.920> one

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:40.609 
in creative so this is the lowest one

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:42.399 
in creative so this is the lowest one
right<00:01:40.850> here<00:01:41.060> this<00:01:41.329> is<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:41.539> lowest<00:01:41.780> point<00:01:42.229> in

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
right here this is the lowest point in

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.559 
right here this is the lowest point in
the<00:01:42.530> world<00:01:42.770> what<00:01:43.759> do<00:01:43.819> you<00:01:43.850> want<00:01:43.999> to<00:01:44.090> do<00:01:44.209> from

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:44.569 
the world what do you want to do from

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:46.270 
the world what do you want to do from
the<00:01:44.749> bedrock<00:01:45.139> so<00:01:45.560> you<00:01:45.619> have<00:01:45.799> four<00:01:46.039> better

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
the bedrock so you have four better

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.690 
the bedrock so you have four better
pieces<00:01:46.700> one<00:01:47.029> two<00:01:47.569> three<00:01:48.579> four<00:01:50.499> so<00:01:51.499> if<00:01:51.829> we<00:01:51.889> mind

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
pieces one two three four so if we mind

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.559 
pieces one two three four so if we mind
like<00:01:52.939> this<00:01:53.380> we<00:01:54.380> still<00:01:54.799> have<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.130> chance<00:01:55.639> to

00:01:56.559 --> 00:01:56.569 
like this we still have the chance to

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:59.410 
like this we still have the chance to
get<00:01:57.200> a<00:01:57.439> pet<00:01:57.679> rock<00:01:57.859> right<00:01:58.130> here<00:01:58.159> and<00:01:58.520> that's<00:01:59.090> one

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
get a pet rock right here and that's one

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.199 
get a pet rock right here and that's one
block<00:02:00.289> less<00:02:00.709> chance<00:02:01.130> that<00:02:01.369> of<00:02:01.549> it<00:02:01.759> being<00:02:02.029> a

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:02.209 
block less chance that of it being a

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:03.519 
block less chance that of it being a
diamond<00:02:02.539> so<00:02:02.689> that's<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:02.990> little<00:02:03.139> bit<00:02:03.289> and

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:03.529 
diamond so that's a little bit and

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:05.440 
diamond so that's a little bit and
effective<00:02:04.069> of<00:02:04.189> course<00:02:04.399> it's<00:02:04.549> not<00:02:04.759> the<00:02:05.240> worst

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
effective of course it's not the worst

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.510 
effective of course it's not the worst
way<00:02:05.869> to<00:02:05.899> do<00:02:06.109> it<00:02:06.259> but<00:02:06.649> what<00:02:06.829> you<00:02:06.920> want<00:02:07.099> to<00:02:07.159> do<00:02:07.279> is

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
way to do it but what you want to do is

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.490 
way to do it but what you want to do is
force<00:02:08.149> go<00:02:08.420> one<00:02:08.899> one<00:02:09.380> two<00:02:09.619> three<00:02:10.660> four<00:02:11.660> up<00:02:12.050> you

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
force go one one two three four up you

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.230 
force go one one two three four up you
might<00:02:12.650> be<00:02:12.740> thinking<00:02:12.920> why<00:02:13.280> for<00:02:13.580> up<00:02:13.850> because

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
might be thinking why for up because

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.900 
might be thinking why for up because
we're<00:02:15.140> not<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.500> little<00:02:15.710> even<00:02:16.070> if<00:02:16.160> we<00:02:16.280> will<00:02:16.430> whip

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
we're not a little even if we will whip

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.830 
we're not a little even if we will whip

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840

able<00:02:18.319> to<00:02:18.530> touch<00:02:18.950> anything<00:02:19.370> any<00:02:20.120> pet<00:02:20.450> rock<00:02:20.660> but

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
able to touch anything any pet rock but

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.040 
able to touch anything any pet rock but
there<00:02:21.709> would<00:02:21.980> be<00:02:22.010> able<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.970> now<00:02:23.660> we<00:02:23.720> are<00:02:23.870> able

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
there would be able to now we are able

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.320 
there would be able to now we are able
to<00:02:24.200> get<00:02:24.440> bigger<00:02:24.709> patches<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.400> diamonds<00:02:26.030> which

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
to get bigger patches of diamonds which

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.910 
to get bigger patches of diamonds which
are<00:02:26.510> going<00:02:26.959> lower<00:02:27.319> than<00:02:27.709> three<00:02:28.489> blocks<00:02:29.349> so<00:02:30.349> all

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
are going lower than three blocks so all

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.520 
are going lower than three blocks so all
you<00:02:31.069> want<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.340> do<00:02:31.489> now<00:02:31.700> is<00:02:31.940> go<00:02:32.420> ahead<00:02:32.569> and<00:02:32.750> mine

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
you want to do now is go ahead and mine

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.520 
you want to do now is go ahead and mine
in<00:02:33.860> any<00:02:34.099> direction<00:02:34.340> and<00:02:34.970> just<00:02:35.660> mine<00:02:36.200> all<00:02:36.470> the

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
in any direction and just mine all the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.740 
in any direction and just mine all the
way<00:02:36.950> and<00:02:37.220> you<00:02:37.879> will<00:02:38.030> find<00:02:38.480> many<00:02:38.989> many<00:02:39.470> diamonds

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
way and you will find many many diamonds

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.089 
way and you will find many many diamonds
so<00:02:41.750> this<00:02:42.110> is<00:02:42.140> it<00:02:42.379> of<00:02:42.590> course<00:02:42.799> it<00:02:42.950> takes

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
so this is it of course it takes

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.550 
so this is it of course it takes
sometimes<00:02:43.510> finding<00:02:44.510> diamonds<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:45.080> will<00:02:45.319> always

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
sometimes finding diamonds I will always

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.250 
sometimes finding diamonds I will always
will<00:02:46.459> always<00:02:46.879> take<00:02:47.120> time<00:02:47.180> unless<00:02:47.780> you<00:02:48.019> use

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
will always take time unless you use

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.759 
will always take time unless you use
seeds<00:02:48.830> which<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:50.360> know<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:50.930> location<00:02:51.530> of<00:02:51.620> the

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
seeds which you know the location of the

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.059 
seeds which you know the location of the
Diamonds<00:02:52.220> of<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:53.260> we<00:02:54.260> just<00:02:54.440> find<00:02:54.680> some<00:02:54.829> cool

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
Diamonds of so we just find some cool

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.069 
Diamonds of so we just find some cool
right<00:02:55.430> there<00:02:55.640> of<00:02:56.329> course<00:02:56.599> that's<00:02:56.780> not<00:02:56.900> what

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
right there of course that's not what

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.110 
right there of course that's not what
you're<00:02:57.290> looking<00:02:57.319> for<00:02:57.860> but<00:02:58.400> we<00:02:58.610> will<00:02:58.760> be<00:02:58.940> able

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
you're looking for but we will be able

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.449 
you're looking for but we will be able
to<00:02:59.269> find<00:02:59.450> some<00:03:00.079> diamonds<00:03:00.290> I'm<00:03:00.950> not<00:03:01.160> telling

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
to find some diamonds I'm not telling

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.309 
to find some diamonds I'm not telling
you<00:03:01.489> we<00:03:01.940> are<00:03:02.030> going<00:03:02.299> to<00:03:02.390> find<00:03:02.599> diamonds<00:03:02.840> every

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
you we are going to find diamonds every

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.330 
you we are going to find diamonds every
single<00:03:03.680> time<00:03:03.920> but<00:03:05.319> so<00:03:06.319> yeah<00:03:06.560> every<00:03:07.099> single

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
single time but so yeah every single

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.330 
single time but so yeah every single
time<00:03:07.700> you<00:03:07.940> come<00:03:08.750> at<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.110> end<00:03:09.140> of<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:09.799> map<00:03:10.069> you

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
time you come at the end of the map you

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.240 
time you come at the end of the map you
just<00:03:10.700> come<00:03:10.879> back<00:03:11.060> right<00:03:11.239> here<00:03:11.480> so<00:03:12.379> you<00:03:12.799> just

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
just come back right here so you just

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.729 
just come back right here so you just
mind<00:03:13.489> until<00:03:13.849> you<00:03:14.030> see<00:03:14.750> they<00:03:14.900> like<00:03:15.379> the<00:03:15.560> end

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
mind until you see they like the end

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:18.369 
mind until you see they like the end
location<00:03:16.010> of<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.489> map<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:16.900> once<00:03:17.900> you<00:03:18.170> have

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:18.379 
location of the map and once you have

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.100 
location of the map and once you have
done<00:03:18.590> that<00:03:18.650> you<00:03:19.430> just<00:03:19.700> go<00:03:19.910> back<00:03:20.180> or<00:03:20.480> you<00:03:20.900> can

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
done that you just go back or you can

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.569 
done that you just go back or you can
also<00:03:21.260> do<00:03:21.500> it<00:03:21.530> right<00:03:21.829> there<00:03:22.040> it<00:03:22.190> isn't<00:03:22.280> really

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
also do it right there it isn't really

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:28.360 
also do it right there it isn't really
matter<00:03:22.730> then<00:03:23.389> you<00:03:23.780> go<00:03:24.079> one<00:03:25.030> two<00:03:26.380> three<00:03:27.380> and

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
matter then you go one two three and

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.430 
matter then you go one two three and
then<00:03:28.609> do<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.239> exact<00:03:29.510> same<00:03:29.540> thing<00:03:30.170> right<00:03:30.380> here

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
then do the exact same thing right here

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.920 
then do the exact same thing right here
and<00:03:30.829> then<00:03:30.920> we<00:03:31.069> just<00:03:31.280> mine<00:03:31.519> again<00:03:31.850> mine<00:03:32.630> again

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
and then we just mine again mine again

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.270 
and then we just mine again mine again
mine<00:03:33.139> again<00:03:33.380> mind<00:03:33.590> again<00:03:33.829> all<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.190> way

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
mine again mind again all the way

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.819 
mine again mind again all the way
through<00:03:34.579> there<00:03:34.930> you<00:03:35.930> might<00:03:36.109> be<00:03:36.200> thinking<00:03:36.410> why

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
through there you might be thinking why

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.210 
through there you might be thinking why
are<00:03:37.069> we<00:03:37.220> leaving<00:03:37.880> a<00:03:38.269> to<00:03:38.359> space<00:03:39.139> gap<00:03:39.500> it's<00:03:40.099> a

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
are we leaving a to space gap it's a

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.940 
are we leaving a to space gap it's a
really<00:03:40.400> easy<00:03:40.840> to<00:03:41.840> answer<00:03:42.019> question<00:03:42.620> because

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
really easy to answer question because

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.879 
really easy to answer question because
if<00:03:43.130> we<00:03:43.340> were<00:03:43.459> to<00:03:43.700> mine<00:03:43.940> here<00:03:44.329> then<00:03:45.170> all<00:03:45.380> these

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
if we were to mine here then all these

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:47.800 
if we were to mine here then all these
blocks<00:03:46.340> that<00:03:46.519> you<00:03:46.700> see<00:03:46.940> on<00:03:47.090> this<00:03:47.239> side<00:03:47.540> you

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
blocks that you see on this side you

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.050 
blocks that you see on this side you
have<00:03:48.349> already<00:03:48.650> discovered<00:03:49.370> when<00:03:49.819> you<00:03:49.940> were

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
have already discovered when you were

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.349 
have already discovered when you were
mining<00:03:50.329> right<00:03:50.690> here<00:03:51.079> them<00:03:51.950> and<00:03:52.370> this<00:03:53.060> way<00:03:53.299> you

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
mining right here them and this way you

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.839 
mining right here them and this way you
will<00:03:53.690> be<00:03:53.870> getting<00:03:54.049> this<00:03:54.709> side<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.370> upper<00:03:55.669> side

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
will be getting this side the upper side

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:59.140 
will be getting this side the upper side
the<00:03:56.209> left<00:03:56.480> side<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:57.049> the<00:03:57.500> downside<00:03:58.099> all<00:03:58.760> with

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
the left side and the downside all with

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.990 
the left side and the downside all with
new<00:03:59.540> lead<00:04:00.260> blogs<00:04:00.859> that<00:04:01.010> you<00:04:01.220> have<00:04:01.340> never<00:04:01.519> seen

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
new lead blogs that you have never seen

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.839 
new lead blogs that you have never seen
before<00:04:02.060> if<00:04:02.720> you<00:04:03.200> would<00:04:03.380> do<00:04:03.950> it<00:04:04.069> closer<00:04:04.489> of

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:04.849 
before if you would do it closer of

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.970 
before if you would do it closer of
course<00:04:05.090> oh<00:04:05.239> this<00:04:05.750> whole<00:04:05.959> entire<00:04:06.290> row<00:04:06.919> you

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
course oh this whole entire row you

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.460 
course oh this whole entire row you
would<00:04:07.250> have<00:04:07.370> already<00:04:07.609> seen<00:04:08.120> it<00:04:08.269> and<00:04:08.450> if<00:04:09.079> we<00:04:09.109> do

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
would have already seen it and if we do
