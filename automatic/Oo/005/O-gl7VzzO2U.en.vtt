00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.050

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.489
 yes at the end 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.869
 the dollar falls that would be any road 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:41.869
 if there is no gap in my level 30 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:44.249

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:47.719
 I always feel I percent injury 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.060
 i maple bush also 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.819
 Of the version 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.029
 here you can see 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:55.799
 only in the attempt 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:56.859
 as is 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.190
 others sun jaczko 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.799
 without letting it sink 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.949
 Good thing, waiting for an owner 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:07.219
 Many people do not like us we are willing to 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:10.049
 ariel 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.869
 the xolos pokémons to anyone who then remains 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:15.279
 these one hundred 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:17.559
 just sign up 

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:22.049
 those pokémon what is these games are really jaqueados of 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.149
 a colleague of mine from here of images 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:30.529
 the good seems to me that they are born a little more legendary I do not know which one 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.049
 but we have several 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.669
 we can get pokémon whatever level you want the attacks you want that 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.539
 well just tell us not to take out the channel 

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:43.299
 And we got ourselves today from one or two days better 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.299
 the ad but only appreciated without success 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.510
 p since we do not have this version as it is looted 

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:53.919
 the suns that will happen to another 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:57.769
 we will be uploading most games with a good country so that 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:03:59.229
 we can exchange 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:01.809
 the aids 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:05.540
 per cent would be like pokemon would be the main one that we have most 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:06.719
 in focus 

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.719
 and well a pokémon you can get anything 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:13.219
 Anything that they ask we have any item 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:15.969
 can see it 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:17.340
 the 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.340
 the berries that ask us a lot 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.199
 we understand any any up to the limit no 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.949
 anything they ask us 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:28.699
 here we are going to have them 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.059
 percent 

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:33.059
 letters of two battle subjects 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:35.460
 ntx 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.680
 or in prizes 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.590
 anything 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.499
 here we have them 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:44.719
 and any pokémon that we are asked of the level they want 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.090
 the rest do not happen 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.550
 super Marxists if they wish 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.680
 obviously 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.529
 yes they will have to use one for their version 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:55.999
 since a lot of people do not like to play with 

00:04:55.999 --> 00:04:57.180
 with jazz 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.689
 But hey, sometimes I bribed one of them and it's good for us 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:04.240
 use because women do not 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.629
 it's not bad it's a simple game of this 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:10.569
 and good that it is impossible that there was before it bought 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:14.029
 I'm not saying that 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:17.159
 which is good in itself but nothing bad 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:19.460
 good gesture is the pokémon in him 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.939
 the diamond 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:24.479
 clearly to change we are going to use this version since we have not even been 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.960
 given the 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.599
 cd as they say 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.879
 they have not given us even the option 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:34.879
 to have a blog 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:38.759
 jalkh by getting the block for a hundred they did not even give us 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:43.900
 they gave us the 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.629
 the efesé 

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:47.080
 good 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.289
 stevens 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:51.539
 already for game matters I think he for the jac 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:56.800
 the report this is all for now these morning days 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.900
 and good ep soon we will release other games some are not going to be steva 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.849
 Spanish but well let's have this 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:09.869
 I have been for years super mario bros with the trick of always being them 

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:12.869
 or the deanery the tricks blocked this narco as new 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.059
 for your good those are the costs right now 

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:18.219
 i 

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:22.179
 from here after we get the simple games warning and showing the 

00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:23.159
 species 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:27.050
 and in the times in which we will be connected in the uefa and so that we can 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.669
 change pokémons also if they wish it is just a matter of carmensa that 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:32.349
 private 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:37.169
 ch show it and we will get it answered when a seat 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:40.900
 when we got it, he knew how we are doing and we can not get it but it seems to me that 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.330
 we can all get 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.890
 evora 3era tending to moshé get more news about the cartridge sep se 

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:48.199
