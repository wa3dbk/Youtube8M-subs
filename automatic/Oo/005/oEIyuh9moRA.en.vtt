00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:07.500
 I greet you today it will be about 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.950
 grinding drum on grinding 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.269
 machine tool 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:19.770
 I here he sits on the shaft there is an option 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:23.160
 put with risen chuck rights to this 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:27.050
 made of steel machined hole by 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.050
 the edges this for relief they are told 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:35.180
 The story today will be about how you can 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:41.270
 easy and fast 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:44.750
 pull on him skin there are options 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:51.350
 stick the skin is nailed screwed 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:56.160
 I use this way I have this skin 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:59.059
 hammered too precise then brusochek 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.059
 rectangular 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:20.250
 This piece we achieve in the groove saved also 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:20.250
 tucked the edges in a crust and how 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:31.840
 bar slaughtered skin stretches 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:37.479
 by itself it does not need to stretch it 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:42.810
 tight as on the drum itself there is the most 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:45.659
 the main point to calculate this 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.520
 the thickness of this cast 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.259
 so that you can score without special 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.429
 effort 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.429
 Well, that same time that he held 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.110
 remove we removed now we need to put 

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:05.520
 new this out of ruffled show now 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.520
 way as but exhibited 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:18.540
 so cut 2 new sandpaper carriage 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:25.180
 just as well that you are old one to each 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:29.830
 especially along the length of the old we are no longer 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:36.300
 need new skin insert one 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:39.300
 the end of the groove and the second too there 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.300
 wrapping up 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.350
 now just very 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:54.150
 scoring until you score I will say here 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:58.720
 us one end of the bar 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:03.000
 there is such a sample of it under the screwdriver 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.000
 to be able to shoot it to hook 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 him 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:23.280
 I start to score and how much by itself 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:28.520
 stretched we hammer to the end for this 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:31.890
 use cylindrical 4 and plus 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:41.130
 mutt machine can not be knocked 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:44.600
 for your sake i show here we have a bar 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:48.900
 drowned in there he does not interfere with 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:50.989
 processing will not check the workpiece all 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.739
 how much stretched 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:58.650
 she sits tight nothing yields yet 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.100
 can work embed installation 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.100
 work 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:12.740
 if skarpa is another grain 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:15.560
 but rather another thickness of course 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:17.390
 the delay is necessary for a friend I think not 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.570
 sure bar do steel can 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:25.090
 from textolite for example 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.090
 durable better 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:37.660
 well that's all for today 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:39.480
 I think someone can not be useful 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.110
 my experience 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.110
 See you all and good luck
