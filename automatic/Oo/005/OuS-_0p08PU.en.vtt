00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.880
 Yes, I will, people. Sonic talk. 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.160
 so we got to get the subject lalo 68 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.289
 buy apps and such and say by 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.390
 which then does not have because I 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.490
 I want to think about all the devices 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.510
 reach me as I recall the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:29.730
 my 65 professionals worked out what is 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.949
 of 20 the 720 1 929 5 and 20 that is what I 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.370
 I have range I'm going to test at all and 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.079
 then liking you can bet something and 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.510
 work for 10 people to 51 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.530
 functioning on the 3 percent majority and 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.570
 of the minority 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.850
 so I'll search first testament 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.309
 first one does not work out I'll warn 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.579
 but I think it will work I tested 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.379
 2009 or 5 520 worked out 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.699
 so I have to show one stay 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.910
 active that a lot of people are looking for 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.969
 it works so perfect is you 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.430
 current season 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.140
 it has that related apps 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.309
 here and you click on 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.710
 Facebook 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.189
 it will fix a facebook rate you 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.049
 will open it and will be without this 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.360
 program or continued for the first time 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.299
 the program I know for example that I have 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.850
 another that the messenger fixed here loses 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.509
 so are all transparencies also 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.570
 Look at all relatives, it's good, something else. 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.950
 I think whatsapp also has the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.320
 challenge of another application that I have 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.450
 the example that even he is from another 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.100
 also very educational but for 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.710
 example will be signed does not work 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.149
 you open this way it will open 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.579
 normally and will open normally 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.289
 even in April normal only a lot of people 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.060
 even and we just do not know that you can 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.390
 perform active search and opened direct 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.189
 here on this earth here on earth 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.420
 started clicking will not open 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.159
 so I think it's worth downloading because 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.399
 has application is free 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.609
 then you just pay being worth it then 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.859
 the tip is this patiently waiting patiently 

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:07.860
 tutorial of being the doctor himself 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:12.590
 I'll try to show as high as possible and 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.590
 so anything the comments and went
