00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:46.610 
want to um like there's a pin in there
and<00:03:44.380> one<00:03:45.370> thing<00:03:45.400> that<00:03:45.549> can<00:03:45.819> happen<00:03:46.000> is<00:03:46.299> if

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
and one thing that can happen is if

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.500 
and one thing that can happen is if
these<00:03:47.620> heat<00:03:47.950> pins<00:03:48.250> if<00:03:48.519> you<00:03:48.730> tighten<00:03:48.970> them<00:03:49.239> too

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
these heat pins if you tighten them too

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.629 
these heat pins if you tighten them too
much<00:03:49.750> then<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.590> way<00:03:50.709> that<00:03:50.919> the<00:03:51.010> joint<00:03:51.220> spins

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
much then the way that the joint spins

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.030 
much then the way that the joint spins
is<00:03:51.880> this<00:03:52.060> is<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.660> upendra<00:03:53.349> tapes<00:03:53.590> in<00:03:53.769> the

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
is this is the upendra tapes in the

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.729 
is this is the upendra tapes in the
joint<00:03:54.250> and<00:03:54.489> that<00:03:55.030> can<00:03:55.269> cause<00:03:55.510> um<00:03:55.870> rather<00:03:56.500> than

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
joint and that can cause um rather than

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.740 
joint and that can cause um rather than
just<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.069> plastic<00:03:57.370> turning<00:03:58.000> against<00:03:58.209> plastic

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
just the plastic turning against plastic

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.369 
just the plastic turning against plastic
and<00:03:58.959> that<00:03:59.190> can<00:04:00.190> cause<00:04:00.430> a<00:04:00.879> that<00:04:01.780> can<00:04:01.930> cause<00:04:02.109> the

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
and that can cause a that can cause the

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:04.860 
and that can cause a that can cause the
plastic<00:04:03.010> that's<00:04:03.370> around<00:04:04.329> the<00:04:04.569> pin<00:04:04.720> to

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
plastic that's around the pin to

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.210 
plastic that's around the pin to
fracture<00:04:05.230> sometimes<00:04:05.560> so<00:04:05.680> I<00:04:05.950> wouldn't<00:04:06.129> be

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
fracture sometimes so I wouldn't be

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.039 
fracture sometimes so I wouldn't be
careful<00:04:06.579> about<00:04:06.760> it<00:04:06.879> but<00:04:07.030> it<00:04:07.480> is<00:04:07.629> a<00:04:07.660> little<00:04:07.870> bit

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
careful about it but it is a little bit

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.390 
careful about it but it is a little bit
loose<00:04:08.199> like<00:04:08.379> you<00:04:08.470> can't<00:04:08.680> really<00:04:08.799> hold<00:04:09.069> any<00:04:09.310> of

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
loose like you can't really hold any of

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.199 
loose like you can't really hold any of
the<00:04:09.519> weapons<00:04:09.819> very<00:04:10.060> well<00:04:11.579> they<00:04:12.579> go<00:04:12.699> in<00:04:12.910> and<00:04:13.030> out

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
the weapons very well they go in and out

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.849 
the weapons very well they go in and out
like<00:04:13.269> this<00:04:13.510> but<00:04:13.900> they<00:04:13.959> bump<00:04:14.139> into<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.500> stuff

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859 
like this but they bump into the stuff

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:16.199 
like this but they bump into the stuff
on<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.069> shoulder<00:04:15.400> so<00:04:15.579> to<00:04:15.639> get<00:04:15.819> around<00:04:16.030> that

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
on the shoulder so to get around that

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.689 
on the shoulder so to get around that
you<00:04:16.239> need<00:04:16.419> to<00:04:16.510> bring<00:04:16.690> these<00:04:16.810> out<00:04:17.049> like<00:04:17.410> this<00:04:17.699> so

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:18.699 
you need to bring these out like this so

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:20.279 
you need to bring these out like this so
you<00:04:18.760> can<00:04:19.150> give<00:04:19.359> a<00:04:19.570> bit<00:04:19.810> more<00:04:19.959> of<00:04:20.049> an<00:04:20.140> outward

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
you can give a bit more of an outward

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:23.310 
you can give a bit more of an outward
motion<00:04:20.620> bites<00:04:21.039> always<00:04:21.760> going<00:04:22.000> to<00:04:22.030> be<00:04:22.150> a

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
motion bites always going to be a

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.260 
motion bites always going to be a
the<00:04:23.470> shoulder<00:04:24.040> here<00:04:24.310> is<00:04:24.490> after<00:04:24.730> the<00:04:25.120> out

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
the shoulder here is after the out

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.850 
the shoulder here is after the out
motion<00:04:25.510> so<00:04:25.780> the<00:04:25.870> out<00:04:26.020> motion<00:04:26.260> is<00:04:26.470> always<00:04:26.710> going

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
motion so the out motion is always going

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.850 
motion so the out motion is always going
to<00:04:26.950> be<00:04:27.010> up<00:04:27.330> but<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.420> reason<00:04:28.540> we<00:04:28.750> keep<00:04:28.900> this<00:04:29.170> all

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
to be up but the reason we keep this all

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.080 
to be up but the reason we keep this all
the<00:04:30.070> way<00:04:30.160> up<00:04:30.280> here<00:04:30.310> is<00:04:30.550> because<00:04:30.670> it<00:04:30.850> County

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
the way up here is because it County

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.910 
the way up here is because it County
grabs<00:04:31.270> around<00:04:31.570> here<00:04:31.780> then<00:04:32.320> you<00:04:32.380> guys<00:04:32.500> have<00:04:32.770> the

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
grabs around here then you guys have the

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.410 
grabs around here then you guys have the
weird<00:04:33.190> elbows<00:04:33.640> here<00:04:33.850> so<00:04:33.970> he's<00:04:34.120> a<00:04:34.150> little<00:04:34.330> bit

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
weird elbows here so he's a little bit

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.910 
weird elbows here so he's a little bit
like<00:04:34.540> scrap<00:04:34.840> ever<00:04:35.020> he<00:04:35.110> doesn't<00:04:35.350> have<00:04:35.530> elbows

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
like scrap ever he doesn't have elbows

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.620 
like scrap ever he doesn't have elbows
that<00:04:36.100> you<00:04:36.190> can<00:04:36.340> use

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
that you can use

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.930 
that you can use
I<00:04:37.770> don't<00:04:38.770> mind<00:04:38.890> it<00:04:39.010> too<00:04:39.160> much<00:04:39.190> just<00:04:39.610> because

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
I don't mind it too much just because

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.480 
I don't mind it too much just because
this<00:04:40.390> guy<00:04:40.600> is<00:04:40.660> so<00:04:40.900> big<00:04:41.260> and<00:04:41.560> chunky<00:04:41.920> anyway

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
this guy is so big and chunky anyway

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:48.200 
this guy is so big and chunky anyway
with<00:04:42.700> like<00:04:42.880> these<00:04:43.690> like<00:04:44.320> it<00:04:46.050> even<00:04:47.050> if<00:04:47.140> he<00:04:47.230> had

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
with like these like it even if he had

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.880 
with like these like it even if he had
decent<00:04:49.210> elbows<00:04:49.660> it<00:04:50.290> wouldn't<00:04:50.530> really<00:04:50.650> matter

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:50.890 
decent elbows it wouldn't really matter

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:52.140 
decent elbows it wouldn't really matter
that<00:04:51.040> much<00:04:51.310> because<00:04:51.460> his<00:04:51.730> arms<00:04:52.000> are<00:04:52.090> so

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
that much because his arms are so

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.720 
that much because his arms are so
limited<00:04:52.660> by<00:04:52.840> all<00:04:53.320> the<00:04:53.680> kibble<00:04:53.890> up<00:04:54.070> here<00:04:54.310> anyway

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
limited by all the kibble up here anyway

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.770 
limited by all the kibble up here anyway
and<00:04:55.060> then<00:04:55.540> his<00:04:55.720> legs<00:04:55.960> um<00:04:56.380> like<00:04:57.280> in<00:04:57.940> theory<00:04:58.510> have

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
and then his legs um like in theory have

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.170 
and then his legs um like in theory have
decent<00:04:59.680> articulation<00:05:00.430> but<00:05:00.700> because<00:05:00.970> of<00:05:01.000> how

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
decent articulation but because of how

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.660 
decent articulation but because of how
stiff<00:05:02.110> all<00:05:02.320> the<00:05:02.440> Germans<00:05:02.740> are<00:05:02.890> so<00:05:03.130> Devastator

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
stiff all the Germans are so Devastator
