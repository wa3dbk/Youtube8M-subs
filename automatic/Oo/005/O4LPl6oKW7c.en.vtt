00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
relatively larger space that I found

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.670 
relatively larger space that I found
that<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:33.799> completely<00:02:34.799> away<00:02:35.430> from<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:36.720> airbag

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
that is completely away from the airbag

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.449 
that is completely away from the airbag
system<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.340> it's<00:02:38.850> deploying<00:02:39.329> paths<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:40.459> you

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
believe that it was a breeze entirely

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.530 
believe that it was a breeze entirely
due<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:11.250> harness<00:03:11.459> that<00:03:11.640> I<00:03:11.790> purchased<00:03:12.360> from
