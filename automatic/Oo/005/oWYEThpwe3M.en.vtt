 well let's start playing this 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.060
 super addictive piglet game that 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.039
 it has to be charged to the wolves that 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.420
 come to both sides the truth is that 

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:14.930
 it had been a while since I played a little 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.330
 addictive like this 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.310
 let's start I do not know how many games 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.180
 I'm going to play according to how I'm doing but I'm not 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:26.150
 I will go here without exceeding the record of 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.130
 111 if it is true that this challenge has already begun 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.530
 a few days ago on twitter 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.390
 If you see my twitter there are many people already 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.040
 that we are giving captures of his record 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.590
 in this game and I think some and go 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.680
 by 140 out there that seems like a 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.080
 we are going to play to see how much I do 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.890
 let's start with our curious 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.110
 little pig here the first one is coming as 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.540
 you see we just have to touch the 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.430
 right left or slide down 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.710
 up we also have a kind 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.450
 double jump and we have to have 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.850
 Beware that sometimes there are some wolves 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.720
 They are throwing us as little knives and me 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.790
 they have given the first 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.470
 As it can be, they have given me all the 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.080
 service sometimes we can use it look 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.170
 how can we use a bit as a shield 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.610
 although sometimes it annoyed by people like you to 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.160
 You catch it then you can use it as 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.980
 shield or if you want you can also not 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.100
 make those who throw you duck and you 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.090
 of course it comes from the other side 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.000
 beware also of the rockets 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.230
 they have given me already brings this incredible very 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.500
 fatal 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.600
 they have returned to give me shit in the ops and 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.660
 beware of the one that comes with the 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.950
 Scythe species enclosed I'm left 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.870
 three little dots of life I'm going too 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.970
 as an excuse but a little side with the 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.200
 capturing 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.200
 come on let's go come on 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.520
 what the fuck 25 a garbage had tried 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.160
 bring because this has been a garbage has 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.050
 I have been a failure and I am still guided 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.960
 I think I'm going to take the iphone and I'm going to 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.180
 play it there let's play another one to see if 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:06.510
 not me 'guide both 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.760
 the little pig that you can 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.420
 first without problems 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:17.829
 the second that I stayed with his head 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.680
 is thrown at people or takes and would have 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.569
 already been too much longer 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.230
 side and all this is impossible me up 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.030
 the 25 do not usually give me one and now here 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.440
 of change they give me two you have to have them in 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.460
 the double jump because if I was not going to 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:36.900
 stab careful there 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:39.270
 there we were those who overcame so 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.650
 minus 100 and I do not think I'm going to take the 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.350
 iphone 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.160
 we go with the rocket that is also 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:50.090
 heavier and you carry it 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.210
 let's go now with the care scythe has 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.950
 dice 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:59.530
 let's go to the scythe we'll see care 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:03.330
 that has returned to give the knife 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:06.640
 It can not be I'm playing fatal 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:09.710
 that there is a lot of mess and they are going to burst 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.870
 fucking wolf 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.490
 I'm sorry if I say any that some 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.209
 another taco but 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:19.579
 hear a tamale after 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.319
 super sad I'm actually going to catch the 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.810
 iphone to see if I do not stay so much in 

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:25.280
 the iphone a kid and good I'm already 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.690
 here again I will play now in the 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.430
 iphone is that it takes me a little 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.319
 idea but I do not want it to be an excuse 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.720
 but I think the show was a little 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:34.280
 iphone version is going better we're going to 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.199
 start now with our car and everything 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.960
 again to the pse now I'm going a little bit 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:41.509
 better as you can see there I did not have 111 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.250
 clipping to 110 is in the third 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:45.169
 game that I'm going to play and here the 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.699
 truth is that I'm going a little better 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.759
 see if I now score more because 

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:53.720
 the score of before has been of pity 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:55.070
 come on we go because you go better in the 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.860
 iphone than the ipad because the ipad is 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.900
 light too and the iphone is 5 s more 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.690

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.210
