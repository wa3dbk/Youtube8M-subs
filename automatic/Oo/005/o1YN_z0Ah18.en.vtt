00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.139
 hello friends of austral 1 that is crystal 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.330
 thief of guevara I come from the company 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.660
 pro meat and we will teach you how to 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.660
 they make rich 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:26.530
 let's start from a technique that is very 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:30.460
 classic that is the assembly of the coal 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:32.470
 we have a diary have it in roger and 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.180
 we wind this serpentine in a 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.820
 bottle and we put the amount that 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.260
 we deem convenient and you 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.470
 we emptied the coal that we 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.810
 we need to make our rich 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.510
 roast 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.190
 this technique is called the volcano and 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.949
 let's turn on our volcano 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.770
 and we're going to get coal to make a 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:58.040
 combustion couple and faster to the air 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.470
 is already taking more color 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.690
 this is an average breaststroke 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.450
 if I put my meat in this minute what 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.930
 what am I going to get in my meat take 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:11.930
 all the harmful agents of coal 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.210
 in the end that I will produce in general 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.840
 my meat by putting it in some phrases like 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:21.410
 this and really always the brace has 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.860
 have this white tonality like 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:27.380
 they were ashes when with our 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.260
 Christmas orange sportsmen is a 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.030
 good relationship 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.900
 distributed the coal to have a 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.370
 more warmth more soft color stronger what 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.160
 that allows us to make different types of 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.750
 cut between the same barrel now you 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.640
 let's give some information so that 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.880
 you can salt your cross is great 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.190
 before putting the important rod 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.530
 is to know that the bigger the 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.590
 piece of meat that I ideally have 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.140
 salt a little before putting on the 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.260
 rod because if we make sure that the 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.940
 salt is impregnated because they are very cuts 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.190
 basic as the lamb or in this case 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:09.690
 with membranes or without membranes 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:12.270
 and with your meat goals exposed and 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.980
 say that salt is going to impregnate 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.440
 difference of the lever in this case 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.960
 which consists of one of its sides with a 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.150
 membrane 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.050
 that I can use once I have the 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.060
 grill 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.310
 we are going to present different cuts for 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.340
 the grill that are not the busy 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.240
 traditionally, what we have here is 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.240
 a tactic 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:38.120
 the cut recognizable by its thick layer 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.120
 of fat and a triangular cut 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.060
 let's go with the tip of picanas 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:47.200
 that they remember in a thick layer of 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:51.069
 fat because this takes about 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.890
 one hour 20 already on a soft fire the first 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.840
 what do we do 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.230
 we put it on the side that does not have the 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.680
 Fat face for 5 minutes and so on 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.760
 we follow our meat 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.200
 we also have the spearhead being 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.970
 a cut also of a triangular shape 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.620
 the layer of fat is quite minor 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.940
 this is also known as the 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:18.319
 small we also seal them start 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.469
 with the layer with less fat 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:24.340
 5 minutes approximately then we give 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.340
 40 minutes 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:32.769
 this cut actually is generally 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.370
 known as a cut and serves for the 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:39.670
 pot to the game and baked but with a lot 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.959
 broth base much juice the same are 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.220
 cuts that have a fat that we 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:47.680
 brings a lot of flavor the fats talk about 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.250
 an irregular rectangular cut that 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.830
 we apply the same technique we cut 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.850
 on the side of the grilled membrane 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.850
 for 5 minutes 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.490
 once they start adding our 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:08.840
 fats 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.840
 we are going strong 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.560
 We are cooking some cuts that are 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.180
 they die more like the point of the 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.070
 goose point 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.890
 we have the lever 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.420
 that allows us to share with friends 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.690
 on the grill for a while because you have 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.070
 a cooking time of less than 10 minutes 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.670
 will allow us to peck at the 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:40.730
 grill we also have an inevitable 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.730
 the expert parties that is the strange 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:47.350
 in our grill we have a cut of 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:50.620
 lever 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.800
 and we have the strange 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.199
 little known only by some the most 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.680
 experts in this court 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:00.520
 he usually stayed at the butcher shop 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.570
 because he was preferred by the 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.550
 butcher is a cut that allows us 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:08.410
 eat a juicy meat in a short time 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.720
 this ideal for this time the party 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.540
 with friends the previous of a barbecue 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:17.490
 great us in our womb 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:20.020
 we can do ultra popular 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.220
 calculate elongated 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.220
 as if it were a belt 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:31.400
 the others are better changed very wide 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.590
 the bone contains 2 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.240
 never have to prick the flesh just 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.639
 we use the meat what we do is 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.680
 lose them natural are within 

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:42.650
 our close if we 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.420
 we ensure the pizzas to be able to take and 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.250
 move mocker 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.630
 we make sure that all the flavor that 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.280
 inside the meat does not drain the 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.860
 tummy 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:53.780
 we have quite important if 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.240
 we deposit the salt from this 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:59.060
 height the only thing we get to talk about 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:01.900
 is this piece of change change while 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.900
 higher 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:09.000
 we only collected the salt allows us 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:09.000
 encompass I 'm not full meat 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.380
 plus 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.770
 I think we like the heart only the 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:24.590
 we use in the following way that we can 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.900
 share with our friends a previous 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:29.390
 there will be a match at this time but it 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:32.840
 delay more than 10 minutes on the grill 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:35.780
 we also have here the meat lever 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:40.850
 soft to my point of view the best for 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:43.450
 the soft soft grill good flavor I leave 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.450
 Butter 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:48.439
 good friends I hope you liked it 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:50.449
 the grill data that we say no 

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:53.479
 we look forward to our cans of meat in the 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:55.129
 came to kill 12 16 to visit us and 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:57.429
 try the best cuts of meat from 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:57.429
 the region
