00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.940
 For example, a bicycle lock in the closet 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.490
 So I have really funny there 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.710

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.830
 to put in the time you look 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.010

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.620
 me that always says so that 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.570
 I do not feel like it in the evening 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.160
 what right food to eat so i do it 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.070
 sometimes from what is right but if 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.360

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.550
 I do not want to eat anymore 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.510
 and that evening it's just like that 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.510
 I have eaten no supper now 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.840
 steps to the comments on whether the 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.849
 you are out or dinner with you 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.319
 something is really important whatever 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.329
 you must be respected because at 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.799
 me is the breakfast for example and 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.269
 the evening is not necessarily eat 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.890
 unless I'm really hungry though 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:39.750
 now you see that too 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:42.120
 Tidy wardrobe so then 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.760

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.120
 I can give you the blue ones 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:52.769

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.109

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.849

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.019
 I then just my face with it 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.019

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.350
 then I use of the kali 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.239
 Rose water that makes one 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.040
 beautiful skin soft and cleanses yet 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.380
 Just let the skin on the game 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.520
 my face and then I do that 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.640
 really not every day 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.780
 I use the peeling mask to fall off 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.890
 Just for my skin 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.440
 clean because I'm just kinda 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.810
 currently got pimple on the chin and 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.160
 I have never otherwise and therefore must 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.950
 I have been like that lately 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.990

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.400
 I will never wear that in the morning 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.500
 because I'm just too lazy in the morning 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.880
 for that and I would rather somehow 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.470

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.850

 I'll take out all the stuff tomorrow 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.980
 would like to wear and what if then mine 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.390
 Mask has dried for ten minutes 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.390
 everything thoroughly again 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.610
 Next, I use from my lush 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.780

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.310
 I really recommend you here 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.780

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.550
 broken lips have on the lips 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.140
 just brush your lips and 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.400
 then they look like new again and again 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:27.140
 then I use the eye cream from bbb 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.610

 dark circles just a bit 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.040
 swell down and do not seem so big and 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.480
 so far I do not see any 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.980
 right difference to the morning though 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.320
 after all , it used to be dry 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.750
