since I've shaved it first about at

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.840 
since I've shaved it first about at
least<00:00:39.719> 3<00:00:39.960> months<00:00:40.110> as<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.219> shaved<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.489> back<00:00:41.640> in

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.270 
least 3 months as I shaved it back in
November<00:00:43.309> but<00:00:44.309> um<00:00:45.469> I'm<00:00:46.469> pretty<00:00:46.829> happy<00:00:47.100> about

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
November but um I'm pretty happy about

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.209 
November but um I'm pretty happy about
it<00:00:47.579> um<00:00:47.730> at<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.899> how<00:00:49.230> fast<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:49.770> growing<00:00:49.950> it's

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
it um at the how fast it's growing it's

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:56.889 
it um at the how fast it's growing it's
quite<00:00:50.399> about<00:00:50.610> 3<00:00:51.449> inches<00:00:51.949> to<00:00:53.090> about<00:00:54.090> 2<00:00:54.629> 3<00:00:54.899> inches

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
quite about 3 inches to about 2 3 inches

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.720 
quite about 3 inches to about 2 3 inches
so<00:00:57.899> that's<00:00:58.050> pretty<00:00:58.289> good<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:58.890> 3<00:00:59.280> months<00:00:59.609> I

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
so that's pretty good for 3 months I

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:00.950 
so that's pretty good for 3 months I
guess

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
guess

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.500 
guess

because you know washing your hair every

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.859 
because you know washing your hair every
day<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.840> bad<00:01:07.049> for<00:01:07.260> your<00:01:07.320> hair<00:01:07.729> but<00:01:08.729> yeah<00:01:09.299> I've

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
I've been using that mixed with regular

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.020 
I've been using that mixed with regular
shampoo<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:29.070> don't<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.460> color<00:01:29.670> protect

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
shampoo I don't have a color protect

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.880 
shampoo I don't have a color protect
because<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.509> had<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> lot<00:01:31.200> when<00:01:31.439> I<00:01:31.470> colored<00:01:31.860> my

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
because I had a lot when I colored my

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.429 
because I had a lot when I colored my
hair<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:33.180> never<00:01:33.299> finished<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.869> all<00:01:34.020> so

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
hair and I just never finished it all so

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.429 
hair and I just never finished it all so
I've<00:01:34.619> been<00:01:34.740> mixing<00:01:34.890> those<00:01:35.130> kind<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.430> shampoos

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
I've been mixing those kind of shampoos

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.640 
I've been mixing those kind of shampoos
and<00:01:37.490> I<00:01:38.600> think<00:01:39.600> it's<00:01:39.720> helping<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.229> blonde<00:01:40.470> to

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
and I think it's helping the blonde to

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.399 
and I think it's helping the blonde to
come<00:01:40.799> out<00:01:40.950> which<00:01:41.130> is<00:01:41.310> awesome<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.960> haven't

since<00:03:20.340> its<00:03:20.880> grade<00:03:21.209> is<00:03:21.650> when<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.739> had<00:03:22.920> my<00:03:23.010> hair

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
since its grade is when I had my hair

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.870 
since its grade is when I had my hair
that<00:03:23.340> long<00:03:23.459> so<00:03:24.260> I'm<00:03:25.260> just<00:03:25.440> going<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.590> show<00:03:25.799> you

long<00:04:47.860> or<00:04:48.490> this<00:04:49.120> one<00:04:49.740> it<00:04:50.740> was<00:04:50.890> all<00:04:51.100> rather<00:04:51.280> than

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
long or this one it was all rather than

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.570 
long or this one it was all rather than
this<00:04:51.550> in<00:04:51.730> this<00:04:51.820> picture<00:04:52.030> but<00:04:52.870> that's<00:04:53.680> the<00:04:54.370> long

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
this in this picture but that's the long

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.580

because<00:04:59.590> I've<00:05:00.070> kept<00:05:00.400> cutting<00:05:00.640> it<00:05:01.650> look<00:05:02.650> i-i've

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
because I've kept cutting it look i-i've

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.890 
because I've kept cutting it look i-i've
married<00:05:03.520> on<00:05:03.760> length<00:05:04.000> like<00:05:04.210> I<00:05:04.330> had<00:05:04.510> that<00:05:04.690> about

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
married on length like I had that about

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:05.700 
married on length like I had that about
this<00:05:05.169> long

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
this long

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.140 
this long
at<00:05:06.370> one<00:05:06.730> point<00:05:07.060> my<00:05:07.360> junior<00:05:07.870> year<00:05:07.900> and<00:05:08.850> then<00:05:09.850> it

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
at one point my junior year and then it

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.190 
at one point my junior year and then it
was<00:05:10.300> a<00:05:10.330> little<00:05:10.419> bit<00:05:10.600> longer<00:05:10.780> on<00:05:10.960> the<00:05:11.080> other

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:11.200 
was a little bit longer on the other

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.820 
was a little bit longer on the other
side<00:05:11.440> so<00:05:11.650> it<00:05:11.770> kind<00:05:12.100> of<00:05:12.190> grew<00:05:12.460> in<00:05:12.640> angular<00:05:13.830> say

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
side so it kind of grew in angular say

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:16.560 
side so it kind of grew in angular say
that<00:05:15.010> I<00:05:15.160> think<00:05:15.400> it<00:05:15.460> was<00:05:15.550> about<00:05:15.669> this<00:05:15.940> long<00:05:16.180> on

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
that I think it was about this long on

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.350 
that I think it was about this long on
the<00:05:16.690> sides<00:05:16.720> and<00:05:17.320> then<00:05:17.860> over<00:05:18.669> here<00:05:18.820> on<00:05:19.000> the<00:05:19.150> side

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
the sides and then over here on the side

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.740 
the sides and then over here on the side
I<00:05:19.390> was<00:05:19.630> like<00:05:19.930> done<00:05:20.680> here<00:05:21.270> but<00:05:22.270> it<00:05:22.419> was<00:05:22.540> pretty

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
I was like done here but it was pretty

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.630 
I was like done here but it was pretty
it<00:05:22.900> was<00:05:22.930> like<00:05:23.140> purple<00:05:23.440> and<00:05:23.680> orange<00:05:23.860> it<00:05:24.190> looked

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
it was like purple and orange it looked

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:30.510 
it was like purple and orange it looked
really<00:05:24.910> good<00:05:25.120> I<00:05:25.390> liked<00:05:25.600> it<00:05:26.280> but<00:05:27.570> yeah<00:05:29.520> so
