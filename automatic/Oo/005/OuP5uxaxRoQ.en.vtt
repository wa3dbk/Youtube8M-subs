 anti stalker product of the range 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.319
 gigaset and but probably of the 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:09.260
 history of commerce in this product is 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:12.769

 he will directly call the call 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:25.250
 or it will recognize the telephone number 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.670
 will store the number in the list of 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.370
 calls for which you will see kylie has 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.560

 no one will disturb me during the 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.100
 night 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.850
 no one will be able to 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.430
 it may disturb you in general is

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.790
 all calls that do not present 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.240

 be torn down 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.380
 another interesting performance is 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:14.620
 that of setting a time slot 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.690

 from ten in the evening to 11 in the evening 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.540
 you don't want to be at eight o'clock in the morning 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.580
 disturbed by unwanted calls but 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.010
 you want to be able to receive calls from 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.760

 old woman who should need e 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:30.360
 typically a request for help does not 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:31.139
 you must necessarily have two

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:35.099
 the call could also arrive 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.470
 on the phone number of the 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:39.409

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:15.940
 then we resume the presentation with 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:18.730
 the model gigaset sl910 similar to the 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:24.220

 extremely simple to use with 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:30.280
 an extremely large display then the 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.610
