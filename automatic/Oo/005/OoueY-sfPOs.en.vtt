00:00:02.662 --> 00:00:04.183
It happens without warning. 

00:00:04.343 --> 00:00:05.572
It’s like an accident,...

00:00:06.175 --> 00:00:07.186
...but it’s natural.

00:00:07.274 --> 00:00:09.581
At the beginning, you get to know him, and then you adapt. 

00:00:10.493 --> 00:00:12.493
At first, I only spoke to him at home...

00:00:12.644 --> 00:00:14.644
...and afterwards I began speaking to him on the street.

00:00:14.862 --> 00:00:17.024
It’s a bit like having a beauty spot on your buttocks.  

00:00:17.215 --> 00:00:19.760
Some things you just don’t talk about; you keep them to yourself. 

00:00:20.103 --> 00:00:23.153
There are depressed monsters, but mine is OK. 

00:00:39.922 --> 00:00:41.922
The glances of others are disturbing. 

00:00:42.422 --> 00:00:44.490
But when you know that everyone has a monster,...

00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:48.307
...you don’t see things in the same way and that’s good...

00:00:48.573 --> 00:00:50.152
...because that unconsciously creates connections. 

00:00:50.686 --> 00:00:52.552
A little smile in the metro.

00:00:53.052 --> 00:00:56.047
Some people don’t smile. They are the ones with depressed monsters. 

00:00:56.385 --> 00:00:58.566
Anyway, you should know that it’s not painful. 

00:01:19.089 --> 00:01:20.697
The monster has laughing fit. 

00:01:20.924 --> 00:01:22.924
He had one that lasted three days.

00:01:23.424 --> 00:01:25.424
He didn’t drink, he didn’t eat,...

00:01:25.548 --> 00:01:27.025
...it was nothing but laugh.

00:01:27.296 --> 00:01:29.146
It was a moment of tenderness.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.631
After he had tried to strangle me, but it doesn’t matter.

00:01:31.868 --> 00:01:34.228
It's normal, it is his nature. 

00:02:43.156 --> 00:02:45.156
Even so, it’s quite an intimate relationship. 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.676
You can’t just say everything.
