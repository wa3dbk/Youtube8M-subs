 perfect conditions 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.050
 dying this forty years later to 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.610
 Although in Chile there are no records 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.050
 of mothers under 10 have 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.320
 increased pregnancy figures 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.720
 adolescent and even childish 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.880
 annually thousand girls under 14 years 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.830
 they have their first child while from 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.060
 15 to 19 years old 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.110
 born in 51 children every thousand adolescents 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.450
 one of the lowest figures in america 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.520
 Latin but that still affects the 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.920
 most vulnerable sectors of the country and not 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.929
 only economically and educationally mind but 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.310
 also in health and is that being a mother 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.800
 when the body is not at all 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.810
 prepared brings its consequences 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.090
 pernÃ­a is that from 3 to 14 years that 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.440
 pregnant run multiple risks one of 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.390
 the most important ones as they are more 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.430
 chiquititas the guagua francamente no 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.070
 therefore, it is much more frequent 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.020
 or alteration of labor by 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.150
 Moreover the excess hormone 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.100
 produced as a function of pregnancy makes 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.540
 the epiphysis or the vital parts 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.460
 bones are closed so that they stop 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.110
 grow so they have to cause during 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.940
 childbirth and that they stop growing and they 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.530
 it is more chiquititas on the other hand the 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.260
 baby is another one that can suffer 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.970
 permanent or momentary sequelae in their 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.830
 most have to do with the development 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.770
 physical of these many times 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.420
 end with a disability 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.600
 usually pregnancies in girls or 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.340
 be less than 13 14 years are associated with 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.200
 growth restriction is to say the 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.030
 fetus the baby grows less than 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.620
 expected less than normal so 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.600
 they have more risks of doing 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.760
 complications in childbirth and even in 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.680
 the postpartum these guaguas as they have 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.020
 more risk also of being premature 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.550
 are at risk of having problems 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.350
 neurological respiratory and even 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.510
 visuals because they have a lot of time in 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.910
 incubator is about minors that 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.680
 they are just beginning to live and that 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.800
 they have to deliver completely to another 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.950
 his children some for lack of education 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.810
 sexual others for violation the reasons 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.280
 they are varied however it is a reality 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.660
 social present 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.150
 in some parts of the world has not 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.150
 improved but otherwise
