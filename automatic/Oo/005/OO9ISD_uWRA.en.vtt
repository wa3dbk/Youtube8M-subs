00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.359
 and we have the package of the new lights 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.820
 that have come to us for the wheels of 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.020
 the bike 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.020
 let's do then 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.430
 tran 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.080
 everything is well packaged 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.520
 and here we have the light bulbs 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:57.530
 here we have the yellow or green model 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.530
 and here we have the blue color model 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.110
 in total we have 4 green 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.680
 5 soles 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.289
 well now we open the bulb 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.920
 towards the person 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.659
 comes what is the bulb and a 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.800
 adapter for 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:36.280
 for the smallest valve 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.250
 it would be like this and the 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.170
 bulb but in our case the valve 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.619
 have 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.970
 it has a wider opening here 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.620
 We have the light bulb LEDs with 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.630
 terminations 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.010
 then proceed with the 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.460
 installation 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:02:04.180
 we take the bulb and simply the 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:06.370
 we open by the intermediate zone to thread 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.200
 we are left with the bottom part and 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:10.630
 here are the three piles 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.700
 button has paper and is 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.640
 protection 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.640
 a tap and the paper comes out 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.310
 and 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.430
 the stones always wear the polo 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.840
 positive on the bottom and the pole 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.150
 negative on the top 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.150
 we simply solder the bulb 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.890
 the light bulb is completely removable 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.800
 this part of here can also be 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.060
 open 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.940
 and this is the same 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:50.120
 is illuminated with movement and 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.910
 vibration already to place it on the valve 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.349
 of the good wheel here we are going to check 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.349
 the lighting of the bulb 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:02.750
 well with 1 tap and the movement 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.310
 fast is called much more like this 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.600
 will depend on the speed of old age is 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.600
 denominates more or less 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.670
 In the net 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:22.249
 the light bulbs are installed what would be 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.920
 the air inlet of the valve gives 

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:27.900
 to drink 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.900
 the plug is removed by default 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.200
 to rock and he gets 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.570
 the bulb also scratch 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:51.020
 until more or less is well 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.020
 subject 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.239
 well we bought it running
