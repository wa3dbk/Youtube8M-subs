myself<00:00:25.619> back<00:00:25.949> in<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.189> count<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.609> was

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
myself back in the count and that was

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.220 
myself back in the count and that was
kind<00:00:26.880> of<00:00:26.999> turning<00:00:27.330> point<00:00:27.509> for<00:00:27.570> man<00:00:27.839> that<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.109> was

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
kind of turning point for man that I was

kind of turning point for man that I was
a<00:00:28.259> little<00:00:28.410> bit<00:00:28.499> deep<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.800> game<00:00:28.949> but<00:00:29.160> that's

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
a little bit deep in the game but that's

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.040 
a little bit deep in the game but that's
really<00:00:29.849> when<00:00:30.089> I<00:00:30.150> felt<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.449> could<00:00:30.599> establish<00:00:30.990> a

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
really when I felt I could establish a

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.930 
really when I felt I could establish a
rhythm<00:00:31.199> into<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:31.980> locate<00:00:32.579> pretty<00:00:32.820> well

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940

in the first two just missed so just
kind<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.000> go<00:00:36.120> thought<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:37.100> continue<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.160> make

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340
