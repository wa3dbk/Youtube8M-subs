00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
that brings it over and then you can

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.860 
that brings it over and then you can
chain<00:02:54.400> six<00:02:54.670> again<00:02:54.940> one<00:02:55.390> two<00:02:56.459> three<00:02:57.569> I'm<00:02:58.569> sorry

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870

through<00:03:00.510> three<00:03:01.560> four<00:03:02.560> five<00:03:03.370> six<00:03:04.200> very<00:03:05.200> loosely

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
through three four five six very loosely

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.979 
through three four five six very loosely
and<00:03:05.920> then<00:03:06.820> you're<00:03:06.970> going<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.150> slip<00:03:07.959> stitch

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
and then you're going to slip stitch

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.890 
and then you're going to slip stitch
back<00:03:08.620> into<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.070> beginning<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:10.450> basically

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
back into the beginning so basically

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:18.120 
back into the beginning so basically
your<00:03:11.140> slip<00:03:11.410> stitching<00:03:11.980> twice<00:03:12.459> into<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:17.130> into

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
your slip stitching twice into the into

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.069 
your slip stitching twice into the into
the<00:03:18.280> double<00:03:18.609> crochet<00:03:18.970> from<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.540> ring<00:03:19.810> before

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
the double crochet from the ring before

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.300 
the double crochet from the ring before
now<00:03:20.650> you<00:03:20.709> can<00:03:20.980> see<00:03:21.310> this<00:03:21.489> a<00:03:21.549> lot<00:03:21.760> better<00:03:22.180> um<00:03:23.310> and

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
now you can see this a lot better um and

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.099 
now you can see this a lot better um and
I<00:03:24.430> also<00:03:24.730> think<00:03:25.150> it's<00:03:25.359> a<00:03:25.420> little<00:03:25.540> bit<00:03:25.690> easier<00:03:25.930> to

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
I also think it's a little bit easier to

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.920 
I also think it's a little bit easier to
see<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.530> with<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:27.549> first<00:03:28.060> yarn<00:03:28.359> being<00:03:28.690> one

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
see it with the first yarn being one

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.440 
see it with the first yarn being one
color<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.519> second<00:03:30.880> yard<00:03:31.090> being<00:03:31.299> a

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
color and the second yard being a

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.420 
color and the second yard being a
brighter<00:03:31.690> colors<00:03:32.049> you<00:03:32.230> could<00:03:32.350> really<00:03:32.530> see<00:03:35.430> you

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
brighter colors you could really see you

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.840 
brighter colors you could really see you
