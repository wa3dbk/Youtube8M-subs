00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
out and there it is I'm again I'm using

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.469 
out and there it is I'm again I'm using
these<00:01:55.190> to<00:01:55.399> pick<00:01:55.520> it<00:01:55.640> up<00:01:55.729> because<00:01:55.880> I'm<00:01:56.240> not

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
these to pick it up because I'm not

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.889 
these to pick it up because I'm not
trying<00:01:56.720> to<00:01:56.869> cut<00:01:56.990> myself<00:01:58.570> and<00:01:59.570> then<00:01:59.720> we<00:01:59.780> can

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
trying to cut myself and then we can

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:06.980 
trying to cut myself and then we can
just<00:02:00.020> pull<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.290> other<00:02:00.380> pieces<00:02:00.649> out

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.450 

now<00:02:07.990> you<00:02:08.080> can<00:02:08.229> see<00:02:08.440> that<00:02:08.649> everything<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:09.369> was

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
now you can see that everything that was

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.690 
now you can see that everything that was
little<00:02:09.970> black<00:02:10.149> class<00:02:10.450> is<00:02:10.720> all<00:02:10.869> gone<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:12.430> just

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
little black class is all gone you just

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.630 
little black class is all gone you just
see<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.910> insides<00:02:14.160> there's<00:02:15.160> just<00:02:15.340> sort<00:02:15.460> of

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
see the insides there's just sort of

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.200 
see the insides there's just sort of
cement<00:02:16.920> holding<00:02:17.920> all<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.490> pieces<00:02:18.730> in<00:02:18.910> there

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
cement holding all the pieces in there

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.690 
cement holding all the pieces in there
and<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.660> think<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:19.990> can<00:02:20.140> see<00:02:20.410> it<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:21.580> we're

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
and I think you can see it so we're

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.950 
and I think you can see it so we're
gonna<00:02:21.790> try<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.090> get<00:02:22.240> that<00:02:22.360> out<00:02:22.420> but<00:02:22.720> first

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
gonna try to get that out but first

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.250 
gonna try to get that out but first
we're<00:02:23.140> gonna<00:02:23.790> go<00:02:24.790> around<00:02:25.210> and<00:02:25.510> push<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.990> metal

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
we're gonna go around and push the metal

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.110 
we're gonna go around and push the metal
up<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.710> you<00:02:27.010> probably<00:02:27.280> can't<00:02:27.520> tell<00:02:27.730> what<00:02:28.060> I'm

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
up and you probably can't tell what I'm

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
up and you probably can't tell what I'm
doing<00:02:28.360> right<00:02:28.450> now<00:02:28.510> but<00:02:28.630> if<00:02:28.840> you<00:02:28.870> do<00:02:29.050> it

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
doing right now but if you do it

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:42.660 
doing right now but if you do it
yourself<00:02:29.230> you'll<00:02:29.560> be<00:02:29.620> able<00:02:29.740> to<00:02:29.890> say<00:02:41.670> there's

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
yourself you'll be able to say there's

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.370 
yourself you'll be able to say there's
this<00:02:42.820> little<00:02:43.000> tube<00:02:43.330> thing<00:02:43.600> in<00:02:43.720> there<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:44.260> got
