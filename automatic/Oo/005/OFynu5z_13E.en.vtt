head

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
head

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.440 
head
the<00:01:12.479> original<00:01:13.140> hat<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.310> movie<00:01:14.580> didn't

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the original hat on the movie didn't

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.280 
the original hat on the movie didn't
have<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:16.439> strap<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:17.100> was<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.340> fitted<00:01:17.850> hat<00:01:18.290> so

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
have this strap it was a fitted hat so

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.880 
have this strap it was a fitted hat so
this<00:01:19.979> was<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.700> Hat<00:01:21.110> that<00:01:22.110> he<00:01:22.409> wore<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:24.710> when<00:01:25.710> he

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
this was the Hat that he wore in when he

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.020 
this was the Hat that he wore in when he
went<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.479> 2015<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.750> his<00:01:28.500> son<00:01:29.040> was<00:01:29.610> wearing<00:01:29.820> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
went to 2015 and his son was wearing the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.480 
went to 2015 and his son was wearing the
hat<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.570> he<00:01:30.900> just<00:01:31.470> want<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.799> look<00:01:31.920> like<00:01:32.100> his<00:01:32.280> son

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
hat so he just want to look like his son

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.760 
hat so he just want to look like his son
I<00:01:32.520> guess<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.390> really<00:01:36.720> really<00:01:37.110> cool<00:01:37.229> I

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
I guess so it's really really cool I

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.140 
I guess so it's really really cool I
like<00:01:38.189> that<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.729> holographic<00:01:40.939> fabric<00:01:41.939> if

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
like that it's a holographic fabric if

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.780 
like that it's a holographic fabric if
you<00:01:42.270> want<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.600> call<00:01:42.810> all<00:01:43.170> material<00:01:43.860> and

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.429
