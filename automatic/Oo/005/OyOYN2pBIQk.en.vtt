00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 and the end is introduced around the little fingers 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:09.690
 towards each other being intercepted in 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:13.110
 center overlaid drag soft 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:15.450
 handcuffed knot tied with the back 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.490
 hand brushes so that the object was 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.520
 harder to untie him at all better all 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.990
 hold these bonds holding hands 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.099
 the enemy behind in the case of an attempt 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.590
 resistance 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:32.180
 sharp suppressed in this case blow 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.309
 in the groin in the temple and in this way 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.410
 related object can be escorted 1 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.219
 breaking grip on little fingers and second 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.100
 hand for grip on ear combo 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:47.430
 fixing asphyxiation 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.210
 here we show not only the technique but 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:55.260
 and binding tactics so first take 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.510
 an object on escorting a knot elbow and 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.559
 shoulder behind 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.910
 bring it to the vertical 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.570
 the obstacle is the best 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.390
 make the wall raise your free hand 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.400
 and painful effect 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.560
 stand on tiptoe 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.970
 Now it will be shown on tiptoe 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.100
 and press your chest and belly against the wall 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:24.689
 with your free hand you get mated 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:28.009
 You spread it to them on a double loop 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.079
 forearm of attacked arm above hand and 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:35.670
 running end encircling your neck 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:38.479
 object then wind up behind the second 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.360
 arm running end several times in tight 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:46.049
 circle the forearm of the second hand 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:51.770
 just above the brush and then around the plot 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:54.270
 viscous second-hand wrist 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:59.790
 then secure the binding 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:02.939
 at the place of the crosshair fix chassis 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.450
 the end at the place where the mating crosses 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.450
 on the back
