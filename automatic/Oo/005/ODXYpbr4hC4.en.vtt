00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.980
 how big is the probability with 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.859
 one cube three times in a row 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.420
 just number to die for 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:10.920
 yes there is of course close lie first 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.420
 to think about how big the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.820
 Probability is an even number 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.520
 to be allowed to dice once only 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:23.010
 So the probability one straight 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:26.039
 number in a litter just number the 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.630
 is yes what can come out then 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.730
 A dice can be a dice 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.009
 come out that once lies on top 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.170
 or in two or three or many 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.290
 or five- or as sixth 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.160
 all results throwing at the dice 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.300
 yes and this event are possible 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.120
 just number 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.760
 that occurs when I just a 2 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.920
 so diced here if I have a lot 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.510
 diced or if I have a six 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.059
 That means I have three 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.399
 results that just these conditions 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.730
 number here meet this event 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.010
 let in and I have a total of 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.570
 six possible results when throwing 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.580
 the dice so the probability 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.080
 for the even number in a litter 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.310
 is 36 or even half but what 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.080
 asked here it is not the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.939
 Probability for a beach litter 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.520
 the probability that that is 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.640
 get three times in a row so 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:30.290
 I need the probability 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:32.460
 three times even number in three throws 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.860
 That's what's in demand 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.810
 now every roll of the dice is 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.850
 independent events dice remembers 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.280
 Do not worry about what number he 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.630
 last time showed everyone 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.869
 it is a new one for the dice 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.430
 try new chance new luck therefore 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.259
 Can we do the multiplication rule 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.670
 apply and that means that we 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.290
 can say that probability 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:57.719
 here's the same 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:00.420
 probability even number in the first 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:05.430
 So that's exactly what we throw up here 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:09.450
 then just number 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:12.310
 straight number in the second throw times 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:17.290
 probability just number in 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.060
 third throw and have this 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.890
 probabilities are the same and the 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.989
 are each half as hear that 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.770
 That's what it's called up there 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:31.170
 is therefore just one stop times half 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:34.780
 half a second and that is then one 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.790
 Eighth so on average it will be me 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.250
 succeed in one of eight attempts 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.970
 an even number three times in a row 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.970
 to throw
