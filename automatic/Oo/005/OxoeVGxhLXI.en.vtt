00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.750
 good afternoon today we will get to know 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.429
 nodes and units dragon on the device 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.610
 represented on the site 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:17.119
 in this case the cone is represented 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:23.609
 diameter 83 by 28 centimeters 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:26.930
 the cone neck is 9 centimeters per 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:34.820
 incised part is 19 centimeters 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:41.300
 thread pitch 6.8 items cone base 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:47.270
 the model has a shaft fit diameter 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.920
 34-85 all three millimeters on the cone neck 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.510
 there are a number 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:59.430
 about the points that are needed for 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:06.200
 technological and operational 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:10.710
 make an appointment given about. 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.640
 used to fix the bolt 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.640
 from axial displacement 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.170
 and also for pressing this angle 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.330
 on the shaft 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.530
 it means it is about . 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:41.110
 bad fucking press the cone of the word 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.830
 not to damage the thread on the neck 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.740
 cone 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.640
 have a cylindrical pore surface in 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.320
 during operation is not recommended 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.420
 spoil 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:58.360
 what is it intended for mainly 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:03.880
 it is designed to go with the diameter 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:07.060
 34 of base diameter means on 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.550
 the diameter you need for 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.209
 making adapter see or 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.260
 bushings 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:16.540
 clit 1 to lower the diameter or mean 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.510
 console any adapter for 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.510
 fixing cones which corner 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:33.960
 we have help on clearance usually 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:37.200
 with the help of you, we are going to 10 main 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:40.800
 we have diameters depending on the power 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:46.990
 made 34-ka Pierre did not say and 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:51.690
 eighty five hundredths and 3985 further you 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:56.730
 see the bearing assembly in the 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.730
 Spike means thank you for your attention
