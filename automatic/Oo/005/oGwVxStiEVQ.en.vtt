 Tara Reid 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.110
 nothing wrong 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.360

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.790
 Brazil 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.820
 already 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.860
 soon 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.860
 walk 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.770
 to argentina 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.590
 log in 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
 to the network 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.890
 juliana alves 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.579
 not always the general tone is the most comfortable for us to play 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.240
 Did you notice that? 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.990
 Then we can do some things. 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.649
 one of them mx action guitar muffin was what i did 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.019
 the other is to move the chords to a more comfortable tonality 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.029
 the setting that chile joÃ£o 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:19.809
 was half played bass 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:21.429
 then the strings 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:24.919
 who is already accustomed to that tuning mice show she me 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:27.919
 will keep this statement 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:30.919
 file or 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:32.649
 soure 

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:35.649
 eno 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.439
 same 

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:41.649
 quiet 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:44.419
 So I'll start by explaining the introduction. 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:48.879
 in the very production that I did I divided the notes of the river into two parts 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.069
 that are 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.819
 amy 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:57.689
 the rapper perceives himself smaller and omit the 11th ocde 

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.000
 his support resembles that seventh of Wednesday 

00:03:01.749 --> 00:03:06.879
 it treats them only of a minor chord why then it is not ctb fourth is smaller with 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:09.609
 seven a pedestrian the first 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.609
 not only with seventh happens the same thing 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:15.469
 I'm going to take the minimum 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:18.469
 and I'm going to touch 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:21.439
 these notes are 5th 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.239
 It's friday 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.859
 the levada it stays in function 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.209
 of this soil 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.209
 do not be like that 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.079
 I'm going to make more cement. 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.079
 and you follow me there ok? 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:54.199
 she 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:04.189
 how did you see 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:06.430
 There's a lot of swine in that beat. 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.480
 precisely because of why it was included here 

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:13.769
 for you to have a little more trouble to do now I'll give you 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:14.749
 a hint 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:15.789
 green ti 

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:19.629
 You make the chords and ask a friend to do with the reef and hockey. 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.699
 only with the chords would it be 

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:38.809
 And look how it looks like this 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:48.189
 I'm going to slow down and you're with me here. 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:58.300
 how did you see 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.379
 it is a sequence of triumphs 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:02.319
 with muted motorbikes this 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:05.330
 always using corrÃªa 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.490
 OK 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.580
 so come on, the second part of the introduction 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.909
 agreements used yes minor 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:15.339
 show with the seventh largest 

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:18.029
 I did the show with the little guy there. 

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:21.089
 the simenorte two neighbors 

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:22.909
 the show as seventh largest 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:24.360
 once 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.339
 and dared to fight it once 

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:30.460
 observe that not this minor with 7min 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.460
 the used levada one here 

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:40.219
 var 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.349
 getting carried away with the chords 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.349
 stays like this 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:04.419
 one year 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.030
 the refrain 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.030
 use this same base with me 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:16.129
 it is in the air 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:18.039
 beyond union 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:21.449
 there is still more 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:24.290
 Calm down, then you just put these parts together. 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.240
 You can already play part first introduction. 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.669
 in turbulent second part no 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.280
 Now let's go, I'm going to use it for the chords. 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.659
 yes smaller 

00:06:34.659 --> 00:06:36.580
 this is definitely greater 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.400
 with that same levada 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.400
 stays like this 

00:06:43.249 --> 00:06:45.229
 mind 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:48.229
 fernandinho is the norm 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:53.279
 my idea 

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:55.879
 in engineering 

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:57.169
 maradona 

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:58.279
 does not give anything 

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:01.279
 caracas 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:06.589
 to finish 

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:09.699
 the via already make the agreement expected if smaller 

00:07:09.699 --> 00:07:12.490
 I did a show account with seventh largest 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.939
 I interrupted a little bit before 

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:17.939
 stayed like this 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:22.809
 each year 

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:24.439
 to react 

00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:25.870
 with annual increase 

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.190
 outside the area 

00:07:32.689 --> 00:07:34.029
 so that's it 

00:07:34.029 --> 00:07:37.859
 this song is great that you put on your spot because it has chords 

00:07:37.859 --> 00:07:42.669
 easy a levada was also a very well upbeat song 

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:46.720
 and being with the people who already have a certain facility already touched some more 

00:07:46.719 --> 00:07:47.350
 time 

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.670
 is that part that limited that will give a charm in power are what 

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.210
 but we until the next step 

00:07:56.409 --> 00:07:59.409
 / 

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:03.379
 anything 

00:08:04.839 --> 00:08:05.789
