00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
in at it helps it so it eliminates a lot

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.410 
in at it helps it so it eliminates a lot
of<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> toe<00:00:37.320> drag<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:39.180> don't<00:00:39.360> have

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
of the toe drag and that you don't have

to worry about catching those edges or
kitchen<00:00:41.550> your<00:00:41.640> toes<00:00:41.820> when<00:00:42.030> you're<00:00:42.180> trying<00:00:42.300> to

what<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.140> does<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.649> can<00:00:58.800> be<00:00:58.829> centered

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
what that does is this can be centered

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.139 
what that does is this can be centered
over<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> middle<00:00:59.609> here<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.789> it's<00:00:59.940> going<00:01:00.090> to

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
over the middle here and it's going to

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.819 
over the middle here and it's going to
rock<00:01:00.300> from<00:01:00.570> edge<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.719> edge<00:01:00.899> what<00:01:01.289> that<00:01:01.410> creates

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
rock from edge to edge what that creates

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.000 
rock from edge to edge what that creates
is<00:01:02.070> more<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.030> catch<00:01:03.239> free<00:01:03.570> feeling<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.830> also

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
is more of a catch free feeling it also

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.280 
is more of a catch free feeling it also
has<00:01:05.369> what<00:01:05.790> they<00:01:05.909> call<00:01:05.939> cruise<00:01:06.390> control<00:01:06.780> which

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
has what they call cruise control which

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.780 
has what they call cruise control which
makes<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.130> kind<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.369> lifts<00:01:08.670> up<00:01:08.760> the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
makes it so that it kind of lifts up the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.600 
makes it so that it kind of lifts up the
edges<00:01:09.180> near<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.600> toes<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:11.220> heels<00:01:11.490> so

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
edges near the toes and the heels so

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.010 
edges near the toes and the heels so
that<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:11.939> makes<00:01:12.150> it<00:01:12.330> so<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.630> don't<00:01:12.810> have

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
that it makes it so that you don't have

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.719 
that it makes it so that you don't have
to<00:01:13.140> worry<00:01:13.320> even<00:01:13.530> when<00:01:13.770> you<00:01:13.830> are<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.610> know

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
to worry even when you are you know

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.190 
to worry even when you are you know
pushing<00:01:15.150> putting<00:01:15.420> pressure<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.750> there<00:01:16.020> to

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
pushing putting pressure on there to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.679 
pushing putting pressure on there to
catch<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.710> edge<00:01:17.119> so<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.150> just<00:01:18.330> it's<00:01:18.659> a

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
catch that edge so you just it's a

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.820 
catch that edge so you just it's a
little<00:01:18.869> more<00:01:18.990> forgiving<00:01:19.380> actually<00:01:19.650> it's<00:01:19.770> a

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
little more forgiving actually it's a

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.490 
little more forgiving actually it's a
lot<00:01:19.979> more<00:01:20.159> forgiving<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.820> sense<00:01:21.500> you're

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
lot more forgiving in that sense you're

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.200 
lot more forgiving in that sense you're
coming<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.830> with<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.520> traditional<00:01:23.970> three

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
coming in with the traditional three

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.990

three set holes for the Burton's known

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.760 
three set holes for the Burton's known

have any questions of that just kind of
ask<00:01:32.400> on<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.790> side<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.030> things<00:01:33.210> also<00:01:34.280> as<00:01:35.280> for

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
ask on that side of things also as for

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.179 
ask on that side of things also as for
the<00:01:35.579> bass<00:01:35.759> here<00:01:36.200> what<00:01:37.200> we<00:01:37.290> got<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:38.040> going

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the bass here what we got is it's going

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.429 
the bass here what we got is it's going
to<00:01:38.250> be<00:01:38.400> it's<00:01:39.180> an<00:01:39.299> extruded<00:01:39.720> base<00:01:39.869> it's<00:01:40.229> kind<00:01:40.380> of

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
to be it's an extruded base it's kind of

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.810 
to be it's an extruded base it's kind of
that<00:01:40.530> entry-level<00:01:40.799> base<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.400> Burton<00:01:41.670> does

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
that entry-level base that Burton does

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.060 
that entry-level base that Burton does
but<00:01:42.509> what<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.320> really<00:01:43.890> low

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
but what it is is it's a really low

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.670 
but what it is is it's a really low
maintenance<00:01:44.250> base<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.780> lot<00:01:46.110> easier<00:01:46.560> to

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
maintenance base that is a lot easier to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.719 
maintenance base that is a lot easier to
deal<00:01:46.860> with<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.159> don't<00:01:47.310> have<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.520> worry<00:01:47.640> about

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
deal with you don't have to worry about

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.700 
deal with you don't have to worry about
waxing<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.360> nearly<00:01:48.659> as<00:01:48.750> often<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.259> also<00:01:49.380> takes

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
waxing it nearly as often it also takes

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.530 
waxing it nearly as often it also takes
quite<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.040> good<00:01:50.220> beating<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.970> as<00:01:51.090> you're<00:01:51.270> you

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
quite a good beating so as you're you

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.270 
quite a good beating so as you're you
know<00:01:51.659> getting<00:01:52.290> better<00:01:52.470> or<00:01:52.799> turning<00:01:53.070> up<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
know getting better or turning up the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.280 
know getting better or turning up the
board<00:01:53.520> or<00:01:53.759> running<00:01:54.420> into<00:01:54.570> skiers<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.170> hill

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
board or running into skiers on the hill

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.560 
board or running into skiers on the hill
that'll<00:01:55.590> be<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.880> it'll<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:57.030> able<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.210> take<00:01:57.420> the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
that'll be the it'll be able to take the

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.260 
that'll be the it'll be able to take the
beating<00:01:57.689> quite<00:01:58.020> well<00:01:58.969> it's<00:01:59.969> also<00:02:00.060> going<00:02:00.210> to

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
beating quite well it's also going to

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.270 
beating quite well it's also going to
have<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.570> fly<00:02:00.869> core<00:02:01.259> Burton<00:02:01.710> fly<00:02:01.890> core<00:02:02.159> which

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
have the fly core Burton fly core which

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.580 
have the fly core Burton fly core which
is<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.549> gonna<00:02:02.610> be<00:02:02.759> kind<00:02:02.909> of<00:02:02.969> their<00:02:03.590> their

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
is just gonna be kind of their their

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.230 
is just gonna be kind of their their
baseline<00:02:05.040> core<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.700> it's<00:02:05.820> going<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.000> be<00:02:06.060> full

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
baseline core so it's going to be full

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.300 
baseline core so it's going to be full
wood<00:02:06.450> material<00:02:06.930> all<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.140> way<00:02:07.229> throughout<00:02:07.500> but

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
wood material all the way throughout but

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.589 
wood material all the way throughout but
at<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.489> same<00:02:08.640> time<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.030> don't<00:02:09.119> have<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.420> worry

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
at the same time you don't have to worry

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.449 
at the same time you don't have to worry
about<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.959> they're<00:02:10.110> not<00:02:10.140> using<00:02:10.440> any<00:02:11.099> super

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
about it they're not using any super

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.740 
about it they're not using any super
light<00:02:11.610> woods<00:02:11.849> or<00:02:12.030> things<00:02:12.180> like<00:02:12.330> that<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.599> just

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
light woods or things like that is just

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.770 
light woods or things like that is just
a<00:02:12.810> super<00:02:13.110> solid<00:02:13.260> construct

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
a super solid construct

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.370 
a super solid construct
and<00:02:13.900> all<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.110> way<00:02:14.200> through<00:02:15.810> short<00:02:16.810> of<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:17.020> it

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
and all the way through short of that it

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.710 
and all the way through short of that it
is<00:02:17.650> going<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.100> be<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.459> directional<00:02:19.060> board<00:02:19.240> so

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
is going to be a directional board so

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.970 
is going to be a directional board so
the<00:02:19.840> nose<00:02:19.990> is<00:02:20.200> going<00:02:20.319> to<00:02:20.380> be<00:02:20.470> slightly<00:02:20.680> longer

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
the nose is going to be slightly longer

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.340 
the nose is going to be slightly longer
than<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.370> tail<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:22.420> what<00:02:22.569> that<00:02:22.720> makes<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.170> is

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
than the tail and what that makes it is

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.750 
than the tail and what that makes it is
it<00:02:23.620> just<00:02:23.800> makes<00:02:23.980> this<00:02:24.069> live<00:02:24.280> does<00:02:24.459> have<00:02:24.640> that

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
it just makes this live does have that

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.870 
it just makes this live does have that
definitive<00:02:25.270> edge<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:26.110> is<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.290> twin<00:02:26.620> shape

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
definitive edge it is a twin shape

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.430 
definitive edge it is a twin shape
underneath<00:02:27.880> so<00:02:28.270> with<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.690> wood<00:02:28.900> it's<00:02:29.380> going

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
underneath so with the wood it's going

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.190 
underneath so with the wood it's going
to<00:02:29.620> be<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.770> same<00:02:30.300> same<00:02:31.300> core<00:02:31.600> that<00:02:32.050> they're

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
to be the same same core that they're

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.510 
to be the same same core that they're
using<00:02:32.350> on<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.650> back<00:02:32.800> half<00:02:33.069> of<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.250> board<00:02:33.430> as

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
using on the back half of the board as

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.690 
using on the back half of the board as
they<00:02:33.610> are<00:02:33.700> on<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.850> front<00:02:33.970> half<00:02:35.190> so<00:02:36.190> no<00:02:36.400> worries

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
they are on the front half so no worries

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.010 
they are on the front half so no worries
along<00:02:37.000> those<00:02:37.180> lines<00:02:37.420> or<00:02:37.569> anything<00:02:37.720> that<00:02:37.840> that

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
along those lines or anything that that

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.900 
along those lines or anything that that
just<00:02:38.260> gives<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.530> a<00:02:38.650> nice<00:02:39.190> even<00:02:39.610> flex

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
just gives it a nice even flex

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.880 
just gives it a nice even flex
throughout<00:02:40.209> the<00:02:40.360> whole<00:02:40.510> thing<00:02:40.750> like<00:02:41.709> I<00:02:41.800> was

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
throughout the whole thing like I was

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.380 
throughout the whole thing like I was
saying<00:02:42.100> just<00:02:42.489> a<00:02:42.520> great<00:02:42.730> board<00:02:42.970> for<00:02:43.030> anyone

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
saying just a great board for anyone

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.520 
saying just a great board for anyone
who's<00:02:43.510> just<00:02:43.690> kind<00:02:43.810> of<00:02:43.900> looking<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.230> get<00:02:44.350> in<00:02:44.440> the
