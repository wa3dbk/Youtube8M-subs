side<00:01:32.220> missions<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.970> one<00:01:33.210> for<00:01:33.240> example<00:01:33.450> if

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
side missions so this one for example if

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.920 
side missions so this one for example if
we're<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.500> look<00:01:34.590> at<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.939> in<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.509> one<00:01:36.689> you're

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
we're to look at this in this one you're

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.330 
we're to look at this in this one you're
racing<00:01:37.320> against<00:01:37.470> knuckles<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:37.950> all<00:01:38.070> of<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
racing against knuckles and all of the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.679 
racing against knuckles and all of the
the<00:01:38.579> badniks<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.119> Moto<00:01:39.270> bug<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.540> seen

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the badniks like the Moto bug you seen

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.450 
the badniks like the Moto bug you seen
the<00:01:39.750> picture<00:01:39.930> there<00:01:40.079> it's<00:01:40.799> just<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:40.979> massive

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
the picture there it's just like massive

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.550 
the picture there it's just like massive
it's<00:01:41.610> like<00:01:41.759> 800<00:01:41.970> percent<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.540> normal<00:01:42.720> size<00:01:42.960> Wow

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
it's like 800 percent of normal size Wow

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.800 
it's like 800 percent of normal size Wow
so<00:01:43.770> all<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.640> these<00:01:44.759> are<00:01:44.820> completely<00:01:45.630> optional

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810
