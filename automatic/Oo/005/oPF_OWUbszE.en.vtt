really truly believe is a dupe for the
Mac<00:03:40.170> highlighters<00:03:40.830> so<00:03:41.370> I'm<00:03:41.610> just<00:03:41.730> blending

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
this and this is going to give us an

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.530 
this and this is going to give us an
extra<00:03:43.800> highlight<00:03:44.280> before<00:03:44.790> applying<00:03:45.239> our

just blending it with a damp Beauty

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.850 
just blending it with a damp Beauty
Blender<00:04:05.360> so<00:04:06.360> my<00:04:06.510> main<00:04:06.630> focus<00:04:06.900> for<00:04:07.110> using<00:04:07.739> the

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
Blender so my main focus for using the

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.240 
Blender so my main focus for using the
yellow<00:04:08.160> corrector<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:09.480> heavy<00:04:10.250> concealer

yellow corrector and a heavy concealer

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.770 
yellow corrector and a heavy concealer
is<00:04:11.430> just<00:04:11.670> because<00:04:11.940> she<00:04:12.180> had<00:04:12.269> a<00:04:12.299> very<00:04:12.569> intense

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.539 
is just because she had a very intense
highlight<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.590> I<00:04:14.010> thought<00:04:14.190> it<00:04:14.340> would<00:04:14.430> be

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
highlight and I thought it would be

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.659
