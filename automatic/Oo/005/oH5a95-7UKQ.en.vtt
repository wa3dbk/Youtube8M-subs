00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:22.000
Sleep, my child, and peace attend thee
All through the night

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:40.000
Guardian angels God will send thee
All through the night

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:50.100
Soft the drowsy hours are creeping
Hill and dale in slumber sleeping

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.300
I my loving vigil keeping
All through the night

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.540
While the moon her watch is keeping
All through the night

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:27.150
While the weary world is sleeping
All through the night

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.590
O'er thy spirit gently stealing
Visions of delight revealing

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:51.770
Breathes a pure and holy feeling
All through the night
