you can make through our that actually
would<00:01:23.560> resonate<00:01:24.310> me

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
would resonate me

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.050 
would resonate me
and<00:01:25.150> your<00:01:25.960> own<00:01:26.140> tribe<00:01:28.110> maybe<00:01:29.110> in<00:01:29.290> some<00:01:29.530> ways

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
and your own tribe maybe in some ways

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:46.770 
and your own tribe maybe in some ways
sound<00:01:31.060> as<00:01:31.360> a<00:01:31.390> way<00:01:31.659> of<00:01:31.690> touching<00:01:31.990> at<00:01:32.590> a<00:01:32.619> distance

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.530 

I<00:01:47.159> started<00:01:48.159> to<00:01:48.220> look<00:01:48.369> about<00:01:48.610> where<00:01:49.119> this<00:01:49.240> thing

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
I started to look about where this thing

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.260 
I started to look about where this thing
could<00:01:49.900> possibly<00:01:50.290> go<00:01:50.470> where<00:01:50.680> this<00:01:50.799> icon<00:01:51.520> of<00:01:51.760> in

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
could possibly go where this icon of in

00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:01.570 
could possibly go where this icon of in
a<00:01:52.330> western<00:01:52.690> music<00:01:52.780> could<00:01:53.200> go
