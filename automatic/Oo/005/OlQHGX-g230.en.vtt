00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
little more forgiving in terms of the

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.170 
little more forgiving in terms of the
blending<00:03:28.889> that<00:03:29.099> might<00:03:29.340> be<00:03:29.489> a<00:03:29.519> good<00:03:29.729> one<00:03:29.909> and

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
there you end up with kind of a softer

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.090 
there you end up with kind of a softer
peach<00:04:21.150> if<00:04:21.479> you<00:04:21.810> the<00:04:22.229> more<00:04:22.440> you<00:04:22.469> blend

peach if you the more you blend
where<00:04:23.250> you<00:04:23.340> blend<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.790> more<00:04:23.970> I<00:04:24.270> guess<00:04:24.930> muted

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
where you blend the more I guess muted

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.620 
where you blend the more I guess muted
the<00:04:25.920> color<00:04:26.160> will<00:04:26.400> get<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:26.880> then<00:04:27.360> there's<00:04:27.540> a
