00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.620 
complaining 12 and 18 weeks out now
and<00:02:17.890> I'm<00:02:18.520> at<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.700> stage<00:02:18.970> where<00:02:19.180> most<00:02:19.360> people

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
and I'm at a stage where most people

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.770 
and I'm at a stage where most people
usually<00:02:19.780> start<00:02:19.990> dieting<00:02:20.650> at<00:02:21.400> 12<00:02:21.700> weeks<00:02:21.940> out<00:02:22.210> so

usually start dieting at 12 weeks out so

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:23.880 
usually start dieting at 12 weeks out so
I<00:02:22.810> think<00:02:22.900> I'm<00:02:23.080> in<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.290> pretty<00:02:23.500> good<00:02:23.620> position

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
I think I'm in a pretty good position

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.800 
I think I'm in a pretty good position
still<00:02:24.430> think<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:24.790> have<00:02:24.880> another<00:02:25.030> 5<00:02:25.330> pounds<00:02:25.780> to

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
still think I have another 5 pounds to

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.890 
still think I have another 5 pounds to
lose<00:02:25.930> if<00:02:26.290> not<00:02:26.620> more<00:02:27.060> one<00:02:28.060> thing<00:02:28.240> I<00:02:28.330> noticed<00:02:28.690> is

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
lose if not more one thing I noticed is

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.540 
lose if not more one thing I noticed is
the<00:02:28.930> more<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.260> lose<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.830> more<00:02:30.010> I<00:02:30.040> realize<00:02:30.400> I

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
the more I lose the more I realize I

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.060 
the more I lose the more I realize I
have<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.970> lose

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
have to lose

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.830
