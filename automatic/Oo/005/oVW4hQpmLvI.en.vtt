basically<00:00:00.630> the<00:00:01.020> general<00:00:01.319> definitional<00:00:01.860> here

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
basically the general definitional here

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.340 
basically the general definitional here
of<00:00:02.129> parkour<00:00:02.550> is<00:00:02.850> that<00:00:03.389> it's<00:00:03.780> moving<00:00:04.200> through

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
of parkour is that it's moving through

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.480 
of parkour is that it's moving through
an<00:00:04.440> environment<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:04.980> quickest<00:00:05.279> most

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
an environment the quickest most

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.980 
an environment the quickest most
efficient<00:00:05.970> way<00:00:06.000> possible<00:00:06.089> while<00:00:06.720> staying

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
efficient way possible while staying

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.750 
efficient way possible while staying
safe<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.500> it<00:00:07.980> basically<00:00:08.099> teaches<00:00:08.670> you<00:00:08.730> to

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
safe and it basically teaches you to

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.860 
safe and it basically teaches you to
treat<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.120> environment<00:00:09.540> like<00:00:09.599> it's<00:00:09.750> an

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
treat the environment like it's an

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.240 
treat the environment like it's an
obstacle<00:00:10.139> course<00:00:10.260> so<00:00:10.769> it<00:00:10.830> teaches<00:00:11.099> you<00:00:11.219> to

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
obstacle course so it teaches you to

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.879 
obstacle course so it teaches you to
move<00:00:11.460> over<00:00:11.730> walls<00:00:11.940> by<00:00:12.380> climbing<00:00:13.380> or<00:00:13.559> running

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
move over walls by climbing or running

and what I can do decided I want to try
it<00:01:04.549> tell<00:01:05.549> my<00:01:05.700> indecisiveness<00:01:06.330> you<00:01:07.320> can't

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
it tell my indecisiveness you can't

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.350 
it tell my indecisiveness you can't
really<00:01:07.590> be<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.890> size<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.310> parkour<00:01:08.640> you

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
really be in the size of in parkour you

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.539 
really be in the size of in parkour you
have<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.380> go<00:01:10.500> under<00:01:10.740> percent<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.130> everything

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
have to go under percent on everything

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.990 
have to go under percent on everything
or<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.210> die<00:01:12.420> so<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.920> mean<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.460> you'll<00:01:14.729> and

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
or you die so I mean and you'll and

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.090 
or you die so I mean and you'll and
indirectly<00:01:15.570> that's<00:01:16.470> what<00:01:16.590> happens<00:01:16.890> when<00:01:16.979> you

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
indirectly that's what happens when you

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.280 
indirectly that's what happens when you
don't<00:01:17.250> go<00:01:17.369> hundred<00:01:17.580> percent<00:01:17.850> very<00:01:18.780> say<00:01:18.990> things

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
don't go hundred percent very say things

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.859 
don't go hundred percent very say things
I<00:01:19.560> feel<00:01:20.159> like<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.790> know<00:01:20.909> no<00:01:21.119> matter<00:01:21.270> how<00:01:21.570> much

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
I feel like you know no matter how much

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.539 
I feel like you know no matter how much
we<00:01:22.229> go<00:01:22.350> out<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.500> train<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.979> how<00:01:23.100> much<00:01:23.220> we

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
we go out and train and how much we

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.340 
we go out and train and how much we
progress<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.450> move<00:01:24.780> forward<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.259> our

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
progress and move forward in our

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.469 
progress and move forward in our
movement<00:01:25.799> it's<00:01:26.640> always<00:01:26.909> good<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.150> go<00:01:27.270> back<00:01:27.360> to

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
movement it's always good to go back to

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.749 
movement it's always good to go back to
basics<00:01:27.900> it's<00:01:28.590> always<00:01:28.829> good<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.070> just<00:01:29.549> drill

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
basics it's always good to just drill

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.490 
basics it's always good to just drill
those<00:01:29.939> basics<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.659> really<00:01:31.110> get<00:01:31.259> them<00:01:31.350> down

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
those basics and really get them down

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.560 
those basics and really get them down
get<00:01:31.799> them<00:01:31.860> smooth<00:01:32.250> so<00:01:32.579> that<00:01:32.610> when<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.420> time

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
get them smooth so that when the time

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.800 
get them smooth so that when the time
comes<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> long<00:01:35.369> run<00:01:35.729> of<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.509> bunch

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
comes and you have a long run of a bunch

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.929 
comes and you have a long run of a bunch
of<00:01:36.930> different<00:01:37.380> basic<00:01:37.950> movements<00:01:38.460> strung

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
of different basic movements strung

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.539 
of different basic movements strung
together<00:01:39.119> it's<00:01:39.840> just<00:01:40.259> muscle<00:01:40.650> memory<00:01:40.950> you

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
together it's just muscle memory you

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.700 
together it's just muscle memory you
just<00:01:41.729> move<00:01:42.030> through<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:43.049> very<00:01:43.140> fluid<00:01:43.500> and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
just move through it it's very fluid and

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.190 
just move through it it's very fluid and
I<00:01:44.640> think<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.880> can<00:01:45.030> say<00:01:45.149> for<00:01:45.180> all<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:45.540> us<00:01:45.659> it's<00:01:45.899> way

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
I think I can say for all of us it's way

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.720 
I think I can say for all of us it's way
easier<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.710> do<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.829> jump<00:01:47.100> when<00:01:47.280> you're

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
easier to do a jump when you're

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.250 
easier to do a jump when you're
and<00:01:48.060> collected<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.870> then<00:01:48.960> when<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.230> comes

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
and collected and then when it comes

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.530 
and collected and then when it comes
time<00:01:49.530> for<00:01:49.650> that<00:01:49.920> big<00:01:50.130> jump<00:01:50.340> you're<00:01:50.790> calm<00:01:51.300> you

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
time for that big jump you're calm you

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.430 
time for that big jump you're calm you
know<00:01:51.660> you're<00:01:51.780> gonna<00:01:51.870> be<00:01:51.990> able<00:01:52.050> to<00:01:52.170> do<00:01:52.260> it<00:01:52.290> right

actually<00:02:55.110> when<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:55.440> really<00:02:55.709> take<00:02:55.860> parkour

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
actually when you really take parkour

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.160 
actually when you really take parkour
seriously<00:02:56.820> it<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.240> all<00:02:57.450> about<00:02:57.570> progression<00:02:57.870> to

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
seriously it is all about progression to

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.900 
seriously it is all about progression to
training<00:02:58.530> when<00:02:58.680> people<00:02:59.280> start<00:02:59.520> we<00:02:59.670> have<00:02:59.700> them

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
training when people start we have them

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.490 
training when people start we have them
start<00:03:00.120> at<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.420> very<00:03:00.450> basic<00:03:01.020> level<00:03:01.050> of<00:03:01.320> fitness

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
start at the very basic level of fitness

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.050 
start at the very basic level of fitness
just<00:03:01.920> to<00:03:02.040> get<00:03:02.190> themselves<00:03:02.340> strong<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.940> ready

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
just to get themselves strong and ready

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.550 
just to get themselves strong and ready
for<00:03:03.360> concrete<00:03:03.930> because<00:03:04.110> it's<00:03:04.260> harder<00:03:04.530> than

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
for concrete because it's harder than

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.680 
for concrete because it's harder than
any<00:03:04.830> other<00:03:04.980> service<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:06.030> we<00:03:06.090> work<00:03:06.239> with

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
any other service that we work with

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.470 
any other service that we work with
so<00:03:07.350> you<00:03:08.100> always<00:03:08.280> start<00:03:08.640> at<00:03:08.790> a<00:03:08.820> small<00:03:09.060> level<00:03:09.240> in

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
so you always start at a small level in

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.820 
so you always start at a small level in
progress<00:03:09.750> slowly<00:03:10.020> so<00:03:10.320> you're<00:03:10.470> always<00:03:10.590> ready

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
progress slowly so you're always ready

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.170 
progress slowly so you're always ready
for<00:03:10.980> what<00:03:11.070> you're<00:03:11.190> going<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.370> do<00:03:11.490> if<00:03:12.060> you

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
for what you're going to do if you

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.020 
for what you're going to do if you
practice<00:03:12.600> smart<00:03:13.380> it's<00:03:14.070> actually<00:03:14.310> a<00:03:14.580> really

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
practice smart it's actually a really

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.790 
practice smart it's actually a really
safe<00:03:15.300> activity<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.930> do<00:03:16.050> when<00:03:16.680> we're

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
safe activity to do when we're

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.960 
safe activity to do when we're
practicing<00:03:16.920> parkour<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.670> we're<00:03:17.760> doing<00:03:17.850> the

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
practicing parkour and we're doing the

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.040 
practicing parkour and we're doing the
training<00:03:18.300> and<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.630> drills<00:03:18.870> in<00:03:19.020> the

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
training and the drills in the

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:20.750 
training and the drills in the
progression<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.710> lot<00:03:19.980> of<00:03:20.130> what<00:03:20.250> we<00:03:20.370> do<00:03:20.520> is<00:03:20.730> a

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
progression a lot of what we do is a

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.970 
progression a lot of what we do is a
conditioning<00:03:21.720> based<00:03:21.960> stuff<00:03:22.200> so<00:03:22.590> it's<00:03:22.740> a<00:03:22.800> lot

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
conditioning based stuff so it's a lot

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.340 
conditioning based stuff so it's a lot
of<00:03:23.010> working<00:03:24.000> out<00:03:24.120> but<00:03:24.360> in<00:03:24.450> a<00:03:24.510> park<00:03:24.750> or<00:03:24.900> specific

sort of way basically backwards bear
crawls<00:03:27.960> upstairs<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.860> that's<00:03:29.340> an

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
crawls upstairs and that's an

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.520 
crawls upstairs and that's an
exceedingly<00:03:29.970> good<00:03:30.450> workout<00:03:30.990> for<00:03:31.020> parkour
