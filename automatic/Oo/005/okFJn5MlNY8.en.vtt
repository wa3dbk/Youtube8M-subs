00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.780
 touch you can with Velcro light then 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.569

 the pouch is now that I have pulley in it 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.440
 I did a really natural one and that 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.090
 is of course the inside of the bag 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.620
 so you can actually put everything in there 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.630

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.049
 just enough space around your headset 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.630
 so maybe the number here 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.160
 you can also do them if you want or 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.390
 Of course you do that makes deforestation 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.130
 not that about cars does him in this 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.359
 because you put it loose in it and you have 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.620
 basically everything you need 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.549

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.320

 few events and I go to few 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.590
 months from me to put him there 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.600
 being able to play there for a while 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.980

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.480

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.819
 shoulder 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.250

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:01.830
 we call him over your shoulder keys 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.230
 That 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.120
 You understand what I meant and box 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.350
 which you know was the backpack 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.820
 of course you can also use it 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.960
 for school because your school books fit there 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.210
 also very easy to use 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.260

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.190
 must of course what I have between you now 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.480
 poor when back to school 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.980
 I can just carry this bag some 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.120
 really is a whole chilling backpack everything 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.800
 fits in with what she wants to get rid of 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.730
 of course also a nice one 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.010
 extra that sit nice 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.540
 2mm to plug to open your backpack 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.530
 close and I can even do it 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.320
 a lock on 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.520
 so fuck you all sorry i can 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.960
 here also a lock on so see k 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.580
 you see those two of those lips you do 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.960
 over each other in doing something and I rob 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.330
 where no one pair meets your place 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.860
 for example if you happen to be somewhere by accident 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.600
 leave it behind and when you return I will 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.500
 stutter war on nature and sick place 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.480
 also in it 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.560
 super you the bag you can review you 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.640
 it was not really necessary to review 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.690
 marrum 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.520
 it just it just a handy thing 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.380
 so you know especially for the persons who 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.360
 really just traveling a lot with one 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.190
 games blunders complete this people up 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.860
 this for example on dick no shop op 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:07.140
 dick and angry and we are all 4 too 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.980
 this backpack otherwise did the finesse with it 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.360
 to take 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.890
 Playstation how they won't take it 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:12.240
 of course you stand there but 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.620
 take a headset meter check 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.600
 Take wiring with you if you go 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.260
 an event is going then you have to do that yourself 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.940
 take 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.440
 if you go to first look or so 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.210
 if oncology wants to play it, it is there 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.590
 for you if you are really going to a competition 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.900
 really just play for money 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.340
 For example, you must take everything with you 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.350
 can take and that's why it is 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.669
 very handy for that but this was it 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.870
 a review I hope you do something about it 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:32.340
 have learned of course in the decision 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.890
 is everything explained you can this bag 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.270
 also buy in an advantage package then 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.440
 buy the astro and this bag 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.060
 at the same time 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.260
 and then you are really 50 euros cheaper 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.360
 or something and you can do another 

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.610
 benefit package buy that is the astro 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.620
 the google glass astro and still the astro 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:48.300
 headset and then you also have something of 60 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.710
 euro benefit large so all states one 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.180
 decision still explained and then me 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:52.080
 if I missed something I think now 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.160
