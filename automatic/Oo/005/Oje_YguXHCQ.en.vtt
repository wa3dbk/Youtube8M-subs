comfort which is even smoother than just
normal<00:03:25.069> driving<00:03:26.069> mode<00:03:26.780> I'll<00:03:27.780> also<00:03:28.049> tell<00:03:28.380> you

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
normal driving mode I'll also tell you

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.620 
normal driving mode I'll also tell you
that<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:28.799> does<00:03:29.010> have<00:03:29.250> an<00:03:29.430> auto<00:03:29.760> dimming<00:03:29.910> mirror
