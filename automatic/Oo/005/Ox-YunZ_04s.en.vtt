to<00:01:13.140> animate<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.649> sort<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:13.830> things<00:01:13.979> we<00:01:14.100> had<00:01:14.220> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
to animate the sort of things we had to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.600 
to animate the sort of things we had to
animate<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:14.970> have<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.299> be<00:01:15.420> able<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.689> fully

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610

understand<00:01:17.610> how<00:01:18.060> horses<00:01:18.360> work<00:01:19.490> certainly<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
understand how horses work certainly the

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.200 
understand how horses work certainly the
face<00:01:20.940> is<00:01:21.210> very<00:01:21.360> different<00:01:21.780> from<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.990> real<00:01:22.140> horse

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
face is very different from a real horse

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.609 
face is very different from a real horse
because<00:01:24.210> there's<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> lot<00:01:24.539> of<00:01:24.570> acting<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.440> it

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
because there's a lot of acting in it

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.529 
because there's a lot of acting in it
quite<00:01:26.100> anthropomorphic<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.360> eyes<00:01:27.509> are

00:01:27.529 --> 00:01:27.539 
quite anthropomorphic so the eyes are

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:29.600 
quite anthropomorphic so the eyes are
quite<00:01:28.259> different<00:01:28.590> from<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.950> real<00:01:29.100> horse<00:01:29.369> and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
quite different from a real horse and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.980 
quite different from a real horse and
you<00:01:29.670> see<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.909> lot<00:01:30.119> more<00:01:30.149> whites<00:01:30.539> around<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.960> eye

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
you see a lot more whites around the eye

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.130 
you see a lot more whites around the eye
so<00:01:31.140> you<00:01:31.470> can<00:01:31.649> see<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.799> direction<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.520> and

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
so you can see I direction and and

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:49.520 
so you can see I direction and and
eyebrows<00:01:34.140> which<00:01:34.619> horses<00:01:35.070> don't<00:01:35.369> really<00:01:35.820> have

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.340 

spirit<00:01:50.530> really<00:01:51.310> was<00:01:51.580> the<00:01:51.730> first<00:01:52.140> movie<00:01:53.140> in

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
spirit really was the first movie in

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.820 
spirit really was the first movie in
which<00:01:53.530> there<00:01:53.860> was<00:01:54.070> a<00:01:54.370> absolute<00:01:55.830> connection

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
which there was a absolute connection

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.450 
which there was a absolute connection
between<00:01:57.070> a<00:01:57.790> hand-drawn<00:01:58.720> character<00:01:59.710> and<00:02:00.100> a

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
between a hand-drawn character and a

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.550 
between a hand-drawn character and a
computer-generated<00:02:01.470> character<00:02:04.470> there's<00:02:05.470> a

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
computer-generated character there's a

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.740 
computer-generated character there's a
great<00:02:06.190> opening<00:02:06.670> shot<00:02:06.940> of<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.150> movie<00:02:07.420> in<00:02:07.720> which

spirit runs up onto the top of a hill

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.300 
spirit runs up onto the top of a hill
side<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.720> in<00:02:10.990> the<00:02:11.080> middle<00:02:11.560> of<00:02:11.680> that<00:02:11.800> shot<00:02:12.100> it

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310

side and in the middle of that shot it
starts<00:02:12.760> out<00:02:12.940> as<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.180> CG<00:02:13.660> shot<00:02:14.170> and<00:02:14.500> about

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
starts out as a CG shot and about

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.620 
starts out as a CG shot and about
two-thirds<00:02:15.490> of<00:02:15.640> the<00:02:15.700> way<00:02:15.760> through<00:02:15.880> it<00:02:16.209> as<00:02:16.450> the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
two-thirds of the way through it as the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.680 
two-thirds of the way through it as the
character<00:02:16.840> really<00:02:17.380> comes<00:02:17.770> into<00:02:17.980> foreground

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
character really comes into foreground

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.190 
character really comes into foreground
the<00:02:19.690> animator<00:02:20.170> took<00:02:20.530> over<00:02:20.920> I<00:02:21.190> still<00:02:22.120> had<00:02:22.810> a

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
the animator took over I still had a

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.230 
the animator took over I still had a
version<00:02:24.010> of<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.370> computer<00:02:24.790> spirit

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
version of the computer spirit

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.690 
version of the computer spirit
underneath<00:02:25.930> my<00:02:26.140> drawings<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:27.130> I<00:02:27.160> had<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.400> really

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
underneath my drawings so I had a really

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.900 
underneath my drawings so I had a really
good<00:02:28.030> bit<00:02:28.390> of<00:02:28.480> reference<00:02:29.020> for<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.350> horse

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
good bit of reference for a horse

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.699 
good bit of reference for a horse
turning<00:02:30.910> in<00:02:31.000> space<00:02:31.330> that<00:02:32.050> last<00:02:32.320> part<00:02:32.590> of<00:02:32.650> the

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
turning in space that last part of the

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:33.960 
turning in space that last part of the
shot<00:02:32.830> even<00:02:33.070> though<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.160> was<00:02:33.370> animating<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:33.880> by

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
shot even though I was animating it by

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.110 
shot even though I was animating it by
hand<00:02:34.209> over<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.570> top<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:36.370> many<00:02:36.550> things<00:02:36.820> about

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
hand over the top so many things about

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.780 
hand over the top so many things about
that<00:02:37.360> movie<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:37.780> think<00:02:38.020> that<00:02:38.440> were<00:02:38.790> original

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
that movie I think that were original

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.050 
that movie I think that were original
were<00:02:40.200> pioneering<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.280> think<00:02:42.790> it's<00:02:42.910> the

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
were pioneering and I think it's the
