00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.950 
money matters it's a very expensive
country<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.490> think<00:01:47.640> money<00:01:48.390> does<00:01:48.600> matter<00:01:48.840> a

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
country so I think money does matter a

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.780 
country so I think money does matter a
little<00:01:49.079> bit<00:01:49.229> here<00:01:49.470> generally<00:01:50.189> yes<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.640> can

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
little bit here generally yes you can

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.010 
little bit here generally yes you can
tell<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.360> very<00:01:51.600> wealthy<00:01:51.990> country

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
but it I think that's just one of the

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.429 
but it I think that's just one of the
things<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.570> makes<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.840> nice<00:01:55.020> too<00:01:55.290> is
