00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.650
 hello everyone i hope you 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.289
 go well today I have the pleasure 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.000
 to make a short video about gta 5 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.619
 so that will be a very quick return 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.119
 and also to tell you that I have a lot 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.039
 small projects that will happen so 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.289
 it's not necessarily right now 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.019
 I'm already waiting a little bit 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.279
 to do some more ex while waiting 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.539
 but what I would say by the cgt 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.279
 I always explained to you it's not 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.610
 a game is over there are a lot of things 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.680
 to do 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.149
 missing what is a little bit boring 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.380
 is that there are a lot of things that 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.579
 I have already presented so much 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.079
 ask to do that to do that 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.879
 do it but it is simply enough 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.530
 to browse but video I'm one of 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.989
 only youtuber who did 300 videos on 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.370
 I was a little bit even more it's not 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.450
 to boast about its shares as inflating the 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.590
 ankles is that I really did 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.399
 of all they had to do on 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.449
 gta 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.980
 I still have a lot of things to do 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.510
 there are things that I spoke with 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.070
 nico in the video is that I'm going 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.690
 try to be able to find ideas 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.070
 enough a new because as you 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.539
 know I do not like doing all the time 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.430
 same thing what it's good to do 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.690
 parts of subscribers but it will be 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.799
 all the time the same thing a little bit 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.119
 boring to do all the time rolled a 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.700
 little bridge henri do the robberies 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.810
 it's yeah that's not going to be 2000 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.549
 episodes on it I was going 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.409
 to say that I find news 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.860
 ideas coming out a little bit of 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.320
 ordinary 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.670
 it's a lot more interesting for 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.590
 you to watch a video you do not have 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.240
 not necessarily a permanent China route 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.560
 that's why I put a little bit 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.240
 of time out budget knowing that he 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.700
 are still 300 videos that came out 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.840
 so it's not something that has happened 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.340
 do it like that by snapping fingers 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.110
 I assure you that requires a lot of 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.700
 work a lot of time and at the same time 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.780
 time I am someone very active 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.759
 So as you could see it is 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.770
 just a little question of patience and 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.360
 also do not hesitate for those who do not 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.740
 not necessarily seen all my videos of gta 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.450
 I do not ask you all to watch them 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.649
 but still makes an effort where they give me 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.060
 fifty thousand times the same 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.470
 issue is when you'll make 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.579
 robbery ended up making a plane 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.130
 it's when you're going to do your part to 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.930
 my videos you will find your happiness and 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.970
 flax small stuff I try to 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.259
 do you very soon 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.570
 there I landed on the roads that makes 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.920
 pleasure so I said trick I'm going 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.000
 to do you soon it's 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.890
 activities that I do not necessarily have 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.930
 present and that's why I speak 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.280
 is a little bit that they were a 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.659
 little bit the ideas that I can 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.069
 develop with nico since frankly 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.500
 I told him listening and 300 videos I 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.600
 start 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.130
 saturated but here I do not want to have 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.810
 a permanent routine that settles 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.670
 so to take a little bit of talk about 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.160
 everything and anything good we concluded 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.270
 that it was much better to do my 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.250
 small way that we have not necessarily 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:22.840
 time to present that to do everything 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.430
 the time of the robbery of the robbery of the 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.570
 robbery we will make one that of course 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.650
 she is abandoned who will go out who 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.480
 will allow us to have the bank 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.400
 and / or so all know to be in 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.660
 construction and I will also take 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.690
 a few subscribers but I will also try 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.530
 to take some subscribers enough 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.060
 correct because sometimes you take 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.620
 to unsubscribe is to help save 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.730
 may burst everyone is not 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.520
 obviously obvious to make videos 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.600
 with alas this video so why am I 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.860
 wanted to do it is look good 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.209
 I already went for a walk with 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.860
 this car there and I wanted 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.970
 occupied the c 130 and here I leave you 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.910
 listen in my mouth is not too much 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.670
 strong as soon as he saw me arrive and 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.370
 referrals years you will not have your one c-130 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.580
 you can still touch your hair 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.780
 what will have nothing no there are the friends so 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.010
 it was a pretty short video 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.150
 at the same time it's a double video 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.950
 it was more to show a little bit 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.030
 the car that you all liked is 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.739
 why what I have not done 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.390
 breech and 130 and to show you a 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.100
 little bit the college and it was mostly for 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:16.390
 talk to you who has a lot of projects that 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.100
 are under construction 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.360
 question of patience if you have 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.260
 frankly time to wait for you 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.120
 go find your happiness 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.290
 and that's the same watchdog I'm god 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.950
 if he did not ask ten thousand times 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.950
 question soon
