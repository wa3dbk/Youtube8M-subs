tenders catching more and more demanding
I<00:04:02.560> mean<00:04:02.860> they<00:04:02.980> have<00:04:03.130> been<00:04:03.310> they<00:04:03.460> have<00:04:03.550> been

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
I mean they have been they have been

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.010 
I mean they have been they have been
demanding<00:04:04.090> in<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.270> past<00:04:04.480> but<00:04:04.660> there<00:04:04.810> will<00:04:04.900> be

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
demanding in the past but there will be

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.410 
demanding in the past but there will be
more<00:04:05.200> and<00:04:05.380> more<00:04:05.410> in<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.620> future<00:04:05.830> we<00:04:06.100> believe

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
more and more in the future we believe

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.380 
more and more in the future we believe
which<00:04:07.420> I<00:04:08.080> can<00:04:08.680> say<00:04:08.860> are<00:04:09.220> more<00:04:09.670> focusing<00:04:10.180> now<00:04:10.360> on

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
which I can say are more focusing now on

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.480 
which I can say are more focusing now on
total<00:04:11.050> cost<00:04:11.260> of<00:04:11.380> ownership<00:04:11.530> rather<00:04:12.130> than<00:04:12.310> the

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
total cost of ownership rather than the

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.570 
total cost of ownership rather than the
mere<00:04:12.970> machine<00:04:13.840> price<00:04:14.260> that<00:04:14.560> means<00:04:14.740> all<00:04:15.520> the

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:15.580 
mere machine price that means all the

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:17.270 
mere machine price that means all the
operating<00:04:16.270> costs<00:04:16.630> through<00:04:17.049> our

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
operating costs through our

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.430 
operating costs through our
the<00:04:17.340> lifetime<00:04:17.730> of<00:04:17.760> a<00:04:17.940> machine<00:04:18.139> are<00:04:19.139> getting

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
the lifetime of a machine are getting

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.470 
the lifetime of a machine are getting
more<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:19.769> more<00:04:19.829> importance<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.639> gain<00:04:21.269> more

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
more and more importance and gain more

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.730 
more and more importance and gain more
and<00:04:21.540> more<00:04:21.810> weight<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.230> so<00:04:22.320> we<00:04:22.470> have<00:04:22.620> to

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
and more weight and so we have to

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.379 
and more weight and so we have to
account<00:04:22.980> for<00:04:23.130> that<00:04:23.370> which<00:04:23.550> we<00:04:23.700> did<00:04:23.850> already<00:04:24.090> by

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
account for that which we did already by

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.520 
account for that which we did already by
making<00:04:25.200> our<00:04:25.320> machines<00:04:25.770> more<00:04:26.840> economical<00:04:27.840> in

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
making our machines more economical in

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.620 
making our machines more economical in
terms<00:04:28.860> of<00:04:29.070> water<00:04:29.760> consumption<00:04:30.210> power
