00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
most retarded paint program you could

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.160 
most retarded paint program you could
possibly<00:02:30.430> ever<00:02:30.579> get<00:02:30.849> and<00:02:31.120> here's<00:02:31.900> something

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
possibly ever get and here's something

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.559 
possibly ever get and here's something
even<00:02:32.500> worse<00:02:32.799> it<00:02:33.250> uses<00:02:33.879> more<00:02:34.720> RAM<00:02:35.159> then

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
even worse it uses more RAM then

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.520 
even worse it uses more RAM then
seashore<00:02:37.569> on<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.079> mac<00:02:38.260> or<00:02:39.569> begin<00:02:40.569> on<00:02:40.870> linux

seashore on the mac or begin on linux
that's<00:02:42.400> right<00:02:42.730> it<00:02:42.970> uses<00:02:43.329> more<00:02:43.750> ram<00:02:44.079> than<00:02:44.109> a
