classic sales approach in a dental

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.420 
classic sales approach in a dental

office and I don't I don't really like
that<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.030> don't<00:01:12.210> think<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.869> that's

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
that I don't think that that's

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.750 
that I don't think that that's
appropriate<00:01:13.409> in<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.860> healthcare<00:01:14.340> setting

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
what the pros and cons are of each

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.810 
what the pros and cons are of each
option<00:01:21.950> even<00:01:22.950> if<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.220> a<00:01:23.340> less<00:01:23.520> expensive

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
option even if it's a less expensive

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.390 
option even if it's a less expensive
option<00:01:24.150> or<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:25.439> not<00:01:25.619> maybe<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:25.979> not<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
option or it's not maybe it's not the

option that that dentist would want in

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
about what does that patient want and

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.080 
about what does that patient want and

either side of that space and getting a
bridge<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> way<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.250> upgrade<00:01:48.210> those

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
bridge is a way to upgrade those

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.080 
bridge is a way to upgrade those
restorations<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.590> new<00:01:49.890> tooth<00:01:50.369> colored<00:01:50.790> you

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
restorations to new tooth colored you

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.319 
restorations to new tooth colored you
know<00:01:51.180> all<00:01:51.360> ceramic<00:01:52.189> restoration<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.430> they

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
know all ceramic restoration and they

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.209 
know all ceramic restoration and they
don't<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.780> pay<00:01:55.020> extra<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.530> have<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.979> old

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
don't have to pay extra to have that old

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.330 
don't have to pay extra to have that old
metal<00:01:56.640> or<00:01:56.880> old<00:01:57.390> crowns<00:01:57.780> taken<00:01:58.350> out<00:01:58.560> because

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
metal or old crowns taken out because

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.030 
metal or old crowns taken out because
it's<00:01:59.729> done<00:02:00.060> as<00:02:00.210> part<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.810> bridge<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.380> if

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
it's done as part of the bridge and if

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.950 
it's done as part of the bridge and if
that's<00:02:02.340> their<00:02:02.549> goal<00:02:02.729> then<00:02:02.969> they<00:02:03.450> would<00:02:03.659> want

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
that's their goal then they would want

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.539 
that's their goal then they would want
to<00:02:04.170> get<00:02:04.350> a<00:02:04.380> bridge<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.189> they<00:02:05.340> could<00:02:05.520> just

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
to get a bridge so that they could just

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.819 
to get a bridge so that they could just
get<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.880> all<00:02:06.000> done<00:02:06.240> for<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:06.869> same<00:02:07.200> price<00:02:07.560> and

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
get it all done for that same price and

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.589 
get it all done for that same price and
not<00:02:07.950> do<00:02:08.160> an<00:02:08.250> implant<00:02:08.610> plus<00:02:09.030> have<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.360> do<00:02:09.450> those

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
not do an implant plus have to do those

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.330 
not do an implant plus have to do those
neighboring<00:02:09.989> teeth<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.530> then

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
neighboring teeth and then

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.830 
neighboring teeth and then
there's<00:02:11.519> you<00:02:11.940> know<00:02:12.060> for<00:02:12.269> people<00:02:12.510> who<00:02:12.660> don't

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
there's you know for people who don't

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.770 
there's you know for people who don't
want<00:02:12.989> their<00:02:13.290> teeth<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:14.250> be<00:02:14.370> cut<00:02:15.150> or<00:02:15.300> prepared

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
want their teeth to be cut or prepared

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.050 
want their teeth to be cut or prepared
at<00:02:15.930> all<00:02:16.140> like<00:02:16.980> maybe<00:02:17.250> their<00:02:17.430> teeth<00:02:17.670> next<00:02:18.000> to

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
at all like maybe their teeth next to

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.119 
at all like maybe their teeth next to
that<00:02:18.209> space<00:02:18.510> have<00:02:18.840> never<00:02:19.110> had<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.470> filling<00:02:19.920> and

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
that space have never had a filling and

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.580 
that space have never had a filling and
so<00:02:20.879> but<00:02:21.300> they<00:02:21.420> don't<00:02:21.599> want<00:02:21.840> an<00:02:22.080> implant<00:02:22.440> they

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
so but they don't want an implant they

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.690 
so but they don't want an implant they
don't<00:02:22.739> like<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.980> idea<00:02:23.069> of<00:02:23.250> having<00:02:23.370> surgery

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
don't like the idea of having surgery

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.979 
don't like the idea of having surgery
they<00:02:23.910> don't<00:02:24.030> want<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.239> have<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.480> wait<00:02:24.660> they

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
they don't want to have to wait they

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.920 
they don't want to have to wait they
really<00:02:25.430> don't<00:02:26.430> want<00:02:26.670> surgery<00:02:27.599> they<00:02:27.780> don't

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
really don't want surgery they don't

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.900 
really don't want surgery they don't
want<00:02:28.110> some<00:02:28.379> an<00:02:28.620> artificial<00:02:29.190> root<00:02:29.430> put<00:02:29.730> into

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
want some an artificial root put into

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.339 
want some an artificial root put into
their<00:02:30.030> bone<00:02:30.269> that<00:02:30.540> will<00:02:30.660> never<00:02:30.840> be<00:02:31.019> removed

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
their bone that will never be removed

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.780 
their bone that will never be removed
and<00:02:31.709> you<00:02:31.769> know<00:02:32.010> a<00:02:32.040> lot<00:02:32.190> of<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.340> times<00:02:32.549> it's

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
and you know a lot of the times it's

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.460 
and you know a lot of the times it's
metal<00:02:33.239> meant<00:02:33.660> in<00:02:33.720> some<00:02:33.930> patients<00:02:34.080> don't<00:02:34.349> want

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
metal meant in some patients don't want

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.160 
metal meant in some patients don't want
any<00:02:34.680> metal<00:02:34.920> put<00:02:35.069> in<00:02:35.160> their<00:02:35.250> mouth<00:02:35.660> and<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:37.140> a

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
any metal put in their mouth and so a

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.920 
any metal put in their mouth and so a
removable<00:02:37.950> partial<00:02:38.220> if<00:02:38.640> it's<00:02:39.060> in<00:02:39.629> my<00:02:39.780> office

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
removable partial if it's in my office

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.440 
removable partial if it's in my office
we<00:02:40.140> use<00:02:40.709> only<00:02:40.950> nonmetal<00:02:41.670> removable<00:02:42.239> partial

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
we use only nonmetal removable partial

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.390 
we use only nonmetal removable partial
materials<00:02:43.019> they're<00:02:43.470> flexible<00:02:44.040> they<00:02:44.190> just

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
materials they're flexible they just

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.069 
materials they're flexible they just
snap<00:02:44.670> into<00:02:44.880> place<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.360> looks<00:02:45.510> exactly<00:02:45.720> like<00:02:45.930> a

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
snap into place it looks exactly like a

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.800 
snap into place it looks exactly like a
tooth<00:02:46.380> they're<00:02:46.860> pretty<00:02:47.370> inexpensive

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
tooth they're pretty inexpensive

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.449 
tooth they're pretty inexpensive
relatively<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:48.989> they<00:02:49.410> can<00:02:49.590> use<00:02:49.799> that<00:02:50.099> for<00:02:50.430> a

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
relatively and they can use that for a

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.370 
relatively and they can use that for a
while<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.910> maybe<00:02:51.060> decide<00:02:51.480> later<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:52.230> they

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
while and maybe decide later that they

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.440 
while and maybe decide later that they
want<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.860> bridge<00:02:53.370> or<00:02:53.640> something<00:02:53.670> cemented<00:02:54.360> in

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
want a bridge or something cemented in

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.750 
want a bridge or something cemented in
or<00:02:54.630> an<00:02:54.720> implant<00:02:55.019> if<00:02:55.319> there<00:02:55.590> are<00:02:55.739> new<00:02:56.220> materials

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
or an implant if there are new materials

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.300 
or an implant if there are new materials
in<00:02:56.970> use<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:57.540> know<00:02:57.629> later<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.709> just<00:02:59.099> want

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
in use you know later and so I just want

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.220 
in use you know later and so I just want
to<00:02:59.400> make<00:02:59.459> sure<00:02:59.700> that<00:02:59.819> they<00:03:00.000> have<00:03:00.239> an<00:03:00.599> idea<00:03:01.140> of

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
to make sure that they have an idea of

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.350 
to make sure that they have an idea of
what<00:03:01.349> all<00:03:01.560> their<00:03:01.769> options<00:03:01.920> are<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:02.970> they<00:03:03.180> can

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
what all their options are so they can

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.430 
what all their options are so they can
make<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.569> choice<00:03:03.780> that's<00:03:03.930> right<00:03:04.140> for<00:03:04.349> them

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
make the choice that's right for them

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.229 
make the choice that's right for them
even<00:03:04.799> if<00:03:04.890> it's<00:03:05.040> something<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:06.120> know

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
even if it's something that you know

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.710 
even if it's something that you know
isn't<00:03:06.750> particularly<00:03:07.849> expensive<00:03:08.849> you<00:03:09.629> know

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
isn't particularly expensive you know

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.479 
isn't particularly expensive you know
that's<00:03:09.959> that<00:03:10.260> doesn't<00:03:10.410> matter<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.890> me<00:03:10.920> my<00:03:11.160> fees

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
that's that doesn't matter to me my fees

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.520 
that's that doesn't matter to me my fees
are<00:03:11.519> based<00:03:11.940> on<00:03:12.239> how<00:03:12.629> long<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:13.049> takes<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.319> do

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
are based on how long it takes to do

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.559 
are based on how long it takes to do
things<00:03:13.799> not<00:03:14.220> what<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.730> market<00:03:14.849> will<00:03:15.120> bear<00:03:15.180> and

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
things not what the market will bear and

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.300 
things not what the market will bear and
so<00:03:16.019> for<00:03:16.230> me<00:03:16.319> it<00:03:16.380> makes<00:03:16.500> no<00:03:16.709> difference<00:03:16.859> at<00:03:17.160> all

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
so for me it makes no difference at all

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.059 
so for me it makes no difference at all
what<00:03:17.880> they<00:03:18.060> choose<00:03:18.420> as<00:03:19.139> as<00:03:19.650> long<00:03:19.829> as<00:03:19.950> they're

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
what they choose as as long as they're

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.500 
what they choose as as long as they're
choosing<00:03:20.220> what's<00:03:20.459> best<00:03:20.639> for<00:03:20.760> them<00:03:20.970> based<00:03:21.299> on
