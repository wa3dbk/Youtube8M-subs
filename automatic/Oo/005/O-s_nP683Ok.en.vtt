00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.910 
rod and i want a machine the entire face
of<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.130> or<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.580> entire<00:00:20.789> length<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.769> just<00:00:22.769> to

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
of it or the entire length of it just to

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.609 
of it or the entire length of it just to
scrape<00:00:23.189> all<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.519> ugly<00:00:23.789> off<00:00:24.170> and<00:00:25.170> i<00:00:25.439> need<00:00:25.590> a

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
scrape all that ugly off and i need a

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.370 
scrape all that ugly off and i need a
way<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.830> reliably<00:00:26.660> place<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.840> into<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.140> chuck

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
way to reliably place it into the chuck

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.250 
way to reliably place it into the chuck
at<00:00:28.710> a<00:00:28.949> depth<00:00:29.250> that<00:00:29.400> I<00:00:29.580> can<00:00:29.820> do<00:00:30.720> again<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.109> again

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
at a depth that I can do again and again

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.799 
at a depth that I can do again and again
and<00:00:31.380> again<00:00:31.610> so<00:00:32.610> here<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:32.910> have<00:00:33.030> just<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.630> piece<00:00:33.780> of

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
and again so here I have just a piece of

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.860 
and again so here I have just a piece of
aluminum<00:00:34.410> bar<00:00:35.070> flat<00:00:35.399> bar<00:00:35.610> that<00:00:36.390> I've<00:00:36.480> machine

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
aluminum bar flat bar that I've machine

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.360 
aluminum bar flat bar that I've machine
2.5<00:00:37.590> 4<00:00:37.920> inches<00:00:38.370> this<00:00:39.329> way<00:00:39.950> the<00:00:40.950> actual<00:00:41.219> length

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
2.5 4 inches this way the actual length

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.940 
2.5 4 inches this way the actual length
is<00:00:41.579> irrelevant<00:00:41.930> but<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.469> put<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:43.890> here

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
is irrelevant but so I put it in here

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.850 
is irrelevant but so I put it in here
lay<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.550> flat<00:00:44.700> against<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.120> face<00:00:45.469> put<00:00:46.469> my<00:00:46.590> part

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
lay it flat against the face put my part

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:54.799 
lay it flat against the face put my part
in<00:00:49.820> hold<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.969> tight<00:00:52.070> wiggle<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.160> as<00:00:53.510> I<00:00:54.510> tighten

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
in hold it tight wiggle it as I tighten

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.380 
in hold it tight wiggle it as I tighten
it<00:00:54.899> down<00:00:55.820> crank<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.969> space<00:00:57.300> or<00:00:57.510> falls<00:00:57.690> out<00:00:57.899> and

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 
it down crank it space or falls out and

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.590 
it down crank it space or falls out and
then<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.690> take<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.710> z-axis<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:03.210> tool<00:01:03.420> that

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
then I take the z-axis the tool that

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.200 
then I take the z-axis the tool that
cutting<00:01:03.870> tool<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.739> zero<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.460> against<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
cutting tool and I zero it against the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.399 
cutting tool and I zero it against the
face<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.450> this<00:01:06.810> part<00:01:07.460> so<00:01:08.460> now<00:01:08.580> my<00:01:08.760> Z<00:01:09.119> 0<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.960> that

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
face of this part so now my Z 0 is that

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.630 
face of this part so now my Z 0 is that
exactly<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.130> backside<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.000> part<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:13.640> it

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
exactly the backside of that part and it

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.940 
exactly the backside of that part and it
works<00:01:14.820> excellent<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.600> all<00:01:15.750> Z<00:01:16.530> measurements

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
works excellent so all Z measurements

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.859 
works excellent so all Z measurements
are<00:01:17.009> going<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.189> be<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.340> positive<00:01:17.790> i<00:01:17.970> know<00:01:18.600> that

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
are going to be in positive i know that

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.149 
are going to be in positive i know that
this<00:01:18.990> part<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.409> 1.25<00:01:20.070> inches<00:01:20.520> long<00:01:20.780> plus

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
this part is 1.25 inches long plus

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.960 
this part is 1.25 inches long plus
tolerance<00:01:23.720> it's<00:01:24.720> like<00:01:24.840> 1.3<00:01:25.409> right<00:01:25.590> now<00:01:25.970> so

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
tolerance it's like 1.3 right now so

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.999 
tolerance it's like 1.3 right now so
then<00:01:27.180> i<00:01:27.240> can<00:01:27.420> do<00:01:27.509> my<00:01:27.540> cuts<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.170> then<00:01:28.560> i<00:01:28.590> can

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
then i can do my cuts and then i can

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.219 
then i can do my cuts and then i can
finish<00:01:29.340> with<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.640> part<00:01:29.850> that's<00:01:30.060> exactly<00:01:30.479> 1.25

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
finish with the part that's exactly 1.25

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.569 
finish with the part that's exactly 1.25
long<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.250> i<00:01:32.369> can<00:01:32.990> machine<00:01:33.990> one<00:01:34.200> side<00:01:34.460> take<00:01:35.460> it

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
long and i can machine one side take it

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.730 
long and i can machine one side take it
out<00:01:35.700> flip<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.210> over<00:01:36.329> onto<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.170> space<00:01:37.500> or

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
out flip it over onto the space or

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.740 
out flip it over onto the space or
machine<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.700> other<00:01:38.820> side<00:01:39.060> and<00:01:39.299> now<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.570> know

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
machine the other side and now I know

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.109 
machine the other side and now I know
the<00:01:39.869> parts<00:01:40.110> exact<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:41.460> other<00:01:41.490> one<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:41.820> want<00:01:42.000> to

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
the parts exact the other one I want to

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.810 
the parts exact the other one I want to
show<00:01:42.270> off<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.229> guy<00:01:43.409> i<00:01:43.439> made<00:01:43.770> this<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.220> one

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
show off is this guy i made this is one

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.920 
show off is this guy i made this is one
of<00:01:44.850> my<00:01:44.970> first<00:01:45.210> things<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.630> made<00:01:45.780> on<00:01:45.899> my

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
of my first things that I made on my

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.840 
of my first things that I made on my
lathe<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.439> then<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:46.920> went<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.189> when<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.670> later

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
lathe and then I went on when and later

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.520 
lathe and then I went on when and later
and<00:01:48.030> touched<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.420> up<00:01:48.509> on<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.810> CNC<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.380> get

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
and touched it up on the CNC to get

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.980 
and touched it up on the CNC to get
little<00:01:49.770> round<00:01:49.950> corners<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.460> stuff<00:01:50.990> very

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
little round corners and stuff very

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.310 
little round corners and stuff very
simple<00:01:52.350> started<00:01:53.070> out<00:01:53.189> as<00:01:53.340> 1.5<00:01:53.909> inch<00:01:54.420> aluminum

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
simple started out as 1.5 inch aluminum

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.380 
simple started out as 1.5 inch aluminum
tube<00:01:56.070> with<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.000> one-inch<00:01:57.210> hole<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:59.210> machine<00:02:00.210> this

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
tube with a one-inch hole I machine this

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.929 
tube with a one-inch hole I machine this
side<00:02:00.659> too<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.770> don't<00:02:01.950> remember<00:02:02.070> what<00:02:02.430> dimension

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
side too I don't remember what dimension

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.020 
side too I don't remember what dimension
but

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
but

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.780 
but
so<00:02:04.630> that<00:02:04.810> it<00:02:04.930> just<00:02:05.320> fits<00:02:05.799> into<00:02:06.010> the<00:02:06.190> chuck<00:02:06.400> it

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
so that it just fits into the chuck it

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.059 
so that it just fits into the chuck it
into<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.360> inner<00:02:08.050> recess<00:02:08.619> of<00:02:08.770> that<00:02:08.890> Chuck

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
into the inner recess of that Chuck

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.030 
into the inner recess of that Chuck
there<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.810> part<00:02:11.080> that<00:02:11.140> I<00:02:11.290> used<00:02:11.590> to<00:02:11.650> machine<00:02:12.010> a

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
there the part that I used to machine a

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
there the part that I used to machine a
lot<00:02:12.310> is<00:02:12.819> this<00:02:13.810> guy<00:02:16.140> very<00:02:17.140> short<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:18.060> aside

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
lot is this guy very short and aside

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.680 
lot is this guy very short and aside
from<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.480> outer<00:02:19.860> face<00:02:20.860> here<00:02:21.450> every<00:02:22.450> surface

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
from the outer face here every surface

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.030 
from the outer face here every surface
gets<00:02:23.050> machined<00:02:23.530> and<00:02:25.590> again<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.830> need<00:02:26.890> to

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
gets machined and again I need to

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.620 
gets machined and again I need to
reliably<00:02:28.080> place<00:02:29.080> that<00:02:29.319> into<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.680> truck<00:02:30.630> then

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
reliably place that into the truck then

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.060 
reliably place that into the truck then
i<00:02:31.720> also<00:02:31.750> created<00:02:32.140> three<00:02:32.650> little<00:02:32.860> spaces<00:02:33.190> here

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
i also created three little spaces here

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.699 
i also created three little spaces here
to<00:02:36.070> vary<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.430> depth<00:02:37.239> but<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:38.140> whatever<00:02:38.410> i<00:02:38.470> need

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
to vary the depth but to whatever i need

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.250 
to vary the depth but to whatever i need
it<00:02:38.800> to<00:02:38.920> be<00:02:39.070> so<00:02:39.970> let's<00:02:40.420> say<00:02:40.600> I<00:02:40.630> use<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.050> three

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
it to be so let's say I use the three

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.350 
it to be so let's say I use the three
spacers<00:02:43.500> now<00:02:44.500> it's<00:02:44.709> too<00:02:44.860> many<00:02:45.300> two<00:02:46.300> spacers

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
spacers now it's too many two spacers

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.479 
spacers now it's too many two spacers
zero<00:02:49.360> the<00:02:49.569> Z<00:02:49.780> or<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.290> tool<00:02:50.500> on<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:50.860> face<00:02:51.459> of

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
zero the Z or the tool on the face of

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.259 
zero the Z or the tool on the face of
that<00:02:51.730> is<00:02:52.000> Z<00:02:52.150> 0<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:53.310> then<00:02:54.310> I<00:02:54.519> can<00:02:54.700> place<00:02:54.850> my<00:02:55.030> part

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
that is Z 0 and then I can place my part

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.570 
that is Z 0 and then I can place my part
in<00:02:55.360> there<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.690> the<00:02:56.410> i<00:02:56.709> turn<00:02:57.100> the<00:02:57.220> outside

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
in there and the i turn the outside

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.340 
in there and the i turn the outside
diameter<00:02:57.760> of<00:02:58.030> this<00:02:58.239> down<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.840> just<00:02:59.019> smaller

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
diameter of this down to just smaller

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:09.569 
diameter of this down to just smaller
than<00:02:59.590> 1.5<00:03:00.250> which<00:03:00.519> is<00:03:00.730> this<00:03:05.640> come<00:03:06.640> on<00:03:08.489> crank<00:03:09.489> it

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
than 1.5 which is this come on crank it

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.199 
than 1.5 which is this come on crank it
down<00:03:09.640> it<00:03:10.030> stays<00:03:10.390> in<00:03:10.420> while<00:03:10.780> I<00:03:10.810> machine<00:03:11.019> and

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
down it stays in while I machine and

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.770 
down it stays in while I machine and
there<00:03:13.209> we<00:03:13.299> have<00:03:13.329> it<00:03:14.850> too<00:03:15.850> very<00:03:16.329> very<00:03:16.600> useful

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
there we have it too very very useful

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.110 
there we have it too very very useful
tools<00:03:17.230> for<00:03:17.410> late<00:03:17.709> work<00:03:17.980> that<00:03:18.610> I<00:03:18.640> use<00:03:18.850> all<00:03:19.090> the

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
tools for late work that I use all the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.530 
tools for late work that I use all the
time<00:03:19.320> especially<00:03:20.320> this<00:03:20.739> guy<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.850> it's<00:03:22.030> just<00:03:22.450> a

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
time especially this guy and it's just a

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.630 
time especially this guy and it's just a
piece<00:03:22.720> of<00:03:22.780> garbage<00:03:23.079> like<00:03:23.470> there's<00:03:24.250> nothing

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
piece of garbage like there's nothing

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.810 
piece of garbage like there's nothing
fancy<00:03:24.850> to<00:03:25.120> it<00:03:25.500> so<00:03:26.500> I<00:03:26.530> hope<00:03:26.739> you<00:03:26.890> enjoyed<00:03:27.130> it<00:03:27.160> my

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
fancy to it so I hope you enjoyed it my

fancy to it so I hope you enjoyed it my
next<00:03:28.030> video<00:03:28.239> is<00:03:28.420> going<00:03:28.540> to<00:03:28.600> be<00:03:28.690> machining

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
next video is going to be machining

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.680 
next video is going to be machining
these<00:03:29.799> into<00:03:30.459> something<00:03:30.820> useful<00:03:30.940> they<00:03:31.510> are

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
these into something useful they are

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.180 
these into something useful they are
motor<00:03:32.170> couplers<00:03:32.590> for<00:03:34.200> this<00:03:35.200> lathe<00:03:35.470> conversion

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
motor couplers for this lathe conversion

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.299 
motor couplers for this lathe conversion
kit<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:37.900> check<00:03:38.440> the<00:03:38.560> next<00:03:38.709> one<00:03:39.030> take<00:03:40.030> care
