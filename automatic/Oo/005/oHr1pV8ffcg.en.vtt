00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
that have dropped have been ones that

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.850 
that have dropped have been ones that
I've<00:01:11.310> wanted<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.939> play<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:13.310> did<00:01:14.310> play<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.760> thing

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
I've wanted to play I did play the thing

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.469 
I've wanted to play I did play the thing
he's<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.920> cool<00:01:17.189> character<00:01:17.869> but<00:01:19.970> you<00:01:20.970> know<00:01:21.150> just

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
he's a cool character but you know just

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.789 
he's a cool character but you know just
none<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.810> them<00:01:21.930> have<00:01:22.140> been<00:01:22.170> ones<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.680> I've

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
none of them have been ones that I've

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.950 
none of them have been ones that I've
won<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.040> would<00:01:23.310> have<00:01:23.400> selected<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.780> play

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
won I would have selected to play

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.990 
won I would have selected to play
otherwise<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:28.799> don't<00:01:29.520> really<00:01:29.729> have<00:01:29.970> a

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
otherwise so I don't really have a

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.300 
otherwise so I don't really have a
problem<00:01:30.509> with<00:01:30.630> that<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.810> think<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.259> by<00:01:32.070> them

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
problem with that I think that by them

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.910 
problem with that I think that by them
doing<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.840> know<00:01:33.930> how<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.290> currently

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
doing that you know how it is currently

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.990 
doing that you know how it is currently
it<00:01:35.549> gives<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:36.590> maybe<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.680> better<00:01:38.159> sense<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.759> how

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
it gives you maybe a better sense of how

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.600 
it gives you maybe a better sense of how
the<00:01:39.390> game<00:01:39.659> would<00:01:39.869> play<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:41.250> had<00:01:41.579> a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
the game would play if you had a

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.569 
the game would play if you had a
character<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.299> didn't<00:01:42.540> want<00:01:43.399> just<00:01:44.399> to

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
character that you didn't want just to

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.420 
character that you didn't want just to
get<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.970> know<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.119> better<00:01:45.299> understanding<00:01:46.200> of

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
get a you know a better understanding of

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.480 
get a you know a better understanding of
the<00:01:47.430> game<00:01:47.909> with<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.479> character<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.490> mean

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
the game with that character I mean

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.100 
the game with that character I mean
because<00:01:50.880> we're<00:01:51.180> playing<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.479> Marvel<00:01:51.869> game

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
because we're playing a Marvel game

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.069 
because we're playing a Marvel game
that's<00:01:52.439> probably<00:01:53.040> not<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.340> best<00:01:53.970> way<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.420> kind

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
that's probably not the best way to kind

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.469 
that's probably not the best way to kind
of<00:01:55.229> look<00:01:55.439> at<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.850> because<00:01:56.850> most<00:01:57.090> people<00:01:57.390> that

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
of look at that because most people that

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.580 
of look at that because most people that
play<00:01:57.780> games<00:01:58.770> Super<00:01:59.280> Hero<00:01:59.460> games<00:01:59.759> want<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.180> play

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
play games Super Hero games want to play

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.639 
play games Super Hero games want to play
the<00:02:01.590> character<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.189> they<00:02:02.399> love<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:04.560> know

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
the character that they love so you know

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.469 
the character that they love so you know
that's<00:02:04.890> not<00:02:05.070> necessarily<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.640> good<00:02:05.820> thing<00:02:05.880> but

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
that's not necessarily a good thing but

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.350 
that's not necessarily a good thing but
it<00:02:06.750> does<00:02:06.960> offer<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> better<00:02:08.700> look<00:02:09.000> at<00:02:09.179> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
it does offer you a better look at the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.930 
it does offer you a better look at the
depth<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.379> game<00:02:10.649> just<00:02:11.430> from<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.700> gameplay

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
depth of the game just from a gameplay

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.020 
depth of the game just from a gameplay
standpoint

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
standpoint

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.440 
standpoint
now<00:02:13.870> here's<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.950> big<00:02:15.070> issue<00:02:15.250> that's<00:02:16.030> a<00:02:16.210> minor

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
now here's the big issue that's a minor

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.020 
now here's the big issue that's a minor
one<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.870> big<00:02:17.020> issue<00:02:17.290> here<00:02:17.320> is<00:02:17.770> that<00:02:18.100> I<00:02:18.370> said<00:02:18.970> I

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
one the big issue here is that I said I

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.380 
one the big issue here is that I said I
got<00:02:19.180> daredevil<00:02:19.480> in<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.200> drop<00:02:20.590> I<00:02:21.210> played<00:02:22.210> the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
got daredevil in a drop I played the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.440 
got daredevil in a drop I played the
game<00:02:22.570> I<00:02:23.250> put<00:02:24.250> in<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.610> lot<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.880> hours<00:02:25.180> in<00:02:25.330> this

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
game I put in a lot of hours in this

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.930 
game I put in a lot of hours in this
game<00:02:25.660> now<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:25.900> it's<00:02:26.380> 50<00:02:26.830> plus<00:02:27.100> I<00:02:27.400> might<00:02:27.790> be

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
game now so it's 50 plus I might be

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.780 
game now so it's 50 plus I might be
approaching<00:02:28.270> a<00:02:28.540> near<00:02:29.140> hundred<00:02:29.620> maybe<00:02:29.860> I<00:02:30.130> have

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
approaching a near hundred maybe I have

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.230 
approaching a near hundred maybe I have
a<00:02:30.850> lot<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:31.030> idle<00:02:31.420> time<00:02:31.620> but<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:33.250> got<00:02:33.910> another

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
a lot of idle time but I got another

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.120 
a lot of idle time but I got another
daredevil<00:02:35.110> drop<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:37.230> when<00:02:38.230> I<00:02:38.260> got<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:38.800> I<00:02:38.950> was

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
daredevil drop and when I got it I was

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.030 
daredevil drop and when I got it I was
immediately<00:02:39.540> furious<00:02:40.540> because<00:02:40.810> I<00:02:41.470> already

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
immediately furious because I already

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.730 
immediately furious because I already
had<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.310> daredevil<00:02:42.670> drop<00:02:43.270> and<00:02:43.540> I<00:02:44.230> got<00:02:44.410> another

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
had a daredevil drop and I got another

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.610 
had a daredevil drop and I got another
one<00:02:44.950> so<00:02:45.370> not<00:02:46.120> only<00:02:46.300> is<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.720> system<00:02:47.080> random

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
one so not only is the system random

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.220 
one so not only is the system random
currently<00:02:48.250> but<00:02:48.940> you<00:02:49.150> have<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.480> chance<00:02:50.020> to

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
currently but you have the chance to

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.090 
currently but you have the chance to
receive<00:02:51.130> characters<00:02:51.730> that<00:02:51.940> you<00:02:52.090> already<00:02:52.390> have

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
receive characters that you already have

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.979 
receive characters that you already have
therefore<00:02:54.100> when<00:02:54.310> you<00:02:54.340> get<00:02:54.670> a<00:02:54.700> new<00:02:54.970> drop<00:02:55.300> and

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
therefore when you get a new drop and

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.310 
therefore when you get a new drop and
you<00:02:56.230> feel<00:02:56.440> like<00:02:56.620> it's<00:02:56.800> a<00:02:56.920> total<00:02:57.280> waste<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:58.900> that

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
you feel like it's a total waste so that

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.550 
you feel like it's a total waste so that
was<00:03:00.130> probably<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.790> point<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.930> tipping<00:03:02.320> point

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
was probably the point the tipping point

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.250 
was probably the point the tipping point
for<00:03:02.650> me<00:03:03.000> for<00:03:04.000> for<00:03:04.510> kind<00:03:04.660> of<00:03:04.720> being<00:03:04.900> like<00:03:05.020> man

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
for me for for kind of being like man

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.080 
for me for for kind of being like man
this<00:03:05.440> is<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.650> really<00:03:05.770> shitty<00:03:06.340> system<00:03:06.640> that<00:03:06.970> they

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
this is a really shitty system that they

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.229 
this is a really shitty system that they
currently<00:03:07.300> have<00:03:07.540> right<00:03:07.989> now<00:03:08.050> for<00:03:08.880> hero<00:03:09.880> drops

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
currently have right now for hero drops

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.570 
currently have right now for hero drops
and<00:03:10.420> you<00:03:10.480> know<00:03:10.570> I<00:03:10.600> was<00:03:10.810> okay<00:03:11.260> with<00:03:11.440> it<00:03:11.500> up<00:03:12.370> to

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
and you know I was okay with it up to

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.699 
and you know I was okay with it up to
that<00:03:12.730> point<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.330> once<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:13.660> got<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:13.989> same<00:03:14.230> hero

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
that point and once I got the same hero

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.920 
that point and once I got the same hero
I<00:03:14.890> had<00:03:15.010> already<00:03:15.250> previously<00:03:15.700> gotten<00:03:16.300> a<00:03:16.480> drop<00:03:16.750> I

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
I had already previously gotten a drop I

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.490 
I had already previously gotten a drop I
was<00:03:17.049> like<00:03:17.230> man<00:03:17.680> I<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:18.430> don't<00:03:19.000> know<00:03:19.299> what<00:03:20.260> they're

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
was like man I I don't know what they're

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.500 
was like man I I don't know what they're
kind<00:03:20.709> of<00:03:20.769> thinking<00:03:20.860> about<00:03:21.220> with<00:03:21.640> with<00:03:22.030> this<00:03:22.209> so

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
kind of thinking about with with this so

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.590 
kind of thinking about with with this so
the<00:03:23.230> fact<00:03:23.500> that<00:03:23.590> they've<00:03:23.799> announced<00:03:24.070> the

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
the fact that they've announced the

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.729 
the fact that they've announced the
eternity<00:03:25.600> splinters<00:03:26.100> as<00:03:27.100> a<00:03:27.160> way<00:03:27.760> for<00:03:28.299> you<00:03:28.630> to

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
eternity splinters as a way for you to

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.190 
eternity splinters as a way for you to
earn<00:03:30.120> characters<00:03:31.120> that<00:03:31.420> you<00:03:31.570> want<00:03:31.870> through

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
earn characters that you want through

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.430 
earn characters that you want through
drops<00:03:33.030> sounds<00:03:34.030> like<00:03:34.209> it'll<00:03:34.570> be<00:03:34.600> a<00:03:34.720> much<00:03:35.049> better

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
drops sounds like it'll be a much better

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.820 
drops sounds like it'll be a much better
system<00:03:35.980> than<00:03:36.220> what<00:03:36.640> they<00:03:36.790> currently<00:03:37.030> have<00:03:37.830> it

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
system than what they currently have it

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.350 
system than what they currently have it
seems<00:03:39.040> like<00:03:39.220> you're<00:03:39.340> going<00:03:39.519> to<00:03:39.640> have<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.150> kind

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
seems like you're going to have to kind

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.259 
seems like you're going to have to kind
of<00:03:40.420> farm<00:03:40.750> these<00:03:41.049> splinters<00:03:41.560> in<00:03:41.860> order<00:03:42.489> to<00:03:42.700> get

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
of farm these splinters in order to get

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.150 
of farm these splinters in order to get
enough<00:03:43.570> of<00:03:43.720> them<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:44.110> purchase<00:03:44.560> a<00:03:44.739> character

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
enough of them to purchase a character

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.740 
enough of them to purchase a character
but<00:03:46.060> it<00:03:46.540> the<00:03:46.780> pricing<00:03:47.230> for<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.750> energy

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
but it the pricing for the energy

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.630 
but it the pricing for the energy
splinter<00:03:50.260> conversion<00:03:51.010> to<00:03:51.250> what<00:03:51.489> the

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
splinter conversion to what the

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.940 
splinter conversion to what the
characters<00:03:52.090> cost<00:03:52.420> is<00:03:52.720> roughly<00:03:53.290> the<00:03:53.470> same<00:03:53.680> the

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
characters cost is roughly the same the

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.880 
characters cost is roughly the same the
more<00:03:54.130> expensive<00:03:54.840> characters<00:03:55.840> that<00:03:56.200> you<00:03:56.799> know

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
more expensive characters that you know

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.460 
more expensive characters that you know
are<00:03:57.250> available<00:03:58.000> for<00:03:58.299> purchase<00:03:58.480> are<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.260> ones

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
are available for purchase are the ones

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:02.009 
are available for purchase are the ones
that<00:03:59.709> use<00:03:59.920> the<00:04:00.190> most<00:04:00.540> of<00:04:01.540> that<00:04:01.810> energy

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
that use the most of that energy

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.319 
that use the most of that energy
splinter<00:04:02.739> cost<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.250> off<00:04:03.519> the<00:04:03.640> top<00:04:03.820> of<00:04:03.850> my<00:04:04.120> head

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329 
splinter cost and off the top of my head

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:06.210 
splinter cost and off the top of my head
I<00:04:04.360> think<00:04:04.690> like<00:04:04.870> Black<00:04:05.140> Widow<00:04:05.410> for<00:04:05.650> example<00:04:06.100> is

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
I think like Black Widow for example is

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.410 
I think like Black Widow for example is
only<00:04:06.519> 200<00:04:07.290> whereas<00:04:08.290> Iron<00:04:09.160> Man<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:10.120> spider-man

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
only 200 whereas Iron Man and spider-man

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.920 
only 200 whereas Iron Man and spider-man
are<00:04:11.140> 600<00:04:12.040> and<00:04:12.820> that's<00:04:12.970> what<00:04:13.120> they<00:04:13.239> have<00:04:13.420> in<00:04:13.690> the

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
are 600 and that's what they have in the
