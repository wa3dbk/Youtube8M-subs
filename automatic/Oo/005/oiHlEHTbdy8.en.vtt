00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.690 
free-standing bucket and it's it's
pretty<00:00:59.630> light<00:00:59.960> it<00:01:00.500> doesn't<00:01:00.680> take<00:01:00.950> up<00:01:01.430> too<00:01:01.670> much

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:01.700 
pretty light it doesn't take up too much

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:02.590 
pretty light it doesn't take up too much

Danbury and they had this one for the
same<00:01:16.579> price<00:01:16.969> as<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:17.630> larger<00:01:18.200> looking<00:01:18.889> one

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
same price as the larger looking one

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.520 
same price as the larger looking one
only<00:01:20.840> this<00:01:21.649> is<00:01:21.859> the<00:01:21.979> same<00:01:22.219> amount<00:01:22.549> of<00:01:23.530> leaders

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
only this is the same amount of leaders

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.590 
only this is the same amount of leaders
this<00:01:24.770> is<00:01:24.950> ten<00:01:25.159> liters<00:01:25.490> and<00:01:25.819> that's<00:01:26.030> ten<00:01:26.299> liters

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
this is ten liters and that's ten liters

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.179 
this is ten liters and that's ten liters
and<00:01:26.840> they<00:01:26.929> both<00:01:27.170> hold<00:01:27.499> the<00:01:27.679> same<00:01:27.829> amount<00:01:27.950> of

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
and they both hold the same amount of

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.999 
and they both hold the same amount of
gallons<00:01:28.549> two<00:01:28.700> point<00:01:28.969> six<00:01:29.119> four<00:01:29.299> gallons<00:01:30.009> the

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
gallons two point six four gallons the

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.609 
gallons two point six four gallons the
difference<00:01:31.490> is<00:01:31.670> is<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.869> one<00:01:33.109> that<00:01:33.350> I<00:01:33.409> showed

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
difference is is the one that I showed

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.039 
difference is is the one that I showed
you<00:01:33.829> first<00:01:34.130> is<00:01:34.579> freestanding<00:01:35.539> it's<00:01:35.899> got<00:01:36.020> a

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
you first is freestanding it's got a

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.499 
you first is freestanding it's got a
flat<00:01:36.350> bottom<00:01:36.590> this<00:01:37.009> one<00:01:37.219> is<00:01:37.429> not<00:01:37.670> it's<00:01:37.880> rounded

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
flat bottom this one is not it's rounded

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.230 
flat bottom this one is not it's rounded
but<00:01:39.439> again<00:01:39.679> it<00:01:39.829> bug<00:01:39.979> out<00:01:40.130> survival<00:01:40.240> situation

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
but again it bug out survival situation

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.289 
but again it bug out survival situation
I<00:01:41.450> really<00:01:41.539> am<00:01:42.319> NOT<00:01:42.590> going<00:01:42.889> to<00:01:43.149> stress<00:01:44.149> about

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
I really am NOT going to stress about

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.899 
I really am NOT going to stress about
what's<00:01:44.779> freestanding<00:01:45.200> what<00:01:45.560> isn't<00:01:45.909> it's

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
what's freestanding what isn't it's

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.059 
what's freestanding what isn't it's
again<00:01:47.240> it's<00:01:47.270> about<00:01:47.539> maximising<00:01:48.439> pack<00:01:48.679> space

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
again it's about maximising pack space

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:51.879 
again it's about maximising pack space
and<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:50.420> make<00:01:50.599> you<00:01:50.840> know<00:01:50.869> traveling<00:01:51.619> lighter

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:51.889 
and and make you know traveling lighter

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:54.669 
and and make you know traveling lighter
so<00:01:52.849> let's<00:01:53.119> let's<00:01:53.810> actually<00:01:53.899> open<00:01:54.349> this<00:01:54.439> off

00:01:54.669 --> 00:01:54.679 
so let's let's actually open this off

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:01.709 
so let's let's actually open this off
off<00:01:55.249> the<00:01:55.279> package<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.060> take<00:01:56.270> a<00:01:57.139> peek<00:01:57.529> at<00:01:57.770> it

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:01.719 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:03.849 

okay<00:02:02.719> so<00:02:02.779> if<00:02:02.959> we<00:02:03.079> can<00:02:03.109> see<00:02:03.319> the<00:02:03.409> difference<00:02:03.770> in

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:03.859 
okay so if we can see the difference in

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:06.429 
okay so if we can see the difference in
the<00:02:03.950> packaging<00:02:04.429> right<00:02:04.549> here<00:02:04.959> freestanding<00:02:05.959> 10

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
the packaging right here freestanding 10

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:10.059 
the packaging right here freestanding 10
liter<00:02:07.420> non<00:02:08.420> freestanding<00:02:09.050> 10<00:02:09.500> liter<00:02:09.740> that's

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
liter non freestanding 10 liter that's

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:11.850 
liter non freestanding 10 liter that's
actually<00:02:10.459> it's<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.640> no-brainer<00:02:10.819> no-brainer

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
actually it's a no-brainer no-brainer

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.580 
actually it's a no-brainer no-brainer
for<00:02:12.860> real<00:02:13.160> estate<00:02:13.520> in<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.700> pack<00:02:14.380> let's<00:02:15.380> open

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
for real estate in the pack let's open
