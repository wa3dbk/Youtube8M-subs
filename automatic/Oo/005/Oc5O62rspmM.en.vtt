00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
here and it takes a while for the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.680 
here and it takes a while for the
monitor<00:02:25.950> to<00:02:26.400> shove<00:02:26.910> off<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.240> I<00:02:27.270> don't<00:02:27.450> want<00:02:27.600> it

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690

screensaver up for I think it's like 30
minutes<00:02:32.400> or<00:02:32.580> something<00:02:33.350> but<00:02:34.350> when<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.650> go<00:02:34.800> to

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.990 
minutes or something but when I go to
sleep<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.310> don't<00:02:35.370> want<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.640> have<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.790> wait<00:02:35.970> that

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
sleep I don't want to have to wait that

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.210 
sleep I don't want to have to wait that
30<00:02:36.450> minutes<00:02:36.840> for<00:02:36.990> my<00:02:37.080> screen<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.530> go<00:02:37.650> off<00:02:37.830> so

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
30 minutes for my screen to go off so

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.240 
30 minutes for my screen to go off so
it's<00:02:38.880> going<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.150> sleep<00:02:39.420> display<00:02:40.230> up<00:02:41.010> in<00:02:41.160> this

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
it's going to sleep display up in this

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.820 
it's going to sleep display up in this
right<00:02:41.459> corner<00:02:41.820> and<00:02:42.000> it<00:02:42.810> instantly<00:02:43.170> shuts<00:02:43.620> off

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
right corner and it instantly shuts off

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.280 
right corner and it instantly shuts off
and<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.760> don't<00:02:45.300> have<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:45.959> know<00:02:46.050> deal<00:02:46.260> with

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
and I don't have to you know deal with

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.660 
and I don't have to you know deal with
the<00:02:46.470> bright<00:02:46.650> screen<00:02:46.950> when<00:02:47.160> I'm<00:02:47.250> trying<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.520> go

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
the bright screen when I'm trying to go

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.480 
the bright screen when I'm trying to go
to<00:02:47.730> sleep<00:02:47.880> so<00:02:48.860> just<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.950> quick<00:02:50.070> little<00:02:50.160> video

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
to sleep so just a quick little video

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.340 
to sleep so just a quick little video
but<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.270> think<00:02:51.570> it's<00:02:51.660> kind<00:02:51.780> of<00:02:51.870> cool<00:02:52.050> that<00:02:52.110> you

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
but I think it's kind of cool that you

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.290 
but I think it's kind of cool that you
can<00:02:52.470> do<00:02:52.620> all<00:02:52.650> these<00:02:52.920> small<00:02:53.670> things<00:02:53.700> on<00:02:54.150> here

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
can do all these small things on here

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.090 
can do all these small things on here
I'm<00:02:54.810> like<00:02:55.020> I<00:02:55.140> said<00:02:55.350> I've<00:02:55.440> never<00:02:55.590> seen<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:55.890> video

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
I'm like I said I've never seen a video

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.300 
I'm like I said I've never seen a video
about<00:02:56.550> that<00:02:57.030> on<00:02:57.830> youtube<00:02:58.830> or<00:02:58.950> anything<00:02:59.280> like

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
about that on youtube or anything like

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.160 
about that on youtube or anything like
that<00:02:59.459> or<00:02:59.670> on<00:02:59.880> that<00:03:00.030> hillside<00:03:00.239> so<00:03:00.690> I<00:03:00.780> figured<00:03:01.080> I

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
that or on that hillside so I figured I

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.260 
that or on that hillside so I figured I
would<00:03:01.320> make<00:03:01.350> one<00:03:01.620> book<00:03:01.800> wish<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.160> my<00:03:02.270> next

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
would make one book wish and my next

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.390
