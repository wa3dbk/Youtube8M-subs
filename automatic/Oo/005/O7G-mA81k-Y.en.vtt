 what are you felipe here abuelito 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:19.029
 finding out about the care of 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.880
 pets and that my dad told me that if 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.910
 ended the year with academic excellence 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.259
 gives me permission to adopt a pet 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.529
 then I guess you have good 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:33.370
 qualifications does not follow grandpa I'm 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:36.190
 doing my best I love m and what 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.320
 kind of pet would you like to have me 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.090
 I love dogs and for 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.050
 comments from my friends you have to be 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:46.890
 very responsible, of course my son is that he is 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.170
 a living being that will depend on you 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.330
 Exactly then I've been reading in 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.130
 Some pages on the internet 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.010
 necessary care to have a 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.250
 healthy pet and what are those 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.380
 care first the feeding 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.490
 I have to give him a concentrate of 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:09.250
 quality and always give you fresh water 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:11.140
 second the cleaning and the exercise I have 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.780
 to bathe him at least once a month 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.320
 or when you feel that the puppy is very 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.979
 dirty third I should take him out for a walk 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.409
 three times a day depending on the race 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.600
 fourth show him where he should do his 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.729
 depositions and fifth 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.140
 I have to be aware of his vaccines to 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.010
 that is not going to get sick is also 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.050
 very important to adapt a place 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.290
 comfortable in the house to sleep 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.110
 with a clean and comfortable bed and where 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.090
 we can get the bed because I was 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.130
 looking and in several veterinarians it 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.770
 can get but I called the 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.680
 attention the agro field page have 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.180
 many products like food games 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:57.940
 houses brushes cleaning things and so on 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.830
 I see you very animated with the subject but 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.410
 I think it's better that you get to 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:07.680
 Study for your parents to authorize you 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.680
 to have it you are absolutely right grandpa 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.220

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:17.540
 get inspired knowing many more things 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.540
