00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.110 
just go brush my teeth I'm done there's
a<00:01:00.960> slight<00:01:01.230> technique<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:02.100> first<00:01:02.609> thing<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.940> do

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
a slight technique to first thing I do

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.700 
a slight technique to first thing I do
is<00:01:03.149> brush<00:01:03.629> with<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:03.930> bristles<00:01:04.379> facing

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
is brush with the bristles facing

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.560 
is brush with the bristles facing
upwards<00:01:05.129> going<00:01:05.489> through<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.850> brace<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.510> you

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
upwards going through the brace so you

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.359 
upwards going through the brace so you
get<00:01:06.869> in<00:01:06.990> between<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.500> brace<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.130> rinse

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
get in between the brace and the rinse

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.780 
get in between the brace and the rinse
if<00:01:08.610> necessary<00:01:09.210> if<00:01:09.540> not<00:01:09.840> then<00:01:10.200> brush<00:01:10.790> downwards

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
if necessary if not then brush downwards

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.219 
if necessary if not then brush downwards
with<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> bristles<00:01:12.390> down<00:01:12.689> all<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.110> way

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
with the bristles down all the way

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.350 
with the bristles down all the way
across<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.439> ball<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.010> then<00:01:14.460> repeat<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.119> same

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
across the ball and then repeat the same

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.870 
across the ball and then repeat the same
again<00:01:15.900> for<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.770> top<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.430> order<00:01:17.820> of

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
again for the top to the order of

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.090 
again for the top to the order of
rushing<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.360> exactly<00:01:18.840> essential<00:01:19.470> but<00:01:19.740> if<00:01:19.920> you

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
rushing is exactly essential but if you

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.980 
rushing is exactly essential but if you
brush<00:01:20.280> upwards<00:01:20.610> then<00:01:21.150> downward<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:21.869> can

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
brush upwards then downward so you can

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.330 
brush upwards then downward so you can
make<00:01:22.080> sure<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.439> everything<00:01:22.770> falls<00:01:22.950> out<00:01:23.310> of

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
make sure that everything falls out of

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.980 
make sure that everything falls out of
the<00:01:23.580> bottom<00:01:23.850> then<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.360> want<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.540> work<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:24.930> the
