real hair and the human hair since it's
real<00:02:44.430> hair<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:44.850> what<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.660> does<00:02:45.870> is<00:02:46.170> it

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
real hair and what that does is it

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.170 
real hair and what that does is it
tightens<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.920> extension<00:02:47.370> hair<00:02:47.550> around<00:02:47.790> your

real hair even further to where that

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.970 
real hair even further to where that
leads<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:51.030> breakage<00:02:51.360> in<00:02:51.480> itself<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.110> after

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
leads to breakage in itself and after

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.650 
leads to breakage in itself and after
the<00:02:53.070> water<00:02:53.280> dries<00:02:53.580> out<00:02:53.760> feels<00:02:54.090> even<00:02:54.390> more

water does not swell synthetic hair at

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.630 
water does not swell synthetic hair at
