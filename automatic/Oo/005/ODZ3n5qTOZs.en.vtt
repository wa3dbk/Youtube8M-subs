just to show you the location of the
heated<00:00:07.620> resistor<00:00:08.010> I<00:00:08.189> believe<00:00:09.120> some<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.389> you

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
heated resistor I believe some of you

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.499 
heated resistor I believe some of you
are<00:00:09.599> struggling<00:00:10.969> well<00:00:11.969> so<00:00:12.090> you<00:00:12.150> want<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.389> find

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
are struggling well so you want to find

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.010 
are struggling well so you want to find
find<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.170> heater<00:00:13.349> resistor<00:00:13.889> on<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.280> European

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
find a heater resistor on a European

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.470 
find a heater resistor on a European
Peugeot<00:00:16.020> this<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.440> 307<00:00:17.279> don't<00:00:18.180> know<00:00:18.270> if<00:00:18.390> the

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
Peugeot this is a 307 don't know if the

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.340 
Peugeot this is a 307 don't know if the
207's<00:00:19.140> or<00:00:19.260> whatever<00:00:19.470> other<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:21.080> first<00:00:22.080> thing

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
207's or whatever other so first thing

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.109 
207's or whatever other so first thing
is<00:00:22.910> start<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:23.939> engine<00:00:25.369> to<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.400> recirculation

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
is start the engine to the recirculation

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.250 
is start the engine to the recirculation
on<00:00:27.980> now<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.189> opens<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.880> flap<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.599> know<00:00:30.689> click

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
on now that opens a flap you know click

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.490 
on now that opens a flap you know click
it<00:00:31.380> out<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.619> car

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
it out the car

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.750 
it out the car
what<00:00:34.500> I've<00:00:34.950> remove<00:00:35.399> some<00:00:35.640> covers

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:46.360 

and<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.239> torchon

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:55.420 

hopefully<00:00:47.150> you<00:00:47.240> can<00:00:47.360> see<00:00:47.600> this

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:03.319 

right<00:00:56.430> let<00:00:56.640> me<00:00:56.790> out<00:00:56.880> 1<00:00:57.270> reach<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.690> switch

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.920 

so<00:01:03.960> current<00:01:04.320> reach<00:01:05.510> can't<00:01:06.510> see<00:01:06.690> what<00:01:06.840> I'm

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
so current reach can't see what I'm

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:16.670 
so current reach can't see what I'm
doing<00:01:07.170> I'm<00:01:07.409> upside<00:01:08.220> down

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:25.870 

well<00:01:17.310> see<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:18.620> recirculation<00:01:21.350> in<00:01:22.350> view

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.780 

ah

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.219 

I'm<00:01:33.790> on<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:34.030> main<00:01:34.180> right<00:01:34.450> here's<00:01:34.780> how<00:01:34.900> could<00:01:35.200> I

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
I'm on the main right here's how could I

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:53.010 
I'm on the main right here's how could I
hurry<00:01:35.470> up

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.039 

mostly<00:01:53.650> possum<00:01:54.070> again

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.550 

Hunter's<00:01:59.979> green<00:02:00.219> on<00:02:00.399> this<00:02:00.520> camera<00:02:00.729> but<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:02.229> hit

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
Hunter's green on this camera but to hit

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.830 
Hunter's green on this camera but to hit
the<00:02:02.649> recirculation

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.400 

flap<00:02:07.619> opens<00:02:08.660> and<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.810> eater<00:02:10.530> resister

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.510 

is<00:02:13.950> nothing<00:02:14.400> side<00:02:15.320> not<00:02:16.320> your<00:02:16.530> best<00:02:16.980> angle

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.500 

don't<00:02:20.520> know<00:02:20.580> if<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:20.730> can<00:02:20.820> see<00:02:21.000> just<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.360> edge

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
don't know if you can see just the edge

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.500 
don't know if you can see just the edge
of<00:02:21.630> that<00:02:21.750> each<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.440> resistor<00:02:23.090> grab<00:02:24.090> older<00:02:24.390> that

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
of that each a resistor grab older that

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.670 
of that each a resistor grab older that
turn<00:02:25.260> it<00:02:25.410> 90<00:02:25.710> degrees<00:02:26.000> pull<00:02:27.000> it<00:02:27.150> down

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
turn it 90 degrees pull it down

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:37.509 
turn it 90 degrees pull it down
hopefully<00:02:28.680> that's<00:02:29.100> helped<00:02:33.650> so

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.420 

I've<00:02:38.519> taken<00:02:38.700> off<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.030> covers<00:02:40.099> ran<00:02:41.099> this<00:02:41.250> here

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
I've taken off the covers ran this here

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.240 
I've taken off the covers ran this here
in<00:02:41.549> column<00:02:41.819> one<00:02:42.269> around<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:42.569> heater<00:02:43.250> that's

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
in column one around the heater that's

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.629 
in column one around the heater that's
where<00:02:44.400> you<00:02:44.489> can<00:02:44.580> find<00:02:44.640> it<00:02:44.940> I<00:02:45.060> hope<00:02:45.209> this<00:02:45.330> helps
