00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
for that option because the standard

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.070 
for that option because the standard
setup<00:02:26.010> it's<00:02:26.519> just<00:02:26.790> so<00:02:26.970> good<00:02:27.239> I<00:02:27.450> mean<00:02:27.810> this<00:02:27.930> car

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
goes around corners extremely well but I

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.090 
goes around corners extremely well but I
do<00:02:30.450> have<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:30.840> complaint<00:02:31.319> so<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:31.830> fact<00:02:31.980> the

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
do have a complaint so the fact the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.520 
do have a complaint so the fact the
steering<00:02:32.519> feels<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.330> little<00:02:33.810> bit<00:02:33.900> inert<00:02:34.230> and

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
steering feels a little bit inert and

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.670 
steering feels a little bit inert and
overall<00:02:35.190> well<00:02:35.730> it's<00:02:35.940> very<00:02:36.120> very<00:02:36.269> capable<00:02:37.049> it's

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
overall well it's very very capable it's

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.120 
overall well it's very very capable it's
just<00:02:37.950> not<00:02:38.340> really<00:02:38.640> that<00:02:38.850> much<00:02:39.330> fun<00:02:39.799> as<00:02:40.799> for<00:02:41.069> the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
just not really that much fun as for the

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.590 
just not really that much fun as for the
downsides<00:02:41.610> well<00:02:41.910> I'm<00:02:42.060> gonna<00:02:42.209> have<00:02:42.299> a<00:02:42.390> moment

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
downsides well I'm gonna have a moment

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.570 
downsides well I'm gonna have a moment
about<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.230> seat<00:02:43.590> bases<00:02:43.890> because<00:02:44.310> they<00:02:44.400> don't

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
about the seat bases because they don't

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.160 
about the seat bases because they don't
seem<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:44.730> have<00:02:44.819> any<00:02:45.030> lateral<00:02:45.690> support<00:02:46.049> which

seem to have any lateral support which

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.750 
seem to have any lateral support which
means<00:02:46.380> it<00:02:46.500> feels<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.769> bit<00:02:46.799> like<00:02:47.069> you're<00:02:47.280> sitting

and then there's a not too small matter
of<00:03:39.330> price<00:03:39.959> because<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.410> Passat<00:03:40.740> is<00:03:40.980> slightly

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430

more<00:03:41.580> expensive<00:03:41.670> than<00:03:42.510> its<00:03:42.660> main<00:03:42.870> rivals<00:03:43.350> that

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
more expensive than its main rivals that

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.930 
more expensive than its main rivals that
said<00:03:43.739> because<00:03:43.950> of<00:03:44.040> its<00:03:44.160> strong<00:03:44.340> brand<00:03:44.670> image

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
said because of its strong brand image

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.670 
said because of its strong brand image
it<00:03:45.180> will<00:03:45.420> hold<00:03:45.630> its<00:03:45.810> value<00:03:45.870> better<00:03:46.350> than<00:03:46.500> most

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
it will hold its value better than most

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.470 
it will hold its value better than most
come<00:03:47.010> resale<00:03:47.459> time<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:47.940> I<00:03:48.060> have<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:48.330> say
