00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
that they included that because it looks

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.289 
that they included that because it looks
really<00:03:38.620> good<00:03:38.739> it's<00:03:39.190> not<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:39.610> I<00:03:39.850> didn't<00:03:40.030> do<00:03:40.090> too

sometimes when they do like dirt or
little<00:03:43.690> injuries<00:03:43.959> they<00:03:44.110> can<00:03:44.260> be<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.070> little

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
little injuries they can be a little

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.520

heavy-handed<00:03:45.519> with<00:03:45.910> their<00:03:46.030> paint<00:03:46.530> speaking

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
of paint the hair on his head for the

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.910 
of paint the hair on his head for the
most<00:03:49.269> parts<00:03:49.570> pretty<00:03:49.840> good<00:03:50.110> when<00:03:50.500> you<00:03:50.590> follow

it<00:03:51.190> I<00:03:51.340> mean<00:03:52.030> sometimes<00:03:52.390> this<00:03:52.840> can<00:03:52.989> get<00:03:53.110> a

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
it I mean sometimes this can get a

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.479 
it I mean sometimes this can get a
little<00:03:53.320> messy<00:03:53.530> here<00:03:53.680> but<00:03:53.769> I<00:03:53.829> think<00:03:53.890> his<00:03:54.160> bangs

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
little messy here but I think his bangs

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.420 
little messy here but I think his bangs
are<00:03:55.180> really<00:03:56.110> clean<00:03:56.350> really<00:03:56.560> well<00:03:56.829> done<00:03:57.190> it

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
are really clean really well done it

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.710 
are really clean really well done it
only<00:03:57.519> loses<00:03:58.090> a<00:03:58.120> little<00:03:58.239> bit<00:03:58.329> of<00:03:58.450> points<00:03:58.660> right

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
here when they don't fully paint that

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.670 
here when they don't fully paint that
section<00:04:01.090> of<00:04:01.239> the<00:04:01.269> hair<00:04:01.510> but<00:04:02.320> I'd<00:04:02.410> rather<00:04:02.500> have

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680

I also like the sculpt of his pants
there's<00:04:29.150> a<00:04:29.180> good<00:04:29.300> little<00:04:29.389> texture<00:04:29.870> to<00:04:29.900> them<00:04:30.110> as

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
there's a good little texture to them as

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.550 
there's a good little texture to them as
well<00:04:30.699> and<00:04:31.699> I<00:04:32.270> love<00:04:32.479> that<00:04:32.630> the<00:04:32.960> painting<00:04:33.320> on<00:04:33.440> all

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
well and I love that the painting on all

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.159 
well and I love that the painting on all
the<00:04:33.680> bandages<00:04:34.190> here<00:04:34.550> I'll<00:04:35.090> stay<00:04:35.720> within<00:04:35.930> the

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
the bandages here I'll stay within the

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.510 
the bandages here I'll stay within the
sculpt<00:04:36.500> none<00:04:36.800> of<00:04:36.889> the<00:04:36.949> paint's<00:04:37.280> really

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
sculpt none of the paint's really

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.610 
sculpt none of the paint's really
straying<00:04:37.940> anywhere<00:04:38.389> so<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.169> paint<00:04:39.410> quality

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
straying anywhere so the paint quality

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.290 
straying anywhere so the paint quality
is<00:04:39.919> good<00:04:40.130> but<00:04:40.310> also<00:04:40.370> like<00:04:40.759> the<00:04:40.850> attention<00:04:41.090> to

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
is good but also like the attention to

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.090 
is good but also like the attention to
detail<00:04:41.690> within<00:04:41.870> that<00:04:42.050> paint<00:04:42.320> it's<00:04:42.860> really

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
detail within that paint it's really

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
detail within that paint it's really
good<00:04:43.280> because<00:04:43.460> it's<00:04:43.580> not<00:04:43.699> just<00:04:43.850> a<00:04:43.910> single

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
good because it's not just a single

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.430 
good because it's not just a single
paint<00:04:44.419> color<00:04:44.660> there's<00:04:44.870> a<00:04:44.930> can<00:04:45.080> other<00:04:45.199> wash

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
paint color there's a can other wash

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.110 
paint color there's a can other wash
over<00:04:45.710> it<00:04:45.860> so<00:04:46.009> it<00:04:46.100> has<00:04:46.250> a<00:04:46.280> two-tone<00:04:46.789> kind<00:04:46.970> of

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
over it so it has a two-tone kind of

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.029 
over it so it has a two-tone kind of
dirty<00:04:47.330> effect<00:04:47.720> man<00:04:48.380> I<00:04:48.470> think<00:04:48.530> the<00:04:48.710> sculpting

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:49.039 
dirty effect man I think the sculpting

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.980 
dirty effect man I think the sculpting
on<00:04:49.400> this<00:04:49.610> little<00:04:50.090> figure<00:04:50.330> on<00:04:50.539> all<00:04:50.630> three<00:04:50.870> is

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
on this little figure on all three is

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.969 
on this little figure on all three is
really<00:04:51.229> good<00:04:51.380> and<00:04:51.560> the<00:04:51.620> paint<00:04:51.860> really

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:51.979 
really good and the paint really

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.920 
really good and the paint really
complements<00:04:52.580> it<00:04:52.669> also<00:04:53.330> worth<00:04:53.449> noting<00:04:53.600> is<00:04:53.900> the

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
complements it also worth noting is the

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.960 
complements it also worth noting is the
tiny<00:04:54.320> details<00:04:54.620> on<00:04:55.160> the<00:04:55.340> artwork<00:04:55.669> on<00:04:55.850> the<00:04:55.940> front

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
tiny details on the artwork on the front

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.490 
tiny details on the artwork on the front

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.570 
this is really cool considering how
small<00:05:05.720> it<00:05:05.900> is<00:05:05.990> I'm<00:05:06.470> sure<00:05:06.889> that<00:05:07.130> you<00:05:07.280> know<00:05:07.370> like

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
I sent over the actual artwork to Funko

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.990 
I sent over the actual artwork to Funko
so<00:05:09.979> they<00:05:10.039> could<00:05:10.190> print<00:05:10.340> it<00:05:10.430> out<00:05:10.580> and<00:05:10.699> apply<00:05:10.759> it

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
so they could print it out and apply it

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.820 
so they could print it out and apply it
but<00:05:11.570> just<00:05:11.660> the<00:05:11.750> fact<00:05:11.960> it's<00:05:12.110> printed<00:05:12.410> out<00:05:12.530> so

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.219 
but just the fact it's printed out so
small<00:05:13.190> and<00:05:13.490> reads<00:05:13.729> so<00:05:14.090> well<00:05:14.330> I<00:05:14.570> mean<00:05:14.990> there's
