00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.970
 is found for episode 13 14 or I 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.220
 know more which two good teams and 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.110
 it was fucking a fucking good 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.190
 moment we had not played on fucking 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.320
 once a handkerchief I swear to you once 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.070
 stencil 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.049
 no it's good I do everything besides the 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.119
 video it's just that I have a 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.260
 voices of cadars but hey this initials yeah 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.369
 it made a fucking moment water 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.949
 that we had not played on skin of 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:27.150
 cubes and it has changed many others 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.300
 factions so already already already I'm going 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.369
 turn all that up here you're playing slap 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.140
 already I have to show you something very 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.579
 important because it's been since 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.380
 the episode this court there I always have you 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.820
 not boot into video it 's other 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.239
 before posts so we'll go this the 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.780
 thatch 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.550
 ap ap utah is frankly i know this is 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.579
 to go get a wallace candle holder and 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.930
 in addition to outposts then he is not he 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.129
 is not in fact missing a door 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:56.520
 shit we had to break it ok I almost 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.690
 die very well normal calm here 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.699
 that's other before posts so he 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.800
 is relatively disgusting 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.549
 that we were attacked head 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.670
 and it sucks I did not see that 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.960
 shit 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.369
 yeah we tried to bend the front 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.930
 post fortunately there is no 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.880
 richness in since that's it 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.189
 just a front post and so here is 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.240
 I have moats, it's a bit 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.180
 standard is like the front 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.830
 posts and if I vs the stubble center I 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.299
 called it the center of 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.200
 control miannay dallas yeah so that's it 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.710
 we only had diamond blocks 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.790
 sorry we are too rich and there is everything 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.400
 good wyatt game or other stuff that 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.869
 here fall someone from the past 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.700
 since in fact all the college is used here 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.850
 still sum stuff and kind it's a 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.020
 little like the falling stuff that falls 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.570
 from heaven because then there is in 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.970
 there is always staff here 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.049
 so the set was something that 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.000
 seemed rather important to you the 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.229
 yours since that's why 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.790
 also we have a lot of stuff 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.790
 because the shadows and Lorient 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:05.840
 ok and now now now 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:10.100
 we've seen that very very closely we're going 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.650
 go to fo or fo but this is really 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.020
 it's really the total renewal 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.830
 so I personally give you 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.360
 my opinion I find it less 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.650
 impressive that the old factions 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.180
 but they have had a problem with 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.910
 hands because ttr waited must I 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.810
 cut the music of the game the volume of the game 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.080
 fucking hu 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:32.210
 it was boring ok so here's an ode to 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.310
 a main room with chests 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.050
 well, in short, I will not do like 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.280
 every time and take too many goals to 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.630
 all you show there I think you 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.050
 see no need to cheat 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.420
 there is that cov cov beautiful wealth 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.410
 well here is way I will not show the 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.590
 cov because that's saying we're going 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:52.010
 to finally do brief here are still some 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.170
 chests always chests there we ride 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.000
 staircase and a little bit more the trunk 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.090
 - that's seven floors is the brothel 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.709
 because it's still under construction 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.340
 who is it really dense and 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.440
 erik guay 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.680
 yeah that's still the brothel because 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.989
 it starts there we had no 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.320
 condat blocks price of iron blocks 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.830
 faulty to the faction in fact she is 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.030
 huge 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.030
 l huge so we had opportunities 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.230
 unlimited we will never have anything 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.790
 store everything in every body because 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.130
 that we already have nothing that we have 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.300
 so much cov that good here is the 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.959
 madness but she's incredibly 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:30.190
 big slap there we had a little 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.690
 room the coffers are empty here that's it 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:37.959
 the non pardon happened at the stops 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:40.459
 and that's the good one here I'm strolling 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.120
 slap and there normally yeah that's 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.160
 the final step 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.950
 this is the final step to go and 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.570
 d'orb it really takes me bouchard 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.489
 it's the galley the whore she is and 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.040
 of orb and honda the limited possibilities 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.750
 so it will be new factions 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.390
 as I meant the other was a 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.190
 little damaged by convicts 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.790
 tnt because that's it 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.560
 history actually 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:04.290
 very very long story of the blow of the 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.069
 that's it then I have two pvp sequences 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.769
 for this episode 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.900
 I have two I know even more suddenly 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.280
 I'm gonna fuck you now and 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.840
 then I will comment on it 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.329
 think I just want to go get a 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.430
 handkerchief in the meantime and suddenly ben 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.859
 that's what I want to say 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.479
 but I want to say it makes you grasp 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.370
 thank you for continuing to watch my 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.330
 videos on cubes I knew when 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:26.830
 even a lot of time that I do and 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.850
 then well here I do not know why I 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:31.210
 you say that now but that makes 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:33.130
 pleasure and huy and twitter follow me 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.590
 on twitter think I'm going I'm going 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.979
 forget to say it after good brief to everything 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.419
 right now yeah so finally 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.830
 I decided to comment 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:43.360
 damn I forgot to go get a 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.009
 handkerchief yeah so I found a 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.210
 pvp sequence so it's a small series 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.190
 friendly I put them in accelerated 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.180
 because it's a little water and suddenly 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.430
 here I recommend you over 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.370
 so the video is going to be short arch of the 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.770
 blow but good sorry and I took advantage 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.960
 to tell you about the project you know 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.860
 single hub that I talked about which I 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.930
 talked about my life of 3000 subscribers down I 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.060
 think the project will actually come out 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.500
 in fact since I have found little 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.470
 close in fact no I have not found 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.610
 equipped i will be all alone b but in this 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.940
 moment I'm having sleepless nights and 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:16.500
 touch laughing tutorials and his mother at his 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.789
 ploughshare 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.000
 Should I make the shot and 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:24.430
 little project the hula the server vation 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.870
 come out to date but suddenly bah voila 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.240
 does not mean that I stop the adventure 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.330
 pvp faction on break and cube 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.470
 so suddenly it's finally waiting 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.720
 other cases when I see the knowledge 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.449
 maybe I will do less but but 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.830
 well here is green if not there I do not know 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:40.120
 how many kilos and but it's true that 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.490
 I made a fucking carnage 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:45.400
 knowing that I was not playing I was not playing 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:48.370
 common how dare you see I even 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.710
 I made a lot of mistakes and in the end 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.970
 I think out of Belgium where flowing 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.159
 and here I think it's the end of the 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.650
 series since there was a guy who 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:58.720
 was coming fupo and everything is at the stroke of 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.509
 kick I crossed a fund ben go 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.370
 well here's like and the video is 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:08.520
 do what you have to do is everything 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:08.520
 found care of you and see you next time
