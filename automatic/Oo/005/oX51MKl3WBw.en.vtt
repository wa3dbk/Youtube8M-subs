what<00:00:15.630> I'm<00:00:15.750> doing<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.199> I'm<00:00:16.379> recording<00:00:16.859> using

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
what I'm doing is I'm recording using

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.779 
what I'm doing is I'm recording using
the<00:00:18.630> mic<00:00:18.900> or<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.500> built-in<00:00:20.039> microphone<00:00:20.400> on

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
the mic or the built-in microphone on

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.050 
the mic or the built-in microphone on
the<00:00:20.820> canon<00:00:21.270> powershot<00:00:21.500> sx1<00:00:22.500> 70<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.670> camera

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
the canon powershot sx1 70 is the camera

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.420 
the canon powershot sx1 70 is the camera
and<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:25.230> reason<00:00:25.529> i'm<00:00:25.650> doing<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.400> that

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
and the reason i'm doing this is so that

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.040 
and the reason i'm doing this is so that
you<00:00:26.760> can<00:00:26.789> see<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.300> difference<00:00:27.630> between<00:00:27.810> a

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
you can see the difference between a

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.439 
you can see the difference between a
camera<00:00:28.470> microphone<00:00:28.980> versus<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.820> microphone

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
camera microphone versus a microphone

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.860 
camera microphone versus a microphone
actual<00:00:31.320> microphone<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.009> right<00:00:32.610> now<00:00:32.759> I'm<00:00:33.090> in<00:00:33.510> a

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
actual microphone and right now I'm in a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.940 
actual microphone and right now I'm in a
little<00:00:33.989> bit<00:00:34.140> I'm<00:00:34.260> going<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.500> switch<00:00:34.649> over<00:00:34.800> to

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
little bit I'm going to switch over to

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.440 
little bit I'm going to switch over to
this<00:00:35.219> microphone<00:00:35.700> which<00:00:35.880> I<00:00:36.000> have<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.300> on

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
this microphone which I have it on

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.560 
this microphone which I have it on
nothing<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> tripod<00:00:37.790> so<00:00:38.790> I'm<00:00:39.149> very<00:00:39.360> I'm

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
nothing on a tripod so I'm very I'm

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.680 
nothing on a tripod so I'm very I'm
about<00:00:40.140> like<00:00:40.550> less<00:00:41.550> than<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> foot<00:00:42.090> away<00:00:42.120> from<00:00:42.360> it

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
about like less than a foot away from it

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.410 
about like less than a foot away from it
and<00:00:42.870> I'm<00:00:43.590> going<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.770> be<00:00:43.980> switching<00:00:44.910> over<00:00:45.000> in

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
and I'm going to be switching over in

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.700 
and I'm going to be switching over in
three<00:00:45.780> two<00:00:46.140> one

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
three two one

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.040 
three two one
so<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.430> how<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.579> microphone<00:00:47.940> sounds<00:00:48.570> it

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
so this is how the microphone sounds it

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.319 
so this is how the microphone sounds it
sounds<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.440> lot<00:00:49.649> cleaner<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.910> better

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
sounds a lot cleaner and better

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.779 
sounds a lot cleaner and better
especially<00:00:51.660> if<00:00:52.230> you're<00:00:52.410> closer<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.520> mic

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
especially if you're closer to the mic

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.540 
especially if you're closer to the mic
and<00:00:54.030> I'm<00:00:54.390> not<00:00:54.570> using<00:00:54.719> any<00:00:54.989> filters<00:00:55.500> or<00:00:55.800> any<00:00:55.949> any

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.960 
regular it gets a little bit too loud
and<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.500> don't<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.979> don't<00:01:50.250> want<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.430> be<00:01:50.520> too<00:01:50.700> close

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
and I don't I don't want to be too close

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.960 
and I don't I don't want to be too close
because<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.689> might<00:01:51.960> distort<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.100> audio<00:01:53.909> a

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
because it it might distort the audio a

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.690 
because it it might distort the audio a
lot<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:55.170> that's<00:01:55.380> regular<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.219> then<00:01:56.430> I'm<00:01:56.520> also

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
lot so that's regular and then I'm also

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.090 
lot so that's regular and then I'm also
going<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:56.969> go<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.149> +10<00:01:57.719> decibels<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.409> one

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
going to go to +10 decibels that one

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.370 
going to go to +10 decibels that one
gets<00:01:59.280> really<00:01:59.640> loud<00:01:59.850> it's<00:02:00.210> a<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:01.049> know<00:02:01.170> it's

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
gets really loud it's a you know it's

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.870 
gets really loud it's a you know it's
almost<00:02:01.610> unrecorded

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
almost unrecorded

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.719 
almost unrecorded
I<00:02:02.969> don't<00:02:03.149> know<00:02:03.920> you<00:02:04.920> might<00:02:05.130> be<00:02:05.159> using<00:02:05.460> this

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
I don't know you might be using this

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.459 
I don't know you might be using this
like<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.119> a<00:02:06.210> conference<00:02:06.570> call<00:02:06.869> with<00:02:06.899> multiple

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
like in a conference call with multiple

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:08.449 
like in a conference call with multiple
people<00:02:07.799> in<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.920> room

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
people in the room

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.479 
people in the room
and<00:02:08.549> so<00:02:09.530> yeah<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:12.859> there<00:02:13.859> you<00:02:13.950> go<00:02:14.099> there's<00:02:14.400> the

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
and so yeah so there you go there's the

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.270 
and so yeah so there you go there's the
-<00:02:15.329> 10<00:02:15.599> decibels<00:02:15.930> which<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.530> think<00:02:16.980> it's<00:02:17.129> the

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
- 10 decibels which I think it's the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.800 
- 10 decibels which I think it's the
best<00:02:17.400> sounding<00:02:17.879> one<00:02:18.030> especially<00:02:18.569> if<00:02:18.629> you're<00:02:18.780> a

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
best sounding one especially if you're a

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.170 
best sounding one especially if you're a
bit<00:02:18.989> further<00:02:19.260> or<00:02:19.530> closer<00:02:19.920> if<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.700> get<00:02:20.879> further

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
bit further or closer if I get further

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.050 
bit further or closer if I get further
it<00:02:21.599> sort<00:02:22.079> of<00:02:22.200> sounds<00:02:22.439> it<00:02:23.069> doesn't<00:02:23.609> sound<00:02:23.849> as

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
it sort of sounds it doesn't sound as

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.619 
it sort of sounds it doesn't sound as
good<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.870> audio<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.379> not<00:02:25.409> clean<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:27.420> just

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
good the audio is not clean it just

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.690 
good the audio is not clean it just
sounds<00:02:27.900> like<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.019> regular<00:02:28.349> microphone<00:02:29.250> almost

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700
