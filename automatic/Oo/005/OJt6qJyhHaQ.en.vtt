just south southeast of the general
store<00:01:16.829> I<00:01:18.200> would<00:01:19.200> say<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.810> it's

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
store I would say this is just it's

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.190 
store I would say this is just it's
probably<00:01:22.890> almost<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.340> same<00:01:23.520> spirits

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
probably almost the same spirits

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.740 
probably almost the same spirits
crafting<00:01:25.200> Astro<00:01:25.530> runes<00:01:26.509> except<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.630> don't

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
they start to degrade and yeah there's

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.580 
they start to degrade and yeah there's
not<00:02:05.969> much<00:02:06.629> more<00:02:07.170> than<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:09.079> just<00:02:10.079> need<00:02:10.379> to

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
not much more than that you just need to

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.740 
not much more than that you just need to
craft<00:02:11.540> these<00:02:12.540> now<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.019> go<00:02:13.530> back<00:02:13.799> the<00:02:14.750> reason

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
craft these now and go back the reason

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.960 
craft these now and go back the reason
the<00:02:16.319> reason<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:16.739> don't<00:02:16.799> have<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.160> TR<00:02:17.489> instead

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
the reason I don't have a TR instead

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.949 
the reason I don't have a TR instead
it's<00:02:18.450> because<00:02:19.019> I<00:02:19.410> prefer<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:20.569> to<00:02:21.569> wear<00:02:21.750> the

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
it's because I prefer to to wear the

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.289 
it's because I prefer to to wear the
full<00:02:22.200> graceful<00:02:22.709> set<00:02:22.950> I'm<00:02:23.730> actually<00:02:23.940> not<00:02:24.239> sure

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
full graceful set I'm actually not sure

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.020 
full graceful set I'm actually not sure
if<00:02:24.750> it's<00:02:24.989> worth<00:02:25.430> not<00:02:26.430> having<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.819> full

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
if it's worth not having the full

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.860 
if it's worth not having the full
graceful<00:02:27.630> and<00:02:27.989> I<00:02:28.230> mean<00:02:28.440> with<00:02:28.560> you

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
graceful and I mean with you

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.140 
graceful and I mean with you
instead<00:02:29.620> but<00:02:30.430> I<00:02:30.849> think<00:02:31.299> it<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:32.190> it<00:02:33.190> gives<00:02:33.580> me<00:02:33.819> 20

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
instead but I think it is it gives me 20

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.259 
instead but I think it is it gives me 20
percent<00:02:34.480> more<00:02:34.690> energy

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
percent more energy

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.270 
percent more energy
hmm<00:02:37.450> I<00:02:37.480> was<00:02:37.900> out<00:02:38.049> to<00:02:38.200> try<00:02:38.470> but<00:02:38.709> now<00:02:38.890> I'm<00:02:39.099> doing

going to learn knows one more time so

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:06.460 
going to learn knows one more time so
you<00:02:57.970> guys<00:02:58.150> can<00:02:58.360> see

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.810 

I'm<00:03:07.400> showing<00:03:07.700> this<00:03:08.000> because<00:03:08.210> people<00:03:08.600> think

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
I'm showing this because people think

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.460 
I'm showing this because people think
regressing<00:03:10.820> is<00:03:11.050> extremely<00:03:12.050> hard<00:03:12.260> and

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
regressing is extremely hard and

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.410 
regressing is extremely hard and
ultimate<00:03:13.130> and<00:03:14.680> it<00:03:15.680> is<00:03:15.980> a<00:03:16.280> little<00:03:16.670> if<00:03:16.940> we<00:03:17.210> do

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
ultimate and it is a little if we do

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.930 
ultimate and it is a little if we do
through<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.260> abbeys<00:03:18.710> it's<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.370> same<00:03:19.580> speed

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
through the abbeys it's the same speed

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.240 
through the abbeys it's the same speed
and<00:03:20.210> you<00:03:20.840> can<00:03:20.870> do<00:03:21.200> through<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.740> abyss<00:03:21.920> if

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
and you can do through the abyss if

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.250 
and you can do through the abyss if
y'all<00:03:22.460> start<00:03:22.730> ups<00:03:23.030> and<00:03:23.360> they've<00:03:23.750> are<00:03:23.900> at<00:03:24.050> your

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
y'all start ups and they've are at your

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.490 
y'all start ups and they've are at your
house<00:03:24.440> you<00:03:25.130> can<00:03:25.310> do<00:03:25.690> rooms<00:03:26.690> with<00:03:26.990> the<00:03:27.110> heavies

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
house you can do rooms with the heavies

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.140 
house you can do rooms with the heavies
an<00:03:28.430> ultimate<00:03:29.270> and<00:03:29.570> it's<00:03:29.900> almost<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.940> same

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
an ultimate and it's almost the same

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.690 
an ultimate and it's almost the same
speed<00:03:32.600> as<00:03:32.840> a<00:03:32.900> normal<00:03:33.500> account<00:03:33.740> you<00:03:34.040> will<00:03:34.400> just

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
speed as a normal account you will just

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.760 
speed as a normal account you will just
have<00:03:34.880> one<00:03:35.570> less<00:03:35.810> space<00:03:36.200> for<00:03:36.860> the<00:03:36.980> looting<00:03:37.280> mode

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
have one less space for the looting mode

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.120 
have one less space for the looting mode
but<00:03:40.540> if<00:03:41.540> you<00:03:41.720> do<00:03:41.840> like<00:03:42.020> these<00:03:42.290> it's<00:03:42.560> just<00:03:43.040> a

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
but if you do like these it's just a

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.550 
but if you do like these it's just a
little<00:03:43.340> bit<00:03:43.460> slower<00:03:43.760> like<00:03:44.180> 2<00:03:44.480> or<00:03:44.510> 3<00:03:44.630> k<00:03:45.050> XP<00:03:45.350> an

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
little bit slower like 2 or 3 k XP an

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.270 
little bit slower like 2 or 3 k XP an
hour<00:03:45.680> slower<00:03:46.130> and<00:03:47.290> yeah<00:03:48.290> interest<00:03:49.070> from

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
hour slower and yeah interest from

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.480 
hour slower and yeah interest from
drafting<00:03:50.230> we're<00:03:51.230> crossing<00:03:51.530> slow<00:03:51.950> by<00:03:52.160> itself

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
drafting we're crossing slow by itself

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.520 
drafting we're crossing slow by itself
like<00:03:53.030> this<00:03:53.210> is<00:03:53.420> just<00:03:53.600> a<00:03:53.780> little<00:03:53.930> bit<00:03:54.110> slower<00:03:54.350> so

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
like this is just a little bit slower so

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.060 
like this is just a little bit slower so
it's<00:03:55.300> possible<00:03:56.300> to<00:03:56.780> get<00:03:57.080> 99<00:03:57.770> runecrafting

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
it's possible to get 99 runecrafting

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.180 
it's possible to get 99 runecrafting
like<00:03:58.760> these<00:03:59.170> not<00:04:00.170> something<00:04:00.650> I'm<00:04:00.770> looking

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
like these not something I'm looking

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.610 
like these not something I'm looking
forward<00:04:01.610> to<00:04:01.670> it

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
forward to it

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.250 
forward to it
yeah<00:04:03.620> it's<00:04:04.010> not<00:04:04.280> desert<00:04:04.850> some<00:04:05.600> people<00:04:05.990> think

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
yeah it's not desert some people think

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.770 
yeah it's not desert some people think
