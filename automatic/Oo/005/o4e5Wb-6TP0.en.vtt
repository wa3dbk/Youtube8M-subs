00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.300
 for a real festival it is true that 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:12.150

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.720
 times a piece of nineteenth and freestyle 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.940
 especially a lot of parties and hopes 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.250
 that they say you are not allowed next to us 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.790

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.690
 on stage or just in front of the stage 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.640
 you have to have that for three minutes 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.320
 just lived up to a freestyle 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:15.600

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.540
 and then also the bee from left 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.610
 to the right and really weigh me down 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.840
 tackle excessive errors 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.970
 great looks very much just sit there 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.280
 how important is what belongs to it 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.200
 majorettes almost hear the 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.640
 obituary there will therefore also have already 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.040
 that dance blew the bee with a nice suit 

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:33.249
 you would laugh and throw lolly sticks and 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.409
 after it comes 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:37.089
 living for three hours was enough 

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:38.289
 dansariekes haagse club of course does 

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:39.939
 nobody in the show 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:42.609
 they are totally wrong but very nice 

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:44.499
 and invested to that and 

00:06:42.609 --> 00:06:45.789
 for the dance mare you have to 

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:47.859
 your entire set 

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:49.239
 my whole set on the stage in the 

00:06:47.859 --> 00:06:51.969
 dance-chic packages 

00:06:49.239 --> 00:06:55.779
 keep dancing making it a party 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:58.719
 a mess has never been shown as guts 

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:59.559

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:02.279

00:06:59.559 --> 00:07:02.279
