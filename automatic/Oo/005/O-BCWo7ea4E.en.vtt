00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:11.119
 sun with the channel I'm going to make one today 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.340
 simple tutorial 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:17.600
 many people want to know how do you 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.310
 play river in the air filter for 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.660
 Do not get caught in the hot air or 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:28.550
 motor is in my case here is I cut 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.830
 this original pipe or mostel and I did 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.920
 two cold air intakes in the 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.920
 bottom 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.270
 the original system 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:54.430
 he pulls the air from behind here the air descends 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:01:00.250
 he comes for a ride on this pipe 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:06.310
 that in the case here would have that box 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:08.800
 the original and the coming and 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.440
 arrive and brolin would pass on the filter to 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.869
 cover with the exit would be here then and 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.550
 this happens to make the filter pull a 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.060
 little cold air 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:22.140
 The solution I found was simple as well 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.140
 simple to do 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:31.360
 the original to people coming 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:33.310
 This piece that I'm behind here is 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.500
 at that angle 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:43.030
 This piece calls that back and forth. 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.700
 this all original back what I did 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.600
 was this piece that she is stuck with 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:54.700
 two for two plastics 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.950
 I took this piece out, right? 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:03.100
 If she's going to leave there, she's going to leave. 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:05.470
 along with this piece here what I did 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.420
 I ended up putting some 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.380
 photos there to show what it was like 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.500
 done 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.810
 I know it well here 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:19.060
 I had this barrel that comes along with 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:22.590
 filter split into two then two 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:26.769
 cold air inlets a board of wine 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.760
 rising raining I can see show 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.540
 a better world 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.540
 She comes 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:44.010
 the attentive and joÃ£o goulart son on top 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:45.260
 and the other is the one here she comes here I did 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.000
 an amendment 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:52.049
 I used enough electrical tape 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:00.470
 she does not get any external comes by 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:03:00.470
 out and will play the star down 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.530
 analyze that piece I cut out 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.950
 I ended up putting that on me. 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:11.740
 yes, do not disturb the air 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:16.100
 the cold air arrives and ends up improving the 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:18.709
 the position of the filter does not 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.440
 So silly people are swaying in 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.290
 forcing these and others pin that ended 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:27.320
 that it was firm that he and I take the air 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:30.470
 cold here that comes down here and 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:34.030
 takes the air that arrives because as well as 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.590
 he got a little taller 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.270
 it got a bit higher then the 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.520
 the front of the car 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.740
 under the hood end up getting a little 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:48.670
 air in the cold air directly into it. 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:48.670
 also personal beauty then
