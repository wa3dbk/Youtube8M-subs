00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:09.320
 hello everyone today with us i want 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.570
 tell how our tomato feels 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.660
 varieties de barao 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.070
 we produced the next one at emission 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.250
 when lowered 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:23.510
 that our upper brushes did not rest 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.349
 and the tip to the top film because 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:29.660
 if it rests then the top 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:32.680
 the brush may die due to the fact that 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.180
 it will come in contact with the film 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.190
 so we performed the next at 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.340
 emitting from the bottom you can see that we 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.450
 closed foliage today by the way we will 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:47.239
 do another collection yet collect 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:51.890
 apparently we collect as I said already like this 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.390
 he began to drill for full singing 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.910
 we do not allow it because it is very difficult 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.100
 then put him to stack he 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:03.710
 his nose pierces his neighbor and 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.250
 so it turns out marriage and so little 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.100
 he 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.120
 it became pink like this 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.940
 already gathering here is a tomato can already be 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.860
 collect quite 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.310
 From the bottom of the foliage until we remove because 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.850
 leaf double function performs closes 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.960
 from excess sun to not baked 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.710
 tomatoes because so many 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.630
 problem from below the tomato starts 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.880
 bake and it turns out right here 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.580
 This spot is spot and side spot and 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:38.680
 this is no longer candida such a tomato even on 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:43.790
 a tomato is no good we leave a leaf and 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:47.860
 thanks to this we are kept in the shadow 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:51.440
 the bulk of the tomato and does not burst and 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.780
 second than it is good that when 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.540
 remove the extra sheet and it is an hour 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.970
 temperature drops and moisture can 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.660
 just when little leaf on 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.110
 tomato 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:07.280
 the tomato starts to crack burst it 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:10.580
 is also a marriage and tomato curls 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.830
 nobody needs it either 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.120
 remove only when mod 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.209
 weâ€™ll go all the way 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.159
 that's how prominent children removed the tassel 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.010
 then until then can the blossom be removed 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:24.879
 don't do this anyway 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:32.060
 need and nutrition tomato tomato 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:34.730
 food goes through foliage and solar 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:43.390
 energy it all goes through foliage and u 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:46.450
 we get so that the sheet is needed 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.840
 somewhere we are already starting to tie up 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.819
 15 16 brush on tomato too 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:57.650
 make another artificial pollination 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:03:00.010
 monster a little bit unsuccessfully twisted 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.569
 tied up lowered but fix it 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.200
 we have the upper brush is already starting 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.730
 to bloom 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.709
 and once again we will produce 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.569
 artificial pollination because 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.480
 air temperature 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.609
 stays with us for 30 degrees and when 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.220
 she is 30 degrees going bad 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:23.450
 envy will do artificial 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:26.060
 pollination and everything here we see that 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:30.769
 blends the truth in the brush has become smaller 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:33.519
 tomato well this summer was bad somewhere 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:41.359
 tied do not have time implementation therefore 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:44.650
 there were 10 9 tomatoes now 567 too 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.609
 we are satisfied with this situation 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.829
