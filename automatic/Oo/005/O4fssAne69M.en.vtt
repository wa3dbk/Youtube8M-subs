it very clear that I'm here as an actor

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.940 
it very clear that I'm here as an actor
from<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.630> outset<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.170> I've<00:01:13.409> always<00:01:13.650> done

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
from the outset and I've always done

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.249 
from the outset and I've always done
roles<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.369> interest<00:01:14.760> me<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.150> my<00:01:15.720> directors

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
roles that interest me and my directors

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.010 
roles that interest me and my directors
have<00:01:16.740> recognized<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.520> all<00:01:17.790> through<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.390> so<00:01:18.900> as

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
have recognized it all through and so as

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
my audience so I've never probably that

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.010 
my audience so I've never probably that
has<00:01:22.110> been<00:01:22.290> one<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.650> most<00:01:23.810> important<00:01:24.810> and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
has been one of the most important and

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.899 
has been one of the most important and
key<00:01:25.290> factors<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:27.470> aiding<00:01:28.470> me<00:01:28.710> debunking<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.759> lot

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
key factors to aiding me debunking a lot

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.870 
key factors to aiding me debunking a lot
of<00:01:30.030> myths<00:01:30.229> because<00:01:31.229> I've<00:01:32.009> never<00:01:32.070> been<00:01:32.610> one<00:01:32.820> to

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
of myths because I've never been one to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.530 
of myths because I've never been one to
follow<00:01:33.180> myths<00:01:33.509> so<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.950> guess<00:01:35.520> there<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.420> no
