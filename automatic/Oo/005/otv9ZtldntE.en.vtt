00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:17.630
 NORIES Ryoma example collaboration planning bus Videos Right 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:23.599
 Skipping is this is a real 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:26.560
 Very difficult but practical 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:29.400
 Under the pier at Pa Bar 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.650
 It's okay to slide under anything 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.340
 When I remember this casting , my boots 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.260
 I think it will go up more than twice 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.850
 Knack 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.020
 The easiest tip 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.300
 Wow 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:49.530
 First of all 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:54.989
 As you need the speed to ping every time you set up 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:57.160
 It in and Bashi', please take back to the back when the throw struck with pitching 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.690
 Throw in 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:05.760
 The lure is 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:11.450
 It is the same as throwing a stone in old-fashioned standings and throwing dad 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.450
 Make the angle for putting the lure into water as shallow as possible 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.390
 It is the best to touch the water from near water 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.860
 Skip and last 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:28.250
 It goes up with a jerk a hit after I arrived at the water 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.390
 By doing so, the lure itself 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:36.340
 Go up to the top 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.510
 It is a knack to extend the flight distance rather than extending it on skipping with skipping . 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.400
 Actually 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:45.400
 That get down as low as possible of the scaffold say to a lower position of Ashiro 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.850
 Skipping I or was a trick to successfully success 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.159
 More than why 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.149
 Lure from low position 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.800
 It stands on the lowest possible position because it is hit by the water surface 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.370
 So brake setting 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.700
 I think everyone wants to be hard 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.120
 Surprisingly 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.509
 It's normal I'm overhead side hand 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:14.040
 I do it with the same brake setting as that time 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:16.720
 Why? And strengthen the play's rating and that amount 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.980
 Skipping distance is reduced 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.300
 You do not leave a good skip Tteyuu who was was a good skip 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.470
 Because 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:29.290
 By all means 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:34.290
 When it comes to the usual setting or the first time you're scared 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.290
 Please don't make it to the end. 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.160
 Cast accidentally 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.660
 It will be kitting doing this 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:50.090
 This is a very difficult cast Why all means everyone Concern 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.090
 Please remember, there is only practice
