00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.020
 hello everyone I am my faxes and I 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.870
 I bring another good farmer video more 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.300
 that we were forming I am going to tell you a way 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:13.930
 that at least also works and that 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.560
 calculated and such formulas and I think it comes out 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.530
 profitable 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.150
 So far it has cost-effective me 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:23.480
 it is a recipe in the forge 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.130
 mystic well 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.880
 I've seen the title we want to take 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.589
 lots of crystalline powder dt 6 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.469
 we need to make this formula 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:35.469
 in the forge we give you 5 crystals 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:45.379
 to see 5 crystals 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:49.130
 5 philosophical stones 250 london 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:53.000
 Incandescent powder of tier 5 and 1 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:56.470
 crystal and 936 ok I'm going to put one 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.470
 formula of the screen for you to see 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.660
 because it has cost us first I'm going to 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.540
 telling us what it cost us has 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.089
 cost to me at least because to me 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.590
 personally it has cost me 370 31 70 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.940
 buy less 150 heaps of dust 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.940
 incandescent in 10 5 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.820
 the price is usually of the pile of 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:20.510
 dust I comment now between 140 and 160 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.610
 silvers 140 and 160 silvers worth 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.260
 also in adding the pile of dust 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.990
 crystalline that tend to be around 25 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.050
 the 25 ergo plants has cost me already 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:34.250
 I say 7 24 hours or so almost four 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:36.580
 hours has cost me exactly 43 95 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.580
 silvers 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:43.460
 3 about 95 well 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.550
 knowing what it cost us I'm going to 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:49.600
 leave another formula here 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:52.140
 here you can find out how much 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.990
 you need to 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.040
 that you get profitable when you have to 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.820
 come out in quotes to make it 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.180
 profitable 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.920
 in the forge 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.430
 ok yes i said i already say 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.900
 in the forge you can leave from 10 to 40 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.630
 lots of crystalline dust 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.700
 that's a total of 30 figures 40 minus 30 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.180
 30 figures 30 quantities of piles that 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.180
 you can leave 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.900
 knowing with the formula that has been given 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.969
 before what has to come out so that 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.890
 come out profitable we can calculate with another 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:28.900
 formula that I put you right now 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.610
 the probability of it coming out profitable 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.380
 this is that for example in this case I 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.020
 I bought it for an X money 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.200
 to 148 concretely the bunch of 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.630
 you returned it has not cost me almost 4 golds 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.400
 and I need to amortize the 16 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.290
 lots of crystalline powder for 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.290
 amortize what I have invested worth 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.660
 so that 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.130
 16 covers 6 of the numbers that you can 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.690
 get out of the amounts that can you 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:08.620
 go out in the forge 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.620
 six of the 30 numbers is 20% 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.820
 is just over 20 percent of 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.670
 chances that you leave no 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.060
 profitable and more than about 70 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.680
 70 and 70 between 80 percent 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.310
 or less about 80 percent of 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.570
 odds that you'll be profitable 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.370
 good if you believe us here ahead 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.500
 right now I'm going to do a couple of 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.680
 attempts in the forge so that you see the 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.780
 result 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.489
 here you have 22 heaps of dust 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.909
 crystalline has come out quite 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.829
 profitable really is another attempt 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:45.370
 expect that you will need to give nothing 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:47.950
 it's worth so much try 17 heaps of 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.540
 crystalline powder as you can see the 22 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.150
 17 are two quantities that are by 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.349
 on top of being in that 80% of 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.750
 possibilities that behind you 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.190
 fall 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.620
 yes it is true that you may have had 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.020
 bad luck and having taken two in the 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.940
 that are in that 20% yes it is true but 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.650
 in this case you have already been lucky 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.170
 luck are probabilities I have already done 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.550
 I 'm telling you 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:15.650
 and in this way I got out at 22 and 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:18.519
 how much 22 and 15 do not 22 and 17 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.519
 to a total of 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.840
 in the wing of 39 heaps of dust 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.840
 crystalline or the same before 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.230
 that about 25 silvers are about 9 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.170
 with 75 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:36.720
 oros have gotten two attempts 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:39.170
 spent eight golds and I've taken nine and 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.170
 there the thing 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.750
 keep in mind that they are nine euros 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:47.460
 net 975 net if you want to do business 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.830
 with this the priority is greater you have 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.450
 Keep in mind apart from everything 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.670
 that I told you before, you have to have 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.590
 account that there is 15 percent of 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:59.140
 taxes when you sell it 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.730
 what makes you out less than 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:05.470
 probably not 16 in my case in 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:07.090
 this case 16 17 18 and that you get out 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.800
 I recommend I take this out not to sell 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.440
 but to make you the legendary or what 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.230
 you want to do it and not to leave a little 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.150
 cheaper than comparing it clear good 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.460
 and here the video if you have any 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.270
 I doubt you probably have it because 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.980
 I do not explain myself too well 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.660
 I tried to make everything as clear as possible 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.460
 possible but good if you have any doubt 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:31.130
 can you put me in comments what 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.130
 I answer even in game I am my rates 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:38.289
 separate m &amp; r space glasses goals in 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.360
 a comment or even a message 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.669
 private here on YouTube from the channel 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.530
 youtube and I'll explain more 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:46.659
 in detail how the thing works 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.150
 Well, greetings and luck no longer with 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:51.449
 the farmer but with the attempts a 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.449
 greeting
