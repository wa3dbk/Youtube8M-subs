waters okay first one we're gonna take a
look<00:00:17.640> at<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:18.060> it's<00:00:18.510> an<00:00:18.960> open<00:00:19.470> water<00:00:19.680> this<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.130> a

look at is it's an open water this is a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.370 
look at is it's an open water this is a
heated<00:00:20.550> water<00:00:20.760> it's<00:00:21.000> made<00:00:21.180> out<00:00:21.330> of

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
heated water it's made out of

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.759 
heated water it's made out of
polystyrene<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.699> it<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.660> done<00:00:25.500> very

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
polystyrene and it is it is done very

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.419 
polystyrene and it is it is done very
well<00:00:25.830> for<00:00:26.310> us<00:00:26.539> it<00:00:27.539> has<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:28.320> float<00:00:28.680> valve<00:00:28.949> inside

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
well for us it has a float valve inside

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.580 
well for us it has a float valve inside
that<00:00:29.849> controls<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.480> amount<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.720> water<00:00:30.929> in<00:00:31.349> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
that controls the amount of water in the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.490 
that controls the amount of water in the
unit<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.399> has<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.579> heater<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.930> keep<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
unit it has a heater in it to keep the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.940 
unit it has a heater in it to keep the
the<00:00:34.920> plumbing<00:00:35.610> from<00:00:35.760> freezing<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.989> works<00:00:37.620> very

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the plumbing from freezing it works very

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:38.780 
the plumbing from freezing it works very
well

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
well

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.420 
well
we<00:00:39.149> we<00:00:39.629> primarily<00:00:39.989> have<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.469> goat<00:00:40.800> dairy<00:00:41.010> here

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
we we primarily have a goat dairy here

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.600 
we we primarily have a goat dairy here
so<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:42.270> has<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.809> few<00:00:43.170> drawbacks<00:00:43.469> as<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:44.370> see

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
so it has a few drawbacks as you can see

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.420 
so it has a few drawbacks as you can see
inside<00:00:45.090> there<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.660> gets<00:00:46.020> very<00:00:46.110> gunky<00:00:47.100> very

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
inside there it gets very gunky very

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.600 
inside there it gets very gunky very
quickly<00:00:47.989> it's<00:00:48.989> also<00:00:49.200> right<00:00:49.530> at<00:00:49.710> bottom<00:00:50.340> height

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
quickly it's also right at bottom height

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.299 
quickly it's also right at bottom height
so<00:00:51.030> if<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.809> goat<00:00:52.020> just<00:00:52.050> happens<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.800> be<00:00:52.860> standing

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
so if a goat just happens to be standing

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.979 
so if a goat just happens to be standing
there<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:54.030> almost<00:00:54.390> seems<00:00:54.629> like<00:00:54.780> there's

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
there and it almost seems like there's

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.410 
there and it almost seems like there's
on<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.890> daily<00:00:56.370> basis<00:00:56.789> somebody's<00:00:57.239> standing

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
on a daily basis somebody's standing

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.750 
on a daily basis somebody's standing
there<00:00:57.719> they<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.469> tendency<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.010> leave<00:00:59.730> a

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
there they have a tendency to leave a

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.150 
there they have a tendency to leave a
deposit<00:00:59.969> in<00:01:00.539> there<00:01:00.840> which<00:01:01.410> means<00:01:01.620> we<00:01:01.859> have<00:01:02.039> to

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
deposit in there which means we have to

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.500 
deposit in there which means we have to
come<00:01:02.280> along<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.670> clean<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.969> all<00:01:03.090> out<00:01:03.120> and

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
come along and clean it all out and

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.130 
come along and clean it all out and
scrub<00:01:03.750> it<00:01:03.870> all<00:01:03.989> out

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
scrub it all out

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.020 
scrub it all out
overall<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.380> good<00:01:07.590> system<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.310> far<00:01:08.970> as

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
overall a good system as far as

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.670 
overall a good system as far as
sanitation<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.080> think<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:11.070> can<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.430> a

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
sanitation I think it is it can be a

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.420 
sanitation I think it is it can be a
source<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:15.380> bacterial<00:01:16.380> infections<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:16.920> for

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
source for bacterial infections and for

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.700 
source for bacterial infections and for
your<00:01:17.549> animals<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.750> also<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.380> lot<00:01:19.560> of

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
your animals and also it is a lot of

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.230 
your animals and also it is a lot of
maintenance<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.340> lot<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.520> cleaning<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.090> has

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
maintenance a lot of cleaning that has

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.760 
maintenance a lot of cleaning that has
to<00:01:21.390> be<00:01:21.479> done<00:01:21.600> with<00:01:21.810> it

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
to be done with it

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.469 
to be done with it
one<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.369> advantages<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.240> when<00:01:24.390> we

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
one of the advantages of this is when we

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.690 
one of the advantages of this is when we
have<00:01:24.630> babies<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.799> makes<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.159> very<00:01:26.280> easy<00:01:26.580> for

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
have babies it makes it very easy for

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.819 
have babies it makes it very easy for
them<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.630> actually<00:01:27.900> have<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.049> brick<00:01:28.409> that

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
them to we actually have a brick that

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.890 
them to we actually have a brick that
they<00:01:28.979> can<00:01:29.159> jump<00:01:29.490> up<00:01:29.610> on<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.090> drink<00:01:30.750> out<00:01:30.869> of

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
they can jump up on and drink out of

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.510 
they can jump up on and drink out of
this<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:31.259> very<00:01:31.320> easy<00:01:31.710> they<00:01:31.979> don't<00:01:32.159> need<00:01:32.460> a

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
this it's very easy they don't need a

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.160 
this it's very easy they don't need a
whole<00:01:32.790> lot<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:33.150> knowledge<00:01:33.360> how<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.780> drink<00:01:34.049> out

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
whole lot of knowledge how to drink out

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.480 
whole lot of knowledge how to drink out
of<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.350> nipple<00:01:34.530> water<00:01:34.770> so<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.159> good<00:01:35.310> for

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
of the nipple water so it's good for

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.289 
of the nipple water so it's good for
training<00:01:35.729> babies<00:01:36.210> but<00:01:38.030> overall<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.150> good

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
training babies but overall a good

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.510 
training babies but overall a good
system<00:01:39.689> has<00:01:40.170> some<00:01:40.470> sanitation<00:01:41.040> issues<00:01:41.159> which

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
system has some sanitation issues which

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.770 
system has some sanitation issues which
we're<00:01:41.729> always<00:01:41.880> worried<00:01:42.270> about<00:01:42.420> keeping

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
we're always worried about keeping

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.609 
we're always worried about keeping
things<00:01:43.170> as<00:01:43.320> clean<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.740> sanitary<00:01:44.130> as<00:01:44.310> possible

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
things as clean and sanitary as possible

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.899 
things as clean and sanitary as possible
okay<00:01:46.619> next<00:01:46.799> we're<00:01:46.979> gonna<00:01:47.070> talk<00:01:47.189> about<00:01:47.340> is<00:01:47.610> a

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
okay next we're gonna talk about is a

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.359 
okay next we're gonna talk about is a
nipple<00:01:48.630> water<00:01:48.869> this<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.770> commercially

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
product has some downsides one of the

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.680 
product has some downsides one of the
problems<00:02:40.730> we<00:02:40.849> have<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.390> probably<00:02:41.659> the

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
problems we have the probably the

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.360 
problems we have the probably the
biggest<00:02:42.049> problems<00:02:42.319> we<00:02:42.409> have<00:02:42.590> with<00:02:42.709> it<00:02:42.829> is<00:02:43.189> when

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
biggest problems we have with it is when

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.039 
biggest problems we have with it is when
the<00:02:43.489> goats<00:02:43.700> are<00:02:43.849> drinking<00:02:44.150> on<00:02:44.299> it<00:02:44.450> they<00:02:44.780> tend

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
the goats are drinking on it they tend

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.050 
the goats are drinking on it they tend
to<00:02:45.109> bite<00:02:45.409> on<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:45.950> they<00:02:46.069> tend<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.400> let<00:02:46.579> a<00:02:46.790> lot

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
to bite on it and they tend to let a lot

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.369 
to bite on it and they tend to let a lot
of<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.209> water<00:02:47.359> fall<00:02:47.720> out<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:48.019> their<00:02:48.170> mouths

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:48.379 
of the water fall out of their mouths

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:50.619 
of the water fall out of their mouths
and<00:02:48.709> so<00:02:49.159> what<00:02:49.340> you'll<00:02:49.489> see<00:02:49.700> on<00:02:49.879> the<00:02:49.970> ground<00:02:50.150> is

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
and so what you'll see on the ground is

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.170 
and so what you'll see on the ground is
it<00:02:51.019> gets<00:02:51.290> sort<00:02:51.590> of<00:02:51.680> soupy<00:02:52.069> and<00:02:52.220> swampy<00:02:52.670> now<00:02:53.120> we

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
it gets sort of soupy and swampy now we

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.089 
it gets sort of soupy and swampy now we
have<00:02:53.450> this<00:02:53.599> poured<00:02:53.870> on<00:02:53.959> a<00:02:53.989> concrete<00:02:54.379> slab<00:02:54.620> but

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
have this poured on a concrete slab but

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.729 
have this poured on a concrete slab but
unless<00:02:55.280> you<00:02:55.430> keep<00:02:55.670> that<00:02:55.879> cleaned<00:02:56.209> up<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:57.200> tends

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
unless you keep that cleaned up it tends

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.970 
unless you keep that cleaned up it tends
to<00:02:57.859> get<00:02:58.069> pretty<00:02:58.639> wet<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.120> mucky<00:02:59.810> and

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
to get pretty wet and mucky and

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.800 
to get pretty wet and mucky and
eventually<00:03:00.980> you<00:03:01.220> will<00:03:01.400> get<00:03:01.639> you'll<00:03:02.329> get<00:03:02.480> bugs

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
eventually you will get you'll get bugs

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.420 
eventually you will get you'll get bugs
and<00:03:03.109> you'll<00:03:03.230> get<00:03:03.409> things<00:03:03.739> that<00:03:03.920> are<00:03:04.010> living<00:03:04.250> in

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
and you'll get things that are living in

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.979 
and you'll get things that are living in
that<00:03:04.639> water<00:03:04.849> it's<00:03:05.060> a<00:03:05.150> nice<00:03:05.329> little<00:03:05.599> home<00:03:05.750> from

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
that water it's a nice little home from

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.839 
that water it's a nice little home from
them<00:03:06.139> so<00:03:06.560> there's<00:03:06.829> some<00:03:07.040> cleanup<00:03:07.430> that<00:03:07.459> has<00:03:07.700> to

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
them so there's some cleanup that has to

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.670 
them so there's some cleanup that has to
happen<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.329> other<00:03:08.810> thing<00:03:08.959> we<00:03:09.079> found<00:03:09.109> is<00:03:09.560> in

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
happen the other thing we found is in

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.250 
happen the other thing we found is in
the<00:03:09.829> winter<00:03:10.340> time<00:03:10.579> as<00:03:10.909> they<00:03:11.480> do<00:03:11.540> that<00:03:11.720> it'll

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
the winter time as they do that it'll

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.610 
the winter time as they do that it'll
actually<00:03:12.470> build<00:03:13.010> up<00:03:13.220> an<00:03:13.459> ice<00:03:14.230> sickle<00:03:15.230> I<00:03:15.260> kind

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
actually build up an ice sickle I kind

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.140 
actually build up an ice sickle I kind
of<00:03:15.650> a<00:03:15.769> reverse<00:03:16.159> icicle<00:03:17.150> that<00:03:17.739> tends<00:03:18.739> to<00:03:19.150> sit

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
of a reverse icicle that tends to sit

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.140 
of a reverse icicle that tends to sit
there<00:03:20.329> and<00:03:20.480> freeze<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:21.079> and<00:03:21.440> and<00:03:21.980> just<00:03:22.970> make<00:03:23.120> a

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
there and freeze and and and just make a

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.020 
there and freeze and and and just make a
big<00:03:23.389> mess<00:03:23.599> so<00:03:24.500> it<00:03:25.220> does<00:03:25.489> have<00:03:25.699> some<00:03:25.879> drawbacks

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
big mess so it does have some drawbacks

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.170 
big mess so it does have some drawbacks
in<00:03:26.660> terms<00:03:26.930> of<00:03:27.230> water<00:03:28.099> you<00:03:28.609> can<00:03:28.760> see<00:03:28.970> on<00:03:29.090> the

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
in terms of water you can see on the

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.619 
in terms of water you can see on the
ground<00:03:29.299> it's<00:03:29.599> always<00:03:29.989> wet<00:03:30.260> near<00:03:30.590> this<00:03:30.739> unit

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:31.629 
ground it's always wet near this unit

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.729 
ground it's always wet near this unit
possibly<00:03:32.629> if<00:03:32.810> we<00:03:33.049> were<00:03:33.109> going<00:03:33.230> to<00:03:33.290> do<00:03:33.410> it<00:03:33.500> again

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
possibly if we were going to do it again

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.129 
possibly if we were going to do it again
we<00:03:33.919> could<00:03:34.160> put<00:03:34.459> a<00:03:34.669> some<00:03:34.970> sort<00:03:35.150> of<00:03:35.209> drain<00:03:35.510> but

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
we could put a some sort of drain but
