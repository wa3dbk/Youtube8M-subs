guess<00:04:10.970> I<00:04:11.120> felt<00:04:11.150> relieved<00:04:11.690> that<00:04:11.900> it<00:04:12.050> was<00:04:12.080> all

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
guess I felt relieved that it was all

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.800 
guess I felt relieved that it was all
finished<00:04:12.850> it<00:04:13.850> was<00:04:13.970> a<00:04:14.030> mixture<00:04:14.420> of<00:04:14.510> all<00:04:14.780> sorts

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
finished it was a mixture of all sorts

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.080 
finished it was a mixture of all sorts
of<00:04:15.260> feelings<00:04:15.530> although<00:04:16.460> I<00:04:16.489> kept<00:04:16.790> telling

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
of feelings although I kept telling

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.030 
of feelings although I kept telling
myself<00:04:17.239> that<00:04:17.720> it<00:04:17.810> would<00:04:17.870> be<00:04:18.020> okay<00:04:18.440> not<00:04:18.710> to<00:04:18.860> pull

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
myself that it would be okay not to pull

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.340 
myself that it would be okay not to pull
a<00:04:19.070> great<00:04:19.400> performance<00:04:20.030> in<00:04:20.270> the<00:04:20.780> small<00:04:21.050> corner

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
a great performance in the small corner

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.770 
a great performance in the small corner
of<00:04:21.470> my<00:04:21.680> mind<00:04:21.890> I<00:04:22.220> still<00:04:22.340> wanted<00:04:22.970> to<00:04:23.000> do<00:04:23.210> well<00:04:23.450> and

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
of my mind I still wanted to do well and

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.890 
of my mind I still wanted to do well and
the<00:04:24.320> fear<00:04:24.590> of<00:04:24.620> not<00:04:24.800> doing<00:04:25.280> well<00:04:25.430> crept<00:04:25.790> up<00:04:26.000> but

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
the fear of not doing well crept up but

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.450 
the fear of not doing well crept up but
after<00:04:27.200> being<00:04:27.410> satisfied<00:04:27.710> with<00:04:28.040> my

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
after being satisfied with my

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.380 
after being satisfied with my
performance<00:04:28.640> I<00:04:29.180> felt<00:04:29.510> happy<00:04:29.960> and<00:04:30.170> relieved

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
performance I felt happy and relieved

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.790 
performance I felt happy and relieved
it's<00:04:32.390> not<00:04:32.480> only<00:04:32.660> the<00:04:32.870> gold<00:04:33.050> medal<00:04:33.350> you<00:04:33.380> also

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
it's not only the gold medal you also

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.460 
it's not only the gold medal you also
got<00:04:33.950> a<00:04:33.980> world-record<00:04:34.910> score<00:04:35.420> when<00:04:36.350> you'd

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
got a world-record score when you'd

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.290 
got a world-record score when you'd

telethon<00:04:41.300> young<00:04:41.750> Gaither<00:04:42.940> because<00:04:43.940> I<00:04:44.120> did<00:04:44.300> a

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
telethon young Gaither because I did a

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:46.900 
telethon young Gaither because I did a
better<00:04:44.570> performance<00:04:45.170> than<00:04:45.230> usual<00:04:45.770> I<00:04:46.010> expected

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
better performance than usual I expected

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:48.790 
better performance than usual I expected
to<00:04:47.030> get<00:04:47.150> a<00:04:47.210> better<00:04:47.390> result<00:04:47.810> but<00:04:48.380> I<00:04:48.410> didn't

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 
to get a better result but I didn't

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.280 
to get a better result but I didn't
expect<00:04:49.040> to<00:04:49.250> do<00:04:49.460> that<00:04:49.490> well<00:04:49.940> so<00:04:50.810> when<00:04:50.930> I<00:04:50.960> saw<00:04:51.230> the

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
expect to do that well so when I saw the

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.530 
expect to do that well so when I saw the
score<00:04:51.710> I<00:04:51.980> was<00:04:52.280> at<00:04:52.370> a<00:04:52.400> loss<00:04:52.640> for<00:04:52.700> words<00:04:53.090> for<00:04:53.510> a

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
score I was at a loss for words for a

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.020 
score I was at a loss for words for a
second<00:04:53.990> thinking<00:04:54.830> I<00:04:54.890> had<00:04:55.040> gotten<00:04:55.250> it<00:04:55.460> wrong<00:04:55.670> I

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
second thinking I had gotten it wrong I

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.360 
second thinking I had gotten it wrong I
was<00:04:56.690> quite<00:04:56.960> shocked<00:04:57.320> and<00:04:57.560> happy<00:04:57.950> at<00:04:58.070> the<00:04:58.190> same

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
was quite shocked and happy at the same

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.970 
was quite shocked and happy at the same
time<00:04:58.670> at<00:04:59.300> that<00:04:59.780> moment<00:04:59.840> I<00:05:00.380> thought<00:05:00.680> I<00:05:00.740> would

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
time at that moment I thought I would

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.160 
time at that moment I thought I would
win<00:05:01.160> a<00:05:01.190> gold<00:05:01.460> medal<00:05:01.520> rather<00:05:02.480> than<00:05:02.690> setting<00:05:03.080> a

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
win a gold medal rather than setting a

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.730 
win a gold medal rather than setting a
new<00:05:03.320> world<00:05:03.350> record<00:05:04.450> so<00:05:05.450> after<00:05:05.690> the<00:05:05.810> Olympics

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740

dear I thought I would do well during

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:26.700 
dear I thought I would do well during
the<00:05:24.999> actual<00:05:25.300> performance<00:05:25.620> because<00:05:26.620> I

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
the actual performance because I

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.260 
the actual performance because I
performed<00:05:27.249> really<00:05:27.490> well<00:05:27.610> during<00:05:28.120> the

performed really well during the
practice<00:05:28.650> so<00:05:29.650> there<00:05:29.830> was<00:05:30.009> a<00:05:30.039> bit<00:05:30.279> of

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
practice so there was a bit of

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.829 
practice so there was a bit of
disappointment<00:05:30.759> that<00:05:31.059> I<00:05:31.210> didn't<00:05:31.629> show<00:05:31.809> my

00:05:31.829 --> 00:05:31.839 
disappointment that I didn't show my

00:05:31.839 --> 00:05:34.589 
disappointment that I didn't show my
best<00:05:32.259> during<00:05:32.589> the<00:05:32.889> performance<00:05:33.569> because<00:05:34.569> I

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:34.599 
best during the performance because I

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:36.420 
best during the performance because I
skipped<00:05:34.960> every<00:05:35.289> competition<00:05:35.889> except<00:05:36.370> the

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
skipped every competition except the

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.519 
skipped every competition except the
World<00:05:36.610> Championship<00:05:37.240> I<00:05:37.479> regarded<00:05:38.409> this

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:38.529 
World Championship I regarded this

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:40.619 
World Championship I regarded this
Moscow<00:05:38.979> competition<00:05:39.610> as<00:05:39.819> a<00:05:39.879> presence<00:05:40.419> of<00:05:40.539> the

00:05:40.619 --> 00:05:40.629 
Moscow competition as a presence of the

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:42.959 
Moscow competition as a presence of the
fans<00:05:40.900> so<00:05:41.770> on<00:05:41.919> that<00:05:42.159> I<00:05:42.400> didn't<00:05:42.849> feel

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:45.540

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
disappointed the only disappointment was

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:46.980 
disappointed the only disappointment was
that<00:05:45.699> the<00:05:45.819> fans<00:05:46.060> didn't<00:05:46.479> get<00:05:46.629> to<00:05:46.779> see

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 
that the fans didn't get to see

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.379 
that the fans didn't get to see
everything<00:05:47.529> I<00:05:47.620> had<00:05:47.889> but<00:05:48.759> I<00:05:48.819> felt<00:05:49.120> really

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
everything I had but I felt really
