00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
and you just kind of jump over a couple

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.830 
and you just kind of jump over a couple
other<00:02:08.250> rhythms<00:02:08.429> like<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.209> cool<00:02:09.390> thing<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.660> is

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
none of these rhythms are really hard to

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.650 
none of these rhythms are really hard to
hit<00:02:11.520> or<00:02:11.670> anything<00:02:12.000> but<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.270> can<00:02:12.390> get<00:02:12.450> some

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
don't even know how I did that I was

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.600 
don't even know how I did that I was
like<00:02:30.500> ninety-nine<00:02:31.500> percent<00:02:31.710> luck<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.430> know

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610

like ninety-nine percent luck you know
I'm<00:02:32.760> saying<00:02:33.030> though<00:02:33.330> but<00:02:34.260> there's<00:02:34.590> two

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
I'm saying though but there's two

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.590 
I'm saying though but there's two
booters<00:02:35.490> right<00:02:35.730> here<00:02:36.000> i<00:02:36.030> would<00:02:36.210> definitely

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
booters right here i would definitely

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.640 
booters right here i would definitely
you<00:02:37.260> can<00:02:37.470> hit<00:02:37.710> them<00:02:37.830> but<00:02:39.020> it's<00:02:40.020> pretty<00:02:40.290> risky

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
you can hit them but it's pretty risky

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.770 
you can hit them but it's pretty risky
especially<00:02:41.130> that<00:02:41.550> first<00:02:41.580> one<00:02:42.150> because<00:02:42.360> it's

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
especially that first one because it's

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.470 
especially that first one because it's
like<00:02:43.020> it<00:02:43.440> launches<00:02:44.040> you<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:44.550> high<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:45.270> lot

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
like it launches you so high that a lot

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.610 
like it launches you so high that a lot
of<00:02:45.570> times<00:02:45.750> you're<00:02:45.900> sending<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.230> end<00:02:46.470> up

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
of times you're sending to end up

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.110 
of times you're sending to end up
bottoming<00:02:47.100> out<00:02:47.220> or<00:02:47.460> you<00:02:47.550> can't<00:02:47.760> ever<00:02:47.850> tell

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
bottoming out or you can't ever tell

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.610 
bottoming out or you can't ever tell
where<00:02:48.330> you're<00:02:48.420> going<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.600> land<00:02:48.870> it's<00:02:49.110> it's

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
where you're going to land it's it's

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.350 
where you're going to land it's it's
kind<00:02:49.830> of<00:02:49.860> weird<00:02:50.130> but<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.490> second<00:02:50.940> booter<00:02:51.210> you

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
kind of weird but that second booter you

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.910 
kind of weird but that second booter you
can<00:02:51.510> kind<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.750> hit<00:02:51.960> it<00:02:51.990> and<00:02:52.200> land<00:02:52.440> either<00:02:52.710> on

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
can kind of hit it and land either on

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.830 
can kind of hit it and land either on
the<00:02:53.010> first<00:02:53.280> one<00:02:53.460> of<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.700> second<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.510> second

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
the first one of the second the second

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.350 
the first one of the second the second
landing<00:02:55.230> you<00:02:55.350> know<00:02:55.500> so<00:02:55.820> then<00:02:56.820> this<00:02:56.940> jump<00:02:57.240> right

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
landing you know so then this jump right

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.550 
landing you know so then this jump right
here<00:02:57.540> is<00:02:57.600> pretty<00:02:57.750> cool<00:02:57.990> you<00:02:58.140> kind<00:02:58.350> of<00:02:58.380> gotta

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
here is pretty cool you kind of gotta

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.040 
here is pretty cool you kind of gotta
scrub<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.160> not<00:02:59.490> not<00:03:00.150> actually<00:03:00.600> hit<00:03:00.780> the

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
scrub it and not not actually hit the

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.730 
scrub it and not not actually hit the
the<00:03:01.680> second<00:03:02.130> jump<00:03:02.370> part<00:03:02.640> right<00:03:02.850> there<00:03:02.880> so<00:03:03.740> this

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
the second jump part right there so this

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.140 
the second jump part right there so this
corner<00:03:05.010> right<00:03:05.100> here's<00:03:05.340> got<00:03:05.520> pretty<00:03:05.730> good<00:03:05.790> ruts

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
the rest of the track doesn't really

have<00:03:07.680> all<00:03:07.890> that<00:03:07.920> many<00:03:08.190> ruts<00:03:08.580> it's<00:03:08.850> more<00:03:09.120> just

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
have all that many ruts it's more just

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.680 
have all that many ruts it's more just
it's<00:03:10.500> more<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.250> flatter<00:03:11.640> kind<00:03:12.090> of<00:03:12.180> track<00:03:12.450> but

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
it's more of a flatter kind of track but

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.760 
it's more of a flatter kind of track but
it<00:03:12.780> does<00:03:12.900> have<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.110> little<00:03:13.290> bit<00:03:13.440> of<00:03:13.530> roughness

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
it does have a little bit of roughness

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.130 
it does have a little bit of roughness
here<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.310> there<00:03:14.430> so<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:15.510> balances<00:03:15.690> out<00:03:16.080> your

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
here and there so it balances out your

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.720 
here and there so it balances out your
speed<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.620> everything<00:03:17.130> it's<00:03:17.310> definitely

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
speed and everything it's definitely

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.980 
speed and everything it's definitely
it's<00:03:17.880> just<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.180> track<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:18.480> just<00:03:18.840> came

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:08.230 
jumps it seems impossible but once you

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.720 
jumps it seems impossible but once you
get<00:07:08.410> good<00:07:08.590> at<00:07:08.770> it<00:07:08.800> up<00:07:09.040> I'm<00:07:09.220> telling<00:07:09.580> you<00:07:09.640> it

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:10.930 
feels like you're playing some kind of

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.050 
feels like you're playing some kind of
reflex<00:07:11.440> or<00:07:11.650> one<00:07:12.130> of<00:07:12.160> those<00:07:12.400> games<00:07:12.610> you<00:07:12.880> just

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:13.060 
reflex or one of those games you just

00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:14.910 
reflex or one of those games you just
get<00:07:13.240> so<00:07:13.480> it<00:07:13.630> actually<00:07:13.780> feels<00:07:14.110> better<00:07:14.620> than

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:14.920 
get so it actually feels better than

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.830 
get so it actually feels better than
reflex<00:07:15.490> because<00:07:15.880> you<00:07:16.030> actually<00:07:16.210> get<00:07:16.480> so<00:07:16.720> much

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:16.840 
reflex because you actually get so much

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.140 
reflex because you actually get so much
more<00:07:17.020> control<00:07:17.500> once<00:07:17.770> you<00:07:17.890> get<00:07:18.070> good<00:07:18.700> at<00:07:18.880> it<00:07:18.910> and

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.150 
more control once you get good at it and
