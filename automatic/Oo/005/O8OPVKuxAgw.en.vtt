00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
that has the ball let's start with the

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.779 
that has the ball let's start with the
first<00:01:07.840> example<00:01:08.049> I<00:01:08.649> see<00:01:09.039> that<00:01:09.219> there<00:01:09.429> is<00:01:09.460> an

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:09.789 
first example I see that there is an

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.389 
first example I see that there is an
open<00:01:10.299> space<00:01:10.479> on<00:01:10.929> the<00:01:10.990> wing<00:01:11.350> so<00:01:11.619> I<00:01:11.649> decide<00:01:12.130> to

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
open space on the wing so I decide to

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.910 
open space on the wing so I decide to
use<00:01:12.729> my<00:01:13.210> second<00:01:13.749> man<00:01:13.899> press<00:01:14.229> to<00:01:14.439> block<00:01:14.740> the

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
use my second man press to block the

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.559 
use my second man press to block the
player<00:01:15.189> that<00:01:15.399> has<00:01:15.670> possession<00:01:16.149> of<00:01:16.389> the<00:01:16.450> ball

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:16.569 
player that has possession of the ball

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:19.679 
player that has possession of the ball
thus<00:01:17.499> I<00:01:17.710> am<00:01:17.889> able<00:01:18.189> to<00:01:18.399> control<00:01:18.969> my<00:01:19.149> player<00:01:19.420> and

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
thus I am able to control my player and

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.859 
thus I am able to control my player and
move<00:01:20.469> him<00:01:20.710> a<00:01:20.889> bit<00:01:21.189> towards<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:21.909> wing<00:01:22.119> in<00:01:22.389> order

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
move him a bit towards the wing in order

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.620 
move him a bit towards the wing in order
to<00:01:23.020> close<00:01:23.380> down<00:01:23.649> the<00:01:23.829> angle<00:01:24.280> once<00:01:24.880> my<00:01:25.090> opponent

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
to close down the angle once my opponent

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.629 
to close down the angle once my opponent
goes<00:01:25.929> on<00:01:26.229> the<00:01:26.380> wing<00:01:26.590> I<00:01:26.770> keep<00:01:27.340> switching

00:01:27.629 --> 00:01:27.639 
goes on the wing I keep switching

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:30.359

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
until ultimately he loses possession of

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.889 
until ultimately he loses possession of
the<00:01:35.950> ball<00:01:36.159> in<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.850> second<00:01:37.149> example<00:01:37.299> I<00:01:37.719> am

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:37.899 
the ball in the second example I am

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.139 
the ball in the second example I am
seeing<00:01:38.259> that<00:01:38.469> Ronaldo<00:01:39.100> is<00:01:39.280> open<00:01:39.880> in<00:01:40.119> the

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
seeing that Ronaldo is open in the

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:41.969

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
and use the second man press because I

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.410 
and use the second man press because I
don't<00:01:47.200> want<00:01:47.529> my<00:01:47.679> operand<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.249> have<00:01:48.459> free<00:01:49.119> space

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:06.929 
penalty area the trick here is to use
the<00:02:04.929> player<00:02:05.200> that<00:02:05.499> you<00:02:05.799> control<00:02:06.310> to<00:02:06.520> close

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
the player that you control to close

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.840 
the player that you control to close
down<00:02:07.179> gaps<00:02:07.539> in<00:02:07.810> your<00:02:07.959> defense<00:02:08.380> or<00:02:08.530> to<00:02:09.190> try<00:02:09.550> and

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
down gaps in your defense or to try and

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.810 
down gaps in your defense or to try and
intercept<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.930> ball<00:02:11.110> in<00:02:11.710> the<00:02:11.950> same<00:02:12.160> time<00:02:12.430> use

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
intercept the ball in the same time use

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.100 
intercept the ball in the same time use
the<00:02:13.090> second<00:02:13.600> man

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
the second man

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.650 
the second man
so<00:02:14.470> your<00:02:14.650> opponent<00:02:14.950> doesn't<00:02:15.400> have<00:02:15.970> room<00:02:16.390> to

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
so your opponent doesn't have room to

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.860 
so your opponent doesn't have room to
advance<00:02:17.200> or<00:02:17.530> to<00:02:18.160> shoot<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.610> ball<00:02:18.870> overall

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
advance or to shoot the ball overall

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.080 
advance or to shoot the ball overall
