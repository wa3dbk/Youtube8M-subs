hey<00:00:01.260> guys<00:00:01.470> I'm<00:00:01.860> a<00:00:02.010> fish<00:00:02.219> guy<00:00:02.250> here<00:00:02.610> doing<00:00:02.940> a

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
hey guys I'm a fish guy here doing a

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.679 
hey guys I'm a fish guy here doing a
video<00:00:03.240> on<00:00:03.389> how<00:00:03.510> you<00:00:03.570> clean<00:00:04.049> a<00:00:04.080> whisper<00:00:04.709> filter

00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:05.689 
video on how you clean a whisper filter

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:08.270 
video on how you clean a whisper filter
these<00:00:06.689> are<00:00:06.899> pretty<00:00:07.139> much<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.649> most<00:00:07.859> common

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
these are pretty much the most common

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.740 
these are pretty much the most common
filter<00:00:08.669> you're<00:00:08.790> going<00:00:08.849> to<00:00:08.969> see<00:00:09.240> they<00:00:09.509> kind<00:00:09.719> of

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
filter you're going to see they kind of

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.310 
filter you're going to see they kind of
most<00:00:09.959> your<00:00:10.139> kits<00:00:10.790> they<00:00:11.790> summon<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.839> big<00:00:13.080> major

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
most your kits they summon the big major

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.529 
most your kits they summon the big major
chains<00:00:13.769> they're<00:00:14.309> one<00:00:14.610> of<00:00:14.669> the<00:00:14.759> oldest<00:00:15.179> filters

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:15.539 
chains they're one of the oldest filters

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:17.660 
chains they're one of the oldest filters
you<00:00:15.719> can<00:00:15.749> probably<00:00:16.020> find<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.769> one<00:00:17.519> of<00:00:17.609> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
you can probably find and one of the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.849 
you can probably find and one of the
most<00:00:17.849> reliable<00:00:18.439> the<00:00:19.439> only<00:00:19.619> thing<00:00:19.740> I<00:00:19.800> don't

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
most reliable the only thing I don't

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.919 
most reliable the only thing I don't
like<00:00:20.160> about<00:00:20.310> these<00:00:20.699> filters<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.539> now<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:21.929 
like about these filters is now the

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:24.320 
like about these filters is now the
clear<00:00:22.560> intake<00:00:23.070> because<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.609> collects<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.150> bunch

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
clear intake because it collects a bunch

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.749 
clear intake because it collects a bunch
of<00:00:24.390> algae<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.769> can<00:00:25.920> see<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.250> where<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.609> it

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:26.759 
of algae and you can see it where is it

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.160 
of algae and you can see it where is it
used<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.000> be<00:00:27.060> black<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.779> couldn't<00:00:28.050> see

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
used to be black and you couldn't see

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.689 
used to be black and you couldn't see
anything<00:00:28.259> going<00:00:28.800> in<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.070> out<00:00:29.220> it<00:00:29.400> or<00:00:29.519> anything

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
anything going in it out it or anything

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.740 
anything going in it out it or anything
like<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.919> but<00:00:31.919> there's<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.520> couple<00:00:33.450> major

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
like that but there's a couple major

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.990 
like that but there's a couple major
components<00:00:34.410> of<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:35.430> filter

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
components of the filter

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.440 
components of the filter
you've<00:00:36.960> got<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.500> black<00:00:37.980> sponge<00:00:38.580> right<00:00:39.150> here

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
you've got the black sponge right here

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.800 
you've got the black sponge right here
and<00:00:39.950> it<00:00:40.950> really<00:00:41.220> does<00:00:41.490> nothing<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:42.180> filter<00:00:42.660> it

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:42.810 
and it really does nothing to filter it

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.890 
and it really does nothing to filter it
some<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.710> them<00:00:43.860> are<00:00:43.950> like<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> carbon<00:00:44.880> that<00:00:45.720> will

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
some of them are like a carbon that will

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.780 
some of them are like a carbon that will
help<00:00:45.990> get<00:00:46.680> some<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.040> impurities<00:00:47.610> out<00:00:47.730> of

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
help get some of the impurities out of

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.760 
help get some of the impurities out of
the<00:00:47.880> water<00:00:48.120> but<00:00:48.780> mostly<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.620> for

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
the water but mostly this is for

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.340 
the water but mostly this is for
beneficial<00:00:50.340> bacteria<00:00:50.480> so<00:00:51.480> if<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:51.690> don't<00:00:52.050> have

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
beneficial bacteria so if you don't have

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.950 
beneficial bacteria so if you don't have
this<00:00:52.680> in<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.370> actual<00:00:53.700> filter<00:00:54.000> it's<00:00:54.600> really

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
this in the actual filter it's really

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.280 
this in the actual filter it's really
not<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.290> to<00:00:55.380> make<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.560> big<00:00:55.830> difference<00:00:57.290> but

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
not going to make a big difference but

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.600 
not going to make a big difference but
it's<00:00:58.470> just<00:00:58.620> another<00:00:58.860> surface<00:00:59.370> for<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
it's just another surface for the

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.300 
it's just another surface for the
bacteria<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.180> grow<00:01:00.330> on<00:01:00.560> so<00:01:01.560> if<00:01:01.650> you<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:01.920> have<00:01:02.160> it

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:02.310 
bacteria to grow on so if you do have it

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.770 
bacteria to grow on so if you do have it
I<00:01:02.430> do<00:01:02.490> recommend<00:01:02.940> putting<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.360> in<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:03.660> if<00:01:03.750> you

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
I do recommend putting it in but if you

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.950 
I do recommend putting it in but if you
don't<00:01:04.110> or<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:04.829> you<00:01:04.920> lost<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.460> or<00:01:06.149> damaged<00:01:06.750> it

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
don't or if you lost it or damaged it

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.899 
don't or if you lost it or damaged it
anything<00:01:07.439> like<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.649> I<00:01:08.159> really<00:01:08.729> wouldn't

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
anything like that I really wouldn't

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.990 
anything like that I really wouldn't
worry<00:01:09.030> about<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:10.439> nice<00:01:10.619> if<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.100> do<00:01:11.340> have

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
worry about it it's nice if you do have

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.090 
worry about it it's nice if you do have
that<00:01:12.240> taken<00:01:12.539> out<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.109> can<00:01:13.140> actually<00:01:13.409> put<00:01:13.829> two

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
that taken out you can actually put two

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.660 
that taken out you can actually put two
filter<00:01:14.490> cartridges<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.469> the<00:01:16.469> actual<00:01:16.799> filter

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
filter cartridges in the actual filter

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.029 
filter cartridges in the actual filter
itself<00:01:18.170> one<00:01:19.170> might<00:01:19.350> need<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.619> be<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> little<00:01:19.859> bit

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
itself one might need to be a little bit

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:21.830 
itself one might need to be a little bit
smaller<00:01:20.340> like<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.670> 10<00:01:20.850> gallon<00:01:21.030> size<00:01:21.390> but<00:01:21.749> it

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
smaller like the 10 gallon size but it

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.149 
smaller like the 10 gallon size but it
can<00:01:21.960> float<00:01:22.229> around<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.590> there<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> little<00:01:22.979> bit

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
can float around in there a little bit

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.249 
can float around in there a little bit
and<00:01:23.399> all<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.270> carbon<00:01:24.600> helps<00:01:24.960> take

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
and all that carbon helps take

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.069 
and all that carbon helps take
everything<00:01:25.649> out<00:01:25.740> too<00:01:26.420> but<00:01:27.420> instead<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.869> buying

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
everything out too but instead of buying

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.649 
everything out too but instead of buying
new<00:01:28.310> filter<00:01:29.310> bags<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:29.850> media<00:01:30.090> every<00:01:30.420> time

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
new filter bags and media every time

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.749 
new filter bags and media every time
what<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.649> can<00:01:31.679> do<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.039> this<00:01:32.130> rinse<00:01:32.399> these<00:01:32.579> out

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
what you can do is this rinse these out

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.179 
what you can do is this rinse these out
real<00:01:33.030> well<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.479> then<00:01:33.590> unclip<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.710> top<00:01:34.920> right

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
real well and then unclip the top right

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.870 
real well and then unclip the top right
here<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.759> change<00:01:36.600> out<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.869> carbon<00:01:37.429> you<00:01:38.429> can

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
here and change out the carbon you can

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.739 
here and change out the carbon you can
buy<00:01:39.030> carbon<00:01:39.359> in<00:01:39.780> many<00:01:40.649> bulk<00:01:40.950> sizes<00:01:41.450> but<00:01:42.450> bigger

00:01:42.739 --> 00:01:42.749 
buy carbon in many bulk sizes but bigger

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:44.389 
buy carbon in many bulk sizes but bigger
the<00:01:42.960> better<00:01:43.170> you're<00:01:43.469> always<00:01:43.649> going<00:01:43.889> to<00:01:43.920> use<00:01:44.159> it

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
the better you're always going to use it

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.789 
the better you're always going to use it
it<00:01:44.490> never<00:01:44.639> really<00:01:44.999> goes<00:01:45.179> bad<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:46.530> great

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
it never really goes bad and it's great

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.999 
it never really goes bad and it's great
change<00:01:47.219> every<00:01:47.520> month<00:01:48.469> because<00:01:49.469> a<00:01:49.619> pretty<00:01:49.859> much

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
change every month because a pretty much

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.919 
change every month because a pretty much
starts<00:01:50.249> dying<00:01:50.520> off<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:51.389> becoming<00:01:51.719> less

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
starts dying off and it's becoming less

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:53.870 
starts dying off and it's becoming less
effective<00:01:52.380> at<00:01:52.499> that<00:01:52.530> point<00:01:52.889> but<00:01:53.579> these<00:01:53.729> are

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
effective at that point but these are

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.099 
effective at that point but these are
really<00:01:53.999> easy<00:01:54.240> if<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.479> want<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.749> see<00:01:54.869> white

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:55.109 
really easy if you want to see white

00:01:55.109 --> 00:02:26.180 
really easy if you want to see white
again

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.340 

okay<00:02:27.190> it's<00:02:27.340> not<00:02:27.430> perfectly<00:02:27.910> white<00:02:28.180> but<00:02:29.110> it

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
okay it's not perfectly white but it

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.380 
okay it's not perfectly white but it
does<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.710> purpose<00:02:30.130> it's<00:02:30.340> clean<00:02:30.700> there's

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
does the purpose it's clean there's

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
does the purpose it's clean there's
nothing<00:02:31.750> in<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:33.160> carbons<00:02:33.610> changed<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:35.260> we

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
nothing in it the carbons changed so we

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.840 
nothing in it the carbons changed so we
don't<00:02:35.620> worry<00:02:35.830> about<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.610> like<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:36.730> said

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
don't worry about that and like I said

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.010 
don't worry about that and like I said
just<00:02:37.330> pop<00:02:37.570> the<00:02:37.750> top<00:02:37.990> off<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:39.810> this<00:02:40.810> should

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
just pop the top off and this should

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.880 
just pop the top off and this should
open<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.680> you<00:02:42.010> can<00:02:42.160> dump<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.580> new<00:02:42.700> carbon<00:02:43.090> in

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
open and you can dump the new carbon in

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.370 
open and you can dump the new carbon in
make<00:02:44.890> sure<00:02:45.040> to<00:02:45.130> shake<00:02:45.370> it<00:02:45.550> up<00:02:45.670> so<00:02:45.940> it<00:02:46.030> gets<00:02:46.380> nice

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
make sure to shake it up so it gets nice

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.650 
make sure to shake it up so it gets nice
and<00:02:47.440> around<00:02:47.920> everything<00:02:48.430> that<00:02:49.240> way<00:02:49.360> it's<00:02:49.510> more

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
and around everything that way it's more

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.440 
and around everything that way it's more
spread<00:02:50.110> out<00:02:50.370> if<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.520> don't<00:02:51.820> it<00:02:52.000> actually<00:02:52.330> will

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
spread out if you don't it actually will

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.750 
spread out if you don't it actually will
just<00:02:52.480> sit<00:02:52.930> on<00:02:53.080> the<00:02:53.260> bottom<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:53.950> pretty<00:02:54.640> much

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
just sit on the bottom and pretty much

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.610 
just sit on the bottom and pretty much
do<00:02:54.940> nothing<00:02:54.970> but<00:02:55.660> circulate<00:02:56.230> the<00:02:56.320> bottom

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
do nothing but circulate the bottom

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.150 
do nothing but circulate the bottom
water<00:02:56.830> and<00:02:57.160> cleanse<00:02:57.910> that<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:59.650> after<00:02:59.770> you<00:03:00.010> do

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
water and cleanse that so after you do

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.720 
water and cleanse that so after you do
that<00:03:00.330> you<00:03:01.330> just<00:03:01.360> want<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:02.010> find<00:03:03.010> the<00:03:03.100> propeller

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.590 

and<00:03:06.730> same<00:03:07.120> thing<00:03:07.150> with<00:03:07.390> the<00:03:07.570> last<00:03:07.780> one<00:03:09.600> you

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
and same thing with the last one you

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.910 
and same thing with the last one you
just<00:03:10.780> want<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:10.990> make<00:03:11.140> sure<00:03:11.170> this<00:03:11.440> is<00:03:11.590> clean

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
just want to make sure this is clean

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.260 
just want to make sure this is clean
especially<00:03:12.780> if<00:03:13.780> you<00:03:13.990> have<00:03:14.110> a<00:03:14.140> sand<00:03:14.500> aquarium

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
especially if you have a sand aquarium

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.770 
especially if you have a sand aquarium
even<00:03:16.270> a<00:03:16.330> saltwater<00:03:16.660> aquarium<00:03:18.420> the<00:03:19.420> actual

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
even a saltwater aquarium the actual

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.780 
even a saltwater aquarium the actual
sand<00:03:20.080> tends<00:03:20.350> to<00:03:20.470> get<00:03:20.560> into<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:20.980> propeller<00:03:21.520> and

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
sand tends to get into the propeller and

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.750 
sand tends to get into the propeller and
into<00:03:22.720> the<00:03:22.810> magnetic<00:03:23.170> part<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:23.800> scratches<00:03:24.640> it

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
into the magnetic part and scratches it

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.400 
into the magnetic part and scratches it
up<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.180> that's<00:03:25.390> what<00:03:25.480> causes<00:03:25.690> your<00:03:25.960> clicking

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
up and that's what causes your clicking

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.830 
up and that's what causes your clicking
large<00:03:26.800> like<00:03:27.520> grinding<00:03:28.030> noise<00:03:28.240> or<00:03:28.570> loud

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
large like grinding noise or loud

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.140 
large like grinding noise or loud
grinding<00:03:29.140> noise<00:03:29.760> but<00:03:30.760> this<00:03:30.880> one<00:03:31.030> actually

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
grinding noise but this one actually

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.479 
grinding noise but this one actually
pretty<00:03:31.600> clean<00:03:31.900> surprisingly<00:03:32.470> doesn't<00:03:33.400> go

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
pretty clean surprisingly doesn't go

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.340 
pretty clean surprisingly doesn't go
down<00:03:33.700> far<00:03:34.120> enough<00:03:34.150> into<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.660> aquarium<00:03:35.170> to

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
down far enough into the aquarium to

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:36.840 
down far enough into the aquarium to
actually<00:03:35.620> have<00:03:35.770> a<00:03:35.800> sand<00:03:36.130> problem<00:03:36.550> the<00:03:36.670> fish

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
actually have a sand problem the fish

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.240 
actually have a sand problem the fish
kick<00:03:37.090> it<00:03:37.209> up<00:03:37.620> so<00:03:38.620> you<00:03:38.680> really<00:03:38.920> don't<00:03:39.040> worry

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
kick it up so you really don't worry

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.370 
kick it up so you really don't worry
about<00:03:39.310> that<00:03:39.730> next<00:03:40.600> all<00:03:40.780> you're<00:03:40.959> going<00:03:41.080> to<00:03:41.140> do

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
about that next all you're going to do

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.160 
about that next all you're going to do
is<00:03:42.060> rinse<00:03:43.060> this<00:03:43.300> out<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:46.480> once<00:03:46.900> you<00:03:47.020> rinse

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
is rinse this out and once you rinse

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.990 
is rinse this out and once you rinse
these<00:03:47.440> out<00:03:47.650> they're<00:03:47.920> pretty<00:03:48.220> much<00:03:48.430> brand<00:03:48.790> new

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
these out they're pretty much brand new

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.120 
these out they're pretty much brand new
looking<00:03:49.420> that's<00:03:49.959> what<00:03:50.080> I<00:03:50.200> love<00:03:50.530> about<00:03:50.860> the

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
looking that's what I love about the

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.190 
looking that's what I love about the
whisper<00:03:51.459> filters<00:03:51.850> as<00:03:52.120> besides<00:03:52.690> the<00:03:52.959> white

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
whisper filters as besides the white

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.660 
whisper filters as besides the white
residue<00:03:53.800> that<00:03:53.950> you<00:03:54.040> get<00:03:54.220> on<00:03:54.340> it

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
residue that you get on it

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.240 
residue that you get on it
from<00:03:55.570> the<00:03:55.690> calcium<00:03:55.930> buildup<00:03:56.560> or<00:03:56.800> hard<00:03:56.980> water

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
from the calcium buildup or hard water

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.740 
from the calcium buildup or hard water
you<00:03:57.520> can<00:03:57.670> pretty<00:03:57.820> much<00:03:57.910> take<00:03:58.270> that<00:03:58.510> right<00:03:58.720> off

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
you can pretty much take that right off

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.800 
you can pretty much take that right off
with<00:03:59.260> a<00:03:59.320> white<00:04:00.010> vinegar<00:04:00.239> but<00:04:01.239> this<00:04:01.420> filter

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
with a white vinegar but this filter

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.870 
with a white vinegar but this filter
itself<00:04:02.200> is<00:04:02.470> actually<00:04:02.800> seven<00:04:03.160> years<00:04:03.370> old<00:04:03.610> and

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
itself is actually seven years old and

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.490 
itself is actually seven years old and
it<00:04:04.300> looks<00:04:04.480> like<00:04:04.630> I<00:04:04.720> just<00:04:04.750> took<00:04:05.200> it<00:04:05.350> right<00:04:05.440> out

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
it looks like I just took it right out

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.949 
it looks like I just took it right out
of<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.709> box<00:04:05.920> and<00:04:06.250> I<00:04:06.850> only<00:04:07.000> do<00:04:07.239> this<00:04:07.390> every

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
of the box and I only do this every

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.370 
of the box and I only do this every
couple<00:04:08.350> months<00:04:08.500> and<00:04:09.360> it<00:04:10.360> still<00:04:10.930> looks<00:04:10.959> brand

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
couple months and it still looks brand

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.370 
couple months and it still looks brand
new<00:04:12.270> even<00:04:13.270> the<00:04:13.360> top<00:04:13.570> you<00:04:13.810> just<00:04:13.840> take<00:04:14.200> some

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
new even the top you just take some

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.650 
new even the top you just take some
vinegar<00:04:14.950> and<00:04:15.400> wipe<00:04:15.550> that<00:04:15.580> off<00:04:15.820> and<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.419> hard

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
vinegar and wipe that off and the hard

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.740 
vinegar and wipe that off and the hard
water<00:04:17.230> residue<00:04:17.410> comes<00:04:18.010> right<00:04:18.190> off<00:04:18.220> and

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
water residue comes right off and
