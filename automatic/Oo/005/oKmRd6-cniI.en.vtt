00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
shut this down avoid that stress time I

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.359 
shut this down avoid that stress time I
think<00:01:37.360> that<00:01:37.600> single<00:01:37.990> folks<00:01:38.200> who<00:01:38.860> ever<00:01:39.040> get<00:01:39.220> to

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
think that single folks who ever get to

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.399 
think that single folks who ever get to
that<00:01:39.520> will<00:01:39.700> be<00:01:39.729> a<00:01:39.850> big<00:01:40.060> thing<00:01:40.090> yeah

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.559 

but<00:01:46.009> the<00:01:46.189> refocus<00:01:46.549> really<00:01:47.090> in<00:01:47.210> disease

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 
but the refocus really in disease

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:50.260 
but the refocus really in disease
prevention<00:01:47.990> is<00:01:48.319> the<00:01:48.469> number<00:01:48.770> one<00:01:48.950> goal<00:01:49.909> for<00:01:50.240> us

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
prevention is the number one goal for us

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.819 
prevention is the number one goal for us
about<00:01:50.600> any<00:01:50.810> of<00:01:50.929> the<00:01:51.020> farms<00:01:51.319> that<00:01:51.439> we<00:01:51.590> work<00:01:51.799> for

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
about any of the farms that we work for

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.520 
about any of the farms that we work for
you<00:01:52.399> can't<00:01:52.670> make<00:01:52.909> a<00:01:52.939> pig<00:01:53.329> cleaner<00:01:54.109> than<00:01:54.409> it

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
you can't make a pig cleaner than it

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.429 
you can't make a pig cleaner than it
starts<00:01:55.149> all<00:01:56.149> the<00:01:56.689> only<00:01:56.840> things<00:01:57.140> that<00:01:57.350> can

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
starts all the only things that can

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.690 
starts all the only things that can
happen<00:01:57.679> is<00:01:57.979> it<00:01:58.130> can<00:01:58.579> continue<00:01:59.119> to<00:01:59.240> get<00:02:00.700> more

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
happen is it can continue to get more

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.240 
happen is it can continue to get more
exposure<00:02:02.299> to<00:02:02.719> disease<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:03.350> so<00:02:03.799> we<00:02:03.979> want<00:02:04.159> to

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.630 
most recently the last few years what
we've<00:02:20.660> done<00:02:20.810> is<00:02:21.019> start<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.379> filter<00:02:21.620> air<00:02:21.980> going

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
we've done is start to filter air going

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.270 
we've done is start to filter air going
into<00:02:22.970> these<00:02:23.090> pig<00:02:23.390> farms<00:02:23.810> so<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:24.709> we<00:02:24.829> can<00:02:25.069> keep

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
into these pig farms so that we can keep

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.780 
into these pig farms so that we can keep
that<00:02:25.340> virus<00:02:25.879> from<00:02:26.060> getting<00:02:26.420> into<00:02:26.569> the<00:02:26.750> park

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
that virus from getting into the park

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.009 
that virus from getting into the park
preventing<00:02:28.790> it<00:02:28.910> from<00:02:28.940> getting<00:02:29.420> into<00:02:29.569> the<00:02:29.750> farm

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
preventing it from getting into the farm

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.850 
preventing it from getting into the farm
is<00:02:30.290> possible<00:02:31.930> this<00:02:32.930> is<00:02:33.140> part<00:02:33.410> of<00:02:33.470> our<00:02:33.620> health

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
is possible this is part of our health

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.880 
is possible this is part of our health
