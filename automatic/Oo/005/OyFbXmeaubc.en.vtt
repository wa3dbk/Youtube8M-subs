pirates ahoy dinette today I'm going to

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.829 
pirates ahoy dinette today I'm going to
cover<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.460> updates<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:15.030> their<00:00:15.150> ship<00:00:15.360> entity

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
cover the updates of their ship entity

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.029 
cover the updates of their ship entity
that's<00:00:16.020> been<00:00:16.260> happening<00:00:16.590> over<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.010> last

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
that's been happening over the last

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.490 
that's been happening over the last
couple<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.460> days<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:18.109> one<00:00:19.109> of<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.260> first

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
couple of days and one of the first

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.769 
couple of days and one of the first
things<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:19.859> we<00:00:20.699> want<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.150> test<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.570> find

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
things that we want to test is to find

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.410 
things that we want to test is to find
out<00:00:21.930> whether<00:00:22.140> or<00:00:22.380> not<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:23.279> mass<00:00:23.699> inside<00:00:24.240> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
out whether or not the mass inside the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.990 
out whether or not the mass inside the
vessel<00:00:24.600> being<00:00:24.960> in<00:00:25.109> one<00:00:25.350> specific<00:00:25.560> spot<00:00:26.070> versus

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
vessel being in one specific spot versus

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.599 
vessel being in one specific spot versus
being<00:00:27.210> spread<00:00:27.570> over<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.990> entire<00:00:28.109> hull<00:00:28.710> is

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
being spread over the entire hull is

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.630 
being spread over the entire hull is
going<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.269> cause<00:00:30.480> us<00:00:30.689> issues<00:00:31.130> so<00:00:32.130> far<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.520> my

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
going to cause us issues so far in my

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.610 
going to cause us issues so far in my
testing<00:00:33.000> i<00:00:33.059> found<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.480> no<00:00:34.079> matter<00:00:34.230> where<00:00:34.559> you

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
testing i found that no matter where you

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.190 
testing i found that no matter where you
place<00:00:35.040> mass<00:00:35.370> in<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.700> vessel<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.570> really

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
place mass in the vessel it really

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.340 
place mass in the vessel it really
doesn't<00:00:37.500> seem<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.770> matter<00:00:38.120> other<00:00:39.120> than

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
doesn't seem to matter other than

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.990 
doesn't seem to matter other than
changing<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:41.629> the<00:00:42.629> trim<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:44.010> so<00:00:44.250> it

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
changing the the trim and that so it

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.240 
changing the the trim and that so it
didn't<00:00:45.300> seem<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.480> make<00:00:45.570> an<00:00:45.719> effect<00:00:46.140> as<00:00:46.860> far<00:00:47.129> as

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
didn't seem to make an effect as far as

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.279 
didn't seem to make an effect as far as
like<00:00:47.399> waves<00:00:47.670> in<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.030> but<00:00:48.750> one<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.140> things

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
like waves in that but one of the things

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.360 
like waves in that but one of the things
I've<00:00:49.379> done<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.680> I've<00:00:49.739> made<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> couple<00:00:50.280> of

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
I've done it I've made a couple of

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.189 
I've done it I've made a couple of
changes<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.789> mass<00:00:50.969> objects<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.989> now<00:00:52.110> it

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
changes to the mass objects so now it

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.160 
changes to the mass objects so now it
allows<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.910> place<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.270> group<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:54.930> mass

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
allows you to place a group of mass

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.010 
allows you to place a group of mass
objects<00:00:55.739> which<00:00:56.579> then<00:00:56.879> divide<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.690> weight

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
objects which then divide the weight

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.160 
objects which then divide the weight
that<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.890> originally<00:00:59.100> had<00:00:59.399> in<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.120> vessel<00:01:00.300> so

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
that you originally had in the vessel so

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.889 
that you originally had in the vessel so
this<00:01:01.710> allows<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.280> to<00:01:02.520> then<00:01:02.730> spread<00:01:03.329> out<00:01:03.570> like

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
this allows you to then spread out like

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.359 
this allows you to then spread out like
this<00:01:04.170> hall<00:01:04.409> here<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.799> three<00:01:05.010> hundred<00:01:05.100> fifty

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
this hall here is three hundred fifty

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.490 
this hall here is three hundred fifty
thousand<00:01:05.850> kilos<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.210> believe<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:07.290> allow<00:01:07.439> you

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
thousand kilos I believe that allow you

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.830 
thousand kilos I believe that allow you
to<00:01:07.619> spread<00:01:07.979> that<00:01:08.060> 300,000<00:01:09.060> over<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.420> distance

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
to spread that 300,000 over a distance

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.560 
to spread that 300,000 over a distance
rather<00:01:10.439> than<00:01:10.650> as<00:01:10.950> one<00:01:11.250> single<00:01:11.549> object<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
rather than as one single object in the

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.880 
rather than as one single object in the
center<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.049> vessel<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:14.299> the<00:01:15.560> hope<00:01:16.560> is

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
center of the vessel and the hope is

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.130 
center of the vessel and the hope is
that<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.549> might<00:01:17.939> make<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.479> vessels<00:01:18.869> move

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
that it might make the vessels move

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.260 
that it might make the vessels move
better<00:01:19.409> in<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.860> water<00:01:20.130> according<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.150> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
better in the water according to the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.490 
better in the water according to the
buoyancy<00:01:21.780> which<00:01:21.990> is<00:01:22.110> going<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.259> be<00:01:22.320> some

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
buoyancy which is going to be some

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.230 
buoyancy which is going to be some
testing<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.830> figure<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.250> out<00:01:23.310> hopefully

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
testing to figure that out hopefully

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.260 
testing to figure that out hopefully
some<00:01:24.630> later<00:01:25.080> updates<00:01:25.790> whether<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.090> have

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
some later updates whether that I have

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.289 
some later updates whether that I have
been<00:01:27.390> working<00:01:27.479> on<00:01:27.780> as<00:01:27.900> well<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.549> the<00:01:29.549> masts<00:01:30.150> and

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
been working on as well is the masts and

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.050 
been working on as well is the masts and
yards<00:01:31.250> originally<00:01:32.250> these<00:01:32.369> masts<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:32.909> yards

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
yards originally these masts and yards

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.030 
yards originally these masts and yards
were<00:01:33.329> all<00:01:33.450> completely<00:01:33.810> static<00:01:34.200> objects<00:01:34.740> you

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
were all completely static objects you

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.520 
were all completely static objects you
assign<00:01:35.430> them<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.880> then<00:01:36.119> they<00:01:36.960> were<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.229> part

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
assign them and then they were just part

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.450 
assign them and then they were just part
of<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:38.299> vessel<00:01:39.299> group<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.930> objects<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:41.250> even

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
of the vessel group of objects so even

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.069 
of the vessel group of objects so even
though<00:01:41.490> they<00:01:41.640> would<00:01:41.820> be<00:01:41.970> independent<00:01:42.659> models

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
though they would be independent models

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.499 
though they would be independent models
they<00:01:43.229> weren't<00:01:43.500> really<00:01:43.740> yeah<00:01:44.579> any<00:01:44.850> do<00:01:45.329> with

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
they weren't really yeah any do with

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.069 
they weren't really yeah any do with
them<00:01:45.680> what<00:01:46.680> you've<00:01:46.890> got<00:01:47.100> now<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:48.060> mast<00:01:48.540> group

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
them what you've got now is a mast group

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.990 
them what you've got now is a mast group
and<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.710> each<00:01:49.890> group<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.610> have<00:01:50.790> up<00:01:50.970> to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
and in each group you can have up to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.950 
and in each group you can have up to
five<00:01:51.299> yards<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.920> group<00:01:53.450> with<00:01:54.450> those<00:01:54.720> five

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
five yards in that group with those five

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.139 
five yards in that group with those five
yards<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.530> can<00:01:55.649> tell<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:56.189> yard<00:01:56.640> offset

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
yards you can tell a yard offset

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.700 
yards you can tell a yard offset
position<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.930> right<00:01:58.140> now<00:01:58.170> we're<00:01:58.560> going<00:01:58.649> to

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
position so right now we're going to

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.889 
position so right now we're going to
change<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.640> yard<00:02:00.030> offset<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.689> floor

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
change the yard offset on this floor

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.010 
change the yard offset on this floor
master<00:02:01.759> so<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.820> allows<00:02:03.000> us<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.360> then<00:02:03.540> shift

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
master so it allows us to then shift

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.880 
master so it allows us to then shift
that<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.439> group<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:05.100> yards<00:02:05.610> around<00:02:06.119> and<00:02:06.890> I'm

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
that a group of yards around and I'm

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.160 
that a group of yards around and I'm
tying<00:02:08.429> this<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.759> an<00:02:09.030> event<00:02:09.420> it's<00:02:09.660> going<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.869> let

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
tying this to an event it's going to let

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.860 
tying this to an event it's going to let
it<00:02:10.700> it'll<00:02:11.700> find<00:02:12.030> out<00:02:12.209> what<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.599> current

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
it it'll find out what the current

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.370 
it it'll find out what the current
position

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
position

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.630 
position
of<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.830> yard<00:02:14.070> is<00:02:14.250> what<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.490> current

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
of the yard is what the current

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.380 
of the yard is what the current
rotational<00:02:15.360> is<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.530> then<00:02:17.040> move<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.240> the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
rotational is and then move it to the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.130 
rotational is and then move it to the
next<00:02:18.600> ordered<00:02:19.110> rotation<00:02:19.770> whether<00:02:20.070> that<00:02:20.250> be

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
next ordered rotation whether that be

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.140 
next ordered rotation whether that be
the<00:02:22.140> yards<00:02:22.590> men<00:02:22.800> are<00:02:23.010> moving<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.400> yards<00:02:23.790> or

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
the yards men are moving the yards or

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.200 
the yards men are moving the yards or
there's<00:02:24.930> damage<00:02:25.200> taken<00:02:25.530> things<00:02:25.890> like<00:02:26.100> that<00:02:26.250> so

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
there's damage taken things like that so

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.790 
there's damage taken things like that so
that<00:02:27.420> allows<00:02:27.750> each<00:02:28.110> one<00:02:28.320> of<00:02:28.350> these<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.710> be

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
that allows each one of these to be

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.500 
that allows each one of these to be
independently<00:02:29.340> settable<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.150> was<00:02:30.360> just

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
independently settable so that was just

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.280 
independently settable so that was just
like<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.290> said<00:02:31.410> it's<00:02:31.890> just<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.940> first<00:02:33.210> mask<00:02:33.570> it

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
like I said it's just the first mask it

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.890 
like I said it's just the first mask it
is<00:02:34.500> settable<00:02:34.860> if<00:02:35.490> we<00:02:36.060> want<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.510> get<00:02:36.660> as

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
is settable if we want to get as

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.450 
is settable if we want to get as
specific<00:02:37.200> as<00:02:37.680> changing<00:02:38.040> each<00:02:38.250> chart

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
specific as changing each chart

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.540 
specific as changing each chart
independently<00:02:39.120> we<00:02:39.510> can<00:02:39.870> later<00:02:40.170> on<00:02:40.470> but<00:02:41.220> as<00:02:41.370> of

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
independently we can later on but as of

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.340 
independently we can later on but as of
right<00:02:41.610> now<00:02:41.790> for<00:02:42.240> the<00:02:42.300> tech<00:02:42.510> demo<00:02:42.840> this<00:02:42.990> is<00:02:43.140> just

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
right now for the tech demo this is just

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.200 
right now for the tech demo this is just
as<00:02:43.650> far<00:02:44.010> as<00:02:44.130> far<00:02:44.370> as<00:02:44.460> I<00:02:44.550> really<00:02:44.820> think<00:02:45.030> we<00:02:45.150> need

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
as far as far as I really think we need

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.750 
as far as far as I really think we need
to<00:02:45.390> go<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.660> hell<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.860> other<00:02:47.100> thing<00:02:47.280> you<00:02:47.310> can<00:02:47.550> do

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
to go to hell the other thing you can do

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.560 
to go to hell the other thing you can do
is<00:02:48.060> on<00:02:48.770> each<00:02:49.770> you<00:02:50.280> are<00:02:50.520> in<00:02:50.670> each<00:02:50.850> mask<00:02:51.150> group

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
is on each you are in each mask group

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.350 
is on each you are in each mask group
you<00:02:52.170> can<00:02:52.350> set<00:02:52.590> up<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.800> spanker<00:02:53.310> or<00:02:53.520> you<00:02:53.910> can<00:02:54.060> set

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
you can set up a spanker or you can set

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.510 
you can set up a spanker or you can set
up<00:02:54.510> something<00:02:54.630> like<00:02:54.810> a<00:02:55.200> like<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.070> lateen

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
up something like a like this lateen

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.900 
up something like a like this lateen
style<00:02:56.820> right<00:02:57.030> here<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.450> it<00:02:58.410> also<00:02:58.710> can<00:02:59.310> be<00:02:59.550> then

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
style right here and it also can be then

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.180 
style right here and it also can be then
offset<00:03:00.210> on<00:03:00.690> its<00:03:00.840> rotations<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:01.620> can<00:03:01.770> tell<00:03:01.980> it

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
offset on its rotations you can tell it

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.730 
offset on its rotations you can tell it
that<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:03.060> want<00:03:03.240> to<00:03:03.330> offset<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:03.960> rotation<00:03:04.530> of

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
that you want to offset the rotation of

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.230 
that you want to offset the rotation of
just<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.850> object<00:03:07.280> so<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:08.310> way<00:03:08.640> each<00:03:08.910> one<00:03:09.150> is

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
just that object so that way each one is

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.880 
just that object so that way each one is
independent<00:03:09.900> so<00:03:10.140> they'll<00:03:10.320> you<00:03:10.470> say<00:03:10.650> we're

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
independent so they'll you say we're

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.470 
independent so they'll you say we're
trying<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.250> make<00:03:11.340> this<00:03:11.460> as<00:03:11.670> dynamic<00:03:12.210> as

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
trying to make this as dynamic as

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.830 
trying to make this as dynamic as
possible<00:03:12.930> for<00:03:13.080> scripting<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.710> work<00:03:13.890> with<00:03:14.130> and

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
possible for scripting to work with and

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.090 
possible for scripting to work with and
of<00:03:15.840> course<00:03:16.080> each<00:03:16.290> one<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.500> these<00:03:16.590> objects

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
of course each one of these objects

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.440 
of course each one of these objects
that's<00:03:17.310> been<00:03:17.460> added<00:03:17.820> is<00:03:18.920> actually<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:20.450> physical

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
that's been added is actually a physical

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.240 
that's been added is actually a physical
eyes<00:03:22.010> object<00:03:23.120> so<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.210> can<00:03:24.450> see<00:03:24.690> here<00:03:25.020> that

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
eyes object so you can see here that

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.350 
eyes object so you can see here that
everything<00:03:26.250> that's<00:03:26.460> that<00:03:26.580> gray<00:03:27.090> outline

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
everything that's that gray outline

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.660 
everything that's that gray outline
means<00:03:27.960> it<00:03:28.080> has<00:03:28.260> a<00:03:28.290> physical<00:03:28.530> proxy<00:03:29.220> to<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.520> so

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
means it has a physical proxy to it so

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.070 
means it has a physical proxy to it so
it<00:03:29.790> can<00:03:29.970> be<00:03:30.180> damaged<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:30.570> it<00:03:30.720> can<00:03:30.810> receive

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
it can be damaged and it can receive

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.190 
it can be damaged and it can receive
damage<00:03:31.350> and<00:03:31.760> so<00:03:32.760> that<00:03:32.910> way<00:03:33.060> when<00:03:33.600> your<00:03:33.780> vessel

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
damage and so that way when your vessel

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.200 
damage and so that way when your vessel
is<00:03:34.290> getting<00:03:34.710> hit<00:03:34.890> by<00:03:34.920> cannonballs<00:03:35.700> that<00:03:36.000> it

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
is getting hit by cannonballs that it

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.510 
is getting hit by cannonballs that it
actually<00:03:36.600> is<00:03:36.990> taking<00:03:37.800> damage<00:03:37.980> everywhere

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
actually is taking damage everywhere

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.220 
actually is taking damage everywhere
it's<00:03:38.850> going<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.060> take<00:03:39.210> just<00:03:39.480> get<00:03:40.110> a<00:03:40.140> hit<00:03:42.230> now

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
it's going to take just get a hit now

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.900 
it's going to take just get a hit now
the<00:03:43.320> last<00:03:43.800> thing<00:03:43.920> that<00:03:44.040> I've<00:03:44.220> been<00:03:44.550> working<00:03:44.700> a

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
the last thing that I've been working a

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.900 
the last thing that I've been working a
little<00:03:44.970> bit<00:03:45.090> Oregon<00:03:45.540> is<00:03:46.310> these<00:03:47.310> little<00:03:47.790> guys

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
little bit Oregon is these little guys

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.620 
little bit Oregon is these little guys
right<00:03:48.120> here<00:03:48.330> and<00:03:49.100> these<00:03:50.100> are<00:03:50.160> the<00:03:50.970> lids<00:03:51.420> for

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
right here and these are the lids for

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.590 
right here and these are the lids for
the<00:03:51.720> gun<00:03:51.870> ports<00:03:52.520> each<00:03:53.520> one<00:03:53.790> of<00:03:53.820> these<00:03:54.000> has<00:03:54.060> to

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
the gun ports each one of these has to

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.199 
the gun ports each one of these has to
be<00:03:54.750> hand<00:03:55.200> done<00:03:55.470> by<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.740> modeler<00:03:56.250> because

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
be hand done by the modeler because

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:59.180

every<00:03:57.750> one<00:03:57.959> of<00:03:58.080> them<00:03:58.170> is<00:03:58.320> slightly<00:03:58.680> different

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
every one of them is slightly different

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.130 
every one of them is slightly different
the<00:03:59.280> curvature<00:03:59.760> is<00:03:59.880> different<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.660> rotation

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140

the curvature is different the rotation
point<00:04:01.320> is<00:04:01.560> different<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:02.550> it<00:04:03.120> kind<00:04:03.270> of

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:03.330 
point is different and it kind of

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.290 
point is different and it kind of
created<00:04:03.720> a<00:04:03.750> dilemma<00:04:04.200> for<00:04:04.350> us<00:04:05.310> on<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.820> coding

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
created a dilemma for us on the coding

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.000 
created a dilemma for us on the coding
side<00:04:06.600> because<00:04:07.140> if<00:04:07.560> everything<00:04:07.920> is

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
side because if everything is

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.860 
side because if everything is
independent<00:04:08.490> that'd<00:04:08.610> be<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.760> real<00:04:09.000> pain<00:04:09.360> is<00:04:09.630> set

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
independent that'd be a real pain is set

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.380 
independent that'd be a real pain is set
up<00:04:10.050> well<00:04:10.860> it<00:04:10.920> turns<00:04:10.950> out<00:04:11.250> they<00:04:11.550> can<00:04:11.730> create<00:04:12.209> the

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
up well it turns out they can create the

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.000 
up well it turns out they can create the
animation<00:04:12.510> on<00:04:12.959> their<00:04:13.200> side<00:04:13.470> and<00:04:13.500> all<00:04:13.709> we<00:04:13.890> have

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
animation on their side and all we have

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.520 
animation on their side and all we have
to<00:04:14.130> do<00:04:14.220> is<00:04:14.250> call<00:04:14.580> it<00:04:14.850> so<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.870> made<00:04:16.140> our<00:04:16.260> job<00:04:16.470> a

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
to do is call it so it made our job a

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.729 
to do is call it so it made our job a
lot<00:04:16.650> easier<00:04:16.980> in

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
lot easier in

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.129 
lot easier in
that<00:04:17.859> all<00:04:18.160> i<00:04:18.190> had<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.489> do<00:04:18.669> is<00:04:18.819> create<00:04:19.150> a<00:04:19.539> gun

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:20.139 
that all i had to do is create a gun

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:22.379 
that all i had to do is create a gun
port<00:04:20.440> open<00:04:20.680> and<00:04:21.009> closed<00:04:21.250> event<00:04:21.549> tied<00:04:22.120> to<00:04:22.270> the

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:22.389 
port open and closed event tied to the

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.140 
port open and closed event tied to the
vessel<00:04:22.750> and<00:04:22.930> then<00:04:23.800> I<00:04:24.130> created<00:04:24.430> a<00:04:24.550> gun<00:04:24.759> ports

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
vessel and then I created a gun ports

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.059 
vessel and then I created a gun ports
group<00:04:25.509> which<00:04:25.840> then<00:04:26.080> it<00:04:26.199> just<00:04:26.500> loops<00:04:26.830> through

00:04:27.059 --> 00:04:27.069 
group which then it just loops through

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:29.070 
group which then it just loops through
every<00:04:27.819> single<00:04:28.060> one<00:04:28.150> of<00:04:28.180> those<00:04:28.300> gun<00:04:28.509> ports<00:04:28.870> and

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
every single one of those gun ports and

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.920 
every single one of those gun ports and
then<00:04:29.560> opens<00:04:30.009> and<00:04:30.160> closes<00:04:30.520> them<00:04:30.759> based<00:04:31.000> on<00:04:31.180> the

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
then opens and closes them based on the

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.749 
then opens and closes them based on the
whether<00:04:32.889> or<00:04:32.949> not<00:04:33.039> they're<00:04:33.160> open<00:04:33.400> or<00:04:33.460> closed<00:04:33.639> at

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
whether or not they're open or closed at

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:36.240 
whether or not they're open or closed at
the<00:04:33.849> time<00:04:33.900> so<00:04:34.900> right<00:04:35.080> now<00:04:35.110> we've<00:04:35.440> got<00:04:35.470> when<00:04:36.160> the

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
the time so right now we've got when the

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.790 
the time so right now we've got when the
vessel<00:04:36.370> loads<00:04:36.789> it<00:04:37.120> loads<00:04:37.449> all<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.229> gun<00:04:38.410> ports

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
vessel loads it loads all the gun ports

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.309 
vessel loads it loads all the gun ports
in<00:04:38.979> the<00:04:39.009> closed<00:04:39.520> position<00:04:39.960> so<00:04:40.960> that<00:04:40.990> way

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:41.319 
in the closed position so that way

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:43.230 
in the closed position so that way
whatever<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:42.160> vessel<00:04:42.550> immediately<00:04:43.000> loves

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
whatever the vessel immediately loves

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.529 
whatever the vessel immediately loves
the<00:04:43.419> gunports<00:04:43.780> start<00:04:44.229> closed<00:04:45.210> this<00:04:46.210> is<00:04:46.360> if

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
the gunports start closed this is if

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:48.120 
the gunports start closed this is if
they<00:04:46.690> haven't<00:04:46.930> they<00:04:47.229> don't<00:04:47.380> have<00:04:47.530> gun<00:04:47.830> ports

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
they haven't they don't have gun ports

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.640 
they haven't they don't have gun ports
and<00:04:48.250> it'll<00:04:48.400> go<00:04:48.669> for<00:04:48.880> a<00:04:48.970> close<00:04:49.409> but<00:04:50.409> when

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
and it'll go for a close but when

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.749 
and it'll go for a close but when
they're<00:04:50.770> in<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:50.919> closed<00:04:51.099> position<00:04:51.130> you<00:04:51.639> can

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 
they're in the closed position you can

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:54.950 
they're in the closed position you can
run<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:52.150> event<00:04:52.240> for<00:04:52.750> the<00:04:52.900> gun<00:04:53.080> port<00:04:53.380> open<00:04:53.590> and

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
run the event for the gun port open and

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.779 
run the event for the gun port open and
what<00:04:55.960> would<00:04:56.139> or<00:04:56.349> you<00:04:56.380> had<00:04:56.590> done<00:04:56.620> is<00:04:57.009> added<00:04:57.430> in<00:04:57.669> a

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
what would or you had done is added in a

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.689 
what would or you had done is added in a
slight<00:04:58.150> difference<00:04:58.630> in<00:04:58.720> the<00:04:59.289> opening<00:05:00.190> speed

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:00.699 
slight difference in the opening speed

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.820 
slight difference in the opening speed
well<00:05:01.449> I've<00:05:01.539> gone<00:05:01.690> a<00:05:01.750> little<00:05:01.900> bit<00:05:02.110> further<00:05:02.409> and

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
well I've gone a little bit further and

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.820 
well I've gone a little bit further and
I've<00:05:02.979> actually<00:05:03.210> added<00:05:04.210> a<00:05:04.449> randomization<00:05:05.020> to

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
I've actually added a randomization to

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.950 
I've actually added a randomization to
the<00:05:06.039> speed<00:05:06.280> of<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:06.430> animation<00:05:06.630> so<00:05:07.630> every<00:05:07.930> time

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:07.960 
the speed of the animation so every time

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.020 
the speed of the animation so every time
you<00:05:08.409> open<00:05:08.440> and<00:05:08.949> close<00:05:08.979> these<00:05:09.400> gun<00:05:09.669> ports

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
you open and close these gun ports

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.550 
you open and close these gun ports
they're<00:05:10.780> going<00:05:10.930> to<00:05:11.020> be<00:05:11.080> a<00:05:11.110> little<00:05:11.440> bit

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
they're going to be a little bit

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.740 
they're going to be a little bit
different<00:05:12.159> every<00:05:12.580> single<00:05:12.940> time<00:05:13.180> so<00:05:13.479> it's<00:05:13.630> not

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
different every single time so it's not

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.240 
different every single time so it's not
going<00:05:13.900> to<00:05:13.990> be<00:05:14.050> the<00:05:14.110> same<00:05:14.259> animation<00:05:14.680> and<00:05:15.009> I<00:05:15.099> can

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
going to be the same animation and I can

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.059 
going to be the same animation and I can
be<00:05:15.340> the<00:05:15.430> same<00:05:15.610> speeds<00:05:16.590> like<00:05:17.590> you<00:05:17.740> see<00:05:17.919> these

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:18.069 
be the same speeds like you see these

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:19.920 
be the same speeds like you see these
here<00:05:18.280> that<00:05:18.550> every<00:05:18.940> time<00:05:19.090> I<00:05:19.210> do<00:05:19.270> this<00:05:19.630> they're

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
here that every time I do this they're

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.770 
here that every time I do this they're
slightly<00:05:20.650> different<00:05:21.599> sometimes<00:05:22.599> they're

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
slightly different sometimes they're

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.459 
slightly different sometimes they're
fast<00:05:23.050> sometimes<00:05:23.380> they're<00:05:23.800> slow<00:05:24.180> but<00:05:25.469> again

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:26.469 
fast sometimes they're slow but again

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:28.140 
fast sometimes they're slow but again
this<00:05:26.560> is<00:05:26.620> to<00:05:26.860> make<00:05:27.039> it<00:05:27.159> so<00:05:27.190> that<00:05:27.340> we've<00:05:27.580> got<00:05:27.789> you

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
this is to make it so that we've got you

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:29.610 
this is to make it so that we've got you
know<00:05:28.270> the<00:05:28.509> ultimate<00:05:28.840> randomization<00:05:29.469> we're

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
know the ultimate randomization we're

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.339 
know the ultimate randomization we're
not<00:05:29.740> looking<00:05:29.949> at<00:05:29.979> the<00:05:30.070> same<00:05:30.310> static

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:31.349 
not looking at the same static

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.770 
not looking at the same static
animations<00:05:32.349> every<00:05:32.530> single<00:05:32.830> time<00:05:33.070> so<00:05:33.969> this<00:05:34.659> is

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
animations every single time so this is

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.390 
animations every single time so this is
what<00:05:34.900> we're<00:05:34.960> up<00:05:35.080> to<00:05:35.199> right<00:05:35.380> now<00:05:35.409> now<00:05:36.039> the<00:05:36.099> ships

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
what we're up to right now now the ships

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.399 
what we're up to right now now the ships
are<00:05:36.490> coming<00:05:36.580> together<00:05:37.020> don't<00:05:38.020> worries<00:05:38.199> only

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:38.409 
are coming together don't worries only
