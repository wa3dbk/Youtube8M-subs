so this was kisser any bad and let's

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.660 
so this was kisser any bad and let's
check<00:02:18.060> out<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:18.450> app<00:02:18.689> circle<00:02:19.170> bar<00:02:19.290> now<00:02:19.670> this

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
check out the app circle bar now this

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.850 
check out the app circle bar now this
does<00:02:20.909> takes<00:02:21.209> time<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:22.620> load<00:02:22.860> up<00:02:24.379> BAM<00:02:25.379> we<00:02:25.769> are

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
does takes time to load up BAM we are

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.729 
does takes time to load up BAM we are
inside<00:02:26.209> so<00:02:27.209> I've<00:02:27.299> just<00:02:27.329> added<00:02:27.599> a<00:02:27.900> few<00:02:28.290> handy

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
inside so I've just added a few handy

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.979 
inside so I've just added a few handy
tools<00:02:28.980> which<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.519> switch<00:02:30.120> over<00:02:30.329> again<00:02:30.810> and

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
tools which I switch over again and

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.850 
tools which I switch over again and
again<00:02:31.290> like<00:02:31.610> this<00:02:32.610> one<00:02:32.909> so<00:02:33.720> this<00:02:33.870> one<00:02:34.019> is<00:02:34.260> best

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
again like this one so this one is best

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.949 
again like this one so this one is best
for<00:02:35.040> multitasking<00:02:35.849> no<00:02:36.180> matter<00:02:36.359> whatever<00:02:36.599> app

for multitasking no matter whatever app

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.539 
for multitasking no matter whatever app
you're<00:02:37.260> inside<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.769> can<00:02:37.920> just<00:02:38.099> pull<00:02:38.370> this

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
you're inside you can just pull this

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.610 
you're inside you can just pull this
crate<00:02:38.879> off<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.359> whatever<00:02:40.170> app<00:02:40.349> you<00:02:40.590> have

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
crate off and whatever app you have

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.699 
crate off and whatever app you have
given<00:02:41.159> a<00:02:41.430> lot<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.060> inside<00:02:42.420> this<00:02:42.659> one<00:02:42.959> you

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
given a lot of it inside this one you

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.770 
given a lot of it inside this one you
can<00:02:43.859> randomly<00:02:44.220> open<00:02:44.579> it<00:02:44.730> whenever<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.209> want

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
can randomly open it whenever you want

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.099 
can randomly open it whenever you want
and<00:02:46.609> even<00:02:47.609> that<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:48.000> fast<00:02:48.450> enough<00:02:48.599> without

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109 
and even that is fast enough without

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:51.920 
and even that is fast enough without
affecting<00:02:49.739> the<00:02:50.459> performance<00:02:50.819> of<00:02:51.389> the<00:02:51.750> user

the recent apps to switch between the

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:00.020 
the recent apps to switch between the
apps<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:58.019> most<00:02:58.230> recent<00:02:58.650> as<00:02:59.190> which<00:02:59.609> you<00:02:59.790> have

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
apps the most recent as which you have

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.910 
apps the most recent as which you have
on<00:03:00.329> your<00:03:00.690> running<00:03:01.079> apps<00:03:01.909> good<00:03:02.909> in<00:03:03.030> that<00:03:03.180> case

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
on your running apps good in that case

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.699 
on your running apps good in that case
now<00:03:04.920> that<00:03:05.489> was<00:03:05.790> about<00:03:06.329> absolutely<00:03:07.109> power<00:03:07.200> and

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
now that was about absolutely power and

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.180 
now that was about absolutely power and
recent<00:03:08.220> apps<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:08.730> what<00:03:08.970> else<00:03:09.150> do<00:03:09.540> we<00:03:09.569> have<00:03:10.190> the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
recent apps so what else do we have the

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.670 
recent apps so what else do we have the
roms<00:03:11.370> pretty<00:03:11.760> smooth<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.150> must<00:03:12.389> say<00:03:12.690> I've<00:03:13.440> been

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
roms pretty smooth I must say I've been

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:20.170 
roms pretty smooth I must say I've been
impressed<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.549> this<00:03:15.829> widgets<00:03:16.829> nothing<00:03:17.579> fancy

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.849 

notification<00:03:21.180> Drive<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:22.079> main<00:03:22.290> part<00:03:22.620> where

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
notification Drive the main part where

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.099 
notification Drive the main part where
you<00:03:22.980> can<00:03:23.190> add<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:24.090> toggles<00:03:24.480> like<00:03:24.780> I've<00:03:24.930> added

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
you can add the toggles like I've added

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.900 
you can add the toggles like I've added
this<00:03:25.379> you<00:03:25.829> also<00:03:25.980> get<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.430> whole<00:03:26.730> lot<00:03:26.879> of

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
this you also get a whole lot of

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.259 
this you also get a whole lot of
troubles<00:03:27.349> but<00:03:28.349> I've<00:03:29.040> decided<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.760> ones<00:03:29.970> which

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
troubles but I've decided the ones which

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.140 
troubles but I've decided the ones which
I<00:03:30.569> use<00:03:31.049> most<00:03:31.440> often

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
I use most often

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.080 
I use most often
I'm<00:03:33.150> just<00:03:33.419> add<00:03:33.569> at<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.840> hotspot<00:03:34.319> and<00:03:35.090> there

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
I'm just add at the hotspot and there

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.379 
I'm just add at the hotspot and there
are<00:03:36.419> many<00:03:36.810> many<00:03:37.079> many<00:03:37.970> if<00:03:38.970> you<00:03:39.000> don't<00:03:39.269> really

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
are many many many if you don't really

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:46.309 
are many many many if you don't really
use<00:03:39.660> them<00:03:40.819> so<00:03:41.819> it<00:03:42.180> depends<00:03:42.660> on<00:03:42.720> you

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.239

the<00:05:01.500> sad<00:05:02.370> part<00:05:02.400> is<00:05:02.820> that<00:05:03.000> we<00:05:03.120> don't<00:05:03.270> really

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
the sad part is that we don't really

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.930 
the sad part is that we don't really
have<00:05:03.599> a<00:05:03.930> screen<00:05:04.440> recorder<00:05:04.919> inside<00:05:05.220> and<00:05:05.490> we

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
have a screen recorder inside and we

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.779 
have a screen recorder inside and we
also<00:05:06.060> don't<00:05:06.330> have<00:05:06.539> the<00:05:07.139> ambient<00:05:07.740> display<00:05:07.979> even

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
also don't have the ambient display even

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.710 
also don't have the ambient display even
though<00:05:08.940> I<00:05:08.970> check<00:05:09.389> the<00:05:09.630> change<00:05:09.900> lock<00:05:10.199> I<00:05:10.610> seem<00:05:11.610> to

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
though I check the change lock I seem to

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.810 
though I check the change lock I seem to
see<00:05:12.720> the<00:05:13.139> ambient<00:05:14.009> display<00:05:14.099> for<00:05:14.430> some<00:05:14.580> side

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
see the ambient display for some side

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.149

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
strong as the battery drain bug has been

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.320

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
updated to the other roms also as this

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.089

is<00:05:44.610> based<00:05:44.880> on<00:05:45.060> the<00:05:45.240> Sun<00:05:45.389> isn't<00:05:45.599> matter<00:05:45.840> of<00:05:46.169> the

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
is based on the Sun isn't matter of the

is based on the Sun isn't matter of the
battery<00:05:47.460> is<00:05:47.580> pretty<00:05:47.789> good<00:05:48.030> without

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
battery is pretty good without

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.249 
battery is pretty good without
sacrificing<00:05:49.349> the<00:05:49.699> performance<00:05:50.699> so<00:05:51.630> we<00:05:52.110> also

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:52.259 
sacrificing the performance so we also

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:54.140 
sacrificing the performance so we also
get<00:05:52.560> to<00:05:52.590> choose<00:05:52.979> our<00:05:53.250> preferred<00:05:53.759> install

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
get to choose our preferred install

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.110 
get to choose our preferred install
location<00:05:54.570> and<00:05:54.779> it's<00:05:55.110> obvious<00:05:55.469> that<00:05:55.500> you

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
location and it's obvious that you

to the SD card nearly everything is

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:02.920 
to the SD card nearly everything is
actually<00:06:01.310> mobile<00:06:01.790> so<00:06:02.419> you<00:06:02.510> don't<00:06:02.690> really<00:06:02.810> have

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
actually mobile so you don't really have

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.290 
actually mobile so you don't really have
to<00:06:03.350> worry<00:06:03.560> about<00:06:03.680> your<00:06:04.250> internal<00:06:05.180> storage
