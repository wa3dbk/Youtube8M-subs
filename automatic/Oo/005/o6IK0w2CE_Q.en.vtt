that you would like to use it and then

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:06.059 
that you would like to use it and then
tighten<00:02:03.819> the<00:02:04.149> thumbscrew<00:02:04.599> which<00:02:05.380> keep<00:02:05.739> it

right to any position you want so I
think<00:02:49.260> this<00:02:49.650> looks<00:02:50.459> slim<00:02:50.760> were<00:02:50.970> like<00:02:51.780> a<00:02:52.880> plane

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
think this looks slim were like a plane

think this looks slim were like a plane
pilot<00:02:55.049> headset<00:02:55.769> but<00:02:56.370> in<00:02:56.549> a<00:02:56.849> more<00:02:57.120> gaming<00:02:57.569> and

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
pilot headset but in a more gaming and

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.559 
pilot headset but in a more gaming and
racer<00:02:58.940> greenish<00:02:59.940> style<00:03:00.780> I<00:03:02.420> think<00:03:03.420> the

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
racer greenish style I think the

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.130 
racer greenish style I think the
aesthetics<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.290> this<00:03:04.769> one<00:03:05.040> is<00:03:05.900> pretty<00:03:06.900> amazing

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
aesthetics of this one is pretty amazing

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.039 
aesthetics of this one is pretty amazing
it's<00:03:07.650> not<00:03:07.829> like<00:03:08.069> the<00:03:08.280> fluorescent<00:03:09.269> green<00:03:09.569> of

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
it's not like the fluorescent green of

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.380 
it's not like the fluorescent green of
the<00:03:10.379> like<00:03:11.069> the<00:03:11.400> Razer<00:03:11.849> Kraken<00:03:13.040> but<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:15.000> design

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
the like the Razer Kraken but the design

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.559 
the like the Razer Kraken but the design
is<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:16.049> think<00:03:16.560> amazing<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:18.060> only<00:03:18.329> thing<00:03:18.540> is

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
is I think amazing the only thing is

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.170 
is I think amazing the only thing is
that<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:19.019> can<00:03:19.049> easily<00:03:19.859> lose<00:03:20.130> that<00:03:20.430> metal<00:03:20.880> part

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
that you can easily lose that metal part

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.000 
that you can easily lose that metal part
and<00:03:21.739> it<00:03:22.739> already<00:03:22.920> happened<00:03:23.489> to<00:03:23.519> me<00:03:23.609> but<00:03:25.010> yeah

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010

will be able to see it so jumping onto

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:37.069 
will be able to see it so jumping onto
the<00:03:33.780> sound<00:03:34.590> test<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:35.310> sound<00:03:36.030> quality<00:03:36.660> on<00:03:36.690> this

headset I'm going to test it against my
beats<00:03:40.109> mixr<00:03:41.660> so<00:03:42.660> what's<00:03:42.900> for<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.079> sound

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
beats mixr so what's for the sound

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.729 
beats mixr so what's for the sound
quality<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.609> research<00:03:44.849> Black<00:03:45.299> Shark<00:03:45.739> they

Shark<00:04:03.630> do<00:04:04.139> beat<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.919> beats<00:04:05.910> mixr<00:04:06.510> because

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
Shark do beat the beats mixr because

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.039 
Shark do beat the beats mixr because
they<00:04:07.049> do<00:04:07.109> have<00:04:07.230> more<00:04:07.889> soft<00:04:08.609> padding<00:04:09.209> all

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
they do have more soft padding all

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.670 
they do have more soft padding all
around<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.829> that<00:04:11.720> helps<00:04:12.720> make<00:04:13.109> the<00:04:13.139> heads<00:04:13.530> and

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
around and that helps make the heads and

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.390 
around and that helps make the heads and
more<00:04:13.950> comfortable<00:04:15.380> it's<00:04:16.380> true<00:04:16.829> that<00:04:17.099> the

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
more comfortable it's true that the

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.629 
more comfortable it's true that the
beats<00:04:17.609> are<00:04:17.849> in<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.150> greatest<00:04:18.660> headphones

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
beats are in the greatest headphones

I think they're both great headphones so
I<00:04:37.919> tested<00:04:38.759> them<00:04:38.969> daisy<00:04:39.659> chaining<00:04:40.110> one<00:04:40.590> with

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
I tested them daisy chaining one with

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.879 
I tested them daisy chaining one with
the<00:04:41.129> other<00:04:41.159> and<00:04:41.960> listening<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.110> same<00:04:43.439> song

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
the other and listening the same song

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:48.770 
the other and listening the same song
about<00:04:44.219> five<00:04:44.939> times<00:04:45.180> each<00:04:45.569> I<00:04:47.330> did<00:04:48.330> the<00:04:48.479> test

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
about five times each I did the test

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.209 
about five times each I did the test
with<00:04:49.319> my<00:04:49.430> iphone<00:04:50.430> 4s<00:04:51.090> it's<00:04:51.419> not<00:04:51.689> a<00:04:51.719> fancy<00:04:52.409> DAC

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:53.219 
with my iphone 4s it's not a fancy DAC

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:55.490 
with my iphone 4s it's not a fancy DAC
headphone<00:04:54.120> amp<00:04:54.449> or<00:04:54.780> something<00:04:55.349> like<00:04:55.439> that

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
headphone amp or something like that

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:00.619 
headphone amp or something like that
it's<00:04:55.919> just<00:04:56.430> a<00:04:56.699> regular<00:04:57.060> own<00:04:57.750> deck<00:04:58.500> at<00:04:59.479> for<00:05:00.479> the

00:05:00.619 --> 00:05:00.629 
it's just a regular own deck at for the

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:03.529 
it's just a regular own deck at for the
microphone<00:05:01.139> test<00:05:01.560> I<00:05:01.879> been<00:05:02.879> using<00:05:03.330> this

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
microphone test I been using this

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.869 
microphone test I been using this
microphone<00:05:03.779> to<00:05:04.169> record<00:05:04.289> all<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:04.879> voiceover

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:05.879 
microphone to record all the voiceover

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:08.300 
microphone to record all the voiceover
on<00:05:06.029> this<00:05:06.060> video<00:05:06.569> so<00:05:07.469> I<00:05:07.500> think<00:05:07.710> it<00:05:07.949> sounds

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
on this video so I think it sounds

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.939 
on this video so I think it sounds
pretty<00:05:08.520> great<00:05:08.759> and<00:05:09.120> it's<00:05:09.750> really<00:05:10.500> comparable

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
pretty great and it's really comparable

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.700 
pretty great and it's really comparable
with<00:05:11.219> the<00:05:11.539> macbook<00:05:12.539> pro<00:05:12.810> integrated

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
with the macbook pro integrated

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.439 
with the macbook pro integrated
microphone<00:05:16.189> so<00:05:17.189> i<00:05:17.219> think<00:05:17.430> that's<00:05:17.699> it<00:05:18.000> for<00:05:18.029> this

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
microphone so i think that's it for this

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:21.019 
microphone so i think that's it for this
video<00:05:18.719> I<00:05:19.199> hope<00:05:19.259> you<00:05:19.830> enjoyed<00:05:20.009> thanks<00:05:20.909> for
