 although you are seeing me at home thanks 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.340
 for being there for giving us that wonderful 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.230
 tuning every day that we 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.120
 We appreciate and make us work every time 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.660
 more to do a program than to you 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.760
 they love very well laura pausini I think 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.889
 that you have grown in relation to the week 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.480
 last because you have gained security 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:24.700
 lost nerves and that's positive 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.700
 that's why I congratulate you videos 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:33.000
 that there is a big resemblance of the bell 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.949
 voice and the details when talking about 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.020
 those details that make the 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:39.060
 Italian medium quarry with an accent 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.409
 weird stuffed that make it look like 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.270
 much to it is also very well 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:45.650
 well worked that however this 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:49.270
 meaning is at the end of today 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:51.530
 and that is something as complicated because 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.910
 we summarize that the tuning is going to be 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.259
 good throughout the song and has 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.180
 there were several places where this has 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:58.220
 been tuning more listen and to 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:02.000
 improve that imitation thank you very much 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:04.160

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.900
 a lot of strength but there I think that you 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.570
 detuning has been for a little bit of 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.340
 doubt in the letter something has happened that you 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.770
 seen and a little deconcentrated you went 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.060
 sure but then he went to the 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.360

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:39.919

 good laura pausini the voice bell 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.840
 It is definitely very close to the 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:01.520
 original so it's still fine by 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.550
 this path 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:06.199
 I believe that when they start to feel the 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.060
 song of yours when they have security 

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:11.180
 of that song when the performer is 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:13.370
 more will feel much more distraction and 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:15.349
 You are going to be distracted, you are going to have a great time 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:18.440
 on stage will be better laura
