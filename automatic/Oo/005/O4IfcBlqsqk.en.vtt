00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello friends of the able welcome to 

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.750
 dvd criticism and today it is about the 100th 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.010
 go filming and yes I know about it 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.809
 there are a few but also a few 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.849
 really good and they have it today 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.110
 should go first new sale but keeps 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.450
 also with the opinion about oneself 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.279
 at least not technically straight 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.010
 behind the mountain and compares itself 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.300
 with hachiko and marley &amp; me yes and if 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.650
 he compares these at all 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.630
 It can be experienced today 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.630
 and that's about red dog 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.180
 red dog is an australian movie 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.949
 the year 2011 and is 88 minutes was 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.690
 There at the cinema charts seems quite 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.309
 the story is told far above 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.690
 a dog's really 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.120
 At least in far 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.070
 share very similar to the 1970's 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.960
 years in Australia from one 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.879
 remote driver is picked up and then with 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.559
 a miner town is taken 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.150
 which founded more or less halt 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.800
 was to dismantle doctors and out 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.839
 miners from all over the world is the 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.129
 good money only as fast as possible 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.050
 want to earn and in this 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.820
 Community appeared in the teaser dog 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.800
 at once as a kind 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.660
 gemig is called he strips 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.520
 through the country and is with each one 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.410
 little friends but with no more 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.270
 as with the others until one day 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.679
 his real boss over the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.960
 Run away played by josh lucas 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:23.910
 Ingested a man named John Grant 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.100
 then a great bond will be created 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.899
 sweet story around this dog the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.280
 Not even so much in the focus 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.470
 but this film is moved over 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.640
 whose help is the story of many 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.710
 single people out of this little one 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.380
 city â€‹â€‹is told and that about this 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.799
 88 minutes and then we have weather 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.140
 Maybe he can film drama that how many times 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.270
 unfortunately other films of his genre am 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.130
 end is not a happy end movie and that is 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.409
 Of course, a great pity and the movie 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.329
 does not start too well with red 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.549
 dog i already thought a cover auweia 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.780
 which is composed of a film and just 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.360
 australia the movie looks the 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.549
 first 30 minutes incredibly tough and 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.020
 is not really fun and me 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.689
 at the point to say okay this movie 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.700
 can barely be good and then suddenly 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.829
 everything was great, the dramaturgy was very good 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.929
 is told because this country is three 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.180
 just as beautiful a captive 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.709
 on blu-ray is that gigantic and because 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.120
 then actually the action so far 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.489
 comes in the roles and the characters 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.630
 just partly as great as they are 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.489
 also be told that I am correct 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.350
 I went along and I am completely on 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.970
 but again punishes a little bit 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.430
 to defend emotionally and absolutely 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.660
 unmanly but what the hell with this 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.160
 We can do that film now 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.959
 that can not be so bad 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.670
 hannah rachael taylor knows you 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.480
 maybe as an actor from the face 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.489
 otherwise the whole is 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.950
 Australian almost not particularly 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.450
 known but they do one 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.640
 very good performance and above all 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.379
 this sense of community here really 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.150
 Great in the foreground and therefore has 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.410
 every single character a little deep 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.720
 a little history 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.250
 That's why this film has moments in addition 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.560
 where you really have to cry almost 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.810
 many great moments to smile and 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.489
 it was then a drama movie honestly 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.800
 said in comparison with hachiko and 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.870
 Marley &amp; I really can not stand it 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.489
 but he is not bad and that 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.959
 So for the australian movie one or 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.489
 two times you can already watch the movie 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.769
 and just for lovers of this genre 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.660
 is here with the replenishment of 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:10.190
 this one is incredibly unknown 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.780
 maybe the tip for all lovers 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.280
 in this direction and I refer already 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.200
 a little with a augenzwinkern on 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.970
 there is the raffle on sunday there 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.769
 even a few blu-ray copies for 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.819
 to dust for free 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.769
 but then you still have to 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.739
 patient red dog gets for me then 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:27.079
 as the movie drama film or animal drama 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.269
 with absolutely rolling landscape shots 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.250
 really good seven and a half out of 10 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.280
 a total of a film of the possible points 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.349
 In the beginning, unbelievably bad at the end 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.700
 pretty pretty great and that shows 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.140
 again, how important the last one 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.430
 impression of a film listeners 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.780
 namely, the film would have the other way 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.069
 started strong and then would have 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.870
 maybe who belongs to 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.290
 Appreciation probably a lot 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.340
 worse 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.959
 that you get the film family 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.889
 a total of six and a half out of ten 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.389
 possible points 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.430
 click the trailer over here 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.230
 if there is a money the video 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.730
 was really bad and for the 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.139
 burghauptmannschaft on facebook over 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.090
 because you can do a whole lot around 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.950
 I'll chat and I hope that this 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.250
 film a somewhat unknown recommendation 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.230
 for special animal movie lovers is and 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.269
 I'm out tomorrow for tomorrow 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.489
 Of course, 15 museums will be back 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.170
 one with a new review and wishes 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.510
 Have a great Friday evening with you 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:15.950
