00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:05.820
 hello very good people I am galley and here 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.670
 you have another fine andreina this time in the 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.890
 map of luque town in the area 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.200
 I do not know how to call this area good in the 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.389
 back to where they are thrown 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.279
 packages when playing multiplayer 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:20.369
 so that nobody steal it from you because 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.320
 right here is to say that this is 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.779
 fine andrei I tried it a long time ago 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.940
 time and I tried it for five or six 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.939
 times and it did not work out I thought it was pretty 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.039
 difficult and I left it worth it when I see that 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.040
 it does not come out to me the fifth bullets is like 

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:36.239
 I leave a lot and I forget and the other day 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.910
 it occurred to me to try it again and 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.710
 also then in a few times in a couple 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.190
 of times more or less or even the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.840
 first it came out was pretty good and 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.960
 nothing to highlight about this hainen train what 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.490
 that the rest is very slow in the sense 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.010
 that zombies come from far away 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.110
 ok now after you will see the camera of the 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.350
 film and see and see where they come from the 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:03.020
 zombies and also highlight the damn 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.760
 mannequin that you are seeing there that is 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.740
 pretty easy that I blocked it's worth because 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.260
 It makes you like this and it gets a little bit like that 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.490
 inside and well there I was not sure of 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.650
 that they would have entered all 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.870
 It happens a lot to me that I'm not sure 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:20.110
 ok we have the voice again I think 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.700
 and it has returned to turns is to say that I 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.090
 much happens that's worth it, I do not know if 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.070
 all enter and that's why I always put the 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.490
 movie camera but good I was watching 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.740
 the front lasted a minute ten seconds 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.840
 We would normally never in a minute or 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.660
 one minute two seconds usually arrive 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.230
 all the zombies on this map are so 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.540
 far the rest that now you will see it as 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.190
 I already have almost 20 zombies here and I still 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.720
 one goes out there in the background that the 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.290
 I have to put up with it and the truth is that I 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.930
 it's going pretty good 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.400
 and good for that more than anything I left the 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.150
 film camera especially from this 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.190
 area to see it and little else 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.260
 look over there from the back 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.930
 of the house and one that is going to take a 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.980
 heap on arrival 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.600
 and a little bit further you can see that the 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.610
 I'm holding on until the 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.570
 damn that one that takes a lot that is 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.940
 a total of 1 minute or a minute ponce or 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.560
 out there good I hope you liked it 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.560
 you will tell me what you think
