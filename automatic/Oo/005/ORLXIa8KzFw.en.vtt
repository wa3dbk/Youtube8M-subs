00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.800
 now I will show you the toilet of our room 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:14.580
 the toilet which is called your years then 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:19.699
 it is not easy, even a toilet is 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:26.750
 piece of informational art 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:26.750
 so ordinary in principle such a cover with 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.230
 mind so ordinary but in fact he 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.520
 no ordinary 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:42.180
 wiring connected to water 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.739
 to electricity and here it is the seat 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.140
 the top actually represents 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.629
 the biggest interest and I can everyones 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.989
 buttons 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:01:00.300
 a lot of everything is written there and to 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:04.830
 this toilet has a control panel this 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:08.280
 control panel itself is here too 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.460
 many things are written new and interesting 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:17.990
 can you guess what these mean 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:23.780
 buttons carefully look at them here 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:27.590
 nails that work the axis will press that 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:30.950
 this toilet will start running a trickle of water 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.259
 will work almost like woes 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.110
 Well, here for girls is also so wide 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:40.380
 there will be a trickle 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:43.729
 cool learning done here on the very 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.540
 Deal some places still connected 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.970
 especially in public places 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:53.280
 A function such as opening is connected. 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.200
 toilet without at the touch that is such 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.990
 you pass it like this 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.299
 holds his hand and he rises 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.549
 cover in some places I saw this 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.340
 on for this because it is specifically needed 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.900
 connect this function here's cool then 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.530
 what when 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:14.690
 sit down the toilet he starts funny 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.690
 way to murmur that is so here 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:40.980
 now hear and begins to rumble so 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:44.690
 another way the sound is being prepared 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:48.720
 passing the image creates an atmosphere 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.990
 it is pleasant to everyone to see tracheitis 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:56.459
 well and helps you focus on 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:59.030
 important thing the most that is cool 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:02.130
 when just sit down on this toilet it 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.100
 the fact that it is heated 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.040
 he warms up in a very funny way 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:13.860
 your ass and you are of course cool yourself 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:16.320
 you feel when you've been sitting here and 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.630
 all his work done here can 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.850
 press the button 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.680
 washed away but they need to be connected 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.959
 sometimes it doesn't completely 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.510
 functional but at home for example if you 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.470
 there are some buttons you can 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.170
 reassign 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.140
 and they will be different robot here as well 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:42.030
 In this toilet there is of course manual 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:45.150
 wash it like this if you turn down 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.170
 or upwards it will go and a big building 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.050

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.780
