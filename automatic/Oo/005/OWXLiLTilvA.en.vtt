00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
when you when you put it on charge what

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.029 
when you when you put it on charge what
it'll<00:01:50.509> do<00:01:50.659> is<00:01:50.689> it<00:01:51.020> automatically<00:01:51.530> senses<00:01:51.799> the

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
it'll do is it automatically senses the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.209 
it'll do is it automatically senses the
battery<00:01:52.369> charges<00:01:53.270> it<00:01:53.389> up<00:01:53.509> to<00:01:53.600> its<00:01:53.749> full

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
battery charges it up to its full

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:57.370 
battery charges it up to its full
voltage<00:01:55.219> and<00:01:55.670> then<00:01:56.240> puts<00:01:56.749> it<00:01:56.840> into<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.109> float

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
voltage and then puts it into a float

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.750 
voltage and then puts it into a float
mode<00:01:57.679> so<00:01:58.490> that<00:01:59.109> it<00:02:00.130> will<00:02:01.130> stay<00:02:01.399> there<00:02:01.670> until

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:02.760 
mode so that it will stay there until

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.360 
mode so that it will stay there until
the<00:02:03.180> Charter<00:02:03.600> when<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.650> put<00:02:04.800> it<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:04.980> the<00:02:05.130> cyber

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
the Charter when you put it on the cyber

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.850 
the Charter when you put it on the cyber
wall<00:02:05.670> what<00:02:06.300> happens<00:02:06.690> is<00:02:06.900> is<00:02:07.410> that<00:02:07.470> there's<00:02:07.800> a

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
wall what happens is is that there's a

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.310 
wall what happens is is that there's a
second<00:02:08.280> set<00:02:09.240> of<00:02:09.300> circuitry<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:09.960> here<00:02:10.140> that

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
second set of circuitry in here that

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.860 
second set of circuitry in here that
will<00:02:10.440> actually<00:02:10.470> lower<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.430> battery<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.570> so

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
will actually lower the battery and so

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.570 
will actually lower the battery and so
it<00:02:13.020> has<00:02:13.200> a<00:02:14.420> built<00:02:15.420> in<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.930> set<00:02:16.650> of<00:02:16.740> low<00:02:16.950> resistors

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
it has a built in a set of low resistors

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.850 
it has a built in a set of low resistors
and<00:02:17.820> fans<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.600> dissipate<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.230> battery<00:02:19.650> so

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
and fans to dissipate the battery so

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.680 
and fans to dissipate the battery so
what<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.220> can<00:02:20.400> do<00:02:20.520> is<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:21.000> will<00:02:21.210> charge<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.570> up

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
what you can do is it will charge it up

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.350 
what you can do is it will charge it up
to<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.930> top<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.380> then<00:02:22.830> it<00:02:22.950> will<00:02:23.100> discharge<00:02:23.730> it

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
to the top and then it will discharge it

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.840 
to the top and then it will discharge it
through<00:02:24.750> its<00:02:25.140> normal<00:02:25.680> discharge<00:02:25.920> cycle<00:02:26.640> and

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
through its normal discharge cycle and

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.340 
through its normal discharge cycle and
by<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.860> series<00:02:28.860> of<00:02:28.920> charges<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.520> discharges<00:02:30.350> it

impedance<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.150> can<00:02:44.030> come<00:02:45.030> back<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.270> a

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
impedance so that it can come back to a

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.860 
impedance so that it can come back to a
higher<00:02:46.280> ability<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.550> run<00:02:47.880> for<00:02:48.150> longer<00:02:48.540> periods

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
higher ability to run for longer periods

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.870 
higher ability to run for longer periods
of<00:02:48.900> time<00:02:48.960> under<00:02:49.380> your<00:02:49.560> loads<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.580> this<00:02:50.730> is

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
of time under your loads and this is

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.010 
of time under your loads and this is
what<00:02:51.060> we<00:02:51.240> refer<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.810> as<00:02:52.530> rejuvenation<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:54.870> can

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
what we refer to as rejuvenation you can

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.440 
what we refer to as rejuvenation you can
literally<00:02:55.530> bring<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.310> battery<00:02:56.670> back<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.270> life

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
literally bring a battery back to life

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.630 
literally bring a battery back to life
and<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.500> that<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.740> behaves<00:02:59.040> almost<00:02:59.280> as

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
and so that it behaves almost as

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.220 
and so that it behaves almost as
brand-new<00:03:00.740> simply<00:03:01.740> by<00:03:02.300> clamping<00:03:03.300> it<00:03:03.600> on<00:03:03.720> to

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
brand-new simply by clamping it on to

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.800 
brand-new simply by clamping it on to
this<00:03:04.710> machine<00:03:05.060> putting<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.150> on<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.390> cycle

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
this machine putting it on the cycle

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.190 
this machine putting it on the cycle
mode<00:03:06.959> and<00:03:07.400> turning<00:03:08.400> it<00:03:08.490> on<00:03:08.580> and<00:03:09.390> what<00:03:09.810> happens

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
mode and turning it on and what happens

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.350 
mode and turning it on and what happens
is<00:03:10.380> is<00:03:10.560> it<00:03:10.680> will<00:03:10.830> charge<00:03:11.430> and<00:03:11.760> discharge<00:03:11.850> the

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
is is it will charge and discharge the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.240 
is is it will charge and discharge the
battery<00:03:12.390> and<00:03:12.959> deeper<00:03:13.380> and<00:03:13.500> deeper<00:03:13.560> cycles

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
battery and deeper and deeper cycles

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.050 
battery and deeper and deeper cycles
until<00:03:15.120> it<00:03:15.690> finally<00:03:16.020> comes<00:03:16.350> back<00:03:16.410> up<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.060> the

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
until it finally comes back up and the

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.540 
until it finally comes back up and the
battery<00:03:18.660> is<00:03:19.170> above<00:03:19.890> 90<00:03:20.340> percent<00:03:20.370> brand-new<00:03:21.300> so

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
battery is above 90 percent brand-new so

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.070 
battery is above 90 percent brand-new so
this<00:03:23.550> is<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.790> first<00:03:24.090> charter<00:03:24.570> of<00:03:24.690> its<00:03:24.810> kind

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
this is the first charter of its kind

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.880 
this is the first charter of its kind
that<00:03:25.739> goes<00:03:26.220> through<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.520> net<00:03:26.880> an<00:03:27.890> automatic

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
that goes through a net an automatic

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.920 
that goes through a net an automatic
sequence<00:03:29.340> of<00:03:29.730> charging<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.300> discharging<00:03:30.420> the

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
sequence of charging and discharging the

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.780 
sequence of charging and discharging the
battery<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.890> bring<00:03:32.400> back<00:03:32.670> its<00:03:33.030> natural<00:03:34.790> built

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
battery to bring back its natural built

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.430 
battery to bring back its natural built
in<00:03:35.970> capacity<00:03:36.600> that<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:36.900> may<00:03:37.050> have<00:03:37.200> lost

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
in capacity that it may have lost

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.059 
in capacity that it may have lost
because<00:03:38.100> it<00:03:38.550> was<00:03:38.670> improperly<00:03:39.180> charged<00:03:39.480> by<00:03:39.750> the

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
because it was improperly charged by the

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.729 
because it was improperly charged by the
characters<00:03:40.659> so<00:03:41.659> this<00:03:42.409> is<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:44.480> first<00:03:45.260> time

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
characters so this is the first time

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.589 
characters so this is the first time
that<00:03:46.549> I<00:03:46.700> that<00:03:47.090> I<00:03:47.180> we<00:03:47.569> are<00:03:47.599> aware<00:03:48.019> of<00:03:48.099> that

hands-free<00:04:31.940> it<00:04:32.570> does<00:04:32.900> completely

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
hands-free it does completely

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.620 
hands-free it does completely
automatically<00:04:34.039> its<00:04:34.789> computer-controlled<00:04:35.479> so

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
automatically its computer-controlled so

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.379 
automatically its computer-controlled so
these<00:04:38.630> processes<00:04:39.440> happen<00:04:40.030> according<00:04:41.030> to<00:04:41.210> a

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
these processes happen according to a

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:45.010 
these processes happen according to a
predetermined<00:04:42.110> cycle<00:04:42.940> that<00:04:43.940> was<00:04:44.090> worked<00:04:44.870> out

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
predetermined cycle that was worked out

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.260 
predetermined cycle that was worked out
in<00:04:45.289> the<00:04:45.440> research<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:46.699> development<00:04:47.150> of<00:04:47.210> this

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
in the research the development of this

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.779 
in the research the development of this
