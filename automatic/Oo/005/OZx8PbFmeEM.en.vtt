00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:03.490 
and today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.440 
and today I'm going to show you how to
monitor<00:00:03.940> your<00:00:04.089> CPU<00:00:04.720> GPU<00:00:05.430> and<00:00:06.430> ram<00:00:06.490> usage<00:00:06.940> and

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.450 
monitor your CPU GPU and ram usage and

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.279 
monitor your CPU GPU and ram usage and
the<00:00:07.839> temperature<00:00:08.410> and<00:00:08.999> the<00:00:09.999> frame<00:00:10.269> rate<00:00:10.299> while

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:11.289 
the temperature and the frame rate while

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:13.499 
the temperature and the frame rate while
playing<00:00:11.799> your<00:00:11.950> games<00:00:12.219> like<00:00:12.759> I<00:00:12.909> do<00:00:12.969> in<00:00:13.480> my

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:13.509 
playing your games like I do in my

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.480 
playing your games like I do in my
videos<00:00:14.519> first<00:00:15.519> we<00:00:15.879> download<00:00:16.170> msi<00:00:17.170> afterburner

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
videos first we download msi afterburner

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.220 
videos first we download msi afterburner
with<00:00:18.490> the<00:00:18.610> link<00:00:18.820> I<00:00:18.970> left<00:00:19.180> down<00:00:19.840> in<00:00:20.110> the

description I'm going to download it

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.150 
description I'm going to download it
because<00:00:23.500> I<00:00:23.740> already<00:00:24.160> have<00:00:24.370> it<00:00:24.550> so<00:00:25.980> I'm<00:00:26.980> going

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
because I already have it so I'm going

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:32.429 
because I already have it so I'm going
to<00:00:27.220> sub<00:00:27.520> from<00:00:27.789> the<00:00:27.940> zip<00:00:28.270> file<00:00:30.360> next<00:00:31.360> you<00:00:32.079> add

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
to sub from the zip file next you add

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.669 
to sub from the zip file next you add
the<00:00:32.999> agreement<00:00:33.999> we<00:00:34.690> want<00:00:34.989> to<00:00:35.109> solve<00:00:35.350> both

00:00:35.669 --> 00:00:35.679 
the agreement we want to solve both

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:39.599 
the agreement we want to solve both
these<00:00:36.129> two<00:00:36.399> programs<00:00:38.280> we<00:00:39.280> create<00:00:39.519> the

00:00:39.599 --> 00:00:39.609 
these two programs we create the

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:48.900 
these two programs we create the
shortcuts<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:43.329> it<00:00:43.480> won't<00:00:43.719> take<00:00:43.899> much<00:00:44.140> time

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:01:07.580 

now<00:00:49.910> we<00:00:49.970> will<00:00:50.240> install<00:00:50.420> Rio<00:00:50.750> char

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.539 

both<00:01:08.450> installations<00:01:09.450> are<00:01:09.630> done<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:11.250> open

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
both installations are done so we open

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.389 
both installations are done so we open
MSI<00:01:11.909> Afterburner<00:01:12.860> we're<00:01:13.860> going<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.130> put<00:01:14.250> this

00:01:14.389 --> 00:01:14.399 
MSI Afterburner we're going to put this

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.920 
MSI Afterburner we're going to put this
standard<00:01:15.500> center<00:01:16.500> interface<00:01:17.479> so<00:01:18.479> everyone

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
standard center interface so everyone

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.810 
standard center interface so everyone
understands<00:01:20.810> there

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
understands there

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.700 
understands there
so<00:01:23.820> first<00:01:24.439> settings<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:26.039> monitoring<00:01:27.710> GPU

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
so first settings and monitoring GPU

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.789 
so first settings and monitoring GPU

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
temperature shown on screen display this

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.249 
temperature shown on screen display this
is<00:01:31.950> why<00:01:32.100> it's<00:01:32.399> important

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
is why it's important

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:42.700 
is why it's important
you<00:01:34.259> pay<00:01:34.439> your<00:01:34.500> usage<00:01:35.329> now<00:01:36.329> screen<00:01:36.689> display

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
memory usage from the GPU the video card

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.900 
memory usage from the GPU the video card
framerate<00:01:48.620> in<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.670> framerate<00:01:51.640> as<00:01:52.640> you<00:01:52.790> can

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
framerate in the framerate as you can

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.640 
framerate in the framerate as you can
see<00:01:53.090> there<00:01:53.740> the<00:01:54.740> temperature<00:01:54.980> of<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.670> CPUs

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
see there the temperature of the CPUs

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:06.070 
see there the temperature of the CPUs
CPU<00:01:59.260> the<00:02:00.260> usage

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:13.360 

-<00:02:06.710> RAM<00:02:06.950> usage<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:11.380> I<00:02:12.380> think<00:02:12.650> that's<00:02:12.950> it

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
- RAM usage and I think that's it

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.290 
- RAM usage and I think that's it
then<00:02:14.150> we<00:02:14.390> change<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:15.650> refresh<00:02:16.040> rate<00:02:16.160> of<00:02:16.580> the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
then we change the refresh rate of the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.760 
then we change the refresh rate of the
overlay<00:02:17.690> so<00:02:18.080> it<00:02:18.830> detects<00:02:19.360> more<00:02:20.360> precisely<00:02:21.230> how

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
overlay so it detects more precisely how

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.050 
overlay so it detects more precisely how
it<00:02:22.270> changes<00:02:23.270> through<00:02:23.540> time<00:02:23.950> hit<00:02:24.950> okay<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.520> now

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
it changes through time hit okay and now

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.300 
it changes through time hit okay and now
we<00:02:26.630> open<00:02:28.390> rabbi<00:02:29.390> Turner<00:02:29.720> that<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:30.860> should<00:02:31.160> open

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
we open rabbi Turner that it should open

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.850 
we open rabbi Turner that it should open
automatically<00:02:31.970> with<00:02:32.330> there<00:02:33.050> you<00:02:33.080> go<00:02:33.260> with

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
automatically with there you go with

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.460 
automatically with there you go with
anis<00:02:34.280> afterburner

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
anis afterburner

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.890

first<00:02:36.470> we<00:02:36.650> click<00:02:37.130> on<00:02:37.310> roster<00:02:37.580> through<00:02:38.030> game<00:02:38.240> so

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
first we click on roster through game so

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.830 
first we click on roster through game so
we<00:02:39.350> have<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.850> different<00:02:40.850> text<00:02:41.210> if<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:41.540> click<00:02:41.750> it

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
we have a different text if you click it

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.070 
we have a different text if you click it
again<00:02:42.110> you're<00:02:42.830> going<00:02:43.130> to<00:02:43.280> have<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:44.630> choose<00:02:44.870> the

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
again you're going to have to choose the

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.380 
again you're going to have to choose the
font<00:02:46.600> whatever<00:02:47.600> you<00:02:47.720> want

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
font whatever you want

then activate on-screen display shadow
for<00:02:54.260> buried<00:02:54.770> disability<00:02:55.280> and<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:58.040> like<00:02:58.430> to

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
for buried disability and I like to

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.390 
for buried disability and I like to
build<00:02:58.670> yellow<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.240> black<00:02:59.390> like<00:03:00.130> fraps<00:03:01.130> and

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
build yellow and black like fraps and

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.720 
build yellow and black like fraps and
with<00:03:02.000> this<00:03:02.150> slider<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:03.170> just<00:03:03.670> change<00:03:04.670> the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
with this slider you just change the

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.030 
with this slider you just change the
size<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.570> other<00:03:05.750> way<00:03:05.870> this<00:03:06.470> can<00:03:06.710> be<00:03:06.740> changed

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
size the other way this can be changed

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.150 
size the other way this can be changed
in<00:03:07.370> real<00:03:07.550> time<00:03:08.230> if<00:03:09.230> you<00:03:09.440> all<00:03:09.560> tap<00:03:09.800> out<00:03:09.950> of<00:03:10.070> the

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
in real time if you all tap out of the

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
in real time if you all tap out of the
game<00:03:10.370> if<00:03:11.000> you<00:03:11.200> if<00:03:12.200> you<00:03:12.320> look<00:03:12.530> here<00:03:12.970> you<00:03:13.970> can

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
game if you if you look here you can

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.790 
game if you if you look here you can
change<00:03:14.590> where<00:03:15.590> it<00:03:15.709> is<00:03:15.830> and<00:03:16.570> that's<00:03:17.570> it<00:03:17.810> you

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
change where it is and that's it you

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:32.820 
change where it is and that's it you
just<00:03:19.130> minimize<00:03:19.760> everything<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.540> open<00:03:20.840> again

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.610 

so<00:03:33.830> we<00:03:33.980> have<00:03:34.130> it<00:03:34.220> right<00:03:34.370> here<00:03:35.200> top-left<00:03:36.200> corner

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
so we have it right here top-left corner

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:43.060 
so we have it right here top-left corner
of<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:38.810> video<00:03:39.730> now<00:03:40.730> we<00:03:40.790> open<00:03:41.330> again<00:03:41.630> we<00:03:42.620> want

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
of the video now we open again we want

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.310 
of the video now we open again we want
to<00:03:43.160> change<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:43.640> so<00:03:43.820> we<00:03:44.330> can<00:03:44.480> do<00:03:44.600> this<00:03:44.780> for
