well I think that way well so she'll be

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.470 
well I think that way well so she'll be
pretty<00:02:50.510> excited<00:02:50.959> to<00:02:51.049> learn<00:02:51.140> how<00:02:51.349> to<00:02:51.379> use<00:02:51.590> it

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
pretty excited to learn how to use it

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.580 
pretty excited to learn how to use it

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
before I leave for basic training and

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:57.880 
before I leave for basic training and
she'll<00:02:56.329> be<00:02:56.420> by<00:02:56.569> herself<00:02:56.720> so<00:02:57.260> hopefully<00:02:57.590> I<00:02:57.620> can
