00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
here going to the fetus because you

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.310 
here going to the fetus because you
didn't<00:00:30.539> follow<00:00:30.779> through

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
your rope when the tip of the rope was

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.520 
your rope when the tip of the rope was
one<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.760> wrong<00:00:50.910> way<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.390> if<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.930> happens

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
one the wrong way and if that happens

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.689 
one the wrong way and if that happens
all<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.800> follow-through<00:00:53.219> in<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> world

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
all the follow-through in the world

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.580 
all the follow-through in the world
doesn't<00:00:54.210> help<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:55.020> here's<00:00:55.289> what<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.500> think

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
doesn't help you so here's what I think

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.290 
doesn't help you so here's what I think
follow-through<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.430> when<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.879> shoot<00:00:57.180> a

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
follow-through is when you shoot a

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.869 
follow-through is when you shoot a
basketball<00:00:57.920> when<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.039> ball<00:00:59.250> leaves<00:00:59.609> your

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
basketball when the ball leaves your

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.630 
basketball when the ball leaves your
hand<00:01:00.180> your<00:01:00.480> hand<00:01:00.510> looks<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:02.100> as<00:01:02.340> it

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
hand your hand looks like that but as it

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.609 
hand your hand looks like that but as it
leaves<00:01:02.879> then<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.570> have<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.989> do<00:01:04.140> something

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
leaves then you have to do something

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.329 
leaves then you have to do something
with<00:01:04.710> your<00:01:04.949> hand

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
with your hand

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.109 
with your hand
okay<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.090> put<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.080> aside<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.939> remember<00:01:08.939> that

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119

it's<00:01:35.549> always<00:01:35.939> open<00:01:36.240> there's<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.930> great<00:01:37.170> picture

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
it's always open there's a great picture

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.469 
it's always open there's a great picture
I<00:01:37.560> think<00:01:37.680> on<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.100> cover<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.430> spin2win<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.240> it

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
I think on the cover of spin2win and it

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.719 
I think on the cover of spin2win and it
might<00:01:39.659> be<00:01:39.689> Derek<00:01:40.170> Begay<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.619> think<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.340> and

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
might be Derek Begay I think it is and

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.889 
might be Derek Begay I think it is and
his<00:01:41.909> hand<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.600> like<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:43.200> okay<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.899> think

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
his hand is is like that okay I think

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.020 
his hand is is like that okay I think
what<00:01:46.110> those<00:01:46.259> guys<00:01:46.560> are<00:01:46.590> doing<00:01:46.829> is<00:01:47.250> as<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.850> rope

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
what those guys are doing is as the rope

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.090 
what those guys are doing is as the rope
leaves<00:01:48.329> their<00:01:48.600> hand<00:01:48.899> they're<00:01:49.439> trying<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.890> get

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
leaves their hand they're trying to get

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.300 
leaves their hand they're trying to get
their<00:01:50.369> rope<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:51.149> spin<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.049> elongate<00:01:52.770> like

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
their rope to spin and elongate like

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.429 
their rope to spin and elongate like
that<00:01:53.579> because<00:01:54.240> if<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.509> watch<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.960> rope<00:01:55.290> at

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
that because if you watch the rope at

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.170 
that because if you watch the rope at
the<00:01:55.560> national<00:01:55.950> finals<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.399> goes<00:01:56.579> on<00:01:56.790> like<00:01:56.820> that

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
the national finals it goes on like that

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.910 
the national finals it goes on like that
that's<00:01:57.390> in<00:01:57.540> my<00:01:57.689> hitting<00:01:58.020> video<00:01:58.290> we<00:01:58.710> talked

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
that's in my hitting video we talked

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.740 
that's in my hitting video we talked
about<00:01:58.950> how<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.369> Rope<00:01:59.640> goes<00:01:59.880> on<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.509> know<00:02:00.540> it

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
about how the Rope goes on you know it

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.300 
about how the Rope goes on you know it
doesn't<00:02:00.960> go<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.259> like<00:02:01.649> this<00:02:01.680> unless<00:02:02.070> you're<00:02:02.280> a

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
doesn't go on like this unless you're a

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.069 
doesn't go on like this unless you're a
beginner<00:02:02.700> then<00:02:03.149> you're<00:02:03.329> open<00:02:03.659> right<00:02:03.840> horn

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
beginner then you're open right horn

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.569 
beginner then you're open right horn
left<00:02:04.320> horn<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.680> that's<00:02:04.770> that's<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.430> whole

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
left horn and that's that's a whole

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.459 
left horn and that's that's a whole
nother<00:02:05.759> topic<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.509> we're<00:02:06.899> talking<00:02:07.020> about<00:02:07.259> if

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
nother topic but we're talking about if

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.499 
nother topic but we're talking about if
you<00:02:07.590> can<00:02:07.770> feel<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.280> tip<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.729> how<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.300> rope

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
you can feel the tip and how that rope

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.510 
you can feel the tip and how that rope
spins<00:02:09.899> out<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.200> your<00:02:10.289> hand<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:11.069> actually

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
spins out of your hand and you actually

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.000 
spins out of your hand and you actually
follow<00:02:12.060> through<00:02:12.330> but<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.660> doesn't

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
follow through but it doesn't

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.809 
follow through but it doesn't
that<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:14.420> means<00:02:14.689> that<00:02:15.439> so<00:02:16.129> I<00:02:16.159> want<00:02:16.489> to<00:02:16.549> show<00:02:16.760> you

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
on the ground I'm gonna I'm gonna spin

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:21.069 
on the ground I'm gonna I'm gonna spin
this<00:02:19.280> rope<00:02:19.519> out<00:02:19.700> of<00:02:19.819> my<00:02:19.939> hand<00:02:20.209> and<00:02:20.659> I<00:02:20.750> want<00:02:20.989> you

this rope out of my hand and I want you
to<00:02:21.200> look<00:02:21.409> at<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.709> imprint<00:02:22.280> that<00:02:22.459> it<00:02:22.549> makes<00:02:22.790> on

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
to look at the imprint that it makes on

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:30.940 
to look at the imprint that it makes on
the<00:02:23.060> ground<00:02:27.310> okay<00:02:28.310> look<00:02:28.579> at<00:02:28.730> see<00:02:29.239> how<00:02:29.269> that<00:02:29.950> so

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
the ground okay look at see how that so

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.100 
the ground okay look at see how that so
what<00:02:31.700> that<00:02:31.879> is<00:02:32.269> is<00:02:33.040> is<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.310> hand<00:02:34.670> hold<00:02:34.940> of<00:02:35.180> my

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
what that is is is the hand hold of my

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.750 
what that is is is the hand hold of my
rope<00:02:36.549> is<00:02:37.549> right<00:02:37.909> there<00:02:38.239> and<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:40.310> tip<00:02:40.519> of<00:02:40.700> the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
rope is right there and the tip of the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.430 
rope is right there and the tip of the
rope<00:02:40.970> is<00:02:41.239> right<00:02:42.140> there<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:44.000> hon<00:02:44.209> do<00:02:44.440> is

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
rope is right there and the hon do is

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.220 
rope is right there and the hon do is
that<00:02:45.709> right<00:02:45.890> there<00:02:46.129> and<00:02:46.849> that's<00:02:47.629> what<00:02:47.900> hits

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
that right there and that's what hits

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.069 
that right there and that's what hits
the<00:02:48.769> base<00:02:49.040> of<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.370> head<00:02:49.579> so<00:02:50.540> you're<00:02:50.720> trying<00:02:50.959> to

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
the base of the head so you're trying to

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:52.899 
the base of the head so you're trying to
get<00:02:51.230> your<00:02:51.409> rope<00:02:51.590> long<00:02:51.859> in<00:02:52.099> so<00:02:52.310> if<00:02:52.400> you<00:02:52.549> threw<00:02:52.879> a

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
get your rope long in so if you threw a

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.210 
get your rope long in so if you threw a
loop<00:02:53.180> like<00:02:53.209> that<00:02:53.450> at<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.870> horns<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:54.349> you<00:02:54.409> spun

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
loop like that at the horns and you spun

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.440 
loop like that at the horns and you spun
it<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:55.519> you<00:02:55.639> Center<00:02:55.970> -<00:02:56.060> how<00:02:56.209> could<00:02:56.389> you

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
it and you Center - how could you

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.899 
it and you Center - how could you
possibly<00:02:56.750> split<00:02:57.379> the<00:02:57.500> horns<00:02:57.829> so<00:02:58.459> that's<00:02:58.670> what

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
possibly split the horns so that's what

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.610 
possibly split the horns so that's what
I<00:02:58.940> try<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.329> do<00:02:59.480> when<00:02:59.659> I<00:02:59.750> head<00:03:00.019> when<00:03:00.290> I<00:03:00.319> get

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
I try to do when I head when I get

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.860 
I try to do when I head when I get
everything<00:03:00.829> set<00:03:01.250> up<00:03:01.280> I<00:03:01.670> try<00:03:02.120> to<00:03:02.180> finish<00:03:02.540> that

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
everything set up I try to finish that

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.229 
everything set up I try to finish that
loop<00:03:03.079> and<00:03:03.319> make<00:03:03.349> that<00:03:03.680> loop<00:03:03.920> I<00:03:04.370> try<00:03:04.879> to<00:03:04.940> present

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
loop and make that loop I try to present

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.539 
loop and make that loop I try to present
it<00:03:05.599> to<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.870> head<00:03:06.079> in<00:03:06.349> that<00:03:06.859> fashion<00:03:07.159> that's

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
it to the head in that fashion that's

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.599 
it to the head in that fashion that's
what<00:03:07.730> I'm<00:03:07.819> trying<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.120> make<00:03:08.239> my<00:03:08.359> loop<00:03:08.540> do

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
what I'm trying to make my loop do

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.530 
what I'm trying to make my loop do
anyway<00:03:10.609> I<00:03:10.639> think<00:03:10.879> that's<00:03:11.239> what

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
anyway I think that's what

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.000 
anyway I think that's what
follow-through<00:03:12.109> means<00:03:12.319> that<00:03:12.500> as<00:03:12.680> a<00:03:12.769> kid<00:03:12.980> I

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
follow-through means that as a kid I

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.500 
follow-through means that as a kid I
didn't<00:03:13.400> understand<00:03:13.819> it<00:03:13.909> I<00:03:14.000> thought<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.359> was

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
didn't understand it I thought it was

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.379 
didn't understand it I thought it was
that<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:15.200> it's<00:03:15.319> not<00:03:15.530> it's<00:03:15.889> it's<00:03:16.220> what<00:03:16.849> you<00:03:17.150> do

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
that and it's not it's it's what you do

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.629 
that and it's not it's it's what you do
as<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.690> rope<00:03:18.199> leaves<00:03:18.500> your<00:03:18.680> hand<00:03:18.889> and<00:03:19.129> after

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639
