00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
take a heavy consistency of paint and

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.840 
take a heavy consistency of paint and
put<00:01:17.340> whatever<00:01:17.850> color<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:19.460> like<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.020 
background right over the masking fluid
it's<00:01:25.590> protected<00:01:27.890> by<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.950> masking<00:01:29.520> fluid<00:01:29.549> so

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
it's protected by the masking fluid so

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.080 
it's protected by the masking fluid so
the<00:01:30.180> flower<00:01:30.450> will<00:01:31.079> end<00:01:31.350> up<00:01:31.590> being<00:01:32.070> white<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:33.030> a
