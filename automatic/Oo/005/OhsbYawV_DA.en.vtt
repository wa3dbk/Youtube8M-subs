00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
have stopped us and say that they can't

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.050

believe<00:03:28.720> how<00:03:29.590> good<00:03:29.830> he's<00:03:29.950> doing<00:03:30.130> and<00:03:30.640> he<00:03:30.910> could

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
believe how good he's doing and he could

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.360 
believe how good he's doing and he could
be<00:03:31.150> a<00:03:31.210> inspiration<00:03:31.530> for<00:03:32.530> other<00:03:32.710> people<00:03:33.070> I

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
be a inspiration for other people I

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.500 
be a inspiration for other people I
think<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:34.150> goal<00:03:34.360> for<00:03:34.630> him<00:03:34.950> would<00:03:35.950> be<00:03:35.980> to<00:03:36.510> help

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
think the goal for him would be to help

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.690 
think the goal for him would be to help
others<00:03:37.780> like<00:03:38.050> he<00:03:38.170> mentioned<00:03:38.500> earlier<00:03:38.920> I<00:03:39.130> think

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
others like he mentioned earlier I think

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.120 
others like he mentioned earlier I think
that<00:03:39.820> says<00:03:40.000> God<00:03:40.570> saved<00:03:40.900> him<00:03:41.080> for<00:03:41.200> a<00:03:41.290> reason<00:03:41.470> and

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
that says God saved him for a reason and

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:50.550 
that says God saved him for a reason and
he's<00:03:42.580> gonna<00:03:42.790> do<00:03:43.570> very<00:03:43.780> well<00:03:49.380> there's<00:03:50.380> no

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
he's gonna do very well there's no

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.650 
he's gonna do very well there's no
reason<00:03:50.830> to<00:03:50.890> give<00:03:51.070> up<00:03:51.220> there's<00:03:51.459> so<00:03:52.300> much<00:03:52.480> out

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
reason to give up there's so much out

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.540 
reason to give up there's so much out
there<00:03:52.930> that<00:03:53.260> you<00:03:53.740> know<00:03:53.800> the<00:03:53.890> way<00:03:54.010> that<00:03:54.160> science

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
there that you know the way that science

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.340 
there that you know the way that science
is<00:03:54.700> being<00:03:54.940> changed<00:03:55.420> anything<00:03:55.720> that<00:03:55.989> it's<00:03:56.110> just

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
is being changed anything that it's just
