hey you do check later again working on
another<00:00:03.000> one<00:00:03.149> of<00:00:03.179> my<00:00:03.300> weird<00:00:03.780> projects<00:00:04.650> this<00:00:05.580> is

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
another one of my weird projects this is

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.770 
another one of my weird projects this is
actually<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.049> inside<00:00:07.670> of<00:00:08.670> a<00:00:09.179> Genesis

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
actually the inside of a Genesis

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.789 
actually the inside of a Genesis
controller<00:00:10.219> and<00:00:11.219> all<00:00:11.700> these<00:00:11.849> wires<00:00:12.210> that<00:00:12.799> are

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
controller and all these wires that are

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.779 
controller and all these wires that are
soldered<00:00:14.340> up<00:00:14.519> are<00:00:15.210> soldered<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:16.490> these<00:00:17.490> little

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
soldered up are soldered to these little

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.070 
soldered up are soldered to these little
guys<00:00:19.580> which<00:00:20.580> are<00:00:22.130> switches<00:00:23.900> now<00:00:24.900> these

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
guys which are switches now these

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.749 
guys which are switches now these
switches<00:00:26.000> will<00:00:27.000> be<00:00:27.150> placed<00:00:28.340> inside<00:00:29.340> of<00:00:29.849> these

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:31.759 
switches will be placed inside of these

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.620 
switches will be placed inside of these
so<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.790> when<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.270> move<00:00:33.510> choice<00:00:34.380> take<00:00:35.630> place

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
so that when you move choice take place

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.760 
so that when you move choice take place
the<00:00:36.840> buttons<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.350> goes<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.680> right

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
the buttons and goes in the right

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.850 
the buttons and goes in the right
direction<00:00:38.480> now<00:00:39.480> I've<00:00:39.629> got<00:00:39.780> two<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.050> those<00:00:40.379> I've

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
direction now I've got two of those I've

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
there now the whole thing is gonna be

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.380 
there now the whole thing is gonna be
encased<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.090> here<00:01:04.640> which<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.670> actually<00:01:06.000> an<00:01:06.299> old

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
silverware box that I'm gonna cut the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.950 
silverware box that I'm gonna cut the
top<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.799> mount<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.920> joystick<00:01:11.369> here<00:01:11.960> buttons

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
top of mount the joystick here buttons

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.929 
top of mount the joystick here buttons
over<00:01:13.110> here<00:01:13.250> start<00:01:14.250> button<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:14.610> the<00:01:14.700> middle

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
over here start button in the middle

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.160 
over here start button in the middle
it's<00:01:15.770> it's<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.860> start<00:01:17.159> button<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:18.780> then

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
right here and plug into the Genesis

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.280 
right here and plug into the Genesis
that<00:01:26.130> way<00:01:26.280> I'll<00:01:26.369> have<00:01:26.780> almost<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.990> lap

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290

controller<00:01:28.920> something<00:01:29.400> I've<00:01:29.520> kind<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.790> wanted

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
controller something I've kind of wanted

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.770 
controller something I've kind of wanted
for<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.299> while<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:31.250> don't<00:01:32.250> know<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.490> think<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.450> may

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
for a while I don't know I think I may

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.190 
for a while I don't know I think I may
build<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.950> stand<00:01:35.310> for<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.759> eventually<00:01:36.200> just

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
build a stand for it eventually just

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.039 
build a stand for it eventually just
having<00:01:37.409> one<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.710> those<00:01:37.799> really<00:01:38.009> weird<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:39.049> don't

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
having one of those really weird I don't

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.580 
having one of those really weird I don't
know<00:01:40.229> but<00:01:41.159> uh<00:01:41.750> that's<00:01:42.750> where<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.020> stands<00:01:43.320> right

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
know but uh that's where it stands right

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.280 
know but uh that's where it stands right
now<00:01:43.649> I'm<00:01:44.280> about<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.610> go<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.619> just<00:01:48.290> soldered

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
now I'm about to go I just soldered

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.649 
now I'm about to go I just soldered
everything<00:01:49.680> on<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.950> board<00:01:53.630> so<00:01:54.630> that

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
everything on the board so that

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.389 
everything on the board so that
everything's<00:01:55.170> making<00:01:55.409> connection<00:01:56.040> I'm<00:01:56.219> about

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
everything's making connection I'm about

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.969 
everything's making connection I'm about
to<00:01:56.579> go<00:01:56.729> hook<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.780> all<00:01:57.869> up<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.290> test<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.740> and

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
to go hook it all up and test it and

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.050 
to go hook it all up and test it and
we'll<00:01:59.340> see<00:01:59.460> how<00:01:59.520> things<00:01:59.700> go<00:01:59.850> from<00:02:00.149> there

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
we'll see how things go from there

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.850 
we'll see how things go from there
Oh<00:02:02.470> gang<00:02:03.470> we've<00:02:03.979> got<00:02:04.100> my<00:02:04.220> go-to<00:02:04.460> game<00:02:05.860> for

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
Oh gang we've got my go-to game for

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.620 
Oh gang we've got my go-to game for
testing<00:02:07.670> controllers<00:02:08.770> Streets<00:02:09.770> of<00:02:09.860> Rage<00:02:10.630> the

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
testing controllers Streets of Rage the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.740 
testing controllers Streets of Rage the
reason<00:02:11.900> I<00:02:11.930> use<00:02:12.170> it<00:02:12.349> is<00:02:12.470> because<00:02:12.500> it's<00:02:12.950> got

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
reason I use it is because it's got

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.570 
reason I use it is because it's got
three<00:02:14.750> separate<00:02:15.290> buttons<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:16.130> I<00:02:16.220> know<00:02:16.280> do

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
three separate buttons that I know do

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.960 
three separate buttons that I know do
three<00:02:16.819> different<00:02:16.940> things<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:20.750> now<00:02:20.870> let's<00:02:21.050> see

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
three different things so now let's see

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.330 
three different things so now let's see
and<00:02:22.970> I've<00:02:23.060> coded<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.599> control<00:02:24.050> the<00:02:24.680> wires<00:02:24.950> so

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
and I've coded the control the wires so

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.839 
and I've coded the control the wires so
if<00:02:25.550> you<00:02:25.640> can<00:02:25.760> see<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.860> but<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.519> green<00:02:28.819> ones

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
if you can see that but the green ones

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.040 
if you can see that but the green ones
are<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.630> controls<00:02:30.160> up<00:02:31.160> down<00:02:31.430> left<00:02:31.610> and<00:02:31.790> right

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
are the controls up down left and right

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.720 
are the controls up down left and right
this<00:02:33.050> one's<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.410> start<00:02:33.739> button<00:02:33.980> which<00:02:34.489> is

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
this one's the start button which is

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:54.970 
buttons are black okay start button
works<00:02:51.610> so<00:02:52.610> far<00:02:53.019> one<00:02:54.019> not<00:02:54.200> working<00:02:54.590> I'll<00:02:54.739> take

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
works so far one not working I'll take

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.370 
works so far one not working I'll take
that<00:02:55.160> right<00:02:55.370> gang<00:02:55.580> I<00:02:55.880> found<00:02:56.360> out<00:02:56.510> that<00:02:56.720> my

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
that right gang I found out that my

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.380 
that right gang I found out that my
soldering<00:02:57.739> job<00:02:57.920> was<00:02:58.069> actually<00:02:58.340> good<00:02:58.549> it's

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
soldering job was actually good it's

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.380 
soldering job was actually good it's
this<00:02:59.690> switch<00:03:00.019> that<00:03:00.290> seems<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.680> be<00:03:00.769> bad<00:03:01.390> because

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
this switch that seems to be bad because

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:29.530 
this switch that seems to be bad because
when<00:03:02.540> I

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:36.429 

a<00:03:31.090> quick<00:03:32.090> thing<00:03:32.269> to<00:03:32.299> remember<00:03:32.629> is<00:03:32.989> that<00:03:35.439> the

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:36.439 
a quick thing to remember is that the

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:38.709 
a quick thing to remember is that the
opposite<00:03:37.069> of<00:03:37.250> whatever<00:03:37.849> you<00:03:38.030> do<00:03:38.209> is<00:03:38.510> gonna

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:38.719 
opposite of whatever you do is gonna

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:45.599 
opposite of whatever you do is gonna
happen<00:03:39.549> so<00:03:40.549> for<00:03:40.670> instance<00:03:40.969> this<00:03:41.180> is<00:03:41.239> up<00:03:43.480> so<00:03:44.480> up

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
happen so for instance this is up so up

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.229 
happen so for instance this is up so up
is<00:03:46.609> actually<00:03:47.000> gonna<00:03:47.120> push<00:03:47.420> this<00:03:48.260> one<00:03:49.180> so<00:03:50.180> you

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
is actually gonna push this one so you

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.460 
is actually gonna push this one so you
got<00:03:50.390> to<00:03:50.450> remember<00:03:50.510> that<00:03:50.930> when<00:03:51.049> you're<00:03:51.170> looking

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
got to remember that when you're looking

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.990 
got to remember that when you're looking
at<00:03:51.590> the<00:03:51.680> joystick<00:03:52.159> you<00:03:52.340> have<00:03:52.489> to<00:03:52.609> wire<00:03:52.790> it<00:03:52.939> up

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
at the joystick you have to wire it up

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.970 
at the joystick you have to wire it up
backwards<00:03:54.430> not<00:03:55.430> time<00:03:55.639> to<00:03:55.760> wire<00:03:55.909> it<00:03:56.060> up<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:56.980> see

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
backwards not time to wire it up and see

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.289 
backwards not time to wire it up and see
if<00:03:58.040> I<00:03:58.069> can<00:03:58.220> actually<00:03:58.370> move<00:03:58.639> around<00:03:58.760> all<00:03:59.239> right

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
if I can actually move around all right

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:01.720 
if I can actually move around all right
I<00:03:59.540> managed<00:03:59.810> to<00:03:59.840> actually<00:04:00.049> break<00:04:00.500> off<00:04:00.700> one<00:04:01.700> of

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
I managed to actually break off one of

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.559 
I managed to actually break off one of
the<00:04:02.650> solder<00:04:03.650> points<00:04:03.950> right<00:04:04.609> there<00:04:04.939> so

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
the solder points right there so

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:16.860 
the solder points right there so
currently<00:04:06.079> my<00:04:06.879> left<00:04:07.879> is<00:04:08.120> not<00:04:08.329> working

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.590 

so<00:04:17.410> now<00:04:17.769> to<00:04:17.829> put<00:04:18.040> it<00:04:18.160> all<00:04:18.250> together<00:04:18.449> all<00:04:19.449> right

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
so now to put it all together all right

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.590 
so now to put it all together all right
before<00:04:20.169> we<00:04:20.440> start<00:04:20.709> cutting<00:04:20.859> on<00:04:21.389> the<00:04:22.389> wood

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
before we start cutting on the wood

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.600 
before we start cutting on the wood
which<00:04:22.870> is<00:04:23.020> harder<00:04:23.320> to<00:04:23.440> replace<00:04:23.710> what<00:04:24.490> we're

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
which is harder to replace what we're

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.280 
which is harder to replace what we're
gonna<00:04:24.730> do<00:04:24.880> is<00:04:25.000> we're<00:04:25.300> gonna<00:04:25.360> make<00:04:25.600> an<00:04:25.870> outline

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
gonna do is we're gonna make an outline

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.700 
gonna do is we're gonna make an outline
of<00:04:26.650> what<00:04:27.610> we're<00:04:27.729> gonna<00:04:27.850> cut<00:04:28.440> now<00:04:29.440> what<00:04:29.590> I'm

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
of what we're gonna cut now what I'm

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.719 
of what we're gonna cut now what I'm
gonna<00:04:29.800> do<00:04:30.010> is<00:04:30.160> I'm<00:04:30.250> gonna<00:04:30.340> go<00:04:30.490> ahead<00:04:30.639> and

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.350 
gonna do is I'm gonna go ahead and
countersink<00:04:31.479> this<00:04:32.040> that<00:04:33.040> amount<00:04:33.490> which<00:04:34.180> is

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
countersink this that amount which is

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.540 
countersink this that amount which is
barely<00:04:34.750> a<00:04:36.510> quarter<00:04:37.510> of<00:04:37.600> an<00:04:37.720> inch<00:04:38.220> all<00:04:39.220> right<00:04:39.400> I

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
barely a quarter of an inch all right I

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.159 
barely a quarter of an inch all right I
took<00:04:39.729> those<00:04:39.880> parts<00:04:40.240> off<00:04:40.419> now<00:04:40.930> we're<00:04:41.080> gonna

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
took those parts off now we're gonna

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.920 
took those parts off now we're gonna
take<00:04:41.470> these<00:04:41.680> screws<00:04:42.040> out<00:04:42.600> we're<00:04:43.600> gonna<00:04:43.690> take

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
take these screws out we're gonna take

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:45.480 
take these screws out we're gonna take
this<00:04:44.080> part<00:04:44.350> off<00:04:44.470> because<00:04:44.770> in<00:04:44.919> case<00:04:45.100> you<00:04:45.220> can't

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
this part off because in case you can't

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.990 
this part off because in case you can't
see<00:04:46.740> there's<00:04:47.740> a<00:04:47.860> little<00:04:48.160> bit<00:04:48.280> of<00:04:48.370> an<00:04:48.490> overhang

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
see there's a little bit of an overhang

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.909 
see there's a little bit of an overhang
right<00:04:49.210> there<00:04:49.510> and<00:04:49.990> I<00:04:50.080> want<00:04:50.290> to<00:04:50.350> get<00:04:50.440> this<00:04:50.650> set

put it back together

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.360 
put it back together
okay<00:05:13.900> I've<00:05:14.080> laid<00:05:14.289> them<00:05:14.410> out<00:05:14.470> in<00:05:14.530> order<00:05:14.919> there's

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
okay I've laid them out in order there's

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.010 
okay I've laid them out in order there's

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
goofy little jagged edges unless you

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:12.659 
goofy little jagged edges unless you
really<00:06:10.060> really<00:06:10.389> try<00:06:10.510> hard<00:06:11.430> now<00:06:12.430> if<00:06:12.520> you'll

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
notice I kind of went a little too far

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:15.800 
notice I kind of went a little too far
over<00:06:14.410> here

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
over here

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.420 
over here
no<00:06:16.810> problem<00:06:17.260> we<00:06:17.410> just<00:06:17.620> put<00:06:17.800> that<00:06:17.950> there

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
no problem we just put that there

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.909 
no problem we just put that there
give<00:06:18.610> a<00:06:18.639> little<00:06:18.880> piece<00:06:19.030> of<00:06:19.060> tape<00:06:19.389> and<00:06:20.349> voila

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:20.919

and there we are

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.239 
and there we are
so<00:06:24.310> that's<00:06:24.490> gonna<00:06:24.639> be<00:06:24.729> my<00:06:24.969> pattern

00:06:26.239 --> 00:06:26.249 
so that's gonna be my pattern

00:06:26.249 --> 00:06:29.119 
so that's gonna be my pattern
to<00:06:27.179> go<00:06:27.329> all<00:06:27.539> the<00:06:27.659> way<00:06:27.689> through<00:06:28.169> the<00:06:28.709> top<00:06:28.949> of<00:06:28.979> the

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:29.129 
to go all the way through the top of the

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:32.839 
to go all the way through the top of the
box<00:06:29.869> so<00:06:30.869> that<00:06:30.899> I<00:06:31.049> can<00:06:31.319> mount<00:06:31.469> it<00:06:31.679> just<00:06:32.669> like

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:32.849 
box so that I can mount it just like

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:38.419 
box so that I can mount it just like
that<00:06:33.619> now<00:06:34.619> let's<00:06:34.859> make<00:06:35.069> the<00:06:35.849> other<00:06:36.059> side<00:06:37.429> which

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:38.429 
that now let's make the other side which

00:06:38.429 --> 00:06:40.249 
that now let's make the other side which
will<00:06:38.609> be<00:06:38.699> this<00:06:38.909> side<00:06:39.179> so<00:06:39.809> I<00:06:39.869> know<00:06:39.929> the

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:40.259 
will be this side so I know the

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:42.139 
will be this side so I know the
countersink<00:06:40.679> it<00:06:40.889> this<00:06:41.549> one's<00:06:41.789> gonna<00:06:41.939> be<00:06:42.119> a

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:42.149 
countersink it this one's gonna be a

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:44.899 
countersink it this one's gonna be a
little<00:06:42.359> easier<00:06:43.219> because<00:06:44.219> I<00:06:44.399> can<00:06:44.609> kind<00:06:44.819> of

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:44.909 
little easier because I can kind of

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:48.499 
little easier because I can kind of
cheat<00:06:45.379> no<00:06:46.379> not<00:06:46.769> cheat<00:06:47.069> but<00:06:47.369> all<00:06:48.119> I'm<00:06:48.239> gonna<00:06:48.329> do

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:48.509 
cheat no not cheat but all I'm gonna do

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:49.909 
cheat no not cheat but all I'm gonna do
is<00:06:48.539> I'm<00:06:48.719> gonna<00:06:48.809> take<00:06:48.899> the<00:06:49.379> other<00:06:49.469> part<00:06:49.769> of<00:06:49.829> the

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 
is I'm gonna take the other part of the

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:53.679 
is I'm gonna take the other part of the
box<00:06:50.359> now<00:06:51.359> one<00:06:51.629> of<00:06:51.719> the<00:06:51.779> ideas<00:06:52.049> I'm<00:06:52.289> toying<00:06:52.529> with

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:53.689 
box now one of the ideas I'm toying with

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:57.019 
box now one of the ideas I'm toying with
is<00:06:54.689> eventually<00:06:55.319> see<00:06:55.529> this<00:06:55.709> it's<00:06:56.699> got<00:06:56.879> this

00:06:57.019 --> 00:06:57.029 
is eventually see this it's got this

00:06:57.029 --> 00:07:01.279 
is eventually see this it's got this
little<00:06:57.239> lip<00:06:57.659> right<00:06:58.459> here<00:06:59.629> and<00:07:00.629> there's<00:07:00.959> no<00:07:01.110> way

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:01.289 
little lip right here and there's no way

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:04.399 
little lip right here and there's no way
you<00:07:01.349> can<00:07:01.589> see<00:07:01.769> that<00:07:02.779> reflection<00:07:03.779> right<00:07:04.199> there

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:04.409 
you can see that reflection right there

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:07.129 
you can see that reflection right there
a<00:07:04.589> little<00:07:05.009> bit<00:07:05.219> I<00:07:05.489> think<00:07:06.389> what<00:07:06.509> I<00:07:06.539> might<00:07:06.719> do<00:07:06.929> is

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:07.139 
a little bit I think what I might do is

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:10.850 
a little bit I think what I might do is
put<00:07:07.439> a<00:07:07.949> piece<00:07:08.579> of<00:07:08.729> brass<00:07:08.999> down<00:07:09.419> in<00:07:09.599> there<00:07:09.860> just

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:10.860 
put a piece of brass down in there just

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.619 
put a piece of brass down in there just
to<00:07:11.039> make<00:07:11.069> it<00:07:11.219> look<00:07:11.339> a<00:07:11.639> little<00:07:11.789> I<00:07:12.469> don't<00:07:13.469> know

00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:14.629 
to make it look a little I don't know

00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:16.159 
to make it look a little I don't know
I'm<00:07:15.629> here
