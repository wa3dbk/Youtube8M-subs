channels quarter-mile app so what's good
about<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.400> TRC<00:00:11.940> app<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.110> get<00:00:13.259> the

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
about the TRC app is that you get the

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.880 
about the TRC app is that you get the
60-foot<00:00:13.950> the<00:00:14.309> 330<00:00:15.150> foot<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.809> eighth<00:00:16.020> mile<00:00:16.350> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
60-foot the 330 foot the eighth mile the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.760 
60-foot the 330 foot the eighth mile the
thousand<00:00:17.460> foot<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.390> quarter<00:00:18.869> mile<00:00:19.199> not

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
thousand foot and the quarter mile not

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.500 
thousand foot and the quarter mile not
only<00:00:19.980> that<00:00:20.130> you<00:00:20.520> get<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> density<00:00:21.330> altitude

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
only that you get a density altitude

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.720 
only that you get a density altitude
reader<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.830> along<00:00:23.160> with<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.609> get

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
reader and along with that you get

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.450 
reader and along with that you get
relative<00:00:24.359> density<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.380> with<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.830> we<00:00:26.250> have<00:00:26.279> a

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
relative density so with that we have a

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.759 
relative density so with that we have a
really<00:00:26.820> awesome<00:00:27.000> car<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.840> test<00:00:28.109> out<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.529> app

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769

really awesome car to test out this app
and<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.580> nothing<00:00:30.210> with<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.630> thousand

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
and it is nothing with a thousand

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.229 
and it is nothing with a thousand
horsepower<00:00:31.470> something<00:00:32.189> with<00:00:32.309> even<00:00:32.550> 2,000

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
horsepower something with even 2,000

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.610 
horsepower something with even 2,000
horsepower<00:00:33.329> we<00:00:34.050> got<00:00:34.290> 80<00:00:35.070> wheel<00:00:35.460> horsepower<00:00:35.820> I

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
horsepower we got 80 wheel horsepower I

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:55.720 
horsepower we got 80 wheel horsepower I
think<00:00:38.870> Trudeau<00:00:39.920> alright<00:00:40.920> let's<00:00:41.340> do<00:00:41.460> this

speed um 67 miles an hour I almost said

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.980 
speed um 67 miles an hour I almost said
97<00:02:22.820> but<00:02:23.000> I<00:02:23.060> guess<00:02:23.360> that'd<00:02:23.570> be<00:02:23.600> wishful

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
ultimate quarter-mile pass it's a

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.320 
ultimate quarter-mile pass it's a
mandatory<00:02:30.410> thing<00:02:31.130> during<00:02:31.520> your<00:02:31.760> 60-foot

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
don't have all wheel drive why is it so

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.840 
don't have all wheel drive why is it so
hard<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.620> get<00:02:36.770> a<00:02:36.800> 60-foot<00:02:37.280> I'm<00:02:37.400> like<00:02:37.520> bro<00:02:37.730> he

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
hard to get a 60-foot I'm like bro he

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.520 
hard to get a 60-foot I'm like bro he
didn't<00:02:38.060> drink<00:02:38.180> your<00:02:38.330> bomb<00:02:38.450> blast<00:02:38.780> all<00:02:39.410> right
