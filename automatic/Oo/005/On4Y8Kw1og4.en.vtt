00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.420
 I wish that in the cup very much possible 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.470
 and what it means to run aground in Hamburg he knows best Alexander Alvanos 

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.880
 the LÃ¼beck last year was still standing with the VfL Gummersbach in the final 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.880
 with his team today plans a lot 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.810
 the hosts 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.140
 from Solingen note that we also moved to the West 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.640
 supported from there spectators in the again sold out hall Claes 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:31.909
 and that prepares 2 by Jiri Vitek 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.530
 wm participant for the Czech Republic 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.640
 experienced player and the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.620
 we hope that you will 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.210
 be underestimated by the first division 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.210
 and Lilly Becker had their problems 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.430
 big action by Mario Huhnstock 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.010
 the Solinger 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.360
 turn cancer 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.870
 6 0 defense 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.920
 Parts of nuclear power fill this gap for jens-peter Reinarz 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.230
 after nine minutes 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.010
 it stands 4 2 2 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.080
 everything is possible 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.080
 the time-out 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.870
 Alessandro Petacchi IT 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.650
 Fri. 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:24.970
 Jabs were still not very happy, both the GAL better against it 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.910
 the Bergische HC 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.220
 Cook Wittke after 13 minutes 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.540
 really fresher 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.540
 Coach of Bremen 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.970
 The atmosphere is almost too loud for some 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.480
 It took us 80 minutes to finally look silly 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.270
 19 6 seconds behind 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.270
 I want as reaction of the 29-year-old lies 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.100
 there changes to the crossing of the insurance lobby Lars von Trier 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.020
 as a blemish 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.790
 successful against Henning Quade 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.470
 and in the r29 currency Alexander is still out 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.839
 Hit it was to ninth 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:17.269
 and because the tartaric acid guide stays it also stands until the age of 12 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:21.149
 12 so that the new he should coach HaDe Schmitz and his companion Chrischa 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.780
 Hannawald 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.780
 further analysis cup can guide the ways 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.549
 played five minutes in the second half 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:31.959
 it amounts to 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.779
 his sixth goal 

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:35.739
 today two-door tour 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:38.449
 Amazingly fresh the 32-year-old 

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:42.819
 but he also has two games less in Austria at the European Championships in the bones 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.629
 as the poles one says on 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.029
 another 

00:02:48.029 --> 00:02:52.409
 under Artur Siodmiak one of the three Polish internationals 

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:56.529
 at the Ostwestfalen and shortened to 3 4 Seehofer should 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.329
 a little bit later 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.969
 the OECD alludes to Siodmiak 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:06.359
 even as you get older in second half equalize 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.359
 but once again the Polish community is waiting 

00:03:10.999 --> 00:03:14.639
 Two busloads of fans out of the need of it were not coming 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:15.669
 to regret 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:17.469
 Michael Radtke 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:20.069
 primacall Maren Meinert Co 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.599
 by Marion Bergsdorf 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:24.599
 and the chance for the Bergische HC 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.819
 to start again and then such an aftermath is annoying 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:32.309
 Habermas 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:37.299
 before that he took advantage of the first lead for the first half which was triggered 15 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.299
 12 10 after 37 minutes 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:46.219
 the decisive phase 

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:48.999
 in this cup-quarterfinal 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:51.999
 was from the fortieth to the 45 minute 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.059
 a man has been played 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:00.859
 16 of 18 

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:04.930
 and all were so brought out the joy of their coach the decisive 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.389
 Impulse 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:10.059
 the defense much safer than at the beginning of the game the forces probably too 

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:11.159
 significantly better 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.359
 all the world wants 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.439
 with the stronger squad then here is the 20 16 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:16.769
 through a new one 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.489
 that was it in the past, the decision was the seventh goal of paramount value 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:22.720
 that was the but 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.439
 da Silva 1 13 

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:27.210
 from Bohlingen the task 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.409
 an example of the will here by Captain Sebastian Hinze 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.270
 who is like that 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.610
 against 2 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.800
 interspersed from the guard 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.479
 she risks everything 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:42.620
 the second division side from Solingen took out a dead one in favor of a sixth 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.889
 Feldspielers from the right in the picture 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.479
 risky 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.120
 I am glad that today rich but for a rare goal IPO of a toad of 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.680
 Milos Putera 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.529
 The Diezer disappointed 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:59.719
 But above all, of course, happy is about winning in a thrilling 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:03.229
 Game the weather report with 26 22 for the first division 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.560
 Percent above that of joy and sorrow so on the subject cup case were gone 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.610
 today close together 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.389
 at the water supply 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:13.330
 she has made 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.430
 Vevey given everything the market has tried everything but 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.629
 Messi has shown that the 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:22.789
 What a first division of staff is so well staffed but that was so to speak 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.979
 it is not necessary they are all 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.169
 In principle, around 100,000 visitors were sitting 

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:34.989
 in addition to the sporting success was so overwhelming even at around 150,000 

00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:38.809
