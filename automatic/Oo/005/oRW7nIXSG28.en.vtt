 on the 15th august at the gamescom friday 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.150

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.070

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.900
 and there are pro gamer in different 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.220
 play alongside workshops and we 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.699
 have the honor of making fifa 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.949
 allowed 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.379
 were asked by the esl if we 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:05.379
 Do not be bothered and be in the case 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.789
 that then for us benny his knife and 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.740
 marvin must be the german champion 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:09.850
 Of course, always at the forefront was and 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.800
 german vice master and if you have 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.509
 of course also virtual bundesliga im 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.280
 top 8 result of his profile good 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.690
 results so that we can easily 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.710
 Let's pretend that we are you 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.850
 maybe show a bit 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.590
 how can you make the fifa even better? 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.119
 and that is going to be running workshops though 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.649
 above all, have fun in the 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.560
 frame program determines what to eat 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:29.050
 Eat and I drink something red 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.310
 bull doses also give it and me 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.170
 just go for a short time the infoseite 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.090
 because there are only a few 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.830
 Things to note attendance is from 15 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.840
 that is when you are young than 15 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.429
 unfortunately you can not do it in the case 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.130
 Maybe next time then 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:44.020
 As I said 15 August is the Friday and 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.759
 very important registration is only possible 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.289
 until the 14th of july so if you say so 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.149
 I want to be and have to be there 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.340
 somehow still cover how it works with 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.619
 the journey and something then you have to 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.410
 cover that very time now and everything 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:57.700
 I think another one will be explained very well 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.380
 fill in the form what you see 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.250
 and we did it that way now 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.690
 I have already written in it 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.160
 in which tournaments do you have 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.420
 participated in this column would have to 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.920
 you always have gaming at the beginning 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.149
 register for your probability 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.530
 that you are about to increase 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.450
 because it is so that we have a slot for 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.830
 rupert gaming has blocked, so to speak 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.209
 they said clearly if you do that 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.030
 we can also make sure that 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.280
 a people of the community there at the start 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.360
 we found it really cool that is if 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.760
 you registered there you can do that 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.750
 enter with a lower one and that increases 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.849
 a little bit the probability 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.680
 that they are at the start and otherwise like 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.360
 said if you have questions write it 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.890
 like to be in the comments of the link too 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.900
 this website is in the description 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.400
 and there, as I said, we will see here 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.290
 everything else can be explained quite simply 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.940
 Of course we would be happy if we 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.859
 see you in cologne then you start there 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.569
 and in that sense I would too 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.840
 Keeping it that way makes good people 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.110
 maybe see us in cologne 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.110
 See you
