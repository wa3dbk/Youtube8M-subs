00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.600
 hello friends today we offer you a video of 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.550
 anatomy on the hand which we 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.710
 will serve to know a little more about 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.720
 our anatomy and will also serve 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:23.570
 I support all students who 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.970
 need to learn about it during the 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.850
 video we specialize only in 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.010
 the bony part and articulate remarking the 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.530
 structures and joints more 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.989
 important if you want information about 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.660
 the anatomy of the muscles and nerves or 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:42.050
 We recommend you action directed to the 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.450
 second video that we will soon publish the 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.730
 hand is the most distal part of our 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.149
 arm is characterized by having a large 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.340
 functionality and variety of movements 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.800
 the bones of the hand are divided into eight 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.739
 short bones that make up the field 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.680
 five long bones that make up the 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.070
 metacarpus 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.830
 and 14 also long bones that are called 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.230
 phalanges in addition between meta casposos 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.080
 phalanges we can find some bones 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.780
 very curious called sesamoid the 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.110
 set of these bones make up the 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.060
 Anatomical region of the hand starting 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.490
 always from a base position 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.440
 anatomical in which the subject is 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.930
 standing with the palms of the 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.810
 hands forward we will describe the 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.330
 bones from outside to inside the 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.670
 eight bones of the carpus are arranged in two 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.060
 rows the first row of them what 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.940
 make up the scaphoid 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.930
 I was mole 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:48.320
 pyramidal and pee and shape 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:52.260
 the second row is made up of 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.690
 the trapezoid trapezius 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.820
 and big bone 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.340
 and hooks 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.920
 the carpus in addition to articulating all his 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.160
 bones with each other in their closest part 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.530
 is articulated with the radio but not with 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.740
 the ulna since the joint surface 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.800
 they make up the triangular ligament or 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.290
 yellow 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.230
 through the distal end the carpus 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:21.110
 articulates with the metacarpus shaped by 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.720
 five long bones formed like all 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.720
 the long bones by a diocese or 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.330
 body and two epiphyses or limbs that 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.700
 they are articulated on both sides last 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.190
 the phalanges articulate with the goal 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.560
 carbon we have three on each finger 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:39.650
 except on the thumb where 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.750
 we only have two we can name 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.030
 in the order in which we 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.940
 we found the closest 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.130
 towards us the first phalanx 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.890
 then the second and third phalanx 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.800
 and finally we have to name the 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:57.410
 sesamoid bones if it's about 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.200
 small bony balls embedded in 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.300
 the tendons and they serve as pulley or 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.420
 point of support when making 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.730
 movements from the point of view 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.520
 articulate it is worth noting the articulation 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.040
 metacarpal trapezius that is performed 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.290
 between the trapeze and the metacarpus of 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.910
 thumb this joint is 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.410
 It distinguishes from the rest has greater 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.840
 functionality 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.270
 and thus enhancing the clamp function 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.610
 that our thumb has 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.770
 in relation to fractures that occur 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.710
 more often in our hand it fits 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.870
 highlight the fragility of the scaphoid the 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:36.060
 scaphoid is a bone that normally 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.000
 it is very poorly vascularized what 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.070
 that gives it a huge fragility 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.560
 it is enough to have a quality supporting 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.020
 our wrist or palm of the hand to 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.490
 that this bone ends fractured in the 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.350
 most of the times the 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.810
 consolidation of a fracture 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:55.070
 scaphoid is quite complicated for its 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.070
 poor vascularization 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.750
 I would also like to highlight the fracture 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.970
 of the fifth metal the fifth metal is the 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.490
 corresponding to the little finger the most 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:07.560
 sensitive and fragile of all the fracture 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.480
 of this metal is called fracture of the 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.270
 boxer since on numerous occasions 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:15.120
 we can have a fracture when performing 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:17.220
 a direct hit with our fist is 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.190
 fracture also takes place when 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.800
 we hit a wall or a table with rage 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.110
 once known this basic anatomy of 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.150
 the hand we recommend you to visualize 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.110
 also the video that talks about his 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.570
 musculature innervation movements 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.670
 if you liked the video consider 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.460
 share them with all people 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.650
 close to you share wellness and health 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.950
 and help all those people who 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:46.410
 have a problem similar to yours with 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.520
 physiotherapy available to everyone
