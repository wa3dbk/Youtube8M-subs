resolution of 720p HD a front-facing
camera<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.250> think<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.729> was<00:01:23.880> 2<00:01:24.180> megapixels<00:01:24.810> and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
camera I think that was 2 megapixels and

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.200 
camera I think that was 2 megapixels and
a<00:01:25.290> rear<00:01:25.560> facing<00:01:25.590> camera<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.310> 12<00:01:26.670> megapixel

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
a rear facing camera of 12 megapixel

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.960 
a rear facing camera of 12 megapixel
support<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:27.840> gps<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.500> gps<00:01:28.530> all<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.610> stuff<00:01:29.820> and

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
support for gps a gps all that stuff and

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.670 
support for gps a gps all that stuff and
something<00:01:30.750> fishy<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.350> actually<00:01:31.380> see

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
something fishy is you can actually see

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.830 
something fishy is you can actually see
the<00:01:31.920> design<00:01:32.310> over<00:01:32.579> there<00:01:32.729> but<00:01:32.970> i<00:01:33.180> honestly

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
the design over there but i honestly

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.899 
the design over there but i honestly
doubt<00:01:34.530> this<00:01:34.829> will<00:01:35.040> be<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.250> final<00:01:35.369> design<00:01:35.640> just

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
doubt this will be the final design just

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.060 
doubt this will be the final design just
because<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.900> kind<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.229> looks<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.500> bit<00:01:37.619> weird<00:01:37.680> i

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
because it kind of looks a bit weird i

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.010 
because it kind of looks a bit weird i
