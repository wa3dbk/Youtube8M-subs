00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:23.099
 the sun as it is being pursued I 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.710
 I have a year here in this decoration 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:26.820
 dolls are Japanese dolls 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.710
 cushion calls 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.050
 they then made a doll of 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.150
 my instagram photos and here in the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.970
 battery decoration where it appears on the 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.829
 videos you started asking to teach 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.650
 It was a challenge for us. 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.229
 I put all my happy thinking 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.860
 in the form of being able to recreate to you 

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:49.619
 so after many hours thinking 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.080
 creating things that are not of this self 

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:54.089
 I got the result and this new york 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.260
 chicago will sign the video today 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:58.199
 logical that it was not identified 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.449
 because this original because they can not 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.760
 the one that arrives made of wood is a 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.920
 very specific painting but she also 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.500
 next also look like I think it's 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.479
 very cool for the performance of the room 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.119
 so if you want to learn how to do 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.119
 these achievements if it continued in the video 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.080
 You're going to need a roll of paper. 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:26.159
 Toilet paper can be paper 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.470
 Aluminum small Styrofoam balls 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:34.940
 that you cut in half fits 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.940
 right on the roller and a larger 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.110
 will also need glue relief in the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.150
 colors you have at home 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.600
 black ink and any other color that 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.270
 Do you want a black and white pen brush? 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.300
 red pen a piece to see the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.540
 red to red fabric a piece of 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:02:01.020
 a green ribbon or a 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:05.070
 green cloth scissors hot glue pencil 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.640
 pen and stylus and that's it, let's go 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.640
 by step 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:15.630
 I start drawing in the bigger ball. 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.790
 the shape of the head of the cochiche then there 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.010
 I'm drawing to the floor not only to 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.930
 you have a sense of what this is. 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.390
 The part that I'm dotting is going to be 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.610
 painted in black that is her hair 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.850
 So this part of the little face I'm going to cut 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.590
 out with the help of the stylus and I'll 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.820
 leave this Styrofoam ball for the cuca 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.970
 inside you will see that I'm going to take 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.650
 the whole of her core is very hollow 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.840
 inside and after we managed to 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.840
 fit the paper roll 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.880
 then I took the side of the ball pretty and 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.190
 I fit the roll if you need to take more 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.170
 take more until that little box 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.780
 the small ball will be the part of the 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.460
 face ball bigger the hair and a 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:09.750
 rolino is going to be the body they are going to be 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:12.180
 now it's just paint 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.360
 part of the hair all black inside 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.480
 and outside pass one or two layers up 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.640
 well cover the Styrofoam Mami you 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.590
 paint the color you want by playing 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:30.090
 pink but your use of the ink you have 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:32.130
 house on the sleeve part of the kimono I 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.960
 I got cut a double cardboard only 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.570
 draw a triangle round the 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.710
 sides and will look more or less like this. 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.940
 Whatever color you want 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.480
 After being with you, you will have these 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.480
 three pieces 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.900
 that's all you have to do is cut the 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:03.230
 be fitted very upright head 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.110
 pass the glue the little face afterwards 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.770
 hair and will position until it is well 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.770
 right 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:30.320
 there is only ribbon necklace paste the sleeves of the 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.320
 that the monolugar correct 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.870
 I made a so a piece of traveling more 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:46.770
 you can do with tape happened 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:48.900
 I clipped it right over my head and 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.820
 now just draw your eyes to the mouth 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.420
 make the details in the kimono of our 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.420
 cochiche 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.930
 principle may seem a bit 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:11.580
 complicated personal step-by-step but 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.040
 I think it's worth struggling and doing 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.690
 because the result is very cool 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.670
 you had prevented them from doing these 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.800

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.780
