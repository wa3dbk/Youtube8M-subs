 nonsense but still someone possible 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.950
 It is useful because I had to 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.399
 I rummage to look in general before 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.239

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.810
 Well, standard registration as on many 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.439
 sites in general are exactly the data that 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.540
 you point there you will need to enter 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:49.470
 just on this little screen 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:56.430
 downloads that you have when 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:59.909
 gta 5 start that's what else you want 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.450
 I did it all, I found this problem as 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.479
 would have decided it all did click further and 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.330
 what I had I started she 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.360
 loaded social club started loading i 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.510
 I thought that 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.900
 went well smoked as if not an advertisement 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.000
 smoking but still coming back and mine 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.660
 my computer is still not loaded 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.400
 so bad and I realized that something is not 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:29.220
 so began to look again for this problem 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.730
 it turns out that she is not only with me and 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:37.690
 what do you need to do to you on disk c on 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:43.690
 c drive here we have c drive create a folder 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:46.980

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.410
 English right here 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.820
 May the document is correct, probably yes 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:57.340
 said okay not the point 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:03:00.959
 here it is, I show it, but this is the way 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.940
 it turns out that's creating a daddy here 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.560
 Here you are roughly there created before this 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.770
 daddy and 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.680
 what do you do next 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:15.910
 Next go to the users roughly 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.299
 saying yes well here's what's here with me 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.580
 not anymore I changed everything 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:26.709
 Well, here are common documents click 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:29.350
 properties by location and that's it in 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:32.830
 this line indicate the path 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:35.799
 It turns out this daddy 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:39.180
 That you will have a local drive c my 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:41.500
 documents everything is nothing complicated 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.739
 you can not even register anything 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:49.780
 here now look here I came here 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:52.989
 Here I clicked on my documents all kontrol 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:56.530
 click copy and paste here 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:59.049
 it turns out all the problems will not be any 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:03.010

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:08.829

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:11.170
 tolerated all this problem we solved i 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:13.500
 did everything at least since i tell you 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.519
 now showed 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.170
 I run gta 5 there no matter through steam 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:24.240
 now it is on i can't show 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:29.380
 as through steam as all people run 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:32.830
 either start from the shortcut 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.080
 it seems to load everything appears 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.020
 the splinter there is already starting 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:42.360
 load there these sprockets police 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:46.900
 up to the top I'm already full of happiness and 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:49.930
 The next error appears: well, this 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:52.540
 error is very upset me I began 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:56.950
 look for a general initialization error 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:05:00.870
 got off the cup of course they are listed it 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:03.580
 the problem is indicated on other sites but 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.630
 for some reason I did not think it was exactly 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.730
 she is listed 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:10.350
 Well, in principle, do not look 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:13.090
 problem solve differently remove the game 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:16.210
 reinstall someone it helps 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.250
 I was helped by the next couple 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.980
 movements today here at work was and 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:24.040
 for some reason I thought that was what was needed 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.880
 make see the game installed by me 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.530
 on disk e 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.570
 see everything on disk e here's a new folder 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.880
 2 was a new folder 3 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.930
 she was called well, roughly speaking, if 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.990
 in new folder 2 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:42.660
 I would install here and here 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:46.830
 gta 5 well, there is not gta 5 but steam 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:53.860
 these are the files here 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:56.500
 here is gta 5 only this folder is not a game 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.990
 Yes, the game is probably correctly written in 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.040
 English is not strong not gay was called 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.760
 new folder 3 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:09.310
 In general, I come from work, I rename 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:11.200
 just a game I literally write it took 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.150
 me a few seconds from somehow I 

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.780
 decided what exactly it should all 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:19.150
 fix and see what we do 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:24.139
