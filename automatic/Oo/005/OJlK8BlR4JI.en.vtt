first<00:03:11.400> thing<00:03:11.550> it<00:03:11.640> does<00:03:11.760> is<00:03:11.820> it<00:03:13.190> moisturizes<00:03:14.190> it

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
first thing it does is it moisturizes it

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.180 
first thing it does is it moisturizes it
it<00:03:14.520> makes<00:03:14.820> it<00:03:14.970> look<00:03:15.240> supple<00:03:15.780> but<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.950> also

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
it makes it look supple but it also

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.340 
it makes it look supple but it also
makes<00:03:17.489> it<00:03:17.610> look<00:03:17.820> matte<00:03:18.270> at<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.690> same<00:03:18.870> time<00:03:19.080> so

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
makes it look matte at the same time so

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.410 
makes it look matte at the same time so

think probably the biggest con and the

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.250 
think probably the biggest con and the
biggest<00:04:02.580> turnoff<00:04:03.709> about<00:04:04.709> this<00:04:04.980> is<00:04:05.250> that<00:04:05.730> it<00:04:06.260> it

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
biggest turnoff about this is that it it

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.800 
biggest turnoff about this is that it it
