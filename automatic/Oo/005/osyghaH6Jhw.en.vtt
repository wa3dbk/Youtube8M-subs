 let's go camping 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.430
 hello good afternoon in the field there is no 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.080
 no problem if you want we pass 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.340
 teach the facilities and what 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.340
 we do here in agreement 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.780
 from Madrid 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.920
 since we are with the crisis are more or 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:21.800
 unless you have a week say where 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:21.800
 we were in a field the women 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.010
 right now we are in one of the zones 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.110
 of bungalows that we have in the campsite 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.610
 apart from plots where people against 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:52.450
 your tents your motorhome caravans 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.369
 and so we have a link to where the 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.369
 people come to your vehicle only 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.680
 stay here and inside they have kitchen fourth 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.259
 of bathroom and good all the comforts 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.450
 that they can have or almost like at home 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.220
 although in a smaller space that does not 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.840
 it becomes neither like a rural house nor 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.729
 neither is it as small as a 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.890
 caravan there are people who prefer their 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.080
 caravan or your tent because 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.700
 he likes that but there are other people who 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.050
 prefer more comfort and look for the 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.610
 bungalow in this case in the aspect 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.890
 geographical we are in a place 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.750
 privileged because we are two hours away 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.330
 from madrid to two hours from murcia 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.920
 alicante de valÃ¨ncia plus everything that is 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.500
 that did the spot we have a 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.610
 crowds of people in two hours 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.610
 quite important 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.550
 the main point is that the camping 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.680
 It is located in the natural park of 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.330
 ruidera lagoons but there are also 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.130
 people who have been coming for many years and 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.569
 that comes exclusively to the campsite and 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.569
 almost does not leave our facilities 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.980
 we attach great importance to the fact 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.720
 the activities and these are some 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.910
 activities that we will do in the afternoon 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.850
 to give no option to boredom at 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.050
 people is doing a little bit of aerobics 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.050
 but inside the pools 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:25.260
 we make of aquagym that is a little more 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:28.209
 relaxing and then aquaerobic and people 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.280
 of all ages but we go more or 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.970
 less from 10-12 years until 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.970
 any age 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.310
 we can see now a child who are 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.330
 making as bracelets materials 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.000
 correct is an activity that 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.070
 it has just started today on 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.500
 all signs guide the importance of 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.360
 the craftsmanship in this case as is done 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.270
 in bracelets necklaces of another type of 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:58.020
 things like they used to do when 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.020
 there were no machines 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.819
 another exhibitor is counted here with another 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.870
 kind of things that more more laborious for 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.870
 If someone does not want to buy 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.919
 the people who come has passed the end of 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.480
 week usually comes during friday 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.630
 for the afternoon and some on Saturday for the 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.630
 morning 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.010
 there are people who come alone to pass the end 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.780
 but there are people who come from 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.790
 vacation and they'll be a week or 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.670
 ten days total today Friday when 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:37.730
 we close the door because we will be on 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.770
 60 or 70% more or less strategic and in 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.500
 total how many people can host this 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:46.450
 song to about 1,200 people we do not know 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.450

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.520
 rest until when you think clear 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.110
 only until Sunday but at 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.330
 beginning when you arrive is a bit 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.009
 Stressful because it mounts store to take out 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.439
 things and also with these two 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:23.569
 little ones that do not let you breathe 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:25.039
 but then if it is very good and the 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:26.809
 small as they tend to distract here in the 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:29.180
 camping usually do what activities 

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:31.219
