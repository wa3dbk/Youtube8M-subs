 butt are co done but continuation 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.929
 let's do a little fishing scream that 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:31.199
 what we are going to do is how to block 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:33.289
 and to be able to reuse them for future 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.289
 occasions 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.540
 good friends as pearls is that 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:51.840
 we are talking are are sliding the 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.290
 there are different colors is the 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.180
 luminous 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.810
 the red or orange red goes well 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.740
 the yellow 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.740
 the Rose 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.580
 and the white vale these are the colors 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.950
 that has a pearl's pearl 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.620
 which you review now below we are going to 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.870
 do the little jump fishing we're going 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.350
 to simply need quotes 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.350
 normal 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:28.600
 the thread of course and a pebble 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:31.200
 come on let's start well then we put 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.200
 the Pearl 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:42.720
 and now we cut a piece of the thread 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.720
 little piece of them 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.450
 we put it there 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.450
 the bulb we take and cut it 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.290
 imagine that this thread has its 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.980
 hook put we do the following you 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.980
 we throw the pearl 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.300
 we have the pearl tucked clear and this 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.400
 sorry, we want to block it 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.230
 because the pearl normally this kind of 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.980
 pearls is normally blocked 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.760
 but it is in question then bank 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:27.180
 perform the way to block the good 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.319
 there are people who used a stick and me 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.290
 personally how I like to use 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.330
 this type of blockade that is a military 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.080
 we do it in the following way with him 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.080
 what we have cut 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.740
 we make a double 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.860
 we put them double 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.540
 and now simply 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.840
 we had double fs 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.440
 for the pearl 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.440
 you see 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:01.570
 and now you just take the 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.570
 family you put a piece 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:09.190
 a piece that is not very very chubby 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.190
 small and we throw 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.020
 and now just be careful not to 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.950
 cut the thread supposedly from the hook 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.950
 we are the light bulb 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.340
 and now 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.160
 we put the bulb a little more towards 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:35.460
 in 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:38.810
 and we take a cut line 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.810
 in a cape and we throw 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:44.709
 and we have the stone blocked 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.310
 blocked and also reusable the 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.580
 we can simply reuse the day 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.330
 that we have to 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.330
 chop it then we remove it 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.200
 the piece of light bulb 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.990
 and we have the pearl to be able to reuse 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.100
 the again 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.100
 good friends as 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.840
 good friends as well as point as 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.690
 last note tell you that this product 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:26.070
 sold in security bags is in 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:29.600
 perlite bike which lowers the cost a lot 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:32.060
 and then I hope that the jump fishing 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.210
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:38.700
 us the most ideal way we see 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.770
 that we use because this is the light bulb 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.450
 because it is very easy and then at the time 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.000
 to be fishing normally does not 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.390
 you usually lose, you do not usually lose a 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.500
 stick can this can suck water it 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.630
 come out be it but there are other ways to 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.540
 I remove the rubber and any other kind of 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.160
 blocking system that occurs good 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.070
