then<00:01:24.620> I'd<00:01:24.740> imagine<00:01:25.100> one<00:01:25.610> thing<00:01:25.820> I<00:01:25.910> really

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.150 
then I'd imagine one thing I really

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.880 
then I'd imagine one thing I really
loved<00:01:26.330> at<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.570> beginning<00:01:26.960> was<00:01:27.080> when<00:01:27.290> all<00:01:27.320> the

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
loved at the beginning was when all the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.800 
loved at the beginning was when all the
all<00:01:28.430> the<00:01:28.640> singers<00:01:28.940> were<00:01:29.090> standing<00:01:29.479> around<00:01:29.630> and

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
all the singers were standing around and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.270 
all the singers were standing around and
the<00:01:29.869> music<00:01:30.229> was<00:01:30.380> really<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.830> centerpiece

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
the music was really the centerpiece

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.490 
the music was really the centerpiece
that's<00:01:32.030> probably<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.690> only<00:01:32.720> time<00:01:33.200> you<00:01:33.320> can

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
that's probably the only time you can

that's probably the only time you can
see<00:01:33.740> something<00:01:34.220> though<00:01:34.369> isn't<00:01:34.580> it<00:01:34.820> you<00:01:35.330> mean
