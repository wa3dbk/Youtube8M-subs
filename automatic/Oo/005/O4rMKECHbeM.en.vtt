00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
where we came up with this so check this

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.370 
where we came up with this so check this
out<00:00:08.490> anyway<00:00:09.090> here's<00:00:09.360> your<00:00:09.540> stock<00:00:09.809> mole<00:00:10.080> tech

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
out anyway here's your stock mole tech

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.879 
out anyway here's your stock mole tech
and<00:00:11.150> here's<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.780> box<00:00:13.019> now<00:00:13.349> if<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.500> notice

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
and here's the box now if you notice

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.200 
and here's the box now if you notice
over<00:00:14.460> into<00:00:14.700> o-ring<00:00:15.710> the<00:00:16.730> mole<00:00:17.730> tech<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.119> the

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
over into o-ring the mole tech is the

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.500 
over into o-ring the mole tech is the
3/16<00:00:19.020> higher<00:00:19.230> which<00:00:19.830> we<00:00:20.039> know<00:00:20.660> okay<00:00:23.330> but<00:00:24.330> from

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
3/16 higher which we know okay but from

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.370 
3/16 higher which we know okay but from
the<00:00:24.689> clip<00:00:25.519> now<00:00:26.519> let's<00:00:26.730> go<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.150> Lucas<00:00:27.539> okay

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
the clip now let's go to the Lucas okay

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.659 
the clip now let's go to the Lucas okay
and<00:00:28.680> here's<00:00:28.890> your<00:00:29.039> Lucas<00:00:29.750> from<00:00:31.520> oring<00:00:32.520> to

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
and here's your Lucas from oring to

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.020 
and here's your Lucas from oring to
o-ring<00:00:33.530> we<00:00:34.530> have<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.920> same<00:00:35.130> three<00:00:35.370> sixteenths

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
o-ring we have the same three sixteenths

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.220 
o-ring we have the same three sixteenths
difference<00:00:38.450> Lucas<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.719> basra<00:00:40.170> are

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
difference Lucas and the basra are

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.610 
difference Lucas and the basra are
identical<00:00:40.739> okay<00:00:41.989> now<00:00:42.989> what<00:00:43.140> I<00:00:43.200> want<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> show

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
identical okay now what I want to show

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.170 
identical okay now what I want to show
you<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:44.010> installed<00:00:44.489> height<00:00:44.760> forget<00:00:45.149> about

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
you is the installed height forget about

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.850 
you is the installed height forget about
what<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.570> injector<00:00:46.050> looks<00:00:46.320> like<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:46.829> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
what the injector looks like for a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.500 
what the injector looks like for a
moment<00:00:47.280> let's<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.239> put<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:50.059> the<00:00:51.059> mole<00:00:51.239> tech

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
moment let's just put in the mole tech

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.350 
moment let's just put in the mole tech
and<00:00:52.699> let's<00:00:53.699> put<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.149> Lucas<00:00:55.760> okay<00:00:56.760> as<00:00:57.180> you

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
and let's put in the Lucas okay as you

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.349 
and let's put in the Lucas okay as you
can<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.649> we<00:00:58.649> zoom<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.160> in

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.070 

the<00:01:02.899> mult<00:01:03.109> exits<00:01:03.649> 3/16<00:01:04.610> inch<00:01:04.790> higher<00:01:05.030> when<00:01:05.990> you

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
the mult exits 3/16 inch higher when you

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.480 
the mult exits 3/16 inch higher when you
put<00:01:06.290> the<00:01:06.409> rail<00:01:06.619> on<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:08.619> o-ring<00:01:09.619> is<00:01:09.830> almost<00:01:10.340> to

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
put the rail on the o-ring is almost to

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.749 
put the rail on the o-ring is almost to
the<00:01:10.580> bottom<00:01:11.060> of<00:01:11.240> the<00:01:11.869> seat<00:01:12.140> on<00:01:12.380> the<00:01:13.220> rail<00:01:13.430> which

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
the bottom of the seat on the rail which

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.300 
the bottom of the seat on the rail which
I'm<00:01:14.420> a<00:01:14.479> little<00:01:14.600> uncomfortable<00:01:15.140> with<00:01:15.530> but<00:01:16.159> it

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
I'm a little uncomfortable with but it

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.389 
I'm a little uncomfortable with but it
works<00:01:16.490> fine<00:01:17.020> all<00:01:18.020> right<00:01:18.170> now<00:01:18.439> some<00:01:18.890> of<00:01:19.189> these

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
works fine all right now some of these

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:25.660 
works fine all right now some of these
cars<00:01:20.320> like<00:01:21.320> a<00:01:21.530> t56<00:01:22.630> particularly<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:25.250> install

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
cars like a t56 particularly the install

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.260 
cars like a t56 particularly the install
the<00:01:25.820> height<00:01:26.030> of<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:27.020> rail<00:01:27.439> is<00:01:27.860> a<00:01:28.789> little

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
the height of the rail is a little

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.580 
the height of the rail is a little
higher<00:01:29.479> than<00:01:30.080> the<00:01:30.289> 88<00:01:30.830> and<00:01:30.860> 89<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:31.640> 90<00:01:32.360> so<00:01:33.289> the

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
higher than the 88 and 89 and 90 so the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.740 
higher than the 88 and 89 and 90 so the
overing<00:01:33.950> is<00:01:34.070> even<00:01:34.399> more<00:01:34.610> exposed<00:01:35.149> it<00:01:35.450> just

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
overing is even more exposed it just

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.919 
overing is even more exposed it just
grabs<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.440> edge<00:01:36.819> but<00:01:37.819> again<00:01:38.149> it<00:01:38.330> still<00:01:38.569> seals

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
grabs the edge but again it still seals

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:40.930 
grabs the edge but again it still seals
I'm<00:01:39.470> still<00:01:39.799> not<00:01:39.920> that<00:01:39.979> comfortable<00:01:40.429> with<00:01:40.670> it

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
I'm still not that comfortable with it

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.100 
I'm still not that comfortable with it
okay<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.920> take<00:01:42.920> the<00:01:43.069> Lucas<00:01:43.429> out<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:43.959> put<00:01:44.959> in

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
okay and take the Lucas out and put in

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.059 
okay and take the Lucas out and put in
the<00:01:45.409> bosch<00:01:46.340> three<00:01:46.819> and<00:01:47.560> again<00:01:48.560> we<00:01:48.799> have<00:01:48.950> the

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
the bosch three and again we have the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.760 
the bosch three and again we have the
same<00:01:49.310> three-eighths<00:01:49.880> problem<00:01:50.740> so<00:01:51.740> what<00:01:51.890> I<00:01:51.920> did

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
same three-eighths problem so what I did

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.779 
same three-eighths problem so what I did
was<00:01:54.770> take<00:01:55.039> the<00:01:55.250> Bosch<00:01:55.429> injector<00:01:57.580> and<00:01:58.580> if<00:01:58.670> you

00:01:58.779 --> 00:01:58.789 
was take the Bosch injector and if you

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:00.520 
was take the Bosch injector and if you
look<00:01:58.970> at<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.179> bottom<00:01:59.539> I<00:01:59.690> installed<00:02:00.229> another

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
look at the bottom I installed another

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.969 
look at the bottom I installed another
bite<00:02:01.009> no<00:02:01.280> ring<00:02:01.549> on<00:02:01.729> this<00:02:02.240> groove<00:02:02.600> right<00:02:03.020> here

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
bite no ring on this groove right here

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.509 
bite no ring on this groove right here
now<00:02:04.759> what<00:02:05.000> this<00:02:05.179> does<00:02:05.679> is<00:02:06.679> changes<00:02:07.280> the

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:07.519 
now what this does is changes the

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:10.270 
now what this does is changes the
installed<00:02:08.000> height<00:02:08.590> because<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:09.800> overhang

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
installed height because that overhang

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.309 
installed height because that overhang
now<00:02:10.489> sits<00:02:11.150> in<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.690> chamfer<00:02:12.200> in<00:02:12.410> the<00:02:12.890> manifold

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
now sits in the chamfer in the manifold

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.080 
now sits in the chamfer in the manifold
the<00:02:15.319> bottom<00:02:15.680> o-ring<00:02:16.099> the<00:02:18.730> bottom<00:02:19.730> o<00:02:19.849> ring

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
the bottom o-ring the bottom o ring

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.900 
the bottom o-ring the bottom o ring
still<00:02:20.390> seals<00:02:20.750> in<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.080> bunk<00:02:21.319> fine<00:02:21.620> so<00:02:22.610> there's

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
still seals in the bunk fine so there's

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.270 
still seals in the bunk fine so there's
no<00:02:23.120> potential<00:02:23.870> for<00:02:24.050> vacuum<00:02:24.620> leak<00:02:24.800> so<00:02:25.069> this

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
no potential for vacuum leak so this

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.800 
no potential for vacuum leak so this
goes<00:02:25.519> in<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.620> that's<00:02:27.620> pushed<00:02:27.950> all<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.220> way<00:02:28.340> in

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
goes in and that's pushed all the way in

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.580 
goes in and that's pushed all the way in
we<00:02:29.810> have<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.110> bottom<00:02:30.440> overhang<00:02:30.830> in<00:02:31.099> the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
we have the bottom overhang in the

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.690 
we have the bottom overhang in the
fifteen<00:02:33.590> millimeter<00:02:34.040> hole<00:02:34.310> that's<00:02:34.610> drilled

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
fifteen millimeter hole that's drilled

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.449 
fifteen millimeter hole that's drilled
in<00:02:35.060> the<00:02:35.150> manifold<00:02:35.629> for<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.110> o-ring<00:02:36.530> but<00:02:37.280> now

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
in the manifold for the o-ring but now

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.180 
in the manifold for the o-ring but now
it<00:02:37.580> is<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:37.730> cushion<00:02:38.230> that<00:02:39.230> this<00:02:39.500> new<00:02:39.680> injector

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
it is a cushion that this new injector

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.699 
it is a cushion that this new injector
sits<00:02:40.459> on<00:02:40.840> all<00:02:41.840> right<00:02:41.989> now<00:02:42.260> look<00:02:42.440> at<00:02:42.560> the

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
sits on all right now look at the

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.490 
sits on all right now look at the
installed<00:02:43.099> height<00:02:43.340> both<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.750> mul<00:02:44.930> tech<00:02:45.200> and

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
installed height both the mul tech and

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.820 
installed height both the mul tech and
the<00:02:45.739> bosch<00:02:46.150> have<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.390> identical

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.380 

height<00:02:52.830> on<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.130> injector<00:02:53.610> they<00:02:53.940> both<00:02:54.150> go<00:02:54.360> into

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
height on the injector they both go into

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.110 
height on the injector they both go into
rail<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:55.020> same<00:02:55.290> clips<00:02:56.099> are<00:02:56.280> not<00:02:56.430> necessary<00:02:56.970> of

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
rail the same clips are not necessary of

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.430 
rail the same clips are not necessary of
course<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.480> pressure<00:02:57.720> is<00:02:57.930> gonna<00:02:58.080> hold<00:02:58.319> them

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
course the pressure is gonna hold them

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.800 
course the pressure is gonna hold them
down<00:02:58.680> and<00:02:58.890> there's<00:02:59.520> no<00:02:59.670> potential<00:03:00.090> for<00:03:00.300> a<00:03:00.540> leak

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
down and there's no potential for a leak

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.059 
down and there's no potential for a leak
I<00:03:02.209> just<00:03:03.209> like<00:03:03.390> this<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.599> lot<00:03:03.840> better<00:03:03.900> so<00:03:04.860> that's

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
I just like this a lot better so that's

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.300 
I just like this a lot better so that's
the<00:03:05.280> deal<00:03:06.080> watch<00:03:07.080> this<00:03:07.290> video<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.830> then<00:03:07.920> tell

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
the deal watch this video and then tell

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.710
