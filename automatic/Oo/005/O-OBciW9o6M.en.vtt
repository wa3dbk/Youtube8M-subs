00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.200 
first checked out their online store I
really<00:01:08.189> thought<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.460> was<00:01:08.520> kind<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.820> ridiculous

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
really thought it was kind of ridiculous

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.200 
really thought it was kind of ridiculous
because<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.750> prices<00:01:10.260> were<00:01:10.590> about<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.400> $100

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
because the prices were about like $100

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.560 
because the prices were about like $100
for<00:01:12.630> only<00:01:13.380> leggings<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:15.240> me<00:01:15.390> that's

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
for only leggings and to me that's

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.300 
for only leggings and to me that's
really<00:01:16.080> expensive<00:01:17.000> but<00:01:18.590> they<00:01:19.590> have<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.159> many

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
really expensive but they have so many

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.899 
really expensive but they have so many

that leggings are not pants and I

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.110 
that leggings are not pants and I

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
leggings are very revealing to like the

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.600 
leggings are very revealing to like the
shape<00:03:07.299> of<00:03:07.450> one's<00:03:07.690> body<00:03:08.019> and<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:09.400> know<00:03:09.489> like

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
shape of one's body and you know like

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.930 
shape of one's body and you know like
form-fitting<00:03:10.319> and<00:03:11.319> it<00:03:11.950> isn't<00:03:12.670> really

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
form-fitting and it isn't really

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.410 
form-fitting and it isn't really
attractive<00:03:13.920> and<00:03:14.920> some<00:03:15.190> people<00:03:15.430> wear<00:03:15.610> it<00:03:15.790> and<00:03:16.120> I

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
attractive and some people wear it and I

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.410 
attractive and some people wear it and I
think<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:17.290> you<00:03:17.860> can<00:03:18.130> wear<00:03:18.400> it<00:03:18.549> as<00:03:18.670> pants<00:03:19.000> but

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
think that you can wear it as pants but

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.780 
think that you can wear it as pants but
you<00:03:20.140> just<00:03:20.320> have<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.650> do<00:03:20.860> it<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.340> right<00:03:21.519> way<00:03:21.760> and

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
you just have to do it the right way and

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.300 
you just have to do it the right way and
wear<00:03:22.360> like<00:03:22.660> a<00:03:22.720> top<00:03:23.049> that<00:03:23.380> actually<00:03:23.799> covers

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
wear like a top that actually covers

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.520 
wear like a top that actually covers
your<00:03:24.459> ass<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:25.660> if<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:25.930> wear<00:03:26.109> it<00:03:26.200> that<00:03:26.350> way<00:03:26.500> I

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
your ass and if you wear it that way I

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.620 
your ass and if you wear it that way I
think<00:03:26.650> it's<00:03:26.950> fine<00:03:27.010> so<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.760> three<00:03:28.000> prints<00:03:28.420> that

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
think it's fine so the three prints that

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.470 
think it's fine so the three prints that
I<00:03:28.690> bought<00:03:29.200> were<00:03:29.739> two<00:03:30.220> galaxies<00:03:30.880> and<00:03:31.209> the

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
this was 75 Australian dollars which is

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.290 
this was 75 Australian dollars which is
I<00:04:20.070> don't<00:04:21.070> know<00:04:21.160> right<00:04:21.460> now<00:04:21.610> I<00:04:21.640> might<00:04:21.910> be<00:04:21.970> about

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
I don't know right now I might be about

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.250 
I don't know right now I might be about
like<00:04:22.830> $10<00:04:23.830> more<00:04:24.100> in<00:04:24.340> u.s.<00:04:24.640> dollars<00:04:25.120> but<00:04:25.510> the

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
like $10 more in u.s. dollars but the

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.300 
like $10 more in u.s. dollars but the
exchange<00:04:26.740> rate<00:04:27.160> is<00:04:28.770> always<00:04:29.770> like<00:04:29.950> going<00:04:30.130> up

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
exchange rate is always like going up

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.230 
exchange rate is always like going up
and<00:04:30.490> down<00:04:30.610> so<00:04:31.320> that's<00:04:32.320> just<00:04:32.670> an<00:04:33.670> approximation

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
and down so that's just an approximation

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.710 
and down so that's just an approximation
I<00:04:34.660> am<00:04:35.200> addicted<00:04:35.500> to<00:04:35.830> their<00:04:36.040> galaxy<00:04:36.820> print<00:04:37.060> I<00:04:37.330> am

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
I am addicted to their galaxy print I am

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.830 
I am addicted to their galaxy print I am
gonna<00:04:38.050> save<00:04:38.380> up<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:39.360> try<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:40.480> get<00:04:40.600> every

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
gonna save up and try and get every

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.480 
gonna save up and try and get every
single<00:04:41.020> one<00:04:41.320> of<00:04:41.350> them<00:04:41.590> it<00:04:41.740> sucks<00:04:42.040> because<00:04:42.190> they

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
single one of them it sucks because they

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.180 
single one of them it sucks because they
had<00:04:42.700> a<00:04:42.730> purl<00:04:43.060> one<00:04:43.330> which<00:04:43.990> they<00:04:44.260> discontinued

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
had a purl one which they discontinued

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.370 
had a purl one which they discontinued
so<00:04:46.000> I'm<00:04:46.210> hoping<00:04:46.420> they<00:04:46.630> bring<00:04:46.660> that<00:04:46.960> back<00:04:47.200> in

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
so I'm hoping they bring that back in

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.300 
so I'm hoping they bring that back in
the<00:04:47.470> future<00:04:47.890> and<00:04:49.710> so<00:04:50.710> the<00:04:50.800> first<00:04:51.040> one<00:04:51.220> I<00:04:51.250> got

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
the future and so the first one I got

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.480 
the future and so the first one I got
was<00:04:51.700> this<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:52.960> red<00:04:53.170> one<00:04:53.380> it's<00:04:53.680> the<00:04:53.890> red<00:04:54.040> galaxy

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:11.479 
are the red galaxies looks more orange

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:21.010 
are the red galaxies looks more orange
to<00:07:11.719> me<00:07:14.590> yeah<00:07:17.050> and<00:07:18.490> to<00:07:19.490> wash<00:07:19.759> them<00:07:20.210> I<00:07:20.240> just<00:07:20.509> hand

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:26.060 
I wouldn't even risk putting this in the

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.600 
I wouldn't even risk putting this in the
washer<00:07:26.509> or<00:07:26.629> dryer<00:07:26.949> I'm<00:07:27.949> considering<00:07:28.490> you

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:28.610 
washer or dryer I'm considering you

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.269 
washer or dryer I'm considering you
spend<00:07:28.939> so<00:07:29.150> much<00:07:29.300> on<00:07:29.539> it<00:07:29.779> so<00:07:30.439> majority<00:07:30.949> of<00:07:31.039> black

00:07:31.269 --> 00:07:31.279 
spend so much on it so majority of black

spend so much on it so majority of black
milk's<00:07:31.810> clothing<00:07:32.810> material<00:07:33.319> is<00:07:33.500> made<00:07:33.770> up<00:07:33.919> of

00:07:34.059 --> 00:07:34.069 
milk's clothing material is made up of

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:36.999 
milk's clothing material is made up of
polyester<00:07:34.909> and<00:07:34.940> nylon<00:07:35.590> so<00:07:36.590> it's<00:07:36.740> like<00:07:36.860> a

00:07:36.999 --> 00:07:37.009 
polyester and nylon so it's like a
