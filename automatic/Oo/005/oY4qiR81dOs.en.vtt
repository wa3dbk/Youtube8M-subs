00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
too many times you know the parents get

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.899 
too many times you know the parents get
a<00:01:03.239> little<00:01:03.480> bit<00:01:03.600> overexcited<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.820> you<00:01:05.820> know

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
a little bit overexcited and you know

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.570 
a little bit overexcited and you know
tried<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.530> direct<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.799> kids<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.280> instruct

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
tried to direct the kids and instruct

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.160 
tried to direct the kids and instruct
the<00:01:08.670> kids<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.180> instead<00:01:09.689> allowing<00:01:09.930> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
the kids and instead allowing the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.050 
the kids and instead allowing the
coaches<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.830> do<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.340> think<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:11.640> did<00:01:11.790> you

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
coaches to do that so I think it did you

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.480 
coaches to do that so I think it did you
know<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.659> teaches<00:01:13.049> them<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.439> value<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.340> just

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
know it teaches them the value of just

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.800 
know it teaches them the value of just
letting<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.790> kids<00:01:14.970> play<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.570> letting<00:01:15.750> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
letting the kids play and letting the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.320 
letting the kids play and letting the
coaches<00:01:16.110> coach<00:01:16.290> I<00:01:16.590> like<00:01:17.280> my<00:01:17.490> parents<00:01:17.759> having

weekend<00:01:34.920> from<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.159> coaching<00:01:35.340> standpoint

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
weekend from a coaching standpoint

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.620
