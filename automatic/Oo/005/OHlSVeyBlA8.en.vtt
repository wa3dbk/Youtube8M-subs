running back and forth well did you know
that<00:00:20.189> there<00:00:20.310> is<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.580> solution<00:00:21.029> out<00:00:21.300> there<00:00:21.510> it's

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
that there is a solution out there it's

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.960 
that there is a solution out there it's
called<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.230> KVM<00:00:22.769> switch<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.369> right<00:00:23.670> here<00:00:23.820> we're

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
called a KVM switch and right here we're

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.810 
called a KVM switch and right here we're
looking<00:00:24.060> at<00:00:24.359> cables<00:00:25.080> -<00:00:25.199> goes<00:00:25.439> true<00:00:25.859> link<00:00:26.039> for

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
looking at cables - goes true link for

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.650 
looking at cables - goes true link for
port<00:00:27.090> USB<00:00:27.349> 2.0<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.529> ps2<00:00:28.910> KVM<00:00:29.910> switch<00:00:30.210> what<00:00:30.630> a

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
port USB 2.0 and ps2 KVM switch what a

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.600 
port USB 2.0 and ps2 KVM switch what a
name<00:00:30.960> well<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.560> does<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> lot<00:00:32.099> maybe<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> name

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
name well it does a lot maybe the name

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.459 
name well it does a lot maybe the name
should<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:32.790> even<00:00:33.059> longer<00:00:33.329> now<00:00:34.110> what<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.380> is

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
should be even longer now what this is

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.720 
should be even longer now what this is
going<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.649> do<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.460> line<00:00:35.610> to

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
going to do it's going to line to

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.790 
going to do it's going to line to
connect<00:00:36.000> up<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.149> four<00:00:36.540> different<00:00:36.989> computers

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
connect up to four different computers

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
to plug in for each computer and then

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.220 
to plug in for each computer and then
all<00:02:50.680> four<00:02:51.310> of<00:02:51.370> these<00:02:51.630> go<00:02:52.630> away<00:02:52.750> and<00:02:53.140> they

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
all four of these go away and they

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.420 
all four of these go away and they
become<00:02:53.560> one<00:02:54.430> you<00:02:54.910> know<00:02:55.030> one<00:02:55.299> VGA<00:02:55.630> and<00:02:56.220> ps2<00:02:57.220> for

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
become one you know one VGA and ps2 for

now these cables that I showed you this
is<00:03:47.019> six<00:03:47.769> feet<00:03:48.010> of<00:03:48.220> cabling<00:03:48.910> so<00:03:49.150> you<00:03:49.750> know<00:03:49.870> ah<00:03:50.019> I

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
is six feet of cabling so you know ah I

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.170 
is six feet of cabling so you know ah I
think<00:03:51.010> I<00:03:51.099> just<00:03:51.130> tied<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.370> knot<00:03:51.669> there<00:03:51.910> we<00:03:52.060> go

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
think I just tied a knot there we go

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.240 
think I just tied a knot there we go
that's<00:03:52.660> six<00:03:52.930> feet<00:03:53.109> right<00:03:53.319> there<00:03:53.380> so<00:03:54.069> you're

that's six feet right there so you're
going<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:54.400> be<00:03:54.519> able<00:03:54.609> to<00:03:54.730> you<00:03:55.120> know<00:03:55.209> put<00:03:55.419> it<00:03:55.510> that

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
going to be able to you know put it that

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:56.819 
going to be able to you know put it that
far<00:03:55.780> away<00:03:55.870> if<00:03:55.930> you<00:03:56.019> need<00:03:56.109> to<00:03:56.200> get<00:03:56.319> longer<00:03:56.530> it

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
far away if you need to get longer it

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:00.150 
far away if you need to get longer it
just<00:03:57.099> uses<00:03:57.370> a<00:03:57.400> standard<00:03:57.639> VGA<00:03:58.150> and<00:03:58.680> USB<00:03:59.680> now<00:04:00.069> you

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
just uses a standard VGA and USB now you

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.140 
just uses a standard VGA and USB now you
can<00:04:00.250> get<00:04:00.340> as<00:04:00.430> long<00:04:00.579> as<00:04:00.730> you<00:04:00.790> need<00:04:00.910> if<00:04:01.030> you've

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
can get as long as you need if you've

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.670 
can get as long as you need if you've
got<00:04:01.239> a<00:04:01.269> computer<00:04:01.510> in<00:04:01.630> the<00:04:01.720> other<00:04:01.840> room<00:04:02.079> you

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680
