00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.560
 fashion doubles points for this 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.510

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.790
 odd number of cards season not season 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:00.290
 turns victory points for a given 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.740
 resort to negative 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:06.830

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.289
 a bankrupt card generally deprives a player of points 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.030
 for this resort 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.549

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.540
 board game with very non-standard 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.520

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.190
 try to predict what 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.960
