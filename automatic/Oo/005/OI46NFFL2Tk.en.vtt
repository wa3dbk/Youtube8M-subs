00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
a basic set of twelve here of course you

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.080 
a basic set of twelve here of course you
can<00:00:14.759> buy<00:00:14.910> much<00:00:15.299> larger<00:00:15.780> cases<00:00:15.990> 24<00:00:16.529> count<00:00:17.490> 72

can really see how the color darkens or
just<00:02:02.899> comes<00:02:03.110> more<00:02:03.380> vibrant<00:02:06.759> mixing<00:02:07.759> those

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
just comes more vibrant mixing those

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.059 
just comes more vibrant mixing those
clouds<00:02:08.179> see<00:02:08.569> they<00:02:08.780> come<00:02:09.020> out<00:02:09.110> just<00:02:09.470> a<00:02:09.649> really

illustration to show you how to mix the

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.160 
illustration to show you how to mix the
colors<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:22.340> get<00:02:22.430> different<00:02:22.730> tones<00:02:23.090> from<00:02:24.019> the

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
colors to get different tones from the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.070 
colors to get different tones from the
colors<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:24.620> already<00:02:24.890> have<00:02:25.780> now<00:02:26.780> I'm<00:02:26.870> going<00:02:27.019> to

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
colors you already have now I'm going to

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:33.900 
colors you already have now I'm going to
lay<00:02:27.709> down<00:02:29.049> the<00:02:30.049> land<00:02:30.459> using<00:02:31.459> a<00:02:31.640> color<00:02:31.880> called

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
lay down the land using a color called

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:45.789 
lay down the land using a color called
burnt<00:02:34.910> earth<00:02:38.950> it's<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:40.040> nice<00:02:40.280> brown<00:02:40.670> color<00:02:44.799> when

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
burnt earth it's a nice brown color when

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.530 
burnt earth it's a nice brown color when
you<00:02:45.890> lay<00:02:46.010> your<00:02:46.160> water<00:02:47.200> down<00:02:48.200> on<00:02:48.410> top<00:02:48.650> of<00:02:48.680> it<00:02:49.540> it

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
you lay your water down on top of it it

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:57.130 
you lay your water down on top of it it
becomes<00:02:50.680> beautiful<00:02:55.870> experiment<00:02:56.870> with

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
becomes beautiful experiment with

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.979 
becomes beautiful experiment with
shading<00:02:57.590> you<00:02:58.519> can<00:02:58.670> have<00:02:58.819> darker<00:02:59.209> areas<00:02:59.599> on<00:02:59.780> one

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
shading you can have darker areas on one

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.190 
shading you can have darker areas on one
side<00:03:00.230> a<00:03:00.590> little<00:03:00.950> lighter<00:03:01.280> on<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.579> other<00:03:02.200> gives

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
side a little lighter on the other gives

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.819 
side a little lighter on the other gives
it<00:03:03.350> a<00:03:03.380> really<00:03:03.620> natural<00:03:03.950> look<00:03:04.489> you<00:03:08.829> smooth

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
it a really natural look you smooth

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:20.069 
it a really natural look you smooth
