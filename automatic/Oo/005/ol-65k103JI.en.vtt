00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hello again welcome to another video to 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.270
 another how can you see pokemon counter and 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.309
 good the why we have selected for 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.950
 trust this occasion is nothing more and 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.200
 nothing less than the mega monstrosity 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.289
 cangas card as many know mega dogs 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.270
 cannes is one of the revolutions that yes 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.250
 were the ones known in this sixth 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.769
 generation and it is one of the most pokemon 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.000
 dangerous and two dangerous because of their 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.130
 skill that is parental love that makes 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.779
 that can attack twice by the 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.230
 cangas with greater and another one by which it is not 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.660
 so small 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.670
 which makes is this 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.570
 combination can defeat for example to 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:44.050
 pokemon with robusté is pokemon with 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.239
 bands focus pokemon with substitutes and it's 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.370
 a pokémon that apart from having this great 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.050
 skill was increased all 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.870
 states making this pokemon a 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.600
 true monstrosity in combat itself 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.360
 and go against this pokemon 1 against 1 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.460
 force against strength is foolish already 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.790
 that can learn a good has a 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.100
 great set great move set which would destroy 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.450
 a lot I hope that many pokemon though 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.610
 there is a way to tell it and this time 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.700
 we will show 4 pokemon that can 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.219
 perfectly count to mega cangas 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.719
 and good that nothing we talk about him set that 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:18.850
 has megachanges that although I could not 

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:22.270
 say it is the most seen but it is 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.399
 the meca cangas set which is the set that 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.039
 he or she is usually going to see 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.890
 this this this this this and this set that 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.909
 would be with retribution by staff 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.289
 earthquake 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.289
 increase support 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.530
 your body beat down 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.080
 ok and more or less we'll know what pokemon 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.820
 you can stop it here we have 4 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.730
 Pokemon that can count perfectly 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.890
 friend cangas can some better than others and 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.490
 I will speak from my Joao 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.540
 own opinion 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.740
 - You can even the most ok and without 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.930
 more than saying we started talking about the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.090
 first that would be the only pokemon that 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.650
 can of the few because the best says 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.100
 that can fight force with force 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.050
 against mega cangas kan mega lúcar ya 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.179
 relocate me as you know too 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.280
 he increased his defense stats which 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.390
 it is very good for you now that you can 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.310
 endure a little better 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.720
 and another thing that we could say about this 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.180
 new place is that it has an attack and 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.550
 university too good what it does 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.500
 that we always make sure we are more 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.910
 fast that mega cangas kan and apart we 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.310
 we could load it from a single 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.420
 combat the only bad point is that mega 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.459
 loads so you can also learn 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.440
 software point and although it would be little 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:37.450
 effective we would end up going down around 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:40.239
 90% more or less as maximum down 90 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.610
 percent because with the older we 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.350
 could cause 60 damage and with the cangas 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.330
 so small another 30 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.490
 so it is also very difficult 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.200
 try to stop this mega cangas 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.840
 carles and with this place and barely with a 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.730
 10% that we could support and not 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.300
 I'm completely sure and I say clear 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.910
 if this pokemon I already have a couple of 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.950
 whose increments the attack has 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.480
 increased nothing only so what 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.280
 we would stand in a timely 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.140
 but to talk about the second because 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.750
 it would be ferro ton 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.180
 but take a pokémon which we are going to 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.630
 count to crack not with force not with 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.360
 attacks but with objects skills and 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.340
 a special attack which would be drained 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.530
 hours that would take away 12.5 percent 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.990
 of life each turn to recover it to 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.170
 us and apart if you charge carlos pegas 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.930
 would hurt backslide by 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.680
 by the steel tip that has as 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.560
 skill and apart would be another sixth a 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.150
 sixth damage for each hit if 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.530
 we use the state helmet which 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.660
 makes that apart from that he can hit us 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.120
 little effective with most 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.620
 movements that you have in your favor 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.110
 we would have it removing more 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.880
 it's ps that could be taking us away 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.680
 to us clear we could hit 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.810
 super effective with fist increased but 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.100
 equally secretary pretty life but 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.560
 after a good increase and a 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.360
 earthquake obviously ends with broken faith 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.190
 so give me a basket as you can see is 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.100
 a monster and although this pokemon what 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.110
 can cut well good indigo trust to 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.440
 means because you may finish it if you 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.440
 it only goes earthquakes 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.680
 ok now let's talk for a while though 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:20.690
 can you count the friend too well 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.190
 cangas can but it is fair to say that this 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.520
 pokemon hides it well thanks to its 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.710
 skill and its combination of types already 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.690
 your combination of attacks that if this 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.550
 Pokemon is not going to have a single attack 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.490
 I will not serve a single attack 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.280
 to defend mega cangas here as 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.070
 you know gorg age is a pokémon type plant 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.110
 ghost and this combination does 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.480
 immune to most attacks that it has 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.120
 cangas mega kan and other ineffective 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.810
 little effective would be earthquake and it would be 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.310
 immune to retribution and hit 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.130
 increase only leaving the 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.020
 earthquake that would strike little effective 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.240
 equally with your body 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.210
 fist under low blow could hit us 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.180
 super effective and end up clear if it is not 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.800
 that's good and as everyone knows only 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.930
 I could hit them with fist increment I say 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.300
 with superimposed with low blow 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:14.030
 if we attack so here the 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:18.650
 key will never attack with war game 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:20.750
 simply use willful fire 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.030
 and drained hours and wait for them to grow 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:24.889
 die so obviously it will follow 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.509
 attacking with earthquake but what 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:28.320
 We will hold well and apart we will go 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:30.510
 recovering ps 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.310
 controllers 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:34.320
 ok now we talk about the pokemon that in 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.740
 common own opinion improved mega 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:39.600
 Cangas that would come to arrive is immune 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.790
 to most mega attacks 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.980
 cangas sings earthquake has the 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.440
 avoidance fist increase and retribution 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.180
 it is immune ghost positive only 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.410
 that giving him the blow down so what 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.240
 what we are going to do is wait for us 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.430
 make a hit down since that is the only thing 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.760
 with what you can hit us 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.290
 and use disabled or in Spanish I think 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.090
 that is called cancellation not to give 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.010
 this attack and he only had left 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.960
 will be the other three who we are 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:07.470
 immune being able to attack without any 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:10.800
 problem with a focus I tell you with a 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.570
 no gas bulbs with an accurate wave and 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.420
 I will have many wonder what 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.340
 it serves 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:17.960
 with you will make mega cangas change these 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:22.320
 heights of the game already when he was shot 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:24.870
 Well, if he was bathed in pokemon 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.670
 showdown pokemones mogon logo deny it 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.220
 I'm banning but that does not mean that 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:31.920
 you can continue using and continue being 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:35.610
 used in random battles in the 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:37.380
 cross 10 in vgc there can still be 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.750
 used since nintendo has never 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.850
 banned so they can equally 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.610
 find someone in the tri 10 that 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.490
 is connected by internet that does not follow 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:49.290
 the rules of smog or not are not 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.970
 well he does mg and he can 

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.280
 use without any problem since if 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:55.020
 Nintendo does not bathe him and he can follow 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:56.910
 but equally but using 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.830
 you see, they have four here 

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:00.540
 perfect ways to buy it 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.580
 better than others and at least in the 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:05.040
 personal opinion the pokemon that best 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.390
 poses would avenge and well here I 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.150
 I would like to ask you if you have 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:11.390
 some other 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:13.070
 another way of telling it and if they have if the 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:14.690
 have please I would appreciate it very much 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.980
 leave it in the comments 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.840
 I would also like to thank you 

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.720
 too much to those people who do not 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.970
