00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello very good like vato kids here 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.759
 are and commenting on a gameplay of 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.269
 white 2 but that's not the topic of today 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:13.170
 logically because now between the good 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.450
 the night of February 20 and in the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.640
 early morning of February 21 sony ha 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.529
 presented his playstation 4 no 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.970
 physically rather just the command 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.779
 let's say what the component is 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.939
 physical hardware but we've had the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.920
 opportunity to know much more about 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.940
 playstation 4 thanks to the 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.560
 conference that has had sony 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.390
 the truth is that there are a lot of points 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.530
 interesting that I want to highlight about 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.360
 everything I would like to talk a little too 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.630
 of the games and what I have been 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.440
 seemed above all more entertaining and 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.540
 good 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.790
 I tried to see the truth the conference 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.400
 live from the internet not a 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.400
 livestream but in the end I could not start 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.320
 to see him for a while and started to get to 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.150
 see a lot that between that was going 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.830
 shortening the image a little bit 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.930
 moment that completely stopped at all 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:02.300
 the world or the same little then 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.000
 well I said then yes for this better 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.740
 I wait for the next morning and I see it 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.360
 whole and point you have what I have done 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.640
 apart from informing me reading news 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.290
 etcetera so it was pretty much I'm 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.570
 a little bit aware about good looks 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.970
 as we are here in this area I am a 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.070
 little in created more or less than of many 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.590
 things then things to highlight good 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.390
 the control of playstation 4 is called 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.860
 current are four has a screen 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.140
 tactile in the center if I'm not mistaken 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.210
 It also has six sensors and they come with 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.060
 a camera also where you can 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.770
 record things live and teach them to 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.940
 your friends because the playstation has 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.570
 opted, let's say 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.310
 goes a bit let's say in the direction 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.870
 socialize that is a console that does not 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.210
 be just for fun but for 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.010
 also be very creative and the same 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.690
 way you can share all things 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.340
 What do you do with your friends 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.170
 there will also be networking applications 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.380
 social et cetera until the 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.330
 playstation let's say it's focused for 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.920
 that all friends share 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.590
 information and so on we carry more 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.070
 globalized 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.359
 good to say it in a way and the 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.700
 truth is that I found it very interesting 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:09.769
 all the things they have said has also 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.420
 presented quite a few games between 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.580
 some franchises that we already know that 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.340
 are on facebook that the truth that 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.450
 It looks pretty good and if not 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.950
 you have set, there are many 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.239
 trailers already out there or you can 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.799
 found on the page itself 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.720
 playstation that I am subscribed that you 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.180
 I recommend that you subscribe jce because 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.920
 let's also say that all the news 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.049
 publish them as ye enterareis and 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.849
 especially now with the pop this 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.470
 of the news of playstation 4 of 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.860
 all of us, we all talk to each other 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.079
 from several days before that was going to be the 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.220
 conference about playstation 4 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.690
 then he recommended that he subscribe his 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.760
 channel because they have put so many 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.680
 trailers of each game between them then 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.239
 that the ife and coarse that the truth that 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.530
 It looks very good I'm going to stand out 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.430
 those who call me the most 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.890
 Attention 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.140
 then what's box forgive me that I have 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:59.420
 Leaving little reziqat watch 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.060
 but hey it's a game let's say the 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.990
 that you control the city by means of 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.490
 the hacking of electronics 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.930
 in positive studies mobile and with that 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.250
 you control so many things then 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.500
 it is also a game that has very good 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.550
 paints the truth is that I do not know to me to 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.140
 first sight it seems a little 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.140
 complicated with so many applications and 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.120
 answer so many things like that the time and 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.590
 bonds and a preservation is served 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.570
 was to get before situation has found 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.640
 the electronic traffic lights controlling 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.780
 trains security cameras and so on 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.460
 It seems a bit complicated but 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.060
 surely I do not think that then it is 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.930
 this will be a little bit of the trick and not 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.220
 that game because it also seems very 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.710
 stressful that will come out for 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.500
 playstation 3 for playstation 4 and the 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.500
 rest of platforms also the 360 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.340
 and also other games like for example 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.569
 the 15 it is leaned dufol I think it was in the 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.519
 how good is a bit about the 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.659
 story that the planet if not me 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:52.569
 The two factions are wrong 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:55.190
 divided and you are a kind of 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.019
 guardian let's say that week since it 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.269
 Keeps order in order 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.269
 between those buildings between those three 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.170
 we also have another game that has me 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.860
 a lot of attention that is called 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:14.989
 bryce drive down or something like that was in 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:19.579
 medieval type plan I think I like it 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:21.410
 the sky the two have a let's say a 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.330
 similar environment then for this 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.820
 it also caught my attention and then 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.070
 others also as destiny that is one 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.500
 so lately he's calling us a 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.450
 little attention let's say it has been done 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.010
 a little bit famous so suddenly that 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.200
 it will be a kind of shooter in the first 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.960
 person focused rather on 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.940
 multiplayer and the witcher that only 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.860
 they follow puzzle plan etc. and other 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.169
 that we also go a lot to believe that 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.700
 it was the medieval game that offers 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.100
 now just that I just remembered not 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.840
 it was folk root or what I would have said was 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.910
 deep down is what it is although it is 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.370
 games was depth something fine 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:57.770
 deep because it will be 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.570
 morras etcetera with dragons and there 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.460
 trailers and to the truth that is very very 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.320
 well and another game to my eyes 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.979
 awesome is one that is called drive 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.660
 flop 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.210
 created by the creators of the storm engine 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:10.820
 thousand buttons is also happy let's go 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.650
 this one always but I bought it I came 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.320
 with playstation 34 they comprise 2 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.639
 if I'm not wrong and awesome everyone 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.930
 the three games that pulls a lot this 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.820
 although this is already completely 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.440
 different to the buttons since also 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.970
 it's another name is completely 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.060
 different only that they are the same 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.190
 creators and this reminds me more of the great 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.740
 tourism so this number 5 as 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.449
 call do not ever buy it but let's go 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.639
 that's how the car graphics 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.169
 by impressive roads so 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:38.030
 are before that game we will enjoy about 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.130
 super realistic graphics already both inside 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.050
 car racing and off 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.280
 Landscapes saw that that game is going to be 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.050
 very interesting and most likely that 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.310
 I bought it because games so 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.120
 Realistic racing has always 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:53.000
 delighted and more or less has been to talk 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.770
 a little bit about the games also that 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.240
 many times we were thinking 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.919
 in which there would be no second-hand games 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.270
 that would take them away because they are not and has 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:04.160
 affirmed that it will be possible to play games 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.289
 second hand since it is something that 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.060
 we the consumers arrived that 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:09.440
 we make a lot of use of them we do not 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.240
 we buy second- hand games and 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.580
 we try 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.470
 we also rent to play with them 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.060
 although it is most likely that it is a 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.500
 multiplayer game I think you dream of 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:21.569
 what the latter have been doing 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.449
 with some last ones like battlefield 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:26.130
 fifa et cetera which is in plan if you 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:28.139
 second-hand shopping other than following 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:31.400
 is by multiple will have a kind of 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:34.349
 base that allows you because if not 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.240
 we come to them they are not either 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:37.620
 you can keep going games games and 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.599
 everyone will be able to multiplayer is 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.520
 good is usually a benefit 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:43.500
 Nor is it much of a problem but hey I 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.900
 I'm not complaining about that either, I 'm happy 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.940
 that they have put second hand more 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.800
 or less enjoyed a little we're going from all 

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:53.490
 this information rather than videogames 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:56.069
 a bit of the side of the play of 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:57.840
 these characteristics of the of the 

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:59.759
 playstation 4 and I will also leave you in the 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:02.789
 description the characteristics let's say 

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:03.870
 of software and ram and so on 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:05.759
 processors and so on 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:07.740
 the playstation 4 that is already all 

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:10.440
 unveiled so they want to take a 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:11.970
 look understand then great and also 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:14.130
 page a page where you will find 

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.780
 you do not have many of the playstation 4 

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:17.370
 so nothing kids I hope you've 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.700
 enjoyed this example and remind me 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:19.050
 like
