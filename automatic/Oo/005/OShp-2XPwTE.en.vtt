00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.150 

okay<00:02:46.940> so<00:02:47.940> as<00:02:48.270> you<00:02:48.330> can<00:02:48.570> see<00:02:49.020> you<00:02:49.440> still<00:02:49.500> have

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
okay so as you can see you still have

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.580 
okay so as you can see you still have
kind<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:50.820> like<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.120> Lauren<00:02:51.510> Conrad<00:02:51.990> braid<00:02:52.350> but

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
kind of like the Lauren Conrad braid but

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.620 
kind of like the Lauren Conrad braid but
without<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:53.100> braid<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.610> it's<00:02:54.240> so<00:02:54.480> much

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
without the braid and it's so much

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.110 
without the braid and it's so much
simpler<00:02:54.960> the<00:02:55.440> back<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.890> just<00:02:56.100> a<00:02:56.280> little<00:02:56.550> twisty

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
simpler the back is just a little twisty

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.490 
simpler the back is just a little twisty
bun<00:02:57.330> so<00:02:58.070> that's<00:02:59.070> another<00:02:59.430> great<00:02:59.880> look<00:03:00.180> because

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
bun so that's another great look because

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.020 
bun so that's another great look because
everything<00:03:01.500> is<00:03:01.620> basically<00:03:02.040> tightly<00:03:02.790> held

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
everything is basically tightly held

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.720 
everything is basically tightly held
back<00:03:03.390> in<00:03:03.660> a<00:03:03.750> nice<00:03:04.020> braided<00:03:04.440> bun<00:03:04.770> with<00:03:05.400> a<00:03:05.430> nice

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.340 
back in a nice braided bun with a nice
twist<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.480> good<00:03:06.660> thing<00:03:06.840> about<00:03:06.900> this<00:03:07.170> is

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
twist and the good thing about this is

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.500 
twist and the good thing about this is
