wintertime<00:01:01.269> sorry<00:01:02.229> for<00:01:02.350> you<00:01:02.440> guys<00:01:02.589> up<00:01:02.830> north

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
wintertime sorry for you guys up north

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:04.410 
wintertime sorry for you guys up north
where<00:01:03.339> it's<00:01:03.460> real<00:01:03.580> cold<00:01:03.790> and<00:01:04.000> you<00:01:04.089> can't<00:01:04.269> do

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
where it's real cold and you can't do

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.700 
where it's real cold and you can't do
this<00:01:04.540> kind<00:01:04.750> of<00:01:04.780> thing<00:01:04.960> but<00:01:05.439> it's<00:01:05.590> beautiful

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
this kind of thing but it's beautiful

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.219 
this kind of thing but it's beautiful
down<00:01:06.040> here<00:01:06.360> anyway<00:01:07.360> I've<00:01:07.570> never<00:01:07.780> tried<00:01:08.049> this

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
down here anyway I've never tried this

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.850 
down here anyway I've never tried this
before<00:01:08.380> with<00:01:08.939> such<00:01:09.939> a<00:01:09.970> powerful<00:01:10.750> motor<00:01:11.080> and<00:01:11.770> a

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
before with such a powerful motor and a

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.770 
before with such a powerful motor and a
little<00:01:12.070> prop<00:01:12.280> but<00:01:12.909> in<00:01:13.030> my<00:01:13.119> opinion<00:01:13.479> a<00:01:13.570> plane

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
little prop but in my opinion a plane

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.679 
little prop but in my opinion a plane
that<00:01:13.900> looks<00:01:14.110> fast<00:01:14.380> should<00:01:14.979> fly<00:01:15.220> fast<00:01:15.520> and<00:01:15.820> I'm

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
that looks fast should fly fast and I'm

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:17.850 
that looks fast should fly fast and I'm
hoping<00:01:17.020> for<00:01:17.079> a<00:01:17.200> hundred<00:01:17.439> miles<00:01:17.560> per<00:01:17.740> hour

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
hoping for a hundred miles per hour

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.740 
hoping for a hundred miles per hour
we'll<00:01:18.130> see<00:01:18.280> how<00:01:18.369> she<00:01:18.400> does<00:01:18.549> unfortunately<00:01:19.270> I

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
we'll see how she does unfortunately I

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.740 
we'll see how she does unfortunately I
don't<00:01:19.840> have<00:01:20.020> a<00:01:20.170> radar<00:01:20.560> gun<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:22.479> we'll<00:01:22.630> just

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
don't have a radar gun so we'll just

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.170 
don't have a radar gun so we'll just
have<00:01:22.840> to<00:01:22.960> guess<00:01:23.170> but<00:01:24.130> this<00:01:24.549> should<00:01:24.820> go<00:01:24.909> a<00:01:24.939> lot

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
have to guess but this should go a lot

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.280 
have to guess but this should go a lot
faster<00:01:25.450> today<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:28.270> plane's<00:01:28.600> wings<00:01:29.020> are

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
faster today the plane's wings are

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.480 
faster today the plane's wings are
straight<00:01:29.560> this<00:01:29.799> time<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:33.040> winds<00:01:33.340> aren't

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
straight this time and the winds aren't

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.610 
straight this time and the winds aren't
so<00:01:33.729> bad<00:01:33.880> there's<00:01:34.149> a<00:01:34.180> little<00:01:34.390> bit<00:01:34.479> of<00:01:34.570> wind<00:01:34.720> if

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
so bad there's a little bit of wind if

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.580 
so bad there's a little bit of wind if
we<00:01:35.770> end<00:01:35.890> up<00:01:35.950> having<00:01:36.010> torque<00:01:36.490> roll<00:01:36.670> this<00:01:36.880> time

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
we end up having torque roll this time

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.780 
we end up having torque roll this time
I'll<00:01:38.590> know<00:01:38.830> that<00:01:38.860> it's<00:01:39.130> not<00:01:39.250> because<00:01:39.310> of<00:01:39.610> the

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
I'll know that it's not because of the

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.219 
I'll know that it's not because of the
wing<00:01:39.940> being<00:01:40.120> twisted<00:01:40.570> it's<00:01:40.720> because<00:01:41.020> of<00:01:41.170> the

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
wing being twisted it's because of the

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:42.690 
wing being twisted it's because of the
torque<00:01:41.470> roll<00:01:41.680> so<00:01:41.890> hopefully<00:01:42.310> we<00:01:42.370> won't<00:01:42.490> have

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
torque roll so hopefully we won't have

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:57.790 
torque roll so hopefully we won't have
any<00:01:42.880> of<00:01:42.909> that<00:01:43.000> we'll<00:01:43.240> see<00:01:43.420> how<00:01:43.540> she<00:01:43.570> goes

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:09.350 

alright<00:01:58.800> guys<00:01:58.950> here<00:01:59.160> we<00:01:59.250> go<00:02:08.030> no<00:02:09.030> trimming

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
alright guys here we go no trimming

00:02:09.360 --> 00:03:35.000 
alright guys here we go no trimming
required<00:02:18.620> roll

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.230 

quite<00:03:36.010> a<00:03:36.040> hundred<00:03:36.190> miles<00:03:36.460> per<00:03:36.640> hour<00:03:36.760> but<00:03:37.030> it's

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:37.240 
quite a hundred miles per hour but it's

00:03:37.240 --> 00:05:28.930 
quite a hundred miles per hour but it's
definitely<00:03:37.420> fast

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.460 

hahaha<00:05:29.940> that<00:05:30.890> was<00:05:31.890> really<00:05:32.310> awesome
