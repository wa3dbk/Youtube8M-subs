of<00:01:15.479> things<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.840> happen<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.530> do<00:01:17.130> see<00:01:17.400> myself

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
of things to happen so I do see myself

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.609 
of things to happen so I do see myself
going<00:01:17.909> fairly<00:01:18.210> high<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:19.170> just<00:01:19.320> a<00:01:19.380> matter<00:01:19.530> of

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
going fairly high it's just a matter of

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.810 
going fairly high it's just a matter of
one<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.860> those<00:01:19.950> teams<00:01:20.159> that's<00:01:20.460> falling<00:01:20.729> in

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
one of those teams that's falling in

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.219 
one of those teams that's falling in
love<00:01:21.000> with<00:01:21.030> me<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.390> think<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:22.049> about

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
love with me and I think it's about

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.719 
love with me and I think it's about
three<00:01:22.470> or<00:01:22.530> four<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.799> them<00:01:22.920> who<00:01:23.070> have<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.700> know

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
three or four of them who have you know

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.550 
three or four of them who have you know
so<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.060> think<00:01:24.119> one<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.420> them<00:01:24.630> will<00:01:25.290> go<00:01:25.350> ahead<00:01:25.409> and

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
so I think one of them will go ahead and

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.340 
so I think one of them will go ahead and
pull<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.740> trigger<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:26.070> Thursday<00:01:26.990> that<00:01:27.990> was<00:01:28.080> EJ

players that have played with EJ Manuel

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.430 
players that have played with EJ Manuel
just<00:02:11.879> speak<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.209> world<00:02:12.569> often<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.080> kind<00:02:13.319> of

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
just speak the world often the kind of

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.350 
just speak the world often the kind of
he<00:02:13.770> is<00:02:13.860> in<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.100> locker<00:02:14.340> room<00:02:14.550> in<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:15.150> huddle

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
he is in the locker room in the huddle

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.600 
he is in the locker room in the huddle
and<00:02:15.570> I<00:02:15.630> think<00:02:15.900> NFL<00:02:16.650> teams<00:02:16.890> are<00:02:17.070> realizing<00:02:17.550> that

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
and I think NFL teams are realizing that

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.610 
and I think NFL teams are realizing that
it's<00:02:17.790> not<00:02:17.940> always<00:02:18.180> going<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.510> be<00:02:18.600> about<00:02:19.170> being

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
it's not always going to be about being

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.280 
it's not always going to be about being
65<00:02:20.250> although<00:02:20.640> he<00:02:20.850> has<00:02:20.970> got<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> height<00:02:21.690> but

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
65 although he has got the height but

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.960 
65 although he has got the height but
you<00:02:22.560> know<00:02:22.680> that<00:02:22.890> they've<00:02:23.070> gambled<00:02:23.610> on<00:02:23.730> some

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
you know that they've gambled on some

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.400 
you know that they've gambled on some
guys<00:02:24.150> that<00:02:24.360> have<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.660> potential<00:02:25.080> at<00:02:25.320> the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
guys that have the potential at the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.260 
guys that have the potential at the
quarterback<00:02:25.710> position<00:02:25.910> but<00:02:26.910> not<00:02:27.090> the

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
quarterback position but not the

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:28.850 
quarterback position but not the
leadership<00:02:27.780> qualities<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.410> the<00:02:28.500> character

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
leadership qualities and the character

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.710 
leadership qualities and the character
qualities<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.340> it's<00:02:29.670> backfired<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.390> think

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
qualities and it's backfired and I think

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.350 
qualities and it's backfired and I think
EJ<00:02:31.050> Manuel<00:02:31.680> luckily<00:02:32.070> for<00:02:32.220> him<00:02:32.370> possesses<00:02:33.210> both

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
EJ Manuel luckily for him possesses both

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.180 
EJ Manuel luckily for him possesses both
of<00:02:33.570> those<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:34.140> I<00:02:34.170> would<00:02:34.380> not<00:02:34.530> be<00:02:34.680> surprised<00:02:35.070> if

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
of those so I would not be surprised if

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.920 
of those so I would not be surprised if
he<00:02:35.310> sneaks<00:02:35.610> into<00:02:35.820> that<00:02:36.030> first<00:02:36.300> round<00:02:36.540> another

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
he sneaks into that first round another

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.020 
he sneaks into that first round another
acc<00:02:37.410> quarterback<00:02:37.860> from<00:02:38.160> Virginia<00:02:38.640> actually

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.210 
stride into his throws more I think he's
probably<00:04:24.960> going<00:04:25.229> to<00:04:25.289> be<00:04:25.380> a<00:04:25.410> late<00:04:25.680> first<00:04:25.979> or<00:04:26.190> a

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
probably going to be a late first or a

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:27.020 
probably going to be a late first or a
high<00:04:26.400> second

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
high second

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.640 
high second
founder<00:04:27.270> I<00:04:27.480> think<00:04:27.990> when<00:04:28.110> you<00:04:28.200> look<00:04:28.230> at<00:04:28.470> Mike

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
founder I think when you look at Mike

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.620 
founder I think when you look at Mike
Glennon<00:04:29.160> you<00:04:29.610> see<00:04:29.820> a<00:04:29.850> guy<00:04:30.060> that<00:04:30.270> yes<00:04:30.420> he's

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
Glennon you see a guy that yes he's

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.390 
Glennon you see a guy that yes he's
limited<00:04:30.930> in<00:04:31.230> terms<00:04:31.350> of<00:04:31.590> his<00:04:31.740> ability<00:04:31.770> to<00:04:32.250> make

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
limited in terms of his ability to make

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.430 
limited in terms of his ability to make
plays<00:04:32.610> with<00:04:32.910> his<00:04:33.030> feet<00:04:33.120> but<00:04:33.750> he's<00:04:33.810> got<00:04:34.050> the<00:04:34.139> arm

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
plays with his feet but he's got the arm

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.830 
plays with his feet but he's got the arm
to<00:04:34.800> make<00:04:35.130> every<00:04:35.669> throw<00:04:35.700> and<00:04:36.210> when<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:36.360> watch<00:04:36.690> him

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
to make every throw and when I watch him

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.440 
to make every throw and when I watch him
back<00:04:36.990> to<00:04:37.139> get<00:04:37.320> reminded<00:04:37.710> a<00:04:37.800> lot<00:04:38.040> of<00:04:38.220> Matt<00:04:38.430> a<00:04:39.030> guy

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
back to get reminded a lot of Matt a guy

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.150 
back to get reminded a lot of Matt a guy
who<00:04:39.510> makes<00:04:39.900> a<00:04:40.050> lot<00:04:40.200> of<00:04:40.230> plays<00:04:40.500> but<00:04:40.980> will<00:04:41.130> also

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
who makes a lot of plays but will also

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.340 
who makes a lot of plays but will also
make<00:04:41.669> some<00:04:41.970> mistakes<00:04:42.389> by<00:04:42.600> forcing<00:04:43.139> some

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
make some mistakes by forcing some

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.080 
make some mistakes by forcing some
passes<00:04:43.770> I<00:04:43.919> think<00:04:44.310> Glenn<00:04:44.550> is<00:04:44.730> probably<00:04:44.970> going

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
passes I think Glenn is probably going

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.110 
passes I think Glenn is probably going
to<00:04:45.180> be<00:04:45.270> a<00:04:45.300> second<00:04:45.720> round<00:04:45.900> choice
