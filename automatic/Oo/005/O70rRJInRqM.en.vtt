00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.729 
really hard to hold on to them because
my<00:00:38.850> fingers<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.329> pushing<00:00:40.050> really<00:00:40.379> close<00:00:40.559> to

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
my fingers just pushing really close to

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.190 
my fingers just pushing really close to
the<00:00:40.829> wood<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:42.570> was<00:00:42.690> going<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.899> cost<00:00:43.020> an

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
the wood so it was going to cost an

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.540 
the wood so it was going to cost an
absolute<00:00:43.290> fortune<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:44.070> get<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.370> reef<00:00:44.550> raided

absolute fortune to get that reef raided
and<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.700> actually<00:00:48.090> cheaper<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.950> get<00:00:49.950> a<00:00:50.010> new

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
and it's actually cheaper to get a new

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.029 
and it's actually cheaper to get a new
warm<00:00:50.370> off<00:00:50.520> neck<00:00:50.870> made<00:00:51.870> up<00:00:52.050> then<00:00:52.500> get<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> refresh

like on there they're not shiny it's

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.730 
like on there they're not shiny it's
like<00:02:05.490> a<00:02:05.520> matte<00:02:05.880> finish<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.509> fret<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:07.020> I'd

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
like a matte finish on the fret so I'd

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.410 
like a matte finish on the fret so I'd
say<00:02:08.009> that's<00:02:08.250> going<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.489> have<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.759> come<00:02:08.940> off<00:02:09.119> so

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
say that's going to have to come off so

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.630 
say that's going to have to come off so
they're<00:02:10.410> going<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.590> need<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.739> be<00:02:10.920> polished<00:02:11.340> and

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
they're going to need to be polished and

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.320 
they're going to need to be polished and
also<00:02:12.390> some<00:02:13.050> of<00:02:13.080> these<00:02:13.260> edges

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
also some of these edges

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.440 
also some of these edges
we'll<00:02:15.330> probably<00:02:15.540> need<00:02:15.810> to<00:02:15.990> be<00:02:16.910> you<00:02:17.910> know<00:02:18.030> filed

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
we'll probably need to be you know filed

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.150 
we'll probably need to be you know filed
down<00:02:18.720> because<00:02:19.230> I<00:02:19.440> think<00:02:19.590> they're<00:02:19.980> just

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
down because I think they're just

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.180 
down because I think they're just
they're<00:02:20.910> sticking<00:02:21.300> out<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.450> bit<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:22.130> you<00:02:23.130> know

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
they're sticking out a bit so you know

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.040 
they're sticking out a bit so you know
scrapes<00:02:23.520> your<00:02:23.670> hand<00:02:23.880> when<00:02:24.060> you<00:02:24.150> go<00:02:24.240> by<00:02:24.420> but<00:02:25.020> I

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
mean you know other than that it's

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.400 
mean you know other than that it's
pretty<00:02:27.060> good<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.950> finish<00:02:29.250> on<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.520> neck<00:02:29.730> is<00:02:30.000> a

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
pretty good the finish on the neck is a

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.310
