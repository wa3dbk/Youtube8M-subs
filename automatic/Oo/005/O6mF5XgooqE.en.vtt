00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 the case work is not even good if it 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.030
 they ask why I'm up above 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:12.179
 a building honestly I do not either 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.770
 I know I was flying with a helicopter and 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:19.080
 I lost the propellers so it was a demanding and 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:21.390
 I miss not those times that you fly 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.000
 so watching around you and crystals 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.350
 for something do not turn to see and price 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.170
 you lose the helicopter and you stay 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.670
 stuck up the roof yes but as 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.239
 it is because I have to get out of here not 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.210
 obviously to begin with not with the video 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.370
 not what I'm going to teach you already 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.379
 what they came and is that something came 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.329
 if you do not get caught and well finally what 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.899
 I got what good that a kind and humble 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.539
 lady was lent to help me not me 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.899
 he lent his car this man is very kind 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.170
 the truth did lend itself to lend me his 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.180
 car and then I have it well maybe 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.660
 do not be so kind to play like me 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.880
 I thought it was true 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.360
 rays now I'll have to hide 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.280
 some days maybe but well then in 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.410
 this grand teton 25 video online 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.750
 now the video officially begins 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.820
 that comes to my apartment to whatever 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.700
 on the server I will show you a 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.920
 secret a reference to the big one 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.150
 up to car 4 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.070
 how good is a reference like that to 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.890
 liberty city which is more or less the same 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.830
 and by the way you already saw this painting or 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.360
 it is something magnificent has never given 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.979
 account in these things these paintings 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.380
 also the paintings from there saw them 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.080
 you as very artistic this 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.300
 department has many things as you see 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.430
 there it has some artistic things but 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.210
 good because I tell you all this is 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.430
 artistic medium as you know when you 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.410
 you buy this department where you 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.950
 online before you buy it in the 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:54.770
 purchase message tells the owner 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.509
 this one went away so it just went 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.330
 was and how was he so millionaire 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.479
 I do not leave all the furniture here 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.119
 and that made me think something very very 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.290
 curious because they said that the owner 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.940
 old had 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.759
 I had never seen the kitchen I do not know if 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.260
 you noticed that this place this 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.480
 department had kitchen because it's the 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.760
 first time I see that the department 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.800
 has kitchen that is the first one writes 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.470
 the kitchen of this department and then 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.300
 that one that can be good as they 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.090
 they said they said the old owner had 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.840
 so much money that he left put furnished 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.990
 no and this made me think of one thing not 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.780
 because who else or who else has the most 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.340
 a lot of money and it goes without warning like this 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.430
 as if from nothing he does not sell the almost goes 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.310
 so we go to this location here 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.650
 as you see here is the liberty book 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.590
 city there is no book of I wanted liberty 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.000
 city ​​pop art well so maybe this 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.410
 someone's department like that 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.510
 like art or there more or less what 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.820
 he likes to have here the good atmosphere and 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.370
 he had a book of the liberty city not 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.890
 like pop art that pop art itself 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.720
 they do not know it is like an art that is 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.670
 use as well as in comics or when 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.590
 do as some caricature as of 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.360
 some popular announcement something that comes out in 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.950
 the newspaper is not able to search for 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.590
 google order and they will leave this 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.780
 images and they go to sleep but 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.120
 They are like comic drawings, not like a 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.459
 book of photos but then in caricature and 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.980
 well here we also have another book and 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.290
 this made me think something because I eat 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.629
 in gta 5 they want you to see that book 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.430
 because what idiot is bought twice the 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:30.879
 same good book in fact three books 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.590
 there is this a third book somewhere else 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.000
 I will also teach him but here 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.410
 Well, we have this book, not the liberty 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.200
 pop art also this book of 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.910
 perfume that is a book of this book of 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.260
 done if there is a book that is 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.230
 flame perfume is indeed a movie 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.079
 I will also take out this movie not like 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.420
 the history of approximate chamba tist 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:52.010
 something like that and so perfume as well as killed 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.349
 people and this file is cool they should 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.640
 see that movie is like this if you raffle and 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.440
 good if we get off here in our 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.030
 fourth let's find the third book 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.379
 good if they have this department if not 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.120
 they have it from everyone here is the 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.610
 good video since we went down to the room 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.530
 to us until here to the bottom and we 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.450
 let's find the third book there 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.480
 this liberty city pop art also there 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.209
 there are the same books and I repeat again 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.310
 what before that idiot is bought the 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.740
 same book three times are not 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.170
 left 

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.370
 three times and this makes me think 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.460
 strongly that this department was of 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.730
 niko bellic of gta 4 because then not to be 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.620
 a millionaire this left as the house well 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.090
 as furnished they say criminals 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.800
 they have to be like moving 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:37.280
 quickly because then if not the 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.410
 they catch and all that is liberty city and 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.210
 well I do not know or be a millionaire liberty 

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.850
 city and leave the furniture fast was like that 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.620
 as something very strange not and as you know in 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.090
 the end of gta 4 good I do not know what final 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.880
 have done but in the end when 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.710
 they kill Roman you know what time 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.570
 then your wife speaks to you of roman 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.330
 or the brownie ccoo and he says to hey no 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.400
 Well, I 'm going to have a son and only 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.810
 say so do not worry do not tell your 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.180
 son who is not going to have to worry 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.070
 not for nothing that is I'm here wool 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.760
 well so that someone does not worry 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.010
 for nothing, never 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.020
 I suppose you must have a lot of money 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.210
 and then I do not know if this house was the same 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.280
 nikko as well as he suddenly came not 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.590
 hide and leave it there furnished for 

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:17.480
 go somewhere else and leave it out there the 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.280
 books I had from liberty city ​​but 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.840
 well that would be all for this video 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.320
 not what you think is interesting enough 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.240
 it's not all then the books of freedom 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.120
 and the house until he left it and I believe in 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.640
 millionaire, do not give us the opinion that 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.990
 look like that because nothing else that would be 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.910
 I hope you liked it, thank you 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.270
 for watching this video and until next time 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.270
 neighborhood 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.280
 I'm sorry I had to say that
