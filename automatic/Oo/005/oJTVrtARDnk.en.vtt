again maybe one two twice for play three
would<00:05:08.100> work<00:05:08.340> out<00:05:08.520> well<00:05:09.030> for<00:05:09.360> you<00:05:09.570> but<00:05:10.230> ask<00:05:10.500> for

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
would work out well for you but ask for

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
continuous over and over again but I

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.230 
continuous over and over again but I
don't<00:05:13.380> know<00:05:13.500> if<00:05:13.680> this<00:05:13.860> here<00:05:14.070> would<00:05:14.310> be<00:05:14.520> in<00:05:14.790> that

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
don't know if this here would be in that

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.780 
don't know if this here would be in that

to do the camera view definitely is not
the<00:05:43.230> greatest<00:05:43.530> but<00:05:44.040> I've<00:05:44.310> seen<00:05:44.520> much<00:05:44.850> worse<00:05:45.260> so

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
the greatest but I've seen much worse so

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.410 
the greatest but I've seen much worse so
on<00:05:46.650> a<00:05:46.710> scale<00:05:47.280> of<00:05:48.920> it<00:05:49.920> being<00:05:50.280> super<00:05:50.730> generic

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
on a scale of it being super generic

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.380 
on a scale of it being super generic
they<00:05:51.930> do<00:05:51.990> look<00:05:52.860> like<00:05:53.100> they<00:05:53.310> at<00:05:53.460> least<00:05:53.640> put<00:05:54.000> some

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
they do look like they at least put some

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.550 
they do look like they at least put some
time<00:05:54.750> and<00:05:54.990> effort<00:05:55.350> into<00:05:55.530> this<00:05:55.830> making<00:05:56.610> it<00:05:56.700> an

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
time and effort into this making it an

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.650 
time and effort into this making it an
exceptional<00:05:58.560> movie<00:05:58.920> based<00:05:59.130> game<00:05:59.430> rather<00:06:00.270> than

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
exceptional movie based game rather than

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:07.660 
exceptional movie based game rather than
just<00:06:01.290> a<00:06:01.410> regular<00:06:01.680> generic<00:06:02.100> fine<00:06:03.620> so<00:06:05.630> overall

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:07.670 
just a regular generic fine so overall

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.630 
just a regular generic fine so overall
this<00:06:08.670> is<00:06:08.730> a<00:06:08.910> good<00:06:09.330> game<00:06:09.660> it's<00:06:10.440> a<00:06:10.650> fun<00:06:10.980> game<00:06:11.280> with

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:11.640 
this is a good game it's a fun game with

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.120 
this is a good game it's a fun game with
many<00:06:11.910> different<00:06:12.210> challenges<00:06:12.600> and<00:06:13.200> involved

really want to pick this up honestly if
it<00:06:19.410> was<00:06:19.590> me<00:06:19.770> I<00:06:19.800> wouldn't<00:06:20.460> pay<00:06:20.970> too<00:06:21.030> much<00:06:21.350> money

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.350 
it was me I wouldn't pay too much money

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.560 
it was me I wouldn't pay too much money
for<00:06:22.680> it<00:06:22.740> as<00:06:22.980> I<00:06:23.430> would<00:06:23.610> only<00:06:23.790> play<00:06:24.090> through<00:06:24.360> it<00:06:24.510> a

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:24.570 
for it as I would only play through it a

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:27.110 
for it as I would only play through it a
couple<00:06:24.780> times<00:06:25.050> but<00:06:25.920> it<00:06:26.160> can<00:06:26.430> provide<00:06:26.610> some

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
couple times but it can provide some

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.090 
couple times but it can provide some
pretty<00:06:27.330> good<00:06:27.540> entertainment

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
pretty good entertainment

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.160 
pretty good entertainment
the<00:06:29.970> result<00:06:30.420> as<00:06:30.690> fourscore<00:06:31.620> I<00:06:31.650> would<00:06:32.130> say

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.170 
the result as fourscore I would say

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:37.640 
the result as fourscore I would say
probably<00:06:34.170> a<00:06:34.620> seven<00:06:35.370> out<00:06:36.210> of<00:06:36.270> ten<00:06:36.650> honestly

being<00:06:38.490> a<00:06:38.760> generic<00:06:39.360> game<00:06:39.540> makes<00:06:40.410> it<00:06:40.620> a<00:06:40.830> bit

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 
being a generic game makes it a bit

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:47.510 
being a generic game makes it a bit
boring<00:06:41.670> and<00:06:42.330> tedious<00:06:43.200> at<00:06:43.770> times<00:06:43.800> but<00:06:45.950> it<00:06:46.950> is

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 
boring and tedious at times but it is

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.990 
boring and tedious at times but it is
still<00:06:47.940> fun<00:06:48.000> it<00:06:48.750> is<00:06:49.080> still<00:06:49.380> playable<00:06:49.800> and<00:06:50.280> it

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 
still fun it is still playable and it

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.020 
still fun it is still playable and it
would<00:06:51.240> be<00:06:51.330> great<00:06:51.600> for<00:06:51.930> any<00:06:52.220> children<00:06:53.220> or<00:06:53.580> fans

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:54.030 
would be great for any children or fans

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:57.950 
would be great for any children or fans
of<00:06:54.270> Kung<00:06:54.480> Fu<00:06:54.510> Panda<00:06:54.800> um<00:06:56.390> even<00:06:57.390> though<00:06:57.510> anyone

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 
of Kung Fu Panda um even though anyone

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.630 
of Kung Fu Panda um even though anyone
can<00:06:58.140> play<00:06:58.350> it<00:06:58.590> this<00:06:58.740> would<00:06:58.950> probably<00:06:59.160> appeal

00:06:59.630 --> 00:06:59.640 
can play it this would probably appeal

00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:07.160 
can play it this would probably appeal
more<00:06:59.970> to<00:07:00.030> children<00:07:00.630> than<00:07:00.780> anything<00:07:01.050> else<00:07:06.170> so
