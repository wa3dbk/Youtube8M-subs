00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.570
 ah 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.220
 very good that cold I say that I am the 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.520
 problem that we have in cÃ¡diz is that 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.380
 here the cold is a very wet cold 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.810
 then clear by how much geek 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.430
 it clears you to the bone is a problem 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.520
 there is another place where it is much colder 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:33.940
 but you warm us and it 's a cold 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.340
 dry much healthier here is that of 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.510
 truth that looks like the cars are 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:41.950
 all soaked dripping the asphalt 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.100
 is wet all this is from moisture 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:48.489
 environmental is not rain or anything like that 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.329
 that this is crazy now you're going to 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.190
 get home to the studio 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.219
 I'm going to explain a little 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.560
 advantages and disadvantages of this 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:03.250
 very high humidity 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.250
 Behold 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.619
 Hi guys 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.860
 Hello Hello 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:22.730
 look at the pavement is totally wet 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.730
 but let's go as if it had rained 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.970
 look at these are the samurai leaves and 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.240
 notice that they have even accumulated water 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.240
 here 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.630
 beige and the problem is that the trees 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.810
 although they have many foliage 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.369
 that moisture reaches the branch 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.820
 inside unless they are too 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:49.590
 bushy that is ideal what happens what 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.590
 positive of this tells us 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.880
 the good thing about this of course is the 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.009
 Foliar hydration and cleansing the 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.689
 low when having the cleanest low for 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.210
 breathe better the photo without themes the 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.430
 photosynthesis is going to be much better here 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.140
 next we have some lanes of this 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.640
 saves is called is not nor see or is 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.910
 saves because it is called leave because of 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.560
 saves as she saves more and that when 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.569
 a car passes a tractor lifts 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.180
 a lot of dust and that dust then rest 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.250
 on the leaves of the trees then 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.930
 here although I never recommend watering 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.350
 foliar but it is true that it is 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.300
 important in this case 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.140
 be a footprint from time to time to 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.490
 clean the blade that breathes better 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.640
 then clear this humidity and this lens 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:40.880
 It is very good for that because it cleans us 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.350
 and in turn hydrates us 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.510
 the whole sheet 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.980
 notice that this tree had a wake 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.750
 harms I the truth had not seen now 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.040
 now if it got a lot of attention and is 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.790
 in this beautiful you are with this relent 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.790
 watch out 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.750
 tito 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.110
 the first problem of this relente of 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.640
 this dew that they call it is that when 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.920
 we go to the same temperature 6 ago 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.360
 degrees is not dangerous but if it goes a lot 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.160
 the temperature and it gets two degrees to 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:02.830
 a degree that is difficult here but in the 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.860
 another farm yes that we got to be 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:08.830
 up to at least two degrees and that wetland 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:11.769
 rests on the blade what it does is that 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.379
 the just burning is formed beauty drop 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.849
 that there is accumulated then that drop is 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:17.919
 would turn to ice if that ice 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:20.200
 would burn the blade would end up killing if 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.090
 come to the inner branch as 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.800
 Notice that in this case this moisture the 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.360
 red color in this case is 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.560
 characteristic of the species is not not 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:29.740
 love 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.530
 if moisture arrives and ice would form 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.889
 on that wood that in my case of 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.460
 steiner and folk is already a very 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.020
 sensitive 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.639
 because it would end up killing the whole tree 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.230
 probably then we have to have 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.810
 careful when we have these dampness and 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.850
 This relent that rests on the sheet of 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.730
 that if they are going to spend a lot 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.110
 temperatures protect the tree because if 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:52.690
 got to become ice in the 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.550
 case of tropical trees would burn the 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.150
 leaf and if the branching burns 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.150
 a branch 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.640
 The second problem is presented 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.240
 in this humidity they are prolonged they are 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:13.130
 for so long is the eternal struggle 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.540
 against fungi in the case of 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.240
 peaks other trees also wood 

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:20.540
 fibrous perhaps the bougainvillea also 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.270
 some tree so delicate this humidity 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:25.070
 for so long in the cortex 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.720
 of our trees can give rise to 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:28.810
 mushrooms that's why it's important that if 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.950
 we live in high humidity climates 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.040
 We use fungicides in a way 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.360
 preventive not only curative but when 

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.960
 let's see that we are going to have a lot of humidity 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:42.260
 we can take a fungicide to avoid 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.030
 that these problems of good 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.220
 of appearance of fungi because we have a 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.200
 very humid weather and for a long time 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:51.080
 if we have a lot of humidity for five 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.330
 days ten days nothing happens nothing happens 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.860
 but when that already extends already when 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.030
 mushrooms begin to appear and colo 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.030
 the problems begin to appear 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.040
 these are the pilgrims for the wii those of 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:11.860
 creeping varieties that I have left 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:11.860
 still in the store are five euros 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.490
 we know that the ones are fed in a 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.750
 80% of the foliage so they are the 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.900
 great beneficiaries of these 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.900
 situations 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.920
 and otherwise all increase the 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:36.620
 pots are cleaned the ramifications are 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:39.080
 they clean our trees they hydrate that 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:40.580
 that water is of the highest quality we can 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.150
 also take advantage to collect that water 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:46.490
 somehow and that's it already 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:48.440
 that with this image of the elm of the 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.110
 sad figure 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.290
 I leave you 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:56.430
 not before telling you a hug and 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:56.430
 until the next video
