00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 good in this video of today you 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.450
 I want to show you how you can make a 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.700
 backup to what is your iphone phone 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.830
 I'm going to use version number 5 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.139
 but technically the steps are going to be 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.389
 similar for any other version 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.100
 of the phone that you have I want 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.920
 mention that this backup has 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.260
 what to do with saving both your files 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.460
 I mean your notes your photographs 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.130
 your music your contacts and so on inside 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.929
 of what your computer is or maybe what 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.450
 you can do in the cloud 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.950
 technically there are two ways of how 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.550
 you can backup your 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.860
 phone to have in reserve or saved that 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.890
 information for later in the case of 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.629
 that you want to return this phone to 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.489
 its original configurations 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.950
 technically erase everything you have the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.739
 possibility of recovering your information 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.930
 and that way you have not lost it 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.489
 whenever you connect your phone to the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.010
 computer in this case I'm 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.899
 using a default mac you 're going 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.059
 to open some programs between them 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.670
 It can be iTunes as you see it 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.750
 at this moment on screen what you 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.960
 you have to do is 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.060
 locate the icon that has to do with 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.360
 what is your phone already connected in 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.100
 this moment and when you click 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.470
 it would automatically take you to what they are 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.010
 your options in this tab that says 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.900
 summary 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.540
 here at the bottom we 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.220
 we have what are the backups and you 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.320
 mentioned that there are two ways to 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.860
 can do it one of them is for 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.990
 half of icloud regularly when you 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.120
 you buy an iphone phone you receive 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.330
 for free in your itunes account 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.130
 what is an icloud space so that 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.590
 you can save that information in the 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.020
 cloud that capacity you can increase it 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.210
 I think it's worth 20 dollars a 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.800
 year but it is optional but in 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.330
 the case that you do not want to do it 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.120
 directly in the cloud you would have to 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.890
 use this second option that says 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.229
 make a backup to this phone that 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.840
 I have directly connected saving 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.820
 what on this computer thing that you 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.140
 you decide which of the two options 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.390
 I want to mention that the icloud 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.780
 You can also do it regularly 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.700
 from inside the phone but in this 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.770
 occasion we are going to do it directly to 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.310
 this computer if I give it this 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.160
 side back up now automatically starts 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.290
 to process the information and what you 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.330
 subtraction here is technically expect everything 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.220
 will depend on how much information 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.230
 you have on your phone 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.020
 wait and once it's over we're going to 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.480
 see the result and well then after 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.280
 wait a few minutes on this side 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.800
 just finished the process 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.360
 technically the backup or copy of 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.520
 security with respect to information 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.590
 from my iphone phone has already been 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.170
 kept here tells me that the last 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.820
 backup was today at this time 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.890
 and how do you realize 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.010
 Now I want to mention what is what 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.680
 could do with this backup that I have 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.590
 saved let's assume that my phone 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.560
 for some reason it is failing 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.660
 at this moment I need to return it to 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.280
 how it came from the factory under that 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.370
 circumstance what I would have to do 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.230
 is to enter this same section as 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.000
 we saw from the beginning and instead of 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.010
 select any option of the part 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.740
 from below you can give it from this side 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.680
 restore the phone to how it came from 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.270
 factory which technically was going to 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.670
 erase all the information and then 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.160
 recover it regularly when you do 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.080
 this process you ask yourself if you want 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.330
 make a backup or a copy of 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.830
 security if you told him not you 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.230
 you could end this process 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.570
 to restore all the options of 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.700
 factory on the phone could return to 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.220
 this section and in this case select 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.500
 restore from a backup that you already 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.050
 would have done previously 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.790
 regularly the name of the backup has 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.640
 what to do with the name of the phone that 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.830
 you have your cell phone in this moment 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.710
 my cell phone case is called iphone yo 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.570
 would select to restore the backup that 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.820
 was made on this date with respect to 

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.800
 this phone and I tell him to restore and 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:05.960
 I would automatically go back to all the 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.360
 information that I just mentioned you 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.070
 I repeat this section is only for 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.570
 save that information you can 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.610
 restore the phone as it comes from 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.890
 factory here is going to give you the 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.440
 option to make a backup if you want and 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.720
 do not take it then it stays let's say 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.180
 a clean copy of the phone and you 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.860
 you can manually return some copy 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.900
 of security that you have already saved 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.380
 You can obviously do it before 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.970
 on different dates and in that way 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.720
 restore it with respect to what you have 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.720
 here saved
