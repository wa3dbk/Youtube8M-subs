00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
lot of attention by carrying a bag that

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.770 
lot of attention by carrying a bag that
looks<00:00:59.950> very<00:01:00.220> tactical<00:01:00.850> so<00:01:01.360> I<00:01:01.390> thought<00:01:01.630> this

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
looks very tactical so I thought this

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.389 
looks very tactical so I thought this
would<00:01:01.899> be<00:01:01.930> a<00:01:02.020> good<00:01:02.140> bag<00:01:02.350> to<00:01:02.560> review<00:01:02.860> it's<00:01:03.070> very

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
compact it does hold a lot despite the

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.280 
compact it does hold a lot despite the
fact<00:01:06.220> that<00:01:06.280> it<00:01:06.430> is<00:01:06.520> smaller<00:01:06.850> but<00:01:07.600> at<00:01:07.869> the<00:01:08.110> bit

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
fact that it is smaller but at the bit

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.749
