00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.520
 the young deer found his own deer 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.770
 last night the number from the 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.700
 promises premier league that is young nec fc 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.269
 oss 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.370
 psv even state eighth is the 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.230
 favorite for this competition but in the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.779
 Past experience has shown that young nec always 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.730
 a difficult opponent is the team 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.529
 van ron de groot also gets the first 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.810
 big chance of the match of this is 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.369
 ruud boymans but what a rescue 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.230
 nigel bertrams 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.269
 plunges for that ball and prevents it 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.529
 the hit of this striker 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.660
 Dick Attorney Attentively 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.390
 misses of course what players are coming 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.610
 Sunday to feyenoord and then it is 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.079
 these guys who are allowed to show themselves 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.440
 and that may be an alternative 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.969
 for the trainer of psv nec again via 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.559
 tutuarima 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.200
 the cross is low ends up at 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.860
 boijmans yes that is this kind of opportunity 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.730
 most of the time not you for the control of 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.280
 bertrams 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.199
 and now the roll beside but are 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.820
 two big warnings at the address 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.619
 from young psv the van oils on the pie that 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.240
 is called what room was something nicer comes 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.270
 over it but the pike had it himself 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.130
 shot johnson's rescue is good like that 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.210
 therefore also a first big opportunity for young 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.090
 psv 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.720
 the corner kick from via this memphis depay 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.700
 marcel ritzmaier the shot of being born 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.350
 closed psv wants a penalty kick 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.820
 referee has some doubts 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.950
 Referee Cuckoo is that he goes to 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.000
 Continue reach by with the for them and there 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.290
 then at least Jürgen Locadia with a zero 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.210
 and then of course you can say that is 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.350
 an excellent decision from Mr. 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.979
 cuckoo 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.710
 gives no penalty and locadia state 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.049
 completely free there and make it whole 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.270
 seventeen are simply the competition 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.180
 goal for young psv 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.640
 wattamaleo with the opening on leroy joyce 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.920
 this is a beautiful assumption from george 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.509
 biru george gogh opposite himself yes then 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.640
 he is too far to the outside but 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.000
 maybe boijmans behind it 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.040
 two barima so the odds are one anyway 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.230
 incredibly great for young msc ma goes 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.490
 the incredibly sloppy with it to 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.560
 that may also be the 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.480
 statement days to the team of 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.050
 big only two points in this 

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.940
 League 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.980
 where are they going again via stijn de looijer 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.870
 only on bertram they played ball something 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.690
 too far for itself that is mainly bicycle 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.300
 well enclosed to leroy george van 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.559
 to keep score 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.559
 [Music] 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.310
 Jansen's kicking a lot with the ball 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.990
 blind forward Korver looks up 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.160
 and goes george again 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.320
 leroy george schouten opposite it 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.300
 shot of joyce on the pole 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.090
 then everything is really against for the 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.620
 Nijmegen is still the first time 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.220
 cuckoo whistle for an attack and the 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.220
 offense 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:01.090
 in the east and the ball at draka lee 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.360
 psv played we go for good with 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.920
 becali locadia in the pyes 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.080
 then you would have some more chances 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.650
 expect 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.930
 the free kick claimed by the pie 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.100
 nice shot johnson half and that makes 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.430
 off him of course 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.150
 jürgen locadia is there again where he 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:27.580
 is supposed to be 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:30.930
 and this is then a number 18 again 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.930
 no obstacle in the way 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.810
 [Music] 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.970
 and then the match definitely seems in it 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:43.510
 benefit of psv watch forest to post 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:46.810
 the pie all the time all the space locadia 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.610
 numbers 19 and 3 0 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.530
 that's how it becomes a simple one 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.310
 victory for young psv 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:58.560
 it wins from young nec thanks to three 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.560
 hits of this man jurgen locadia 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.139
 if we look at the other results 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.299
 yesterday evening we see ajax 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:09.340
 wins from nac breda utrecht home of 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.349
 vitesse and also heerenveen and groningen 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.870
 win their home game 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.329
 heracles almelo wins 4 0 with no less 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.130
 FC Twente 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:20.410
 this is then the position 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.110
 we now find psv on place 7 th 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.870
 climbs over ajax and has 17 points 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.849
 11 matches nec remains desolate 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.349
 below with only two points out of 12 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:30.570
 matches 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.610
 and here we see the Jurgen Locadia 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.840
 young PSV top scorer made three and 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.840
 is now at 19
