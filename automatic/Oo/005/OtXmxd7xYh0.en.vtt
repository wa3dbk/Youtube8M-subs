00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 Your health habits help your body. 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:11.820
 Today , I'll learn about the lower body exercises. 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:17.609
 Our body basically has to be sturdy and strong. Everything builds a castle. 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:22.500
 Sometimes, the part should be healthy. The part of the egg is the upper part in Syria . 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.810
 When the lower body becomes poor as if it is healthy , the body naturally shakes. 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.760
 My shoulders are also very sick. 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:34.170
 In addition to that, strengthening the lower body is the most basic because of various aspects 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.829
 Especially running and these are the fundamentals of every movement. 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.090
 As you can see, the first thing I want to recommend is the first 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.629
 Walk a lot 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.230
 But more usually at least 4 hours walking time was the time that we can 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:51.510
 Because it is best for you jog or run 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:55.800
 If you have 30 minutes or more it gives up word spreads very greatly appreciated in mental health 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.940
 The most basic month for training the lower body or for training the whole body 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.649
 It is work. 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:05.850
 There are two best underbody exercises you can buy in an indoor space. 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:10.080
 The stance squats and lunges that you'll learn about it 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.870
 Both sides 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.100
 When'm your feet shoulder width away 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:21.870
 Well then born in a body, and then finish the girae 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:26.430
 After having the feeling that there is a koi , we open the door when we ride 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.230
 As if behind as the next aneusineun yoreotge go sit your butt first, 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.560
 You think you have a doctor. 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:35.010
 Let's pretend that we do not, but let's try the lion. 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.690
 And it's a good idea to have your arms down this way in the future 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.160
 This state baldly that mwonyamyeon knees should be the end of the note is ahead 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:46.200
 When you go 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:48.810
 I will kneel so I will break the waist and stretch it like this. 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.910
 Sitting as if you have a pebble. 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:56.670
 I will not go too far on my knees or if my knees go back 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:00.120
 Of course being as it is, because beyond the patch only 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.280
 I will not go too far to protect the water itself . 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.750
 You do this. 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.869
 You can do this posture seven or five times at a time. 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:13.050
 I 'll take a look at it three times in a row. 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:16.560
 I saw one sitting Like 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:20.730
 Yes. Return to sleep . Write your knees around yourself. 2 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.020
 I stretched out, resting it at the waist gives itself all the way down to 90 degrees if possible 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.440
 good 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.650
 My 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:32.530
 4 This way 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:36.850
 Repeat 15 sets of three sets of information, and the lower body is very good. 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:42.340
 In itself, not only this lower body, but also the heap itself is legal. 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:46.480
 What makes the skirt look good busy giving a word line in this part 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.970
 Lower body movement is the most basic and can catch the strength of all lower body movements 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.260
 It's so important because it's exercise. 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:58.510
 There are a few things about running a squirt, but this method is a reaction one 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:02.470
 So let's take a look at the basic behavior of this 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:06.820
 Please make it to the extent that you can do better then a little short 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:12.310
 I would like you to run the rest of the basics and do it a few more times 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:14.860
 Look at the pushpin. This time it took me a little bit to break it, but shoulder width 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.610
 Draw as much as twice 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:23.590
 Yes, I open my toe outside of Jeonbuk 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:24.760
 And the very same inde manjilttae must reply to a self-luminous Gwangyang 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.739
 It will open it. 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:34.120
 4 If you have this state, get up in the wrong direction 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:37.720
 It's not when you use your carol. 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:41.830
 Because the unrighteous approach is a very important thing in our body. 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.030
 Because when you get aging, the water is getting wider, 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:47.830
 It's getting harder. 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:52.150
 If you already have a leg, you can stand your legs and squats. 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:55.540
 So that when the muscles and the buttocks are attached to the waist, 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.910
 So that will be 2 So my only way for you is really my way 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:02.860
 I sat down 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:06.370
 While you may think your feet so your legs outward bestows This rest 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:10.000
 Tighten your buttocks and make it like an achievement. 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:14.490
 That's when I get my strength, so the force is on the furniture base . 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.490
 Please put together the second month 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:22.950
 Yeah , sitting on number three and picking things up. 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:27.810
 Example 1 Down 1 2 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:32.700
 If you do this in a new way, it will be a lot harder. 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:37.440
 It's a very tough exercise, though it's a very round face now . 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.880
 4 Then I went to the side of a foot and then squat, 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.910
 I'll do it 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:47.370
 There is a squat movement and in the main store 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:52.380
 Take a pair , go to the side, take one foot and squat. 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.040
 As the air alone back bath next to the property, then rejected this again 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.720
 You 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.620
 This is a behavior that is rich in these methods foe sucked patients legs 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.460
 I will. 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:01.460
 You squat. 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:09.479
 Sit up and raise your leg. 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.830
 4 off and back again 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:17.520
 Divers continue to embrace four ways to do this, they are the bridge's animation 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:21.810
 The way he sat down. He got up and sideways . 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:24.000
 Wake up and sat back while standing doeguyo spent a full top up, huh legs 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:28.560
 You can turn it out or kick me out. 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.479
 But that will fit on one leg far more power to embrace holding balance control 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.979
 It helps to strengthen it. 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:38.610
 The year saw a squat applications in various lands this way three Intermediate Advanced 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:41.910
 First, you should get the following hasiguyo enough to skirt the liver 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:46.289
 I'll see you later on about Lunge. 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:52.020
 He touches me first, right like Seoh . 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:53.339
 Example 4 In that state, it goes down to the bottom. 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:59.309
 Look down 

00:05:53.339 --> 00:06:02.879
 If your knees go forward beyond the tip of your feet, let's go. 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:07.529
 Your knees will be hurt immediately. 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:11.309
 It's important not to go forward . 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:15.300
 There's a fist in here and it's just black . 

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:18.749
 You can do this on the couch in that state, or you can try both sides. 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.459
 Do not turn up the pelvis will also climb down from thy state Lancy 

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:23.909
 You 

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:27.930
 Examples subside hasiguyo up the city 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:30.499
 Haeju is going grunge like this still say when change then this is well 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.499
 See you. 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:36.470
 Likewise , if this works well , push your hand forward 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:42.950
 Shake hands together. 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:48.170
 First place went down plunge control island here that only the more loosen each 

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:49.340
 Oh , this thigh is okay because I have time difference when I go up again. 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.910
 We'll have power. 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:55.130
 Let's try it. 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:07:00.350
 4 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:07:02.270
 4 In this state, for example , heavy objects such as Aion, bag, heavy 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:06.619
 It's like a bag and you can hold it. 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:11.719
 You have to hold the same ball and move like this 4 

00:07:06.619 --> 00:07:15.019
 So far , I've learned about squat and lunge about lower body exercises. 

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:18.499
 I usually work on the lower body exercises on the 1st day. 

00:07:15.019 --> 00:07:21.949
 So if you make the lower body strong, it will be with the blood circulation of our body. 

00:07:18.499 --> 00:07:24.879
 It will be a chance to make your upper body strong. 

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:24.879
 Workout hard
