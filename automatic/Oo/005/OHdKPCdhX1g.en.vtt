00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:11.840
 so hello everyone it's my own again 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:18.340
 a review on venture 987 asked and 420 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:24.800
 so bear that they then decided cases 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:28.130
 disassemble and then by the way all the ripples and 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.810
 all the snow is gone why are you so this 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.400
 the problem is not flash but most likely 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.520
 plumes of some kind of chinese which are not 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.830
 so soldered only and what kind of ball 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:46.370
 unscrewed 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:50.840
 in this 7 pier bolts again ok but 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:59.450
 also come again from is a number not 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:01:06.979
 Not so much done Don 3 version 4 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:12.530
 2 so disassemble and very easy then 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:15.110
 again you finger here nail and evil here 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:24.380
 see and already appeared here somewhere i 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:28.520
 clicked nothing went exactly from this to 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:34.780
 It goes every three loops do not know who where 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.780
 there goes unpacked pay about us 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.040
 I was glad that I thought I forgot everything 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.700
 just a train was leaving 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.790
 but it turned out to be still more difficult 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.410
 even something processor itself 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.680
 bad contact somewhere 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:05.640
 falls off because of this goes such 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.929
 garbage here we have nothing special 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.209
 Kind of like but Kiev speaker microphone 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:17.850
 second microphone 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:21.690
 flash and current I write this antenna very 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.620
 it's just done here 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.959
 yusbi 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.340
 and we are like when in this wesby constantly 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:34.290
 driver this scarf because of this here 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:37.340
 grew two walked three walked some of them i 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:42.959
 I do not know for sure I am not a master on the phone 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:45.680
 probably leaves this series 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.680
 shawl itself 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:57.489
 here are some two boards and then not all 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:04.209
 move the light and so you shoot 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:06.610
 ok from fighting this video of course 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.830
 the company but the soup and they figured it out 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.739
 Husband, not all the same do say because 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.870
 it is here and obse it is a little bit 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.030
 but 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:21.700
 but if it was like that I even went with it 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:29.079
 phone and did not think to change here again 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:38.110
 now there is no and then move well there 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:40.180
 here you can see 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.519
 can you get lucky can you 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:49.260
 will fall into place and everything will be fine 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:52.690
 it is also very easy to collect 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:04:01.650
 but his rope place well done certainly not 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:05.660
 it is necessary to suffer here everything on the latch 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:14.060
 everything is going to the sea 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:15.880
 someone 5 years have passed not much possible 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:23.350
 for corps somehow act or 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:23.350
 from the body you can walk of course so
