before<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.539> start<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:04.530> actually<00:01:04.739> need<00:01:05.220> to

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
before you start you actually need to

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.100 
before you start you actually need to
cure<00:01:06.210> your<00:01:06.570> God<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.920> gods<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.580> get

normally<00:01:10.110> one<00:01:10.830> be<00:01:11.040> cured<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.610> would<00:01:11.760> have

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
normally one be cured so you would have

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.660 
normally one be cured so you would have
to<00:01:11.939> do<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.900> this<00:01:13.080> pretty<00:01:13.500> much<00:01:13.670> involves

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
to do it so this pretty much involves

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.969 
to do it so this pretty much involves
putting<00:01:15.360> some<00:01:16.250> herb<00:01:17.250> with<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.659> yerba<00:01:19.080> inside

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
putting some herb with the yerba inside

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.160

the<00:01:20.189> gourd<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.670> leaving<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.270> overnight<00:01:21.479> with

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
the gourd and leaving it overnight with

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.880 
the gourd and leaving it overnight with
some<00:01:22.409> water<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.850> for<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:25.049> herb<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.740> be

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
some water in it just for the herb to be

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.270 
some water in it just for the herb to be
able<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.189> cure<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.880> wood<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.860> also<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.920> might

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
able to cure the wood and also you might

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.289 
able to cure the wood and also you might
get<00:01:29.490> some<00:01:29.869> loosely<00:01:31.159> particles<00:01:32.159> of<00:01:32.310> wood<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.150> it

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
get some loosely particles of wood so it

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.330 
get some loosely particles of wood so it
just<00:01:33.479> helps<00:01:33.810> clear<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.290> out<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:34.770> improve

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
just helps clear that out and improve

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.030 
just helps clear that out and improve
the<00:01:35.369> taste<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.180> wood<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.770> should<00:01:38.009> be

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
the taste of the wood so this should be

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.340 
the taste of the wood so this should be
done<00:01:38.189> for<00:01:38.549> at<00:01:38.670> least<00:01:38.790> one<00:01:39.090> or<00:01:39.240> two<00:01:39.390> nights<00:01:39.659> but

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
done for at least one or two nights but

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.230 
done for at least one or two nights but
there's<00:01:40.530> more<00:01:40.770> information<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.670> slide<00:01:41.909> on

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
there's more information on the slide on

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.469 
there's more information on the slide on
how<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.600> do<00:01:42.840> that<00:01:43.549> so<00:01:44.549> Arthur<00:01:44.970> your<00:01:45.119> God<00:01:45.329> is

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
how to do that so Arthur your God is

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.490 
how to do that so Arthur your God is
ready<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.930> drink<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:47.070> need<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.399> add<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.640> over

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.630 

so<00:01:52.500> normally<00:01:52.950> you<00:01:53.600> add<00:01:54.600> about<00:01:55.110> half<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.920> two

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
so normally you add about half to two

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.060 
so normally you add about half to two
thirds<00:01:57.170> so<00:01:58.170> I'm<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:58.500> going<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.710> do<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.009> now

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
thirds so I'm just going to do that now

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.090 
thirds so I'm just going to do that now
I'm<00:01:59.430> not<00:01:59.579> sure<00:01:59.610> if<00:01:59.909> we<00:02:00.060> can<00:02:00.210> see<00:02:00.450> properly<00:02:01.100> but

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
I'm not sure if we can see properly but

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:13.430 
I'm not sure if we can see properly but
so<00:02:02.399> just<00:02:02.430> pouring<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.240> in<00:02:03.390> there

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.070 

now<00:02:14.440> it<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:14.950> quite<00:02:15.400> dusty<00:02:15.670> so<00:02:16.420> some<00:02:16.720> people

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
now it is quite dusty so some people

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.650 
now it is quite dusty so some people
like<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.320> just<00:02:17.710> put<00:02:18.100> their<00:02:18.340> hand<00:02:18.820> over<00:02:19.300> it<00:02:19.420> and

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
like to just put their hand over it and

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.090 
like to just put their hand over it and
then<00:02:20.410> just<00:02:20.440> tip<00:02:21.220> it<00:02:21.400> over<00:02:21.780> like<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:23.100> wheat

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
then just tip it over like that wheat

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.420

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
mountain and now I'm sure if you can see

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.750 
mountain and now I'm sure if you can see
there<00:03:21.510> but<00:03:22.510> I've<00:03:23.020> just<00:03:23.770> poured<00:03:24.070> water<00:03:24.370> to<00:03:24.670> the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
there but I've just poured water to the

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.430 
there but I've just poured water to the
side<00:03:25.030> of<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.360> little<00:03:25.780> mountain<00:03:26.170> that<00:03:26.290> I've

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
side of the little mountain that I've

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.770 
side of the little mountain that I've
created<00:03:26.620> there<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.550> it's<00:03:28.000> just<00:03:28.210> cold<00:03:28.390> water

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
created there and it's just cold water

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.380 
created there and it's just cold water
that<00:03:29.320> just<00:03:29.590> boats<00:03:29.890> a<00:03:30.130> herb<00:03:30.340> so<00:03:30.970> it<00:03:31.120> can<00:03:31.270> just

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
that just boats a herb so it can just

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.780 
that just boats a herb so it can just
make<00:03:31.600> it<00:03:31.630> a<00:03:31.810> bit<00:03:31.990> more<00:03:32.020> compact<00:03:32.800> and<00:03:33.040> also

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
make it a bit more compact and also

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.600 
make it a bit more compact and also
expands<00:03:34.510> it<00:03:34.600> so<00:03:34.780> we<00:03:34.900> can<00:03:35.080> fit<00:03:35.380> firmly<00:03:36.130> within

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
expands it so we can fit firmly within

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.430 
expands it so we can fit firmly within
the<00:03:36.820> gold<00:03:37.060> so<00:03:37.300> it<00:03:37.360> doesn't<00:03:37.690> move<00:03:37.810> around<00:03:37.870> too

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
the gold so it doesn't move around too

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.699 
the gold so it doesn't move around too
much<00:03:38.470> when<00:03:38.860> you<00:03:38.980> drink<00:03:39.220> it<00:03:39.600> then<00:03:40.709> preferably

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
much when you drink it then preferably

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.620 
much when you drink it then preferably
you<00:03:42.070> leave<00:03:42.310> this<00:03:42.520> for<00:03:42.760> a<00:03:42.820> few<00:03:43.030> minutes<00:03:43.300> just

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
you leave this for a few minutes just

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.680 
you leave this for a few minutes just
the<00:03:43.959> blood<00:03:44.200> but<00:03:45.190> for<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.060> purpose<00:03:46.450> of<00:03:46.570> the
