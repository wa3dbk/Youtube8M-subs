00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
upgrade of this gun is the Monte Carlo

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.419 
upgrade of this gun is the Monte Carlo
method<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.990> what<00:02:07.439> this<00:02:07.590> upgrade<00:02:07.950> does<00:02:08.190> is

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
method and what this upgrade does is

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.219 
method and what this upgrade does is
when<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:08.970> hit<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.239> enemy<00:02:09.390> with<00:02:09.780> this<00:02:09.929> gun

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
when you hit the enemy with this gun

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.559 
when you hit the enemy with this gun
every<00:02:10.679> single<00:02:11.009> shot<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.879> will<00:02:12.030> decrease<00:02:12.270> your

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
every single shot it will decrease your

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.980 
every single shot it will decrease your
melee<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:13.319> cool<00:02:13.620> down

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
melee is cool down

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.800 
melee is cool down
when<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:14.860> monte<00:02:15.190> carlo<00:02:15.220> method<00:02:16.150> is<00:02:16.300> an<00:02:16.390> effect

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
when the monte carlo method is an effect

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.350 
when the monte carlo method is an effect
it<00:02:17.110> is<00:02:17.590> quite<00:02:17.860> noticeable<00:02:18.460> but<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.090> is<00:02:19.180> not

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
it is quite noticeable but it is not

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.180 
it is quite noticeable but it is not
that<00:02:19.390> useful<00:02:19.780> because<00:02:20.260> even<00:02:20.710> if<00:02:20.770> you<00:02:20.860> unload<00:02:21.160> a

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
that useful because even if you unload a

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.400 
that useful because even if you unload a
whole<00:02:21.490> clip<00:02:21.820> onto<00:02:22.000> an<00:02:22.300> enemy<00:02:22.660> you<00:02:22.840> cannot<00:02:23.170> get

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
whole clip onto an enemy you cannot get

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.070 
whole clip onto an enemy you cannot get
your<00:02:23.680> melee<00:02:24.040> back<00:02:24.280> right<00:02:24.550> away<00:02:24.670> so<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:25.930> can

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
your melee back right away so you can

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.110 
your melee back right away so you can
see<00:02:26.320> a<00:02:26.350> move<00:02:26.620> like<00:02:27.130> I'm<00:02:27.280> showing<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:27.730> right

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
see a move like I'm showing you right

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.330 
see a move like I'm showing you right
now<00:02:28.390> but<00:02:29.350> it's<00:02:29.620> not<00:02:29.830> something<00:02:30.070> so

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
now but it's not something so

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.920 
now but it's not something so
game-breaking<00:02:30.940> that<00:02:31.330> makes<00:02:31.510> this<00:02:31.630> gun<00:02:31.900> a

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
game-breaking that makes this gun a

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.350 
game-breaking that makes this gun a
super<00:02:32.380> good<00:02:32.530> gun<00:02:32.830> it's<00:02:33.520> all<00:02:33.670> right<00:02:33.910> I<00:02:33.940> guess

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
super good gun it's all right I guess

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.780 
super good gun it's all right I guess
another<00:02:34.900> thing<00:02:35.170> is<00:02:35.320> if<00:02:35.350> your<00:02:35.710> melee<00:02:36.100> for<00:02:36.670> your

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
another thing is if your melee for your

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.540 
another thing is if your melee for your
class<00:02:37.030> is<00:02:37.330> not<00:02:37.510> super<00:02:37.780> good<00:02:38.170> for<00:02:38.980> example<00:02:39.370> the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
class is not super good for example the

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.670 
class is not super good for example the
Sun<00:02:39.790> singers<00:02:40.180> flame<00:02:40.540> shield<00:02:40.870> or<00:02:41.080> scorched

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
Sun singers flame shield or scorched

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.560 
Sun singers flame shield or scorched
flame<00:02:41.980> shield<00:02:42.310> which<00:02:42.820> gives<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.210> shield

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
flame shield which gives you a shield

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.210 
flame shield which gives you a shield
whenever<00:02:43.930> you<00:02:44.020> may<00:02:44.170> leave<00:02:44.410> that's<00:02:44.800> a<00:02:45.040> very

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
whenever you may leave that's a very

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.280 
whenever you may leave that's a very
good<00:02:45.310> melee<00:02:45.820> but<00:02:46.390> then<00:02:46.510> if<00:02:46.690> you're<00:02:46.870> a<00:02:46.900> striker

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
good melee but then if you're a striker

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.590 
good melee but then if you're a striker
tight<00:02:47.590> in<00:02:47.770> there<00:02:48.490> won't<00:02:48.790> be<00:02:48.970> much<00:02:49.090> difference

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
tight in there won't be much difference

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.790 
tight in there won't be much difference
you're<00:02:49.780> going<00:02:49.900> to<00:02:49.960> shoulder<00:02:50.260> charge<00:02:50.410> anyway

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
you're going to shoulder charge anyway

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.370 
you're going to shoulder charge anyway
right<00:02:51.040> now<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.000> philosophy<00:02:52.810> of<00:02:52.840> this<00:02:53.140> gun

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
right now the philosophy of this gun

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.560 
right now the philosophy of this gun
this<00:02:53.770> gun<00:02:53.860> promotes<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.520> to<00:02:54.700> shoot<00:02:55.090> from<00:02:55.180> afar

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
this gun promotes you to shoot from afar

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.930 
this gun promotes you to shoot from afar
and<00:02:55.930> then<00:02:56.170> change<00:02:56.560> up<00:02:56.800> use<00:02:57.160> your<00:02:57.310> melee<00:02:57.700> and

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
and then change up use your melee and

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.640 
and then change up use your melee and
then<00:02:58.330> go<00:02:58.450> back<00:02:58.630> shooting<00:02:58.870> of<00:02:59.020> shooting<00:02:59.530> out

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
then go back shooting of shooting out

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.370 
then go back shooting of shooting out
from<00:02:59.680> afar<00:03:00.190> because<00:03:00.520> the<00:03:01.360> more<00:03:01.540> you<00:03:01.570> shoot<00:03:01.960> the

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
from afar because the more you shoot the

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.510 
from afar because the more you shoot the
more<00:03:02.590> your<00:03:02.800> melee<00:03:03.340> will<00:03:04.180> be<00:03:04.330> ready<00:03:04.680> but<00:03:05.680> like<00:03:06.400> I

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
more your melee will be ready but like I

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.610 
more your melee will be ready but like I
mentioned<00:03:06.700> earlier<00:03:06.970> not<00:03:07.750> every<00:03:08.110> classes

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
mentioned earlier not every classes

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.250 
mentioned earlier not every classes
melee<00:03:09.040> ability<00:03:09.580> is<00:03:09.790> that<00:03:10.030> good<00:03:10.390> if<00:03:10.930> your<00:03:11.080> class

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
melee ability is that good if your class

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.140 
melee ability is that good if your class
is<00:03:11.320> mainly<00:03:11.680> ability<00:03:12.190> is<00:03:12.370> good<00:03:12.670> then<00:03:13.000> you<00:03:13.120> can

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
is mainly ability is good then you can

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.300 
is mainly ability is good then you can
benefit<00:03:13.720> from<00:03:13.780> this<00:03:14.020> gun<00:03:14.290> on<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.920> other<00:03:15.040> hand

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
benefit from this gun on the other hand

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.310 
benefit from this gun on the other hand
if<00:03:15.580> your<00:03:15.700> class<00:03:15.880> is<00:03:15.940> mainly<00:03:16.270> abilities<00:03:16.690> bad<00:03:16.990> or

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
if your class is mainly abilities bad or

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.130 
if your class is mainly abilities bad or
actually<00:03:17.650> not<00:03:18.100> super<00:03:18.580> good<00:03:18.790> then<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:19.990> don't

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
actually not super good then you don't

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.500 
actually not super good then you don't
really<00:03:20.260> get<00:03:20.530> much<00:03:20.590> benefit<00:03:21.190> now<00:03:22.090> let's<00:03:22.390> look

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
really get much benefit now let's look

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.050 
really get much benefit now let's look
at<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.810> pros<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.200> cons<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.890> this<00:03:23.950> gun<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.730> pro

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
at the pros and cons of this gun the pro

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.270 
at the pros and cons of this gun the pro
like<00:03:25.720> I<00:03:25.840> mentioned<00:03:26.020> earlier<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.890> Monte<00:03:27.250> Carlo

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
like I mentioned earlier the Monte Carlo

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.760 
like I mentioned earlier the Monte Carlo
is<00:03:27.820> a<00:03:27.850> moderate<00:03:28.390> rate<00:03:28.660> of<00:03:28.810> fire<00:03:29.080> auto<00:03:29.380> rifle

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
is a moderate rate of fire auto rifle

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.460 
is a moderate rate of fire auto rifle
it's<00:03:30.370> not<00:03:30.610> those<00:03:30.820> super<00:03:31.240> fast<00:03:31.540> ones<00:03:31.930> but<00:03:32.260> it's

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
it's not those super fast ones but it's

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.470 
it's not those super fast ones but it's
also<00:03:32.650> not<00:03:32.920> those<00:03:33.130> super<00:03:33.430> slow<00:03:33.700> one<00:03:33.970> so<00:03:34.300> it's

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
also not those super slow one so it's

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.530 
also not those super slow one so it's
all<00:03:34.720> right<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.860> Monte<00:03:36.190> Carlo<00:03:36.220> method<00:03:37.030> it's<00:03:37.330> an

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
all right the Monte Carlo method it's an

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.450 
all right the Monte Carlo method it's an
upgrade<00:03:38.050> that<00:03:38.260> promotes<00:03:38.890> you<00:03:39.070> to<00:03:39.280> use<00:03:39.430> your

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
upgrade that promotes you to use your

mentioned<00:03:56.800> this<00:03:57.100> one's<00:03:57.370> only<00:03:57.520> moderate<00:03:58.090> so

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
mentioned this one's only moderate so

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.660 
mentioned this one's only moderate so
which<00:03:58.540> is<00:03:58.570> quite<00:03:58.900> nice<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.740> final<00:04:00.190> pro<00:04:00.460> is

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
which is quite nice the final pro is

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.880 
which is quite nice the final pro is
that<00:04:00.910> this<00:04:01.060> gun<00:04:01.300> looks<00:04:01.510> awesome<00:04:02.370> period

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
that this gun looks awesome period

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.040 
that this gun looks awesome period
anyways<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.250> cons<00:04:06.520> this<00:04:07.390> gun<00:04:07.600> is<00:04:07.630> a<00:04:07.780> low

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
anyways the cons this gun is a low

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.320 
anyways the cons this gun is a low
damage<00:04:08.350> weapon<00:04:08.920> so<00:04:09.190> you<00:04:09.250> need<00:04:09.490> a<00:04:09.520> lot<00:04:09.760> of<00:04:09.820> hits

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
damage weapon so you need a lot of hits

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.080 
damage weapon so you need a lot of hits
to<00:04:10.690> take<00:04:11.350> down<00:04:11.500> an<00:04:11.709> enemy<00:04:11.830> then<00:04:12.700> there's<00:04:12.970> the

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
to take down an enemy then there's the

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.699 
to take down an enemy then there's the
monte<00:04:13.450> carlo<00:04:13.480> method<00:04:14.110> is<00:04:14.200> not<00:04:14.320> that<00:04:14.530> useful

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
monte carlo method is not that useful

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.710 
monte carlo method is not that useful
it's<00:04:15.220> not<00:04:15.340> that<00:04:15.520> good<00:04:15.790> for<00:04:16.000> every<00:04:16.299> single

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
it's not that good for every single

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.349 
it's not that good for every single
class<00:04:17.049> because<00:04:17.680> not<00:04:17.920> every<00:04:18.220> single<00:04:18.580> class<00:04:18.910> has

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
class because not every single class has

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:22.770 
class because not every single class has
very<00:04:19.690> good<00:04:20.049> mainly<00:04:20.890> abilities<00:04:21.760> if<00:04:22.120> your<00:04:22.570> class

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
very good mainly abilities if your class

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.230 
very good mainly abilities if your class
mail<00:04:23.350> ability<00:04:23.800> is<00:04:23.860> not<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.310> super<00:04:24.820> good<00:04:25.030> ones

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
mail ability is not the super good ones

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.640 
mail ability is not the super good ones
then

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
then

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.860 
then
to<00:04:26.680> give<00:04:26.830> you<00:04:26.860> anything<00:04:27.100> any<00:04:27.430> benefits<00:04:28.120> you

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
to give you anything any benefits you

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.439 
to give you anything any benefits you
would<00:04:29.050> rather<00:04:29.320> use<00:04:29.710> another<00:04:30.040> gun<00:04:30.280> and<00:04:30.580> then<00:04:31.210> I

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
would rather use another gun and then I

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.070 
would rather use another gun and then I
list<00:04:31.960> slow<00:04:32.440> reload<00:04:32.860> animation<00:04:33.100> because<00:04:34.080> this

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
list slow reload animation because this

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.510 
list slow reload animation because this
is<00:04:35.199> the<00:04:35.289> thing<00:04:35.410> I<00:04:35.560> do<00:04:35.620> when<00:04:36.039> you<00:04:36.190> reload<00:04:36.460> your

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
is the thing I do when you reload your

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.760 
is the thing I do when you reload your
gun<00:04:36.669> your<00:04:37.419> gun<00:04:37.600> goes<00:04:37.840> through<00:04:38.050> this<00:04:38.169> reloading

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
gun your gun goes through this reloading

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.340 
gun your gun goes through this reloading
animation<00:04:39.460> while<00:04:39.759> the<00:04:40.449> clip<00:04:40.750> on<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.169> left

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
animation while the clip on the left

side<00:04:41.530> of<00:04:41.740> your<00:04:41.860> screen<00:04:41.919> will<00:04:42.460> show<00:04:42.490> as<00:04:42.880> full

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
side of your screen will show as full

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.570 
side of your screen will show as full
sometimes<00:04:44.080> dream<00:04:44.500> that<00:04:44.620> animation<00:04:45.039> what<00:04:45.460> I<00:04:45.490> do

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
sometimes dream that animation what I do

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.249 
sometimes dream that animation what I do
is<00:04:45.789> I<00:04:45.850> cancel<00:04:46.389> all<00:04:46.479> the<00:04:46.509> animation<00:04:47.139> by

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
is I cancel all the animation by

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:49.230 
is I cancel all the animation by
sprinting<00:04:47.919> so<00:04:48.400> I<00:04:48.430> don't<00:04:48.669> have<00:04:48.729> to<00:04:48.820> wait<00:04:49.060> until

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
sprinting so I don't have to wait until

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.070 
sprinting so I don't have to wait until
the<00:04:50.020> animation<00:04:50.440> ends<00:04:50.889> but<00:04:51.460> for<00:04:51.669> this<00:04:51.789> gun<00:04:52.120> you

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
the animation ends but for this gun you

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.620 
the animation ends but for this gun you
cannot<00:04:53.440> cancel<00:04:53.860> out<00:04:54.340> until<00:04:54.850> near<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.389> very

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
cannot cancel out until near the very

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.900 
cannot cancel out until near the very
very<00:04:55.990> very<00:04:56.289> end<00:04:56.650> so<00:04:56.949> there's<00:04:57.250> no<00:04:57.400> point<00:04:57.699> in

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
very very end so there's no point in

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.210 
very very end so there's no point in
canceling<00:04:58.539> out<00:04:58.750> so<00:04:59.500> you<00:04:59.590> just<00:04:59.740> have<00:04:59.919> to<00:05:00.010> watch

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
canceling out so you just have to watch

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.800 
canceling out so you just have to watch
the<00:05:00.430> whole<00:05:00.580> animation<00:05:01.000> that's<00:05:01.389> why<00:05:01.510> I<00:05:01.539> list

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
the whole animation that's why I list

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.159 
the whole animation that's why I list
slow<00:05:02.229> reload<00:05:02.650> animation<00:05:02.970> but<00:05:03.970> in<00:05:04.210> reality<00:05:04.539> if

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
slow reload animation but in reality if

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.560 
slow reload animation but in reality if
you<00:05:05.289> don't<00:05:05.500> use<00:05:05.680> the<00:05:05.830> trick<00:05:06.070> I<00:05:06.250> do<00:05:06.310> it's<00:05:07.150> just<00:05:07.330> a
