00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
things over and over again you're buying

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.870 
things over and over again you're buying
all<00:01:24.530> this<00:01:24.619> plastic<00:01:25.070> and<00:01:25.219> injuring<00:01:25.490> it<00:01:25.700> in<00:01:25.789> the

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
all this plastic and injuring it in the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.630 
all this plastic and injuring it in the
garbage<00:01:26.090> so<00:01:26.479> what<00:01:26.930> can<00:01:27.049> we<00:01:27.170> do<00:01:27.399> to<00:01:28.399> make<00:01:28.610> a

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
garbage so what can we do to make a

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.200 
garbage so what can we do to make a
difference<00:01:28.789> and<00:01:29.920> this<00:01:30.920> is<00:01:30.979> a<00:01:31.159> good<00:01:31.310> start<00:01:31.579> so

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
difference and this is a good start so

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.690 
difference and this is a good start so
the<00:01:32.570> shampoo<00:01:32.990> is<00:01:33.289> essentially<00:01:33.979> just<00:01:34.039> baking

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
the shampoo is essentially just baking

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.740 
the shampoo is essentially just baking
soda<00:01:34.939> and<00:01:35.210> water<00:01:35.649> it's<00:01:36.649> about<00:01:37.180> I<00:01:38.180> guess<00:01:38.570> the

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
soda and water it's about I guess the

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.690 
soda and water it's about I guess the
proportion<00:01:39.200> you<00:01:39.350> could<00:01:39.500> change<00:01:39.770> depending<00:01:40.250> on

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
proportion you could change depending on

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.050 
proportion you could change depending on
your<00:01:40.850> hair<00:01:41.119> type<00:01:41.149> but<00:01:41.750> I<00:01:41.780> started<00:01:42.289> with<00:01:42.500> about

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
your hair type but I started with about

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.330 
your hair type but I started with about
two<00:01:44.060> tablespoons<00:01:44.420> of<00:01:44.840> baking<00:01:45.020> soda<00:01:45.380> in<00:01:45.890> just<00:01:46.219> a

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
two tablespoons of baking soda in just a

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.249 
two tablespoons of baking soda in just a
small<00:01:46.609> bottle<00:01:47.240> of<00:01:47.299> water<00:01:47.479> so<00:01:47.689> it's<00:01:47.840> just<00:01:48.049> under

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
small bottle of water so it's just under

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.469 
small bottle of water so it's just under
a<00:01:48.439> cup<00:01:48.710> right<00:01:49.219> and<00:01:50.000> you<00:01:50.090> just<00:01:50.270> give<00:01:50.390> it<00:01:50.450> a

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
a cup right and you just give it a

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:51.290 
a cup right and you just give it a
really<00:01:50.659> good<00:01:50.689> shake

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
really good shake

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
with this method the great thing is that

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.020 
with this method the great thing is that

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.370 
you can start to wash your hair less and
less<00:03:36.180> because<00:03:36.420> you<00:03:36.810> don't<00:03:36.989> have<00:03:37.170> the

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
less because you don't have the

need to wash it as often and how are
they<00:03:54.239> on<00:03:54.570> color<00:03:55.050> treated<00:03:55.380> hair<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.970> baking

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
they on color treated hair the baking

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.550 
they on color treated hair the baking

soda can

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.559 
soda can
a<00:03:58.590> little<00:03:59.190> bit<00:03:59.370> harsh<00:03:59.700> depending<00:04:00.330> on<00:04:00.450> the

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
a little bit harsh depending on the

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.630 
a little bit harsh depending on the
proportion<00:04:01.110> and<00:04:01.230> again<00:04:01.500> so<00:04:01.860> if<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.550> have

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
proportion and again so if you have

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.190 
proportion and again so if you have
color<00:04:02.849> treated<00:04:02.970> hair<00:04:03.270> you<00:04:03.450> might<00:04:03.720> want<00:04:03.930> to<00:04:03.959> try

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
color treated hair you might want to try

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.380
