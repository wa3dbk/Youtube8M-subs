00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:10.209
 hello are Huesca 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:13.789
 that is to say industrial and technological systems of monterrey campus puebla 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:18.279
 the reason why it exists this Tuesday because I believe that the best way to 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.949
 living on this planet without destroying them is not through changing Chinese habits 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.949
 supports its nature to renew the technologies of today 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.630
 following the models of living and healthy beings the same principles of 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.869
 cyclical and non-linear processes 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.869
 I sell department ch the leaders and effective 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.220
 the purpose of this cereal 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.290
 is to persuade other fronts like 20 13 violence regardless of career 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.240
 specifically in law and ethics as a trend will continue to innovate in 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.640
 productive processes and systems 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.770
 because normally this application to the material is not taken into account by 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.860
 think that it's not important for the race 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.880
 or simply because of ignorance is 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.280
 but first 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.410
 what is the benefic 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.180
 basically it is the explanation adaptation of mechanisms found in 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.239
 the applicable nature mainly engineering 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.670
 but also technology and practically any area of 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.190
 knowledge 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.910
 is based on the fact that poverty has proposed solutions to problems of 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.590
 adaptation of organisms 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.430
 through natural selection 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.400
 for millions of years by trial and error 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.250
 have lasted the best 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.360
 these problems often appear differently in life 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.550
 of human beings but the solutions devised by the environment are more 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.550
 efficient than those that the human mind would have achieved on its own 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.710
 da vinci was a great precursor of this ethnic group 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.710
 studying birds and bats to create their airplane models 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.000
 he said himself 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.440
 those that are inspired by a different nature model 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.620
 teacher superior to all teachers 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.610
 they work in vain 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.050
 although none of their prototypes have worked 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.200
 pride thus transcended 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.920
 change the shape of the wings of the planes for the different moments of the 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.640
 flight 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.110
 has proven to be more effective than the classic model gives the almost static 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.090
 to achieve this 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.000
 they are basing the shape of the wings of the salle 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.589
 just as it had been at the time 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:12.919
 another representative invention in rabat for which a group of engineers 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:16.229
 military are based their share the bats and dolphins 

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:19.359
 and devised a way to cheat on a large scale 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.729
 These examples represent early efforts in the application of 

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:24.159
 breathalyser 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:27.750
 however, they are very isolated events and did not set a trend 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.989
 an example the benefit applies today 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:33.199
 is the case of the bullet train without a house 

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:36.099
 the problem I had was that they list 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.099
 the cable that joined it with one of the rails emits a very loud sound 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.879
 this is solved by urging the shape of the poplar 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.879
 these ammunition birds and two parts but by surprise 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:49.889
 another problem that had its marks of torture 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:51.719
 Well, while I was working 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:54.189
 created a pressure of air so big that when escaping 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:57.319
 but without sound like an explosion 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.319
 for this case the kingfisher form was studied 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:04.599
 this network when entering the uat must produce the same amount of waves to the 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.179
 surface to keep track of your post 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:10.109
 the shape of its beak was implemented at the tip of the train 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:14.529
 which solved his noise problem a better use of the heat by 10% and 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:17.529
 Step your energy efficiency the other 15% 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:24.059
 another very common example is the easy swimsuit the ps 2 the loving punishment 

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:27.059
 which with its design on the skin of sharks 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:31.189
 these animals to be able to breathe are always in motion 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:35.499
 this would represent a large calorie expenditure if it were not because they have 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:39.529
 evolved so that these skin does not produce date and with the water already without being 

00:03:39.529 --> 00:03:42.859
 the least amount of energy to move 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.059
 fascinates him the 13 2 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:46.730
 by centers the day of kings 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.530
 caused by the team from the United States of which the winner of the 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.159
 eight gold medals michael shanks 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.010
 the organizers of the event discovered that this suit worked 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.159
 also that gives them a big advantage over the other teams 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.159
 so it was forbidden to use it for the tape is competition 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:04.849
 she is a thousand beni 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.460
 is a consultant and innovations 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.589
 and writer of natural sciences 

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:12.020
 in 1997 he published his book entitled 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.299
 go min 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.299
 in which the definition of life in Mexico is erased 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:18.900
 through his press releases 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.110
 has managed to integrate a large community of supporters and thanks to it 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.979
 a group called vaio mini cabrio has been created 

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:29.409
 and a large part is due to the work of this group which is well conceived the 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:31.219
 previous examples 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:32.389
 concluding 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.460
 in three points 8 million years 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.460
 nature has learned to be an immense amount of tasks 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:40.599
 for example 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:42.669
 although the tip of the mountains 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.680
 and the deepest ocean 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.650
 get energy from the sun 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.099
 create light 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:50.539
 create amazing materials like skin 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:51.680
 horns 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.120
 bones 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.780
 Among those tasks is everything that we took, we wanted 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.319
 be 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:01.319
 but without using fossil fuels or polluting the planet 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.199
 although we are part of nature 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:06.389
 we are very young species yet 

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:09.319
 and what do we need to learn the right way to do things 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:11.669
 with michelin star 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:14.669
 we are finally doing it right if we first ask 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.119
 as nature would
