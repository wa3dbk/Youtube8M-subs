this<00:00:17.490> says<00:00:17.670> LCD<00:00:18.090> power<00:00:18.390> supply<00:00:18.630> tester<00:00:18.980> easy

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
this says LCD power supply tester easy

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.150 
this says LCD power supply tester easy
use<00:00:20.369> or<00:00:20.699> easy<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:20.910> read<00:00:21.150> power<00:00:21.779> voltage

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
use or easy to read power voltage

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.269 
use or easy to read power voltage
basically<00:00:23.160> gives<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.490> digital<00:00:23.880> readout

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:25.279 
basically gives you a digital readout

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:28.429 
basically gives you a digital readout
the<00:00:26.279> voltages<00:00:26.960> coming<00:00:27.960> out<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.230> your<00:00:28.320> power

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
the voltages coming out of your power

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.980 
the voltages coming out of your power
supply<00:00:28.590> so<00:00:29.390> something<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.869> pretty

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
supply so something like this is pretty

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.780 
supply so something like this is pretty
handy<00:00:31.380> out<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.590> field<00:00:31.830> rather<00:00:32.340> than<00:00:32.489> trying

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
handy out the field rather than trying

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.700 
handy out the field rather than trying
to<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.420> know<00:00:33.450> troubleshoot<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.079> power<00:00:34.260> problem

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
to you know troubleshoot a power problem

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.930 
to you know troubleshoot a power problem
and<00:00:34.890> just<00:00:35.010> start<00:00:35.190> swapping<00:00:35.460> out<00:00:35.700> power

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
and just start swapping out power

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.940 
and just start swapping out power
supplies<00:00:36.300> that's<00:00:36.870> kind<00:00:37.050> of<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.200> that<00:00:37.770> could<00:00:37.890> be

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
supplies that's kind of a that could be

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.260 
supplies that's kind of a that could be
time-consuming<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.700> kind<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.969> pain<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
time-consuming and kind of a pain in the

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.420 
time-consuming and kind of a pain in the
butt<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.860> what<00:00:40.860> we're<00:00:40.950> gonna<00:00:41.010> do<00:00:41.160> is<00:00:41.280> we're

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
butt so what we're gonna do is we're

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.190 
butt so what we're gonna do is we're
good<00:00:41.550> we're<00:00:42.030> not<00:00:42.059> I'm<00:00:42.270> not<00:00:42.300> suspecting<00:00:43.079> any

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
good we're not I'm not suspecting any

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.020 
good we're not I'm not suspecting any
problems<00:00:43.559> with<00:00:43.649> power<00:00:43.860> supply<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.460> just<00:00:44.879> want

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
problems with power supply I just want

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.220 
problems with power supply I just want
to<00:00:45.120> test<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.420> out<00:00:45.510> because<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.809> have<00:00:45.989> yet<00:00:46.170> to

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
to test it out because I have yet to

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.850 
to test it out because I have yet to
test<00:00:46.530> this<00:00:46.680> thing<00:00:46.920> out<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.840> all<00:00:48.840> right<00:00:49.050> we're

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
test this thing out so all right we're

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.330 
test this thing out so all right we're
going<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.039> do<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.219> plug<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.579> 24<00:00:51.539> pin

in okay and Skeeter 4 pin
there's<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.260> bunch<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.590> spots<00:01:10.860> up<00:01:11.100> there<00:01:11.810> for

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
there's a bunch of spots up there for

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.399 
there's a bunch of spots up there for
different<00:01:14.100> sized<00:01:15.080> connectors<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.229> get<00:01:16.350> the

four paying at 8 p.m. and a 6 pin and

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.870 
four paying at 8 p.m. and a 6 pin and
even<00:01:18.420> your<00:01:18.570> little<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:19.610> believe<00:01:20.610> that's<00:01:20.790> your

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
even your little I believe that's your

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.990 
even your little I believe that's your
fluffy<00:01:22.070> but<00:01:23.070> some<00:01:23.340> like<00:01:23.490> this

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
fluffy but some like this

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.149 
fluffy but some like this
I<00:01:24.030> mean<00:01:24.840> contestable<00:01:25.530> just<00:01:25.830> coming<00:01:26.040> out<00:01:26.100> of

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
I mean contestable just coming out of

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.520 
I mean contestable just coming out of
everything<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.360> power<00:01:27.600> supply<00:01:27.930> it's

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
everything on this power supply it's

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.890 
everything on this power supply it's
actually<00:01:28.860> from<00:01:29.400> what<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.520> read<00:01:29.820> it's<00:01:30.689> pretty

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
actually from what I read it's pretty

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.550 
actually from what I read it's pretty
cool<00:01:31.110> because<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:32.960> start<00:01:33.960> testing<00:01:34.409> out

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
cool because you can start testing out

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.590 
cool because you can start testing out
like<00:01:35.130> different<00:01:35.490> devices<00:01:35.729> maybe<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.329> have

problems<00:01:41.130> or<00:01:41.280> something<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.570> know

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
problems or something you can you know

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.920 
problems or something you can you know
plug<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.729> don't<00:01:44.790> know<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.479> let's

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
plug it in I don't know this is let's

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.289 
plug it in I don't know this is let's
just<00:01:46.110> get<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:46.380> with<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.619> test

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
just get on with the test

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:48.609 
just get on with the test
all<00:01:47.810> right<00:01:47.930> so<00:01:48.079> now<00:01:48.170> I'm<00:01:48.229> gonna<00:01:48.320> go<00:01:48.439> ahead<00:01:48.530> and

I do have an on/off switch on the back
of<00:01:55.070> this<00:01:55.159> power<00:01:55.369> supply<00:01:55.520> I'm<00:01:55.909> going<00:01:56.090> to<00:01:56.149> go

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
of this power supply I'm going to go

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.810 
of this power supply I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.450> flip<00:01:56.600> it<00:01:56.750> right<00:01:56.899> now<00:01:57.640> okay

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
ahead and flip it right now okay

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.620 
ahead and flip it right now okay
just<00:01:59.090> lit<00:01:59.299> up<00:01:59.710> and<00:02:00.909> I<00:02:01.909> don't<00:02:02.000> forget<00:02:02.329> to<00:02:02.479> read

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
just lit up and I don't forget to read

maybe<00:02:09.280> alright<00:02:10.750> with<00:02:11.750> our<00:02:11.780> +5<00:02:12.680> volts<00:02:13.010> we<00:02:13.099> got

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
maybe alright with our +5 volts we got

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.809 
maybe alright with our +5 volts we got
5.2<00:02:14.709> close<00:02:15.709> 12<00:02:15.950> volts<00:02:16.220> we<00:02:16.310> got<00:02:16.400> twelve<00:02:16.640> point

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
5.2 close 12 volts we got twelve point

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.180 
5.2 close 12 volts we got twelve point
seven<00:02:17.140> two<00:02:18.140> point<00:02:18.170> three<00:02:18.500> bulls<00:02:20.799> 12<00:02:21.799> volts<00:02:22.040> out

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
seven two point three bulls 12 volts out

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.039 
seven two point three bulls 12 volts out
of<00:02:22.280> them<00:02:22.370> point<00:02:22.640> eight<00:02:25.150> that's<00:02:26.150> my<00:02:26.299> slope<00:02:26.630> is<00:02:26.840> 2

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
of them point eight that's my slope is 2

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:34.210 
of them point eight that's my slope is 2
I<00:02:28.780> don't<00:02:29.780> know<00:02:29.959> what<00:02:30.170> PG<00:02:30.560> is<00:02:31.239> but<00:02:33.010> some<00:02:34.010> about

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
I don't know what PG is but some about

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.460 
I don't know what PG is but some about
Mille<00:02:34.459> seconds<00:02:34.910> maybe<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.450> don't<00:02:35.810> know<00:02:35.900> but<00:02:36.829> I

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
Mille seconds maybe I don't know but I

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.080 
Mille seconds maybe I don't know but I
know<00:02:39.470> this<00:02:39.709> thing<00:02:39.860> is<00:02:39.920> good<00:02:40.130> because<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:40.880> works

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
know this thing is good because it works

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.319 
know this thing is good because it works
so<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:42.130> don't<00:02:43.130> have<00:02:43.459> to<00:02:43.549> read<00:02:43.700> up<00:02:43.819> and<00:02:43.970> to<00:02:44.090> see

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
so I don't have to read up and to see

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:45.970 
so I don't have to read up and to see
what<00:02:44.630> what<00:02:45.079> kind<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.319> messages<00:02:45.739> we'd<00:02:45.890> be

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
what what kind of messages we'd be

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.880 
what what kind of messages we'd be
getting<00:02:46.129> if<00:02:46.400> it's<00:02:46.610> if<00:02:47.540> it's<00:02:47.690> no<00:02:47.959> good<00:02:48.170> or<00:02:48.440> if<00:02:48.620> it

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
getting if it's if it's no good or if it

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.100 
getting if it's if it's no good or if it
senses<00:02:49.670> of<00:02:49.879> problem<00:02:50.209> I'm<00:02:50.329> sure<00:02:50.360> maybe<00:02:50.780> if<00:02:50.959> when

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
senses of problem I'm sure maybe if when

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.780 
senses of problem I'm sure maybe if when
I<00:02:51.200> get<00:02:51.350> 12<00:02:51.560> volts<00:02:51.859> it'll<00:02:52.040> say<00:02:52.160> zero<00:02:52.459> but<00:02:52.760> I

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
I get 12 volts it'll say zero but I

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.199 
I get 12 volts it'll say zero but I
don't<00:02:52.970> know<00:02:53.060> if<00:02:53.180> it'll<00:02:53.709> also<00:02:54.790> light<00:02:55.790> anything

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
don't know if it'll also light anything
