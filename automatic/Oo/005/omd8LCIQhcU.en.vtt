00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
I thought was amazing so I'm not

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.740 
I thought was amazing so I'm not
expecting<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.000> on<00:01:18.179> that<00:01:18.360> kind<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.690> level

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
expecting it to be on that kind of level

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.380 
expecting it to be on that kind of level
probably<00:01:19.649> be<00:01:19.770> somewhere<00:01:20.100> between<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.789> Alfred

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
probably be somewhere between the Alfred

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.630 
probably be somewhere between the Alfred
from<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.690> first<00:01:21.899> Batman<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:23.009> know<00:01:23.069> the<00:01:23.190> 90s

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
from the first Batman you know the 90s

from the first Batman you know the 90s
well<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.630> should<00:01:24.960> say<00:01:24.990> 1989<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:26.369> into<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.090> 90s

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
well I should say 1989 to into the 90s

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.560 
well I should say 1989 to into the 90s

Batman<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.229> Robin<00:01:31.619> Alfred<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.399> forget<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
Batman and Robin Alfred I forget the

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.310

name<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.180> actor<00:01:33.450> who<00:01:33.540> did<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.899> but<00:01:34.110> I

name of the actor who did that but I

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.990 
name of the actor who did that but I
think<00:01:34.590> it'll<00:01:34.860> be<00:01:34.890> somewhere<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.310> between<00:01:35.490> you

of the sort they can make it work

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.909 
of the sort they can make it work
they'll<00:06:33.599> make<00:06:33.810> it<00:06:33.930> work<00:06:34.080> regardless<00:06:34.560> there's

too<00:06:35.099> much<00:06:35.220> money<00:06:35.460> involved<00:06:35.699> for<00:06:35.880> them<00:06:36.000> to

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
too much money involved for them to

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.270 
too much money involved for them to
screw<00:06:36.210> it<00:06:36.419> up<00:06:36.479> but<00:06:37.110> it's<00:06:37.259> just<00:06:37.650> not<00:06:37.710> a<00:06:37.860> great

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:38.280 
screw it up but it's just not a great

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.249 
screw it up but it's just not a great
casting<00:06:38.880> choice<00:06:39.090> I<00:06:39.300> think<00:06:39.509> personally<00:06:39.870> it's

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:40.259 
casting choice I think personally it's

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:42.529 
casting choice I think personally it's
just<00:06:40.409> it's<00:06:40.650> just<00:06:40.740> not<00:06:41.039> he's<00:06:41.370> not<00:06:41.669> a<00:06:41.909> great

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:42.539 
just it's just not he's not a great

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:45.469 
just it's just not he's not a great
choice<00:06:42.840> for<00:06:43.199> an<00:06:43.470> intimidating<00:06:44.310> version<00:06:45.270> of

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 
choice for an intimidating version of

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:48.770 
choice for an intimidating version of
Lex<00:06:46.169> Luthor<00:06:46.680> that<00:06:46.979> I<00:06:47.130> think<00:06:47.550> we<00:06:47.729> need<00:06:48.000> even

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
Lex Luthor that I think we need even

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.180 
Lex Luthor that I think we need even
more<00:06:48.810> so<00:06:49.229> than<00:06:49.380> a<00:06:49.440> regular<00:06:49.650> the<00:06:49.860> villain

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190 
more so than a regular the villain

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:52.790 
more so than a regular the villain
because<00:06:50.729> we<00:06:51.330> know<00:06:51.539> the<00:06:51.570> Superman<00:06:52.320> could<00:06:52.500> smash

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 
because we know the Superman could smash

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.649 
because we know the Superman could smash
up<00:06:53.009> at<00:06:53.099> any<00:06:53.280> time<00:06:53.520> so<00:06:55.460> yeah<00:06:56.460> it's<00:06:57.210> kind<00:06:57.510> of<00:06:57.539> an

00:06:57.649 --> 00:06:57.659 
up at any time so yeah it's kind of an

00:06:57.659 --> 00:07:00.200 
up at any time so yeah it's kind of an
extreme<00:06:58.110> though<00:06:58.349> because<00:06:58.680> as<00:06:59.190> small<00:06:59.820> as<00:06:59.969> he<00:07:00.090> is

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:00.210 
extreme though because as small as he is

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:02.719 
extreme though because as small as he is
compared<00:07:00.750> it<00:07:00.870> to<00:07:00.900> Henry<00:07:01.229> Cavill<00:07:01.620> its<00:07:02.010> kind

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:02.729 
compared it to Henry Cavill its kind

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:05.299 
compared it to Henry Cavill its kind
like<00:07:02.879> it's<00:07:03.809> kind<00:07:04.110> of<00:07:04.139> like<00:07:04.229> the<00:07:04.379> physicality

00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:05.309 
like it's kind of like the physicality

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:11.299 
like it's kind of like the physicality
of<00:07:05.610> that<00:07:06.210> whole<00:07:08.569> thing<00:07:09.860> brought<00:07:10.860> to<00:07:11.099> life

00:07:11.299 --> 00:07:11.309 
of that whole thing brought to life

00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:13.850 
of that whole thing brought to life
because<00:07:11.699> he's<00:07:11.879> so<00:07:12.240> much<00:07:12.449> smaller<00:07:12.809> he<00:07:13.650> actually
