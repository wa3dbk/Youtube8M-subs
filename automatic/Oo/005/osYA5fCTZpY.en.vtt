00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:19.929
 Here's a tip so if there is no sandpaper 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:23.099
 You can sharpen the knife using the floor cooking 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:26.259
 i.e. gross grinder 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.759
 just want to say right now that you are doing 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.580
 that is, you need to be careful because this 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.890

 get injured take measures 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:40.199
 security we take a corpse just not 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:43.110
 the cutting wheel is the grinding wheel 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.520
 set on the grinder 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.219
 the circle is set on the grinder and 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.140
 balalaika indulge so that was 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.780
 steady position so she doesn't 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.410
 slid did not spin at startup yet 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.840
 time I say 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.640
 observe safety precautions as 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.760

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.750

 Well, the parties sharpened now 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.330
 turn the knife over to the other side of it 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.330
 learn the other side 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:43.030
 chickpeas three times from each country will be 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:46.940
 enough now to remove the burrs 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.040
 you can walk a few stretchers 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.060
 grind and 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:55.060
 taken such a small sandpaper and on it 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.060
 start up 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.640
 Well, not quite 1 to 10 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.209

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.000
 polish with me this part of the knife

 Kiev points this knife was found on 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.620
 scrap metal rusty and dirty from did

 I cut off the handle now Iâ€™ll show you how he is 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.410
 must be cut by the knife to normal 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:49.660
 so it will cut the old knife if you 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.970
 Sharpen it well but of course 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.810
