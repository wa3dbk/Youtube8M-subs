inside<00:01:34.340> now<00:01:35.180> most<00:01:35.450> of<00:01:35.540> these<00:01:35.630> stereos<00:01:36.140> like

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
inside now most of these stereos like

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.240 
inside now most of these stereos like
this<00:01:36.410> are<00:01:36.500> going<00:01:36.619> to<00:01:36.680> be<00:01:36.740> pretty<00:01:36.890> much<00:01:37.070> the

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
this are going to be pretty much the

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.639 
this are going to be pretty much the
same<00:01:37.399> you're<00:01:38.180> going<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:38.570> have<00:01:38.810> big

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 
same you're going to have big

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:41.050 
same you're going to have big
transformer<00:01:40.399> in<00:01:40.460> there<00:01:40.610> copper<00:01:40.910> bearing

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
transformer in there copper bearing

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.330 
transformer in there copper bearing
motor<00:01:41.300> you<00:01:41.960> have<00:01:42.200> some<00:01:42.380> aluminum<00:01:42.830> heat<00:01:42.950> sinks

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
motor you have some aluminum heat sinks

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.999 
motor you have some aluminum heat sinks
in<00:01:43.460> here<00:01:43.840> and<00:01:44.840> you<00:01:45.259> have<00:01:45.470> some<00:01:45.500> low<00:01:45.800> grade

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
in here and you have some low grade

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.389 
in here and you have some low grade
boards<00:01:47.380> pretty<00:01:48.380> much<00:01:48.500> that<00:01:48.770> set<00:01:49.009> as<00:01:49.130> a<00:01:49.160> few

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
boards pretty much that set as a few

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.130 
boards pretty much that set as a few
other<00:01:49.610> little<00:01:49.729> motors<00:01:50.179> especially<00:01:50.959> this<00:01:51.080> is

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
other little motors especially this is

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.130 
other little motors especially this is
going<00:01:51.350> to<00:01:51.410> like<00:01:51.679> a<00:01:51.740> tape<00:01:51.950> deck<00:01:52.130> so<00:01:53.030> let's<00:01:53.720> let's

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
going to like a tape deck so let's let's

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.419 
going to like a tape deck so let's let's
get<00:01:54.229> the<00:01:54.319> recessed<00:01:54.619> part<00:01:56.619> part<00:01:57.619> of<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.920> CD

00:01:58.419 --> 00:01:58.429

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
changer let see a low grade board in

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.990 
changer let see a low grade board in
here<00:02:05.530> we've<00:02:06.530> got<00:02:06.770> two<00:02:07.190> small<00:02:07.399> copper<00:02:07.759> bearing

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
here we've got two small copper bearing

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.710 
here we've got two small copper bearing
motors<00:02:12.700> alright<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:13.910> here's<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.180> main<00:02:14.420> board

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
motors alright so here's the main board

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:21.050 
motors alright so here's the main board
that<00:02:14.870> was<00:02:14.930> in<00:02:15.080> there<00:02:15.280> this

check it with a magnet listen stick so
little<00:02:24.909> nun<00:02:31.230> big<00:02:32.230> chocolate<00:02:35.250> for<00:02:36.250> this<00:02:36.640> board

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
little nun big chocolate for this board

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.410 
little nun big chocolate for this board
just<00:02:38.400> box<00:02:39.400> to<00:02:39.640> see<00:02:39.790> if<00:02:39.819> there's<00:02:40.060> anything<00:02:40.239> in

power cord here and strip that for the
copper<00:04:54.760> I<00:04:56.400> usually<00:04:57.400> strip<00:04:57.610> anything<00:04:57.970> that

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
copper I usually strip anything that

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.640 
copper I usually strip anything that
size<00:04:58.360> a<00:04:58.389> bigger<00:04:59.220> and<00:05:00.220> that's<00:05:00.970> about<00:05:01.150> it<00:05:01.270> so<00:05:01.650> if
