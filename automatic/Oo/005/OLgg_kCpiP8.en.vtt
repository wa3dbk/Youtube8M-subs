00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.639 

all<00:00:05.850> right<00:00:06.060> you're<00:00:06.240> looking<00:00:06.509> at<00:00:06.660> a<00:00:06.690> number<00:00:07.170> 40

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
all right you're looking at a number 40

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.250 
all right you're looking at a number 40
chain<00:00:07.890> on<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.130> bicycle<00:00:09.120> chain<00:00:09.150> right<00:00:09.570> there's

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
chain on a bicycle chain right there's

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.700 
chain on a bicycle chain right there's
actually<00:00:10.620> two<00:00:10.920> chain<00:00:11.309> rings<00:00:11.580> welded<00:00:12.059> together

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.710 
actually two chain rings welded together

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.910 
actually two chain rings welded together
they're<00:00:13.710> flat<00:00:13.980> faces<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.790> then<00:00:15.030> they<00:00:15.179> were

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
they're flat faces and then they were

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.620 
they're flat faces and then they were
hammered<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.340> tips<00:00:17.670> were<00:00:17.850> hammered<00:00:18.210> in<00:00:18.359> and

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
hammered the tips were hammered in and

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.380 
hammered the tips were hammered in and
then<00:00:19.529> here<00:00:19.800> I'm<00:00:19.920> tracking<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.550> alignment<00:00:21.029> and

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
then here I'm tracking the alignment and

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.040 
then here I'm tracking the alignment and
balance<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.830> system<00:00:23.539> and<00:00:24.539> this<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.840> just

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
balance of that system and this is just

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.420 
balance of that system and this is just
for<00:00:25.170> fun<00:00:25.230> we're<00:00:25.590> actually<00:00:25.680> looking<00:00:26.039> at<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
for fun we're actually looking at the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.210 
for fun we're actually looking at the
Arduino<00:00:27.000> code<00:00:27.359> for<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.590> look<00:00:28.830> at<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
Arduino code for this and look at the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.939 
Arduino code for this and look at the
breaker<00:00:29.880> switch<00:00:30.060> cruise<00:00:30.630> control<00:00:31.080> there's<00:00:31.769> an

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
breaker switch cruise control there's an

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.430 
breaker switch cruise control there's an
amp<00:00:32.130> limiting<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.050> maybe<00:00:34.050> some<00:00:34.260> other

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
amp limiting and maybe some other

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:43.610 
amp limiting and maybe some other
details<00:00:36.440> mega<00:00:37.940> mechatronics<00:00:42.290> okay<00:00:43.290> here<00:00:43.530> I'm

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
details mega mechatronics okay here I'm

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.580 
details mega mechatronics okay here I'm
doing<00:00:43.860> some<00:00:44.420> debugging<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
doing some debugging on the for the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.279 
doing some debugging on the for the
arduino<00:00:47.190> motor<00:00:48.000> controller<00:00:50.840> motor<00:00:51.840> control

arduino motor controller motor control
unit<00:00:52.800> essentially<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.780> few<00:00:55.559> inputs

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
unit essentially and I have a few inputs

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.340 
unit essentially and I have a few inputs
here's<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.280> throttle<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.870> would<00:00:57.989> be<00:00:58.109> like<00:00:58.260> the

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
here's a throttle that would be like the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.500 
here's a throttle that would be like the
handgrips<00:00:58.770> throttle<00:00:59.280> here's<00:01:00.149> going<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.480> a

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
handgrips throttle here's going to be a

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.149 
handgrips throttle here's going to be a
momentary<00:01:01.109> cruise<00:01:02.010> control<00:01:02.399> switch<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.030> a

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
momentary cruise control switch and a

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.149 
momentary cruise control switch and a
brake<00:01:05.159> switch<00:01:05.400> here<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.210> will<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.780> know<00:01:06.840> be

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
brake switch here that will you know be

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.190 
brake switch here that will you know be
activated<00:01:08.159> when<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.340> brake<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:09.020> turned<00:01:10.020> on

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
activated when the brake is turned on

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.460 
activated when the brake is turned on
and<00:01:10.670> that's<00:01:11.670> going<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.909> cut<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.210> motor<00:01:12.420> off<00:01:12.659> of

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and that's going to cut the motor off of

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.109 
and that's going to cut the motor off of
course<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:15.110> these<00:01:16.110> LEDs<00:01:16.560> up<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:17.009> are<00:01:17.159> this

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
course and these LEDs up here are this

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.929 
course and these LEDs up here are this
is<00:01:18.360> amperage<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.310> this<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.490> some<00:01:20.729> voltage

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
is amperage and this is some voltage

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.030 
is amperage and this is some voltage
stuff<00:01:21.830> just<00:01:22.830> for<00:01:23.040> visual<00:01:23.490> feedback<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.890> got

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
stuff just for visual feedback and I got

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.300 
stuff just for visual feedback and I got
the<00:01:26.189> program<00:01:26.400> written<00:01:26.939> here<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:29.700> it's<00:01:30.060> about

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
the program written here and it's about

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.600 
the program written here and it's about
6300<00:01:32.310> bytes<00:01:33.020> so<00:01:34.020> we'll<00:01:34.170> go<00:01:34.320> ahead<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:35.340> upload

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
6300 bytes so we'll go ahead and upload

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:47.570 
6300 bytes so we'll go ahead and upload
that

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.150 

okay<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.960> then<00:01:49.110> we'll<00:01:49.290> go<00:01:49.530> ahead<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.710> start

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
okay and then we'll go ahead and start

00:01:50.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
okay and then we'll go ahead and start
the<00:01:50.640> serial<00:01:52.370> for<00:01:53.370> debugging<00:01:53.760> here

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.050 

all<00:02:00.690> right<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:02.190> let's<00:02:02.340> test<00:02:02.520> out<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.820> throttle

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
all right so let's test out the throttle

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:10.420 
all right so let's test out the throttle
and<00:02:03.930> you'll<00:02:04.050> see<00:02:04.230> the<00:02:04.350> pulse<00:02:06.350> zoom<00:02:07.350> in<00:02:07.500> here

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.280 

okay<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.580> pulse<00:02:11.820> will<00:02:12.030> go<00:02:12.210> all<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.480> way<00:02:12.600> up<00:02:12.840> to

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
okay the pulse will go all the way up to

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.030 
okay the pulse will go all the way up to
254<00:02:14.100> where<00:02:14.910> I<00:02:14.940> constrained<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.770> so<00:02:16.770> let's<00:02:16.920> say

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
254 where I constrained it so let's say

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.940 
254 where I constrained it so let's say
we're<00:02:17.190> driving<00:02:17.520> along<00:02:17.760> and<00:02:18.710> throttle<00:02:19.710> sticks

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
we're driving along and throttle sticks

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.510 
we're driving along and throttle sticks
on<00:02:20.160> we<00:02:21.060> can<00:02:21.240> hold<00:02:21.390> down<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.890> brake<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.220> it

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
on we can hold down the brake and it

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.060 
on we can hold down the brake and it
goes<00:02:23.700> in<00:02:23.850> to<00:02:23.940> shut<00:02:24.150> down<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.450> while<00:02:24.870> loop<00:02:25.290> for<00:02:26.040> a

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
goes in to shut down a while loop for a

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.460 
goes in to shut down a while loop for a
while<00:02:26.280> that's<00:02:26.550> high<00:02:26.820> sets<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.810> pulse<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.230> zero

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
while that's high sets the pulse to zero

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.920 
while that's high sets the pulse to zero
and<00:02:29.220> let<00:02:29.430> off<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.930> brake<00:02:31.730> cetera<00:02:32.730> okay<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:33.600> now

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
and let off the brake cetera okay so now

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.710 
and let off the brake cetera okay so now
we'll<00:02:34.560> test<00:02:34.770> out<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.100> cruise<00:02:35.340> control<00:02:35.420> so<00:02:36.420> we

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
we'll test out the cruise control so we

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.350 
we'll test out the cruise control so we
have<00:02:36.810> a<00:02:36.840> varying<00:02:37.530> input<00:02:37.770> based<00:02:38.520> on<00:02:38.820> whatever

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
have a varying input based on whatever

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.570 
have a varying input based on whatever
i'm<00:02:39.720> variate<00:02:40.140> -<00:02:40.320> so<00:02:40.500> i<00:02:40.530> set<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:40.860> to<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.100> level<00:02:41.490> I

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
i'm variate - so i set it to a level I

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.330 
i'm variate - so i set it to a level I
like<00:02:41.820> I<00:02:42.170> click<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.320> momentary<00:02:43.890> switch<00:02:44.190> it

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
like I click the momentary switch it

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.699 
like I click the momentary switch it
goes<00:02:44.520> into<00:02:44.730> cruise<00:02:45.060> mode<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:46.020> to<00:02:46.110> toggle<00:02:46.470> the

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
goes into cruise mode so to toggle the

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.100 
goes into cruise mode so to toggle the
while<00:02:46.950> loop<00:02:47.310> I'll<00:02:48.270> change<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.720> throttle

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
while loop I'll change the throttle

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.160 
while loop I'll change the throttle
input<00:02:49.440> right<00:02:49.680> now<00:02:49.830> to<00:02:49.890> zero<00:02:50.480> or<00:02:51.480> or<00:02:51.690> any<00:02:51.930> number

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
input right now to zero or or any number

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.260 
input right now to zero or or any number
and<00:02:52.530> I'll<00:02:52.770> shut<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.070> off<00:02:53.340> by<00:02:53.640> hitting<00:02:53.790> the

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
and I'll shut it off by hitting the

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.940 
and I'll shut it off by hitting the
cruise<00:02:54.540> again<00:02:54.800> oops

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
cruise again oops

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.230 
cruise again oops
shouldn't<00:02:56.670> turn<00:02:56.850> it<00:02:57.000> back<00:02:57.150> on<00:02:58.850> so<00:02:59.850> I<00:02:59.880> got<00:03:00.060> some

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
shouldn't turn it back on so I got some

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.740 
shouldn't turn it back on so I got some
debouncing<00:03:00.870> debugging<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:01.590> still<00:03:02.390> so<00:03:03.390> I'll

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
debouncing debugging and still so I'll

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.710 
debouncing debugging and still so I'll
set<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.170> pulse<00:03:04.350> again<00:03:05.420> we'll<00:03:06.420> turn<00:03:06.570> the

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
set the pulse again we'll turn the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.479 
set the pulse again we'll turn the
cruise<00:03:06.959> on<00:03:07.850> it<00:03:08.850> sticks<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.330> at<00:03:09.450> 78<00:03:10.370> click<00:03:11.370> it

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
cruise on it sticks it at 78 click it

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.479 
cruise on it sticks it at 78 click it
again<00:03:11.840> we're<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.110> I<00:03:13.320> actually<00:03:13.980> shut<00:03:14.190> off<00:03:14.310> the

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
again we're and I actually shut off the

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.060 
again we're and I actually shut off the
pulse<00:03:14.730> while<00:03:15.000> I<00:03:15.030> was<00:03:15.269> cruising<00:03:15.769> so<00:03:16.769> again

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
pulse while I was cruising so again

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.350 
pulse while I was cruising so again
we'll<00:03:17.280> do<00:03:17.430> another<00:03:17.610> test

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
we'll do another test

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.620 
we'll do another test
cruising<00:03:19.260> 72<00:03:20.040> pulse<00:03:20.310> now<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.030> hit<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.360> brake

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
cruising 72 pulse now I hit the brake

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.590 
cruising 72 pulse now I hit the brake
shuts<00:03:22.470> it<00:03:22.620> down<00:03:22.730> just<00:03:23.730> like<00:03:23.880> a<00:03:23.910> regular<00:03:24.180> car

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
shuts it down just like a regular car

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.710 
shuts it down just like a regular car
again<00:03:25.200> I'll<00:03:25.380> set<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.739> pulse<00:03:26.330> hit<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.480> brake

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
again I'll set the pulse hit the brake

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.380 
again I'll set the pulse hit the brake
momentarily<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:31.430> it<00:03:32.430> shuts<00:03:32.700> off<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:32.940> cruise

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
momentarily and it shuts off the cruise

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.170 
momentarily and it shuts off the cruise
and<00:03:34.489> then<00:03:35.489> let's<00:03:35.760> do<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.239> cruise<00:03:36.930> panic<00:03:37.769> stop<00:03:38.180> so

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
and then let's do a cruise panic stop so

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.970 
and then let's do a cruise panic stop so
we're<00:03:39.330> in<00:03:39.510> cruise<00:03:39.900> mode<00:03:40.700> 126<00:03:42.650> smile<00:03:43.650> child

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
we're in cruise mode 126 smile child

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.310 
we're in cruise mode 126 smile child
runs<00:03:44.250> into<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.850> sidewalk<00:03:45.299> I'm<00:03:45.930> going<00:03:46.080> to<00:03:46.140> grab

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
runs into the sidewalk I'm going to grab

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.740 
runs into the sidewalk I'm going to grab
onto<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.739> brake<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:47.310> it<00:03:47.760> shuts<00:03:48.120> off<00:03:48.299> Cruise

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
onto the brake and it shuts off Cruise

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.160 
onto the brake and it shuts off Cruise
and<00:03:49.110> then<00:03:49.230> goes<00:03:49.440> and<00:03:49.620> immediately<00:03:50.280> goes<00:03:50.580> into

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
and then goes and immediately goes into

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.080 
and then goes and immediately goes into
shutdown<00:03:52.170> so<00:03:52.440> zero<00:03:52.769> pulse<00:03:53.570> there<00:03:54.950> and<00:03:55.970> so<00:03:56.970> I'm

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
shutdown so zero pulse there and so I'm

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.680 
shutdown so zero pulse there and so I'm
going<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.269> switch<00:03:57.450> over<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:59.690> potentiometer

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
going to switch over the potentiometer

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.620 
going to switch over the potentiometer
to<00:04:01.680> the<00:04:02.610> amperage<00:04:03.060> output

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:14.300 

and<00:04:08.630> we'll<00:04:08.840> play<00:04:08.990> with<00:04:09.170> that

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.490 

so<00:04:14.940> if<00:04:15.090> you<00:04:15.209> watch<00:04:15.390> their<00:04:17.720> Hall<00:04:18.720> millivolts<00:04:19.440> so

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
so if you watch their Hall millivolts so

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.099 
so if you watch their Hall millivolts so
that's<00:04:19.829> going<00:04:20.040> to<00:04:20.100> start<00:04:20.310> kicking<00:04:20.519> in<00:04:20.760> around

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
that's going to start kicking in around

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:27.740 
that's going to start kicking in around
23<00:04:22.400> 25<00:04:24.350> so<00:04:25.350> now<00:04:25.470> watch<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.889> amps<00:04:26.510> so<00:04:27.510> there's

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
23 25 so now watch the amps so there's

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.110 
23 25 so now watch the amps so there's
this<00:04:27.900> obviously<00:04:28.860> zero<00:04:29.160> point<00:04:29.520> that's<00:04:29.790> about

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
this obviously zero point that's about

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.990 
this obviously zero point that's about
right<00:04:30.300> there<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:31.830> hall<00:04:32.040> is<00:04:32.370> would<00:04:32.850> be

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
right there the hall is would be

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.129 
right there the hall is would be
activated<00:04:35.030> and<00:04:36.030> then<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:36.360> start<00:04:36.720> feeding<00:04:36.930> in

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
activated and then I start feeding in

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:42.020 
activated and then I start feeding in
amps<00:04:37.530> it<00:04:38.400> goes<00:04:38.610> through<00:04:38.910> calculation<00:04:40.970> now<00:04:41.970> you

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
amps it goes through calculation now you

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.590 
amps it goes through calculation now you
can<00:04:42.300> see<00:04:42.480> I'm<00:04:42.840> hitting<00:04:43.139> an<00:04:43.230> over-limit<00:04:44.600> so

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
can see I'm hitting an over-limit so

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.590 
can see I'm hitting an over-limit so
that's<00:04:45.780> going<00:04:45.960> to<00:04:46.020> actually<00:04:46.260> shut<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:47.600> start

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
that's going to actually shut the start

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.750 
that's going to actually shut the start
cutting<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:48.930> pulse<00:04:49.140> back<00:04:49.410> I<00:04:49.740> still<00:04:50.580> have<00:04:50.669> to

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
cutting the pulse back I still have to

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.760 
cutting the pulse back I still have to
do<00:04:51.120> some<00:04:51.300> testing<00:04:51.660> there<00:04:51.900> so<00:04:52.350> let's<00:04:52.500> play<00:04:52.740> with

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
do some testing there so let's play with

00:04:52.770 --> 00:05:01.130 
do some testing there so let's play with
the<00:04:54.380> user<00:04:55.380> lights<00:04:56.070> here<00:04:56.340> so<00:04:57.620> it's<00:04:58.620> about<00:04:58.830> a<00:05:00.140> 5

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
the user lights here so it's about a 5

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:07.700 
the user lights here so it's about a 5
10<00:05:01.350> 15<00:05:01.890> 20<00:05:02.270> 25<00:05:03.270> 30<00:05:03.960> 35<00:05:04.080> 40<00:05:04.620> 45<00:05:05.130> 50<00:05:05.669> and<00:05:06.570> I<00:05:07.260> change

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 and I change

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.040 
10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 and I change
that<00:05:07.919> it's<00:05:08.160> varying<00:05:08.669> the<00:05:08.820> brightness<00:05:09.300> oh<00:05:09.540> let

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
that it's varying the brightness oh let

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:17.270 
that it's varying the brightness oh let
me<00:05:10.140> get<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:10.350> cap<00:05:10.530> out<00:05:10.770> of<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:10.919> way<00:05:16.220> okay<00:05:17.220> so

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
me get the cap out of the way okay so

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.440 
me get the cap out of the way okay so
that<00:05:18.000> we're<00:05:18.810> at<00:05:18.900> 7<00:05:19.910> goes<00:05:20.910> the<00:05:21.030> second

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
that we're at 7 goes the second

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.370 
that we're at 7 goes the second
brightness<00:05:21.810> we<00:05:21.960> just<00:05:22.169> hit<00:05:22.320> 12<00:05:24.380> first

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
brightness we just hit 12 first

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.400 
brightness we just hit 12 first
brightness<00:05:26.900> there<00:05:27.900> at<00:05:28.020> 17<00:05:28.820> second<00:05:29.820> brightness

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
brightness there at 17 second brightness

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:44.570 
brightness there at 17 second brightness
we<00:05:31.410> are<00:05:31.560> at<00:05:31.740> 24<00:05:33.289> okay<00:05:34.289> or<00:05:34.440> 29<00:05:36.050> 32<00:05:38.960> 37<00:05:41.990> 42<00:05:43.400> ok<00:05:44.400> now

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
we are at 24 okay or 29 32 37 42 ok now

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:51.710 
we are at 24 okay or 29 32 37 42 ok now
we're<00:05:44.760> up<00:05:45.390> to<00:05:45.620> go<00:05:46.620> back<00:05:46.800> here<00:05:47.310> is<00:05:48.650> 48

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:06:07.909 

here<00:05:52.320> is<00:05:52.590> 53<00:05:53.810> that's<00:05:54.810> the<00:05:55.050> max

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.489 

all<00:06:08.400> right<00:06:09.020> I'm<00:06:10.020> still<00:06:10.259> messing<00:06:10.770> with<00:06:10.830> the

00:06:12.489 --> 00:06:12.499 
all right I'm still messing with the

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:15.469 
all right I'm still messing with the
