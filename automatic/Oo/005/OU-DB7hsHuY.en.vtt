it<00:05:02.510> was<00:05:02.630> an<00:05:02.720> impulse<00:05:03.050> buy<00:05:03.200> the<00:05:03.710> only<00:05:03.980> con<00:05:04.310> is

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
it was an impulse buy the only con is

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.430 
it was an impulse buy the only con is
that<00:05:04.670> when<00:05:05.060> you<00:05:05.180> turn<00:05:05.420> it<00:05:05.570> on<00:05:05.660> basically<00:05:06.410> I

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
that when you turn it on basically I

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.960 
that when you turn it on basically I
didn't<00:05:06.710> know<00:05:06.770> how<00:05:06.920> they<00:05:07.070> worked<00:05:07.280> until<00:05:07.490> now

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
didn't know how they worked until now

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.210 
didn't know how they worked until now
there's<00:05:08.780> a<00:05:08.870> light<00:05:09.140> bulb<00:05:09.380> underneath<00:05:09.770> here

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
there's a light bulb underneath here

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.520 
there's a light bulb underneath here
that<00:05:10.370> heats<00:05:10.640> up<00:05:10.940> these<00:05:11.690> sort<00:05:12.020> of<00:05:12.110> bubble

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
that heats up these sort of bubble

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.850 
that heats up these sort of bubble
things<00:05:12.770> and<00:05:13.070> this<00:05:13.400> goop<00:05:14.380> it's<00:05:15.380> actually<00:05:15.740> like

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
things and this goop it's actually like

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.740 
things and this goop it's actually like
a<00:05:15.920> solid<00:05:16.460> lump<00:05:16.820> that<00:05:16.970> sits<00:05:17.330> at<00:05:17.480> the<00:05:17.570> bottom

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
a solid lump that sits at the bottom

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.080 
a solid lump that sits at the bottom
until<00:05:18.260> it's<00:05:18.410> heated<00:05:18.680> enough<00:05:19.100> which<00:05:19.700> takes

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
until it's heated enough which takes

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.180 
until it's heated enough which takes
about<00:05:20.270> four<00:05:20.720> hours<00:05:20.750> to<00:05:21.110> heat<00:05:21.500> so<00:05:21.830> it's<00:05:22.010> not

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
about four hours to heat so it's not

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.160 
about four hours to heat so it's not
like<00:05:22.490> you<00:05:22.670> can<00:05:22.820> just<00:05:22.850> turn<00:05:23.180> it<00:05:23.270> on<00:05:23.450> and<00:05:23.750> off<00:05:23.840> so

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.170 
like you can just turn it on and off so

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:26.470 
like you can just turn it on and off so
I<00:05:24.290> don't<00:05:24.590> use<00:05:24.800> it<00:05:24.830> that<00:05:25.430> much<00:05:25.460> but<00:05:26.180> it's<00:05:26.300> cool

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:26.480 
I don't use it that much but it's cool

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.240 
I don't use it that much but it's cool
to<00:05:26.690> have<00:05:26.870> I<00:05:27.320> talked<00:05:27.590> about<00:05:27.680> this<00:05:27.890> in<00:05:28.010> one<00:05:28.100> of<00:05:28.130> my

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250
