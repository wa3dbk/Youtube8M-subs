00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.609 
with some that used to be awesome at the
wheat<00:01:43.799> but<00:01:44.549> uh<00:01:44.579> yeah<00:01:45.420> that's<00:01:45.600> beyond<00:01:45.930> besides

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
wheat but uh yeah that's beyond besides

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.910

the<00:01:46.799> point<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.509> the<00:01:48.509> reason<00:01:48.689> why<00:01:49.110> i<00:01:49.140> think<00:01:49.500> x

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
the point and the reason why i think x

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.889 
the point and the reason why i think x
marks<00:01:50.009> players<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.700> get<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.180> much<00:01:51.329> credit<00:01:51.600> that

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
marks players to get so much credit that

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.130 
marks players to get so much credit that
they<00:01:51.930> do<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.409> because<00:01:52.890> they<00:01:53.340> pay<00:01:53.549> for<00:01:53.820> their

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
they do is because they pay for their

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.350 
they do is because they pay for their
subscription<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.829> play<00:01:56.070> online<00:01:56.250> now<00:01:57.030> i<00:01:57.060> think

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
subscription to play online now i think

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.719 
subscription to play online now i think
if<00:01:57.750> ps3<00:01:58.409> players<00:01:58.649> had<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.159> pay<00:01:59.310> for<00:01:59.340> their

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
if ps3 players had to pay for their

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.240 
if ps3 players had to pay for their
subscription<00:02:00.390> online<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:01.560> would<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:01.890> an<00:02:01.979> even

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
subscription online it would be an even

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.060 
subscription online it would be an even
playing<00:02:02.640> field<00:02:02.790> everybody<00:02:03.750> would<00:02:03.930> say<00:02:04.259> that

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
playing field everybody would say that

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.730 
playing field everybody would say that
oh<00:02:05.430> there's<00:02:06.270> really<00:02:06.780> no<00:02:07.049> difference<00:02:07.079> in<00:02:07.649> the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
oh there's really no difference in the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.790 
oh there's really no difference in the
players<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.399> just<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.700> controllers<00:02:09.239> or

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
players it's just the controllers or

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.080 
players it's just the controllers or
something<00:02:10.800> along<00:02:10.950> those<00:02:11.310> lines<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.819> don't<00:02:12.000> know

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
something along those lines I don't know

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.460 
something along those lines I don't know
but

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
but

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.670 
but
I<00:02:13.500> think<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.340> xbox<00:02:14.940> players<00:02:15.260> are<00:02:16.260> worse

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
I think that xbox players are worse

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.760 
I think that xbox players are worse
because<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:18.180> don't<00:02:19.050> know<00:02:19.170> if<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.380> guys<00:02:19.500> have

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
because I don't know if you guys have

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.920 
because I don't know if you guys have
realized<00:02:20.220> this<00:02:20.400> but<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.850> majority<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.360> people

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
realized this but the majority of people

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.710 
realized this but the majority of people
that<00:02:22.110> do<00:02:22.370> trolling<00:02:23.370> on<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:25.670> video<00:02:26.670> games<00:02:26.910> most

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
that do trolling on the video games most

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.130 
that do trolling on the video games most
of<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.990> time<00:02:28.170> it's<00:02:28.500> always<00:02:28.920> on<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.190> xbox<00:02:29.700> now

why is there the debate that xbox
players<00:02:45.300> are<00:02:45.630> better<00:02:45.990> because<00:02:46.320> if<00:02:46.709> there's

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
players are better because if there's

way<00:03:13.470> to<00:03:13.530> do<00:03:13.740> it<00:03:13.770> you<00:03:13.950> know<00:03:13.980> what<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.160> mean<00:03:14.190> like

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
way to do it you know what I mean like

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.940 
way to do it you know what I mean like
maybe<00:03:15.090> use<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.510> controller<00:03:16.140> adapter

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
maybe use a controller adapter

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.970 
maybe use a controller adapter
converters<00:03:17.850> that<00:03:18.150> like<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.290> I<00:03:19.320> have<00:03:19.680> I'm

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
and i'll leave the link down in the

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.470 
and i'll leave the link down in the
description<00:03:25.709> below<00:03:26.250> on<00:03:26.640> a<00:03:26.730> video<00:03:27.000> that<00:03:27.150> talks

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
description below on a video that talks

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.720 
description below on a video that talks
about<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:27.989> which<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.650> done<00:03:28.890> by<00:03:28.920> ronaldinho

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
about it which is done by ronaldinho

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.520 
about it which is done by ronaldinho
1224<00:03:30.510> so<00:03:32.120> like<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.269> think<00:03:33.660> if<00:03:33.840> Xbox<00:03:34.320> players

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
1224 so like I think if Xbox players

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.870 
1224 so like I think if Xbox players
were<00:03:34.709> able<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:34.980> use<00:03:35.100> their<00:03:35.340> controllers<00:03:35.760> on

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
were able to use their controllers on

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.720 
were able to use their controllers on
the<00:03:35.970> ps3<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:36.720> ps3<00:03:37.440> controllers<00:03:38.010> on<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.160> Xbox

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
the ps3 and ps3 controllers on the Xbox

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.170 
the ps3 and ps3 controllers on the Xbox
that<00:03:39.420> that<00:03:40.230> would<00:03:40.410> be<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.590> true<00:03:40.920> test<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.519> I

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
that that would be the true test and I

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.470 
that that would be the true test and I
think<00:03:42.269> if<00:03:42.630> MLG<00:03:43.170> got<00:03:43.920> behind<00:03:44.130> this<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:44.760> had<00:03:45.150> one

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
think if MLG got behind this and had one

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.130 
think if MLG got behind this and had one
of<00:03:45.600> their<00:03:45.750> events<00:03:46.549> have<00:03:47.549> this<00:03:47.910> I<00:03:48.150> think<00:03:48.989> you'd

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
of their events have this I think you'd

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.160 
of their events have this I think you'd
see<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.860> majority<00:03:50.280> of<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.400> time<00:03:50.959> ps3<00:03:51.959> players

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
see the majority of the time ps3 players

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.880 
see the majority of the time ps3 players
winning<00:03:52.500> now<00:03:53.220> I<00:03:53.640> know<00:03:53.880> people<00:03:54.420> will<00:03:55.230> hate<00:03:55.560> that

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
winning now I know people will hate that

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.520 
winning now I know people will hate that
I<00:03:55.920> say<00:03:56.190> that<00:03:56.430> or<00:03:56.730> they'll<00:03:57.239> be<00:03:57.290> upset<00:03:58.290> that<00:03:58.470> I

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
I say that or they'll be upset that I

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.860 
I say that or they'll be upset that I
said<00:03:58.739> that<00:03:58.769> but<00:03:59.220> I<00:03:59.760> feel<00:04:00.180> that<00:04:00.209> this<00:04:00.540> is<00:04:00.600> the

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
said that but I feel that this is the

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.530 
said that but I feel that this is the
truth<00:04:01.170> and<00:04:01.350> if<00:04:01.920> you<00:04:02.160> want<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:02.820> do<00:04:02.910> a<00:04:02.940> commentary
