00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.369
 9. 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.379
 Ask the Bible Man Bible Man is Pastor Gang Byung-Kook 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.140
 this time 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.769
 The following questions came to me pm 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.370
 Who is my fan in the Bible that will appear in Genesis 6. 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.400
 Here, the sons of God are called by many by Christianity 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.140
 Claiming that it is only killing 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.530
 A mummy that claims that human beings are descendants of Cain 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.809
 Depending on the person 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.870
 People 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.649
 Cain's claim 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.359
 But Adam's previous postponement 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:53.070
 I claim to be a person. And with angels 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.770
 Human beings 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.790
 I hear you are the first descendants, but who is Neville? 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.300
 I will. 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.870
 The cost of compassion. 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.120
 It means ag. It means big. 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.590
 By the way 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.350
 A baby 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.860
 Genesis 6 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.990
 In addition to the non-domestic b2b appearance, the same word 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.530
 Numbers 13 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.540
 It also appears in verse 32 and 33. 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.470
 Here is what I have to say 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.690
 The land which the sons of Israel have discovered before the altar of charity 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.300
 It is dark and others are dark. 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.890
 It's a bankruptcy crisis. 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.610
 If we did not carry it around, 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.670
 All the peoples who are seen there from the earth 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.900
 The kidneys are the little ones. 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.520
 I feel it in there, too. 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.170
 After that, it looks like a grasshopper on its own. 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.060
 They look the same. 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.950
 To do something 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.040
 I can see what you told me. 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.250
 Nephilim 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.710
 The newspapers are derived from Nepal for 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.159
 This is a large physique, but especially violent and cruel 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.560
 People are saying that it's in coffee. 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.300
 Everyone in the flood of Noah 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.650
 There are also tall and small vehicles on the beach 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.389
 Refute 

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:13.629
 People who are looking for flu 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.260
 That it was 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.260
 We can understand what is comfortable. 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.359
 In your ex-team situations, people who are truly godly 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:27.560
 A lot of snow came with the daughters of the fallen Cain boys who did not see 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.370
 As the drama shows, people's eu is getting more and more depressed. 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.850
 The position of the leader is basic. 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.660
 So more violent people Cruel people And they are good 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.330
 Eat well in the environment 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.980
 In such a civilized society that was good 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.640
 They would have done something to make bigger people 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.310
 There is a lot of possibility 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.409
 And so, 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:51.659
 Vision is better than the giants 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:52.629
 Cruel 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:53.369
 savage 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:55.420
 fallen 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.319
 What is a trillion people 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.099
 It is what we can understand in the Bible. 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.010
 Cinnamon Rim 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.590
 Noah's aspirations at the time of the flood, 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.280
 Did not 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.000
 Therefore, after that it is written in Numbers, 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.090
 Not only are people who are tall are matters 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:18.180
 It means that the outlawed people are saying that we 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.699
 I wish I understood 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:20.850
 nice question 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.749
 So thank you 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:23.999
 I do not think so.
