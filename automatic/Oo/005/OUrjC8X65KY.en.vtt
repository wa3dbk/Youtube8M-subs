 so won with rolled up at sneakers 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.030

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.220
 for a shirt with a text on it and me 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.200
 had a long one like that 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.580
 beachy cardigan but really whole 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.020
 light peachy 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.850
 but I did like assisting then 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.620
 is in the same color family 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.380
 like the shoes but then a lot 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.990
 more neutral is it perfectly fine without 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.390
 that it 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.430
 too yeast and yes I like it a lot 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.259
 real 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.259
 wear in this outfit in ripped skinny 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.880
 jeans and a neon color t-shirt 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.470
 in the same course the shoes 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.509
 who happens to be smiling in the closet 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.610
 I'm really happy with the jeans 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.250
 is not a very nice between color 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.259
 dark not very light now rips it 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.870
 a tough effect and then something more 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.180
 I have put together to look like 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.519
 just my cream-colored place archer 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.930
 attracted and I have to say that 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:22.340
 I actually think this is my favorite 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.200
 outfit is also correct 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.420
 super fun is for a black 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.060
 go trousers because that's how it comes 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.069
 the neon even more forward and the 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.150
 actually put the shoes back on and on 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.799
 thought it was really cool 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.690
 and why I keep it very simple 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.030
 with a white wine the blood and 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.860
 over it unwell and tough about six 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.040
 denim jacket what a nice bee 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.630
 the sneakerz fits very cool and you 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.430
 can also take a blouse with you in your pants 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.950
 defecate and then truly your legs right but 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:54.320
 a lot the longer and yes so good 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:56.030
 just get all the attention here as well 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.980
 in this last from that time I see that 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.070
 you can also make it very girlish 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.560
 with all sweet soft pink mini 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.690
 shades and what with such a fan 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.549
 coral color are those shades one 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.230
 little bit in the family 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.180
 but just seem much more subdued 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:14.350
 and then you see that it's nice 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.350
 is true what is for have 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:21.150
 this is an outfit let me know 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.739
 which is your favorite and I am too 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.630
 very curious how you sheet sneakers 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.590
 combines if you have or how you and them 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.330
 would combine 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.069
 don't forget to leave it behind what you do 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.840

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.239
