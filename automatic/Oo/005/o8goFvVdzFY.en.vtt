00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.240 
great storyteller well you kind of said
it<00:01:42.900> you<00:01:43.110> know<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.260> think<00:01:43.620> it<00:01:43.740> hopefully<00:01:44.100> you'll

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
it you know I think it hopefully you'll

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.580 
it you know I think it hopefully you'll
learn<00:01:44.400> something<00:01:44.820> about<00:01:45.300> something<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.140> you

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
learn something about something that you

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.190 
learn something about something that you
know<00:01:46.710> we<00:01:46.920> were<00:01:47.280> not<00:01:47.570> obviously<00:01:48.570> proud<00:01:48.840> about

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
know we were not obviously proud about

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.290 
know we were not obviously proud about
but<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:49.920> think<00:01:50.190> it's<00:01:50.310> great<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.640> expose<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.210> in

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
but I think it's great to expose it in

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.140 
but I think it's great to expose it in
this<00:01:51.390> light<00:01:51.660> and<00:01:51.840> be<00:01:51.930> real<00:01:52.170> about<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.650> and<00:01:53.150> and

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
this light and be real about it and and

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.450 
this light and be real about it and and
and<00:01:54.930> understand<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.800> was<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.980> time<00:01:56.280> in

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
and understand that that was a time in

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.280 
and understand that that was a time in
our<00:01:56.520> past<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.150> that<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.600> know<00:01:57.900> it<00:01:58.050> shouldn't

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
our past and that you know it shouldn't

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.950 
our past and that you know it shouldn't
be<00:01:58.410> forgotten<00:01:58.980> and<00:01:59.970> now<00:02:00.450> during<00:02:00.690> this<00:02:00.900> time

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
be forgotten and now during this time

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.840 
be forgotten and now during this time
you<00:02:01.290> know<00:02:01.380> we've<00:02:01.560> definitely<00:02:01.920> been<00:02:02.430> more

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
you know we've definitely been more

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.970 
you know we've definitely been more
custom<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:04.050> everything<00:02:04.470> that's<00:02:04.590> going<00:02:04.860> on

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
custom to everything that's going on

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.490 
custom to everything that's going on
what's<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:05.490> next<00:02:05.670> step<00:02:05.910> I<00:02:05.970> think<00:02:06.260> I<00:02:07.260> think

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
what's the next step I think I think

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.380 
what's the next step I think I think
it's<00:02:07.650> a<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:07.890> think<00:02:08.010> it's<00:02:08.280> these<00:02:08.700> kind<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.119> things

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
it's a I think it's these kind of things

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.180 
it's a I think it's these kind of things
I<00:02:09.600> think<00:02:09.660> it's<00:02:09.930> educating<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.860> think<00:02:11.070> it's

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
I think it's educating I think it's

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.340 
I think it's educating I think it's
starting<00:02:11.520> with<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.640> kids<00:02:11.990> like<00:02:12.990> I<00:02:13.170> was<00:02:13.320> just

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
starting with the kids like I was just

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.200 
starting with the kids like I was just
doing<00:02:13.770> an<00:02:13.860> interview<00:02:14.190> earlier<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.940> it's<00:02:15.060> like

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
doing an interview earlier and it's like

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.330 
doing an interview earlier and it's like
when<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.450> was<00:02:15.750> in<00:02:15.930> grade<00:02:16.530> school<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:17.040> was<00:02:17.160> like

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
when I was in grade school it was like

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.010 
when I was in grade school it was like
it<00:02:17.610> was<00:02:17.730> something<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.120> should<00:02:18.360> be<00:02:18.510> feared

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
it was something that should be feared

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.770 
it was something that should be feared
and<00:02:19.230> not<00:02:19.410> really<00:02:19.860> known<00:02:20.280> if<00:02:21.180> that<00:02:21.420> makes<00:02:21.660> sense

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
and not really known if that makes sense

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.870 
and not really known if that makes sense
and<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.320> think<00:02:22.350> we<00:02:22.680> can<00:02:22.860> kind<00:02:23.070> of<00:02:23.130> go<00:02:23.280> flip<00:02:23.640> it<00:02:23.790> on

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
and I think we can kind of go flip it on

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.120 
and I think we can kind of go flip it on
its<00:02:23.910> head<00:02:24.150> and<00:02:24.300> and<00:02:24.810> not<00:02:25.110> be<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:25.470> afraid<00:02:25.710> of<00:02:25.860> it

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
its head and and not be so afraid of it

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.340 
its head and and not be so afraid of it
and<00:02:27.140> it's<00:02:28.140> just<00:02:28.320> key<00:02:28.530> in<00:02:28.560> my<00:02:28.890> opinion
