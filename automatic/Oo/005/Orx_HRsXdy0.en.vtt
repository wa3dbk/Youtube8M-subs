00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.780 
so first of all I'm just going to talk
about<00:00:25.690> why<00:00:26.080> i<00:00:26.530> chose<00:00:27.040> the<00:00:27.310> clothes<00:00:27.550> i<00:00:27.670> was

these<00:00:31.510> photos<00:00:31.900> come<00:00:32.080> together<00:00:32.349> so<00:00:32.680> the

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
these photos come together so the

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.450 
these photos come together so the
clothing<00:00:33.670> i<00:00:33.760> chose<00:00:34.150> was<00:00:34.570> plain<00:00:34.900> white<00:00:35.140> and<00:00:35.530> i

want to choose planes or block colors

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.460 
want to choose planes or block colors
because<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.239> contrast<00:00:40.780> with<00:00:41.020> that<00:00:41.200> and<00:00:41.380> this

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
because the contrast with that and this

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.410 
because the contrast with that and this
gritty<00:00:41.860> urban<00:00:42.220> setting<00:00:42.910> is<00:00:43.059> just<00:00:43.300> fantastic

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
gritty urban setting is just fantastic

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.780 
gritty urban setting is just fantastic
it's<00:00:44.050> it's<00:00:44.590> really<00:00:44.770> nice<00:00:45.010> to<00:00:45.070> have<00:00:45.220> different

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
it's it's really nice to have different

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.220 
it's it's really nice to have different
themes<00:00:46.030> running<00:00:46.330> throughout<00:00:46.630> your<00:00:46.809> photos

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
themes running throughout your photos

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.560 
themes running throughout your photos
because<00:00:47.500> otherwise<00:00:47.739> i<00:00:47.860> gave<00:00:48.400> it<00:00:48.520> boring<00:00:48.879> so

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
because otherwise i gave it boring so

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.770 
because otherwise i gave it boring so
the<00:00:50.080> first<00:00:50.230> photo<00:00:50.559> we<00:00:50.890> took<00:00:50.920> today<00:00:51.660> was<00:00:52.660> on

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
the first photo we took today was on

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.690 
the first photo we took today was on
this<00:00:52.960> shutter<00:00:53.230> and<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:54.280> reason<00:00:54.580> we<00:00:54.670> chose

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
this shutter and the reason we chose

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.939 
this shutter and the reason we chose
this<00:00:55.089> photo<00:00:55.390> of<00:00:55.570> all<00:00:56.050> photos<00:00:56.500> we<00:00:56.620> took<00:00:56.650> on<00:00:56.920> the

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
this photo of all photos we took on the

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.759 
this photo of all photos we took on the
shutter<00:00:57.250> was<00:00:57.940> because<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.420> leading<00:00:59.170> lines<00:00:59.440> of

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
shutter was because the leading lines of

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:01.829 
shutter was because the leading lines of
the<00:00:59.860> shutter<00:01:00.070> draw<00:01:00.909> your<00:01:01.089> eyes<00:01:01.239> straight<00:01:01.600> to

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:01.839 
the shutter draw your eyes straight to

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:04.410 
the shutter draw your eyes straight to
the<00:01:01.960> model<00:01:02.640> these<00:01:03.640> subtle<00:01:04.000> things<00:01:04.210> in<00:01:04.360> the

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
the model these subtle things in the

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.940 
the model these subtle things in the
background<00:01:04.780> can<00:01:04.960> really<00:01:05.199> help<00:01:05.320> your<00:01:05.500> picture

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
background can really help your picture

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.730 
background can really help your picture
pop<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:07.450> only<00:01:07.750> thing<00:01:08.020> I<00:01:08.170> don't<00:01:08.409> really<00:01:08.650> like

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
pop the only thing I don't really like

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.230 
pop the only thing I don't really like
about<00:01:08.920> this<00:01:09.040> photo<00:01:09.280> is<00:01:09.490> my<00:01:09.850> eyes<00:01:10.000> were<00:01:10.210> a

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
about this photo is my eyes were a

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.570 
about this photo is my eyes were a
little<00:01:10.480> bit<00:01:10.810> tired<00:01:11.110> and<00:01:11.500> because<00:01:12.040> I'm<00:01:12.190> direct

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
little bit tired and because I'm direct

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.219 
little bit tired and because I'm direct
to<00:01:12.820> camera<00:01:13.270> they<00:01:13.450> should<00:01:13.630> probably<00:01:13.750> be<00:01:14.200> a

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
to camera they should probably be a

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.260 
to camera they should probably be a
little<00:01:14.380> bit<00:01:14.620> more<00:01:14.830> focused<00:01:15.640> on<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:15.909> camera<00:01:16.240> I

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
little bit more focused on the camera I

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.000 
little bit more focused on the camera I
think<00:01:16.479> I<00:01:16.540> was<00:01:16.659> daydreaming<00:01:16.870> a<00:01:17.290> little<00:01:17.590> bit<00:01:17.740> but

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
think I was daydreaming a little bit but

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.830 
think I was daydreaming a little bit but
other<00:01:18.490> than<00:01:18.760> that<00:01:18.820> I<00:01:19.060> really<00:01:19.090> like<00:01:19.420> this<00:01:19.570> shot

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
other than that I really like this shot

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.670 
other than that I really like this shot
okay<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:22.240> this<00:01:22.450> is<00:01:22.600> one<00:01:22.750> of<00:01:22.780> my<00:01:22.900> favorite<00:01:23.409> shots

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
okay so this is one of my favorite shots

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.440 
okay so this is one of my favorite shots
of<00:01:23.830> the<00:01:23.920> day<00:01:24.100> I<00:01:24.130> think<00:01:24.340> this<00:01:24.729> looks<00:01:25.150> straight

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
of the day I think this looks straight

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.100 
of the day I think this looks straight
out<00:01:25.510> of<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.750> magazine<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.560> full<00:01:27.549> length<00:01:28.110> Nessus

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
out of a magazine the full length Nessus

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.840 
out of a magazine the full length Nessus
off<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.350> shot<00:01:29.590> so<00:01:29.829> it<00:01:29.890> makes<00:01:30.070> it<00:01:30.310> look<00:01:30.430> really

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
off the shot so it makes it look really

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.429 
off the shot so it makes it look really
dramatic<00:01:31.329> and<00:01:31.540> we<00:01:32.530> used<00:01:32.979> a<00:01:33.399> wide<00:01:33.670> aperture

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
dramatic and we used a wide aperture

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.170 
dramatic and we used a wide aperture
which<00:01:35.439> gives<00:01:35.740> a<00:01:35.860> very<00:01:36.009> shallow<00:01:36.369> depth<00:01:37.030> of

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
which gives a very shallow depth of

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.789 
which gives a very shallow depth of
field<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:37.780> the<00:01:37.869> blurred<00:01:38.079> background<00:01:38.649> in

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
field and the blurred background in

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.459 
field and the blurred background in
contrast<00:01:39.280> with<00:01:39.579> the<00:01:40.240> pose<00:01:40.600> it's<00:01:41.020> just<00:01:41.259> great

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469 
contrast with the pose it's just great

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:44.100 
contrast with the pose it's just great
it's<00:01:41.619> very<00:01:41.860> dramatic<00:01:42.340> we<00:01:43.149> tried<00:01:43.689> this<00:01:43.930> with

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
it's very dramatic we tried this with

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.840 
it's very dramatic we tried this with
flash<00:01:44.409> initially<00:01:45.100> but<00:01:45.310> as<00:01:45.460> you'll<00:01:45.640> see

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
flash initially but as you'll see

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.940 
flash initially but as you'll see
another<00:01:46.149> photo<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:46.780> flash<00:01:47.079> in<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:47.619> setting

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
another photo the flash in this setting

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.240 
another photo the flash in this setting
indoors<00:01:48.549> richly<00:01:49.060> inside<00:01:49.390> the<00:01:49.539> factory<00:01:49.899> now<00:01:50.250> it

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
indoors richly inside the factory now it

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.469 
indoors richly inside the factory now it
made<00:01:51.460> it<00:01:51.609> look<00:01:51.640> a<00:01:51.850> little<00:01:52.000> bit<00:01:52.240> too

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
made it look a little bit too

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.690 
made it look a little bit too
in-your-face<00:01:53.109> so<00:01:53.979> without<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.549> flash

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
in-your-face so without the flash

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.190 
in-your-face so without the flash
actually<00:01:55.299> the<00:01:55.479> natural<00:01:55.840> light<00:01:55.960> was<00:01:56.170> just

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
actually the natural light was just

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.590 
actually the natural light was just
enough

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
enough

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.320 
enough

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
and the full-length style of this photo

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.420 
and the full-length style of this photo
also<00:02:00.659> makes<00:02:00.990> me<00:02:01.080> look<00:02:01.229> really<00:02:01.409> tall<00:02:01.770> as<00:02:02.159> just

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.980 
also makes me look really tall as just
the<00:02:02.549> pose<00:02:02.759> which<00:02:03.060> actually<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.540> borrowed

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990

talking about the flash now the actual

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.590 
talking about the flash now the actual
picture<00:02:13.620> isn't<00:02:14.130> that<00:02:14.400> bad<00:02:14.640> apart<00:02:15.300> from<00:02:15.450> the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
picture isn't that bad apart from the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.809 
picture isn't that bad apart from the
fact<00:02:15.630> that<00:02:15.989> it's<00:02:16.350> definitely<00:02:16.739> too<00:02:17.250> dark<00:02:17.550> on

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
fact that it's definitely too dark on

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.670 
fact that it's definitely too dark on
the<00:02:17.970> lower<00:02:18.120> half<00:02:18.300> of<00:02:18.360> my<00:02:18.540> body<00:02:18.630> we've<00:02:19.410> got<00:02:19.590> the

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
the lower half of my body we've got the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.710 
the lower half of my body we've got the
flash<00:02:19.950> hitting<00:02:20.489> my<00:02:20.610> face<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.150> my<00:02:21.209> shoulders

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
flash hitting my face and my shoulders

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.630 
flash hitting my face and my shoulders
and<00:02:21.750> then<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:21.959> just<00:02:22.080> gradually<00:02:22.440> gets<00:02:22.950> darker

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
and then it just gradually gets darker

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.640 
and then it just gradually gets darker
and<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:24.540> didn't<00:02:24.810> quite<00:02:24.930> give<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.350> effect

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
and it didn't quite give the effect

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.710 
and it didn't quite give the effect

in<00:02:41.880> this<00:02:42.000> photo<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.330> this<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.600> what<00:02:42.750> I<00:02:42.780> was

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
in this photo and this is what I was

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.660 
in this photo and this is what I was
talking<00:02:43.080> about<00:02:43.290> in<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.650> first<00:02:43.800> picture<00:02:44.220> and

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
talking about in the first picture and

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.850 
talking about in the first picture and
the<00:02:45.150> closer<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.600> are<00:02:45.690> to<00:02:45.750> camera<00:02:46.200> really<00:02:46.380> is

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
the closer you are to camera really is

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.340 
the closer you are to camera really is
how<00:02:47.190> intense<00:02:47.970> your<00:02:48.269> look<00:02:48.510> should<00:02:48.750> be<00:02:48.930> if

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
how intense your look should be if

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.070 
how intense your look should be if
you're<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:50.489> focus<00:02:50.940> is<00:02:51.120> around<00:02:51.360> your<00:02:51.600> face<00:02:51.840> and

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
you're the focus is around your face and

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.990 
you're the focus is around your face and
you<00:02:52.170> should<00:02:52.319> definitely<00:02:52.470> be<00:02:53.250> intense<00:02:53.760> with

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
you should definitely be intense with

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.850 
you should definitely be intense with
your<00:02:54.090> eyes<00:02:54.239> it<00:02:55.230> could<00:02:55.440> have<00:02:55.530> been<00:02:55.590> a<00:02:55.650> little

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
your eyes it could have been a little

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.580 
your eyes it could have been a little
bit<00:02:56.100> more<00:02:56.250> focused<00:02:56.900> but<00:02:57.900> use<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.290> lighting

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
bit more focused but use the lighting

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.620 
bit more focused but use the lighting
situation<00:02:59.130> this<00:02:59.250> was<00:02:59.489> difficult<00:03:00.090> but<00:03:00.269> this<00:03:00.450> is

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
situation this was difficult but this is

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:01.789 
situation this was difficult but this is
definitely<00:03:00.780> one<00:03:01.080> of<00:03:01.140> my<00:03:01.260> favorite<00:03:01.680> pictures

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
definitely one of my favorite pictures

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:05.000 
definitely one of my favorite pictures
of<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.250> day<00:03:02.959> next<00:03:03.959> we<00:03:04.079> moved<00:03:04.260> on<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.440> this<00:03:04.680> sort

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
of the day next we moved on to this sort

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.400 
of the day next we moved on to this sort
of<00:03:05.070> metal<00:03:05.700> post<00:03:06.299> that<00:03:06.570> was<00:03:06.660> holding<00:03:07.049> at<00:03:07.200> the

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
of metal post that was holding at the

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.199 
of metal post that was holding at the
factory<00:03:07.799> along<00:03:08.579> with<00:03:08.730> all<00:03:08.850> the<00:03:08.970> others

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
factory along with all the others

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.900 
factory along with all the others
obviously<00:03:09.890> which<00:03:10.890> jeff<00:03:11.190> pointed<00:03:11.610> out<00:03:11.700> might

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
obviously which jeff pointed out might

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.750 
obviously which jeff pointed out might
be<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:12.060> nice<00:03:12.269> point<00:03:12.660> of<00:03:12.840> focus<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:14.310> we<00:03:14.549> did<00:03:14.730> a

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
be a nice point of focus so we did a

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.170 
be a nice point of focus so we did a
medium<00:03:15.150> shots<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.840> i<00:03:16.079> used<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:17.180> environment

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
medium shots and i used the environment

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.270 
medium shots and i used the environment
with<00:03:18.720> my<00:03:18.900> posed<00:03:19.170> by<00:03:19.440> leaning<00:03:19.890> on<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.010> there

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
with my posed by leaning on it there

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.270 
with my posed by leaning on it there
with<00:03:20.400> my<00:03:20.579> arm<00:03:20.790> i<00:03:21.380> really<00:03:22.380> like<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.769> shots<00:03:23.070> i

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
with my arm i really like the shots i

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.380 
with my arm i really like the shots i
think<00:03:23.579> that<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:23.880> could<00:03:23.910> have<00:03:24.120> been<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.239> little

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
think that it could have been a little

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.240 
think that it could have been a little
bit<00:03:24.690> lower<00:03:24.989> down<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.320> i<00:03:25.590> could<00:03:25.739> have<00:03:25.829> been<00:03:26.010> a

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
bit lower down and i could have been a

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.770 
bit lower down and i could have been a
little<00:03:26.430> bit<00:03:26.700> more<00:03:26.910> in<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.209> shop<00:03:27.450> because

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
little bit more in the shop because

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.110 
little bit more in the shop because
there's<00:03:28.019> a<00:03:28.079> lot<00:03:28.109> of<00:03:28.320> space<00:03:28.739> above<00:03:29.040> my<00:03:29.250> head<00:03:29.280> but

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
there's a lot of space above my head but

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.539 
there's a lot of space above my head but
what<00:03:30.299> we<00:03:30.450> did<00:03:30.630> do<00:03:30.900> after<00:03:31.320> we<00:03:31.470> saw<00:03:31.829> this<00:03:32.040> is<00:03:32.280> we

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
what we did do after we saw this is we

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.759 
what we did do after we saw this is we
edited<00:03:33.269> it<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.750> a<00:03:34.290> wide<00:03:34.910> angle<00:03:35.910> frame<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:37.079> we

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
edited it to a wide angle frame so we

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.069 
edited it to a wide angle frame so we
have<00:03:37.950> improved<00:03:38.340> this<00:03:38.519> since<00:03:38.820> but<00:03:39.209> this<00:03:39.780> is<00:03:39.930> the

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
have improved this since but this is the

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.050 
have improved this since but this is the
original<00:03:40.109> to<00:03:40.680> want<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:40.920> talk<00:03:41.220> about<00:03:41.250> it

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
original to want to talk about it

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.410 
original to want to talk about it
list<00:03:42.980> so<00:03:43.980> Jeff<00:03:44.280> had<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.489> brilliant<00:03:44.670> idea<00:03:44.940> here

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
list so Jeff had a brilliant idea here

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.809 
list so Jeff had a brilliant idea here
and<00:03:45.599> he<00:03:45.690> decided<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.290> sit<00:03:47.099> a<00:03:47.130> little<00:03:47.340> bit<00:03:47.610> lower

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
and he decided to sit a little bit lower

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.390 
and he decided to sit a little bit lower
actually<00:03:48.209> close<00:03:48.720> to<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:48.989> ground<00:03:49.110> while<00:03:50.099> we

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
actually close to the ground while we

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.949 
actually close to the ground while we
were<00:03:50.520> taking<00:03:50.849> some<00:03:51.030> pictures<00:03:51.209> on<00:03:51.420> this<00:03:51.540> barrel

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
were taking some pictures on this barrel

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.070 
were taking some pictures on this barrel
and<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:52.290> turned<00:03:52.530> out<00:03:52.739> brilliantly<00:03:53.310> and

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
and it turned out brilliantly and

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.120 
and it turned out brilliantly and
sometimes<00:03:55.080> when<00:03:55.290> you're<00:03:55.440> on<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:55.590> photography

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
sometimes when you're on a photography

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.010 
sometimes when you're on a photography
shoot<00:03:56.400> it's<00:03:56.610> really<00:03:57.270> good<00:03:57.420> just<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:57.780> wing<00:03:57.989> it

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
shoot it's really good just to wing it

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.559 
shoot it's really good just to wing it
and<00:03:58.170> try<00:03:58.500> all<00:03:58.530> the<00:03:58.920> ideas<00:03:59.340> because<00:03:59.880> you<00:04:00.420> never

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
and try all the ideas because you never

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.690 
and try all the ideas because you never
know<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:01.200> ones<00:04:01.410> you<00:04:01.560> try<00:04:01.800> out<00:04:01.950> on<00:04:02.099> a<00:04:02.130> whim<00:04:02.400> are

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
know the ones you try out on a whim are

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.030 
know the ones you try out on a whim are
normally<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.150> best<00:04:03.330> ones<00:04:03.599> and<00:04:04.380> so<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.890> lower

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
normally the best ones and so the lower

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.460 
normally the best ones and so the lower
angle<00:04:05.340> in<00:04:05.610> this<00:04:05.730> shot<00:04:06.060> it<00:04:06.690> makes<00:04:06.930> models<00:04:07.170> look

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
angle in this shot it makes models look

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.770 
angle in this shot it makes models look
taller<00:04:07.769> it's<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.519> very<00:04:08.700> flattering<00:04:09.180> angle<00:04:09.420> if

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
taller it's a very flattering angle if

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.430 
taller it's a very flattering angle if
you<00:04:09.900> want<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.260> lengthen<00:04:10.440> a<00:04:10.890> model<00:04:12.200> so<00:04:13.200> this

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
you want to lengthen a model so this

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.580 
you want to lengthen a model so this
photo<00:04:13.739> actually<00:04:14.340> reminds<00:04:14.850> me<00:04:15.030> of<00:04:15.299> a<00:04:15.510> music<00:04:16.320> or

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
photo actually reminds me of a music or

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.360 
photo actually reminds me of a music or
film<00:04:17.160> you<00:04:17.489> know<00:04:17.519> video<00:04:17.850> still<00:04:18.389> and<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:20.190> only

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
film you know video still and the only

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.310 
film you know video still and the only
my<00:04:20.700> face<00:04:20.970> was<00:04:21.180> in<00:04:21.209> focus<00:04:21.690> and<00:04:21.780> this<00:04:21.930> because<00:04:22.200> we

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
my face was in focus and this because we

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.900 
my face was in focus and this because we
have<00:04:22.410> a<00:04:22.440> very<00:04:22.590> wide<00:04:22.710> aperture<00:04:23.310> everything

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
have a very wide aperture everything

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.670 
have a very wide aperture everything
else<00:04:24.060> is<00:04:24.240> pretty<00:04:24.479> blurry<00:04:24.750> but<00:04:25.229> that's<00:04:25.380> what<00:04:25.560> we

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
else is pretty blurry but that's what we

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.879 
else is pretty blurry but that's what we
wanted<00:04:26.160> I<00:04:27.120> like<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.870> emotion<00:04:28.320> in<00:04:28.410> my<00:04:28.530> eyes<00:04:28.650> and

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
wanted I like the emotion in my eyes and

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:30.469 
wanted I like the emotion in my eyes and
is<00:04:29.010> it<00:04:29.220> kind<00:04:29.460> of<00:04:29.550> looks<00:04:29.729> like<00:04:29.790> I've<00:04:30.060> got<00:04:30.090> a<00:04:30.240> bit

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
is it kind of looks like I've got a bit

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:32.480 
is it kind of looks like I've got a bit
of<00:04:30.600> a<00:04:30.690> story<00:04:30.990> going<00:04:31.229> on<00:04:31.650> but<00:04:31.919> as<00:04:32.040> I<00:04:32.070> said<00:04:32.220> it

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
of a story going on but as I said it

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.330 
of a story going on but as I said it
does<00:04:32.669> it<00:04:32.940> does<00:04:33.120> like<00:04:33.450> a<00:04:33.479> steal<00:04:33.900> I<00:04:34.740> want<00:04:35.250> to

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
does it does like a steal I want to

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.800 
does it does like a steal I want to
mention<00:04:35.490> quickly<00:04:35.820> as<00:04:36.090> well<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.419> Lightroom

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
mention quickly as well the Lightroom

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.870 
mention quickly as well the Lightroom
look<00:04:37.020> we're<00:04:37.290> using<00:04:37.620> for<00:04:38.010> these<00:04:38.100> photos<00:04:38.520> is<00:04:38.550> one

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
look we're using for these photos is one

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.969 
look we're using for these photos is one
called<00:04:39.090> marine<00:04:39.479> pop<00:04:39.810> and<00:04:40.110> the<00:04:40.620> reason<00:04:40.889> we

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
called marine pop and the reason we

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:42.650 
called marine pop and the reason we
chose<00:04:41.010> this<00:04:41.460> is<00:04:41.639> because<00:04:41.970> as<00:04:42.180> it<00:04:42.210> the<00:04:42.510> name

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
chose this is because as it the name

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.900 
chose this is because as it the name
states<00:04:43.020> it<00:04:43.350> makes<00:04:43.590> all<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:43.950> blue<00:04:44.220> tones<00:04:44.520> pop

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
states it makes all the blue tones pop

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.300 
states it makes all the blue tones pop
and<00:04:45.120> for<00:04:45.270> this<00:04:45.389> shoot<00:04:45.690> it<00:04:45.870> really<00:04:46.310> emphasized

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
and for this shoot it really emphasized

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.779 
and for this shoot it really emphasized
this<00:04:47.550> moody<00:04:48.060> cool<00:04:48.419> look<00:04:49.430> so<00:04:50.430> this<00:04:50.550> is<00:04:50.669> the

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
this moody cool look so this is the

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.850 
this moody cool look so this is the
first<00:04:51.000> of<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.240> portrait<00:04:51.900> shots<00:04:52.260> and<00:04:52.590> this<00:04:52.680> will

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
first of a portrait shots and this will

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.500 
first of a portrait shots and this will
have<00:04:53.010> a<00:04:53.039> little<00:04:53.340> bit<00:04:53.490> of<00:04:53.520> movement<00:04:53.850> to<00:04:54.210> it<00:04:54.240> and

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
have a little bit of movement to it and

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.050 
have a little bit of movement to it and
the<00:04:54.960> shot<00:04:55.200> was<00:04:55.380> taking<00:04:55.800> as<00:04:55.979> I<00:04:56.160> was<00:04:56.310> assuming<00:04:56.669> a

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
the shot was taking as I was assuming a

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.659 
the shot was taking as I was assuming a
pose<00:04:57.330> so<00:04:57.990> it's<00:04:58.320> nice<00:04:58.770> as<00:04:58.950> a<00:04:58.979> little<00:04:59.490> bit<00:04:59.580> of

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
pose so it's nice as a little bit of

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.130 
pose so it's nice as a little bit of
movement<00:04:59.820> in<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.150> hair<00:05:00.390> and<00:05:00.630> you<00:05:00.690> can<00:05:00.840> see<00:05:01.050> it

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:01.140 
movement in the hair and you can see it

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.510 
movement in the hair and you can see it
kind<00:05:01.320> of<00:05:01.470> looks<00:05:01.620> like<00:05:01.710> I'm<00:05:01.890> just<00:05:01.950> tipping

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
kind of looks like I'm just tipping

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.370 
kind of looks like I'm just tipping
forward<00:05:02.729> a<00:05:02.940> little<00:05:03.150> which<00:05:03.479> is<00:05:03.660> it's<00:05:03.960> nice<00:05:04.140> it's

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
forward a little which is it's nice it's

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.930 
forward a little which is it's nice it's
different<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:04.860> the<00:05:05.039> other<00:05:05.190> photos<00:05:05.550> it's<00:05:05.789> not

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
different to the other photos it's not

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.050 
different to the other photos it's not
the<00:05:06.120> static<00:05:06.680> we<00:05:07.680> had<00:05:07.890> to<00:05:08.070> change<00:05:08.370> the<00:05:08.640> shutter

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
the static we had to change the shutter

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.440 
the static we had to change the shutter
speed<00:05:09.620> 1600<00:05:10.669> because<00:05:11.669> taking<00:05:11.880> photos<00:05:12.419> with

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
speed 1600 because taking photos with

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.629 
speed 1600 because taking photos with
such<00:05:12.780> a<00:05:12.870> wide<00:05:12.990> aperture<00:05:13.169> can<00:05:14.100> leave<00:05:14.280> the<00:05:14.430> shop

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
such a wide aperture can leave the shop

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.969 
such a wide aperture can leave the shop
very<00:05:14.850> overexposed<00:05:15.720> if<00:05:15.930> you<00:05:16.050> don't<00:05:16.229> do<00:05:16.470> that<00:05:16.710> so

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 
very overexposed if you don't do that so

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:18.890 
very overexposed if you don't do that so

we had two thugs we came outside and it
was<00:05:18.990> brighter<00:05:19.260> than<00:05:19.410> we<00:05:19.620> expected

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
was brighter than we expected

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.920 
was brighter than we expected

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
shutter at the color of the shutter is

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
just definitely pops here the filters

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.910 
just definitely pops here the filters
definitely<00:05:28.490> doing<00:05:28.850> its<00:05:29.000> job<00:05:29.530> with<00:05:30.530> the<00:05:30.680> pose

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
definitely doing its job with the pose

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.400 
definitely doing its job with the pose
here<00:05:31.280> I<00:05:31.310> decided<00:05:31.790> to<00:05:32.000> pop<00:05:32.210> my<00:05:32.360> hip<00:05:32.690> my<00:05:32.960> knees

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
here I decided to pop my hip my knees

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:35.590 
here I decided to pop my hip my knees
and<00:05:33.710> my<00:05:33.800> elbows<00:05:34.340> out<00:05:34.520> at<00:05:34.700> this<00:05:34.880> angle<00:05:35.090> because

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
and my elbows out at this angle because

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.380 
and my elbows out at this angle because
i<00:05:35.630> feel<00:05:36.050> if<00:05:36.770> i<00:05:36.980> was<00:05:37.160> a<00:05:37.190> stand<00:05:37.580> to<00:05:37.760> straight<00:05:38.360> up

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
i feel if i was a stand to straight up

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.630 
i feel if i was a stand to straight up
in<00:05:38.810> this<00:05:38.900> pose<00:05:39.230> it<00:05:39.530> would<00:05:39.680> look<00:05:39.800> too<00:05:40.130> forced

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
in this pose it would look too forced

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.300 
in this pose it would look too forced
unto<00:05:41.000> uncomfortable<00:05:41.750> funnily<00:05:42.530> enough<00:05:42.530> the

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
unto uncomfortable funnily enough the

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.070 
unto uncomfortable funnily enough the
most<00:05:43.490> uncomfortable<00:05:43.850> poses<00:05:44.540> tend<00:05:44.840> to<00:05:44.960> look

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
most uncomfortable poses tend to look

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.360 
most uncomfortable poses tend to look
the<00:05:45.290> most<00:05:45.410> comfortable<00:05:45.950> on<00:05:46.130> camera<00:05:48.220> so<00:05:49.220> this

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
the most comfortable on camera so this

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.320 
the most comfortable on camera so this
is<00:05:49.400> one<00:05:49.670> of<00:05:49.700> our<00:05:49.850> only<00:05:50.150> close-ups<00:05:50.840> of<00:05:51.110> the<00:05:51.440> day

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
is one of our only close-ups of the day

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.760 
is one of our only close-ups of the day
the<00:05:53.330> direct<00:05:53.900> eye<00:05:54.020> contact<00:05:54.140> with<00:05:54.650> the<00:05:54.680> camera

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
the direct eye contact with the camera

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.909 
the direct eye contact with the camera
is<00:05:55.190> good<00:05:55.720> and<00:05:56.720> it<00:05:57.050> could<00:05:57.290> have<00:05:57.380> had<00:05:57.530> a<00:05:57.560> little

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
is good and it could have had a little

00:05:57.919 --> 00:05:59.950 
is good and it could have had a little
bit<00:05:58.160> more<00:05:58.310> intensity<00:05:58.760> but<00:05:59.120> my<00:05:59.300> expression<00:05:59.840> is

00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 
bit more intensity but my expression is

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.760 
bit more intensity but my expression is
fairly<00:06:00.200> neutral<00:06:01.660> this<00:06:02.660> is<00:06:02.900> one<00:06:03.320> of<00:06:03.440> the<00:06:03.530> most

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
fairly neutral this is one of the most

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.430 
fairly neutral this is one of the most
different<00:06:04.220> shots<00:06:04.430> we<00:06:04.640> did<00:06:04.820> the<00:06:05.060> day<00:06:05.270> I<00:06:05.780> really

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440 
different shots we did the day I really

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.290 
different shots we did the day I really
like<00:06:06.620> the<00:06:06.950> angle<00:06:07.040> again<00:06:07.520> this<00:06:07.669> is<00:06:07.820> taken<00:06:08.180> from

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
like the angle again this is taken from

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:11.470 
like the angle again this is taken from
quite<00:06:08.600> low<00:06:08.750> down<00:06:08.990> so<00:06:09.470> to<00:06:09.530> lengthen<00:06:10.160> the<00:06:10.550> model

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:11.480 
quite low down so to lengthen the model

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.120 
quite low down so to lengthen the model
what<00:06:12.460> we<00:06:13.460> decided<00:06:13.910> that<00:06:14.440> we<00:06:15.440> could<00:06:15.470> give<00:06:16.010> this

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
what we decided that we could give this

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:19.360 
what we decided that we could give this
one<00:06:16.340> even<00:06:16.610> more<00:06:16.760> of<00:06:17.090> a<00:06:17.180> moody<00:06:17.570> look<00:06:17.780> so<00:06:18.230> we<00:06:19.040> did

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.370 
one even more of a moody look so we did

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:23.200 
one even more of a moody look so we did
a<00:06:20.050> gradual<00:06:21.050> filter<00:06:21.530> on<00:06:21.680> the<00:06:21.710> sky<00:06:22.100> and<00:06:22.670> it<00:06:23.030> just

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
a gradual filter on the sky and it just

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:25.120 
a gradual filter on the sky and it just
makes<00:06:23.390> it<00:06:23.510> a<00:06:23.570> bit<00:06:23.690> more<00:06:23.720> darker<00:06:24.650> and<00:06:24.890> it<00:06:24.980> can

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.130 
makes it a bit more darker and it can

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.400 
makes it a bit more darker and it can
give<00:06:25.310> it<00:06:25.460> a<00:06:25.520> vignette<00:06:25.910> and<00:06:26.270> it<00:06:26.360> just<00:06:26.600> we<00:06:27.230> really

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:27.410 
give it a vignette and it just we really

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:29.200 
give it a vignette and it just we really
like<00:06:27.620> the<00:06:27.830> way<00:06:27.860> it's<00:06:28.520> turned<00:06:28.730> out<00:06:28.970> the<00:06:29.180> only

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:29.210 
like the way it's turned out the only

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.780 
like the way it's turned out the only
thing<00:06:29.660> that<00:06:29.840> could<00:06:30.050> have<00:06:30.170> improved<00:06:30.790> this

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:31.790 
thing that could have improved this

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.400 
thing that could have improved this
photo<00:06:32.120> is<00:06:32.330> if<00:06:32.540> I<00:06:32.630> was<00:06:32.750> a<00:06:32.780> little<00:06:33.140> bit<00:06:33.260> more

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 
photo is if I was a little bit more

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.920 
photo is if I was a little bit more
central<00:06:34.190> so<00:06:34.820> that<00:06:35.000> the<00:06:35.090> leading<00:06:35.390> lines<00:06:35.600> of<00:06:35.840> the

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 
central so that the leading lines of the

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.010 
central so that the leading lines of the
building<00:06:36.940> would<00:06:37.940> go<00:06:38.180> straight<00:06:38.240> to<00:06:38.690> me<00:06:38.840> but

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 
building would go straight to me but

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.110 
building would go straight to me but
other<00:06:39.170> than<00:06:39.380> that

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
other than that

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.140 
other than that
like<00:06:40.210> it<00:06:41.070> so<00:06:42.070> in<00:06:42.190> this<00:06:42.310> shot<00:06:42.580> at<00:06:42.729> another<00:06:43.000> one

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
like it so in this shot at another one

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.610 
like it so in this shot at another one
where<00:06:43.330> I'm<00:06:43.419> looking<00:06:43.570> away<00:06:43.900> from<00:06:43.930> camera<00:06:44.320> again

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
where I'm looking away from camera again

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.159 
where I'm looking away from camera again
it's<00:06:45.010> a<00:06:45.100> little<00:06:45.370> bit<00:06:45.520> lower<00:06:45.669> down<00:06:45.970> we<00:06:46.750> had<00:06:46.990> to

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:47.169 
it's a little bit lower down we had to

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:49.110 
it's a little bit lower down we had to
heighten<00:06:47.949> the<00:06:48.100> shutter<00:06:48.310> speed<00:06:48.610> even<00:06:48.940> more

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
heighten the shutter speed even more

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.730 
heighten the shutter speed even more
because<00:06:49.240> the<00:06:49.510> Sun<00:06:49.720> came<00:06:49.930> out<00:06:50.080> and<00:06:50.139> it<00:06:50.320> was<00:06:50.350> so

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
because the Sun came out and it was so

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:54.450 
because the Sun came out and it was so
bright<00:06:51.100> it<00:06:51.310> literally<00:06:51.729> almost<00:06:52.240> blinded<00:06:52.780> us<00:06:53.460> so

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.460 
bright it literally almost blinded us so

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.010 
bright it literally almost blinded us so
we<00:06:54.580> had<00:06:54.760> a<00:06:54.790> little<00:06:55.060> bit<00:06:55.330> of<00:06:55.360> trouble<00:06:55.570> the<00:06:55.870> white

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:56.020 
we had a little bit of trouble the white

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.280 
we had a little bit of trouble the white
outfit<00:06:56.500> can<00:06:57.090> be<00:06:58.090> a<00:06:58.120> problem<00:06:58.419> when<00:06:58.960> you've<00:06:59.139> got

00:06:59.280 --> 00:06:59.290 
outfit can be a problem when you've got

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:00.960 
outfit can be a problem when you've got
such<00:06:59.500> bright<00:06:59.740> sunshine<00:07:00.160> as<00:07:00.280> it<00:07:00.370> can<00:07:00.550> cause<00:07:00.820> I'm

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:00.970 
such bright sunshine as it can cause I'm

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:02.520 
such bright sunshine as it can cause I'm
just<00:07:01.090> a<00:07:01.330> little<00:07:01.510> bit<00:07:01.630> overexposed<00:07:02.080> but<00:07:02.440> we

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:02.530 
just a little bit overexposed but we

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.090 
just a little bit overexposed but we
think<00:07:02.710> we<00:07:02.949> dealt<00:07:03.160> with<00:07:03.250> that<00:07:03.460> in<00:07:04.210> this<00:07:04.389> shot<00:07:05.100> so

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:06.100 
think we dealt with that in this shot so

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.090 
think we dealt with that in this shot so
this<00:07:06.370> shot<00:07:06.699> looks<00:07:07.540> very<00:07:07.930> summery<00:07:08.380> and<00:07:08.470> I<00:07:08.740> think

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.100 
this shot looks very summery and I think
