hi I'm Andrew Watson thanks for tuning

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:18.970 
hi I'm Andrew Watson thanks for tuning
in<00:00:17.029> again<00:00:17.239> to<00:00:17.630> one<00:00:17.749> of<00:00:17.839> my<00:00:17.900> guitar<00:00:18.230> blogs<00:00:18.529> it<00:00:18.800> is

Saturday<00:00:19.759> July<00:00:20.300> 16th<00:00:20.960> 2011<00:00:21.829> and<00:00:22.279> I<00:00:22.699> had<00:00:22.789> a

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:22.819 
Saturday July 16th 2011 and I had a

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:24.550 
Saturday July 16th 2011 and I had a
question<00:00:22.999> sent<00:00:23.419> in<00:00:23.509> to<00:00:23.689> me<00:00:23.810> from<00:00:23.989> Christopher

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
question sent in to me from Christopher

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.229 
question sent in to me from Christopher
he<00:00:24.800> lives<00:00:25.009> in<00:00:25.130> Ottawa<00:00:25.489> Ontario<00:00:25.640> he<00:00:26.029> just

00:00:26.229 --> 00:00:26.239 
he lives in Ottawa Ontario he just

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:28.989 
he lives in Ottawa Ontario he just
wanted<00:00:26.449> to<00:00:26.539> know<00:00:26.689> what<00:00:27.019> exactly<00:00:27.890> is<00:00:28.249> a<00:00:28.579> cadence

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:28.999 
wanted to know what exactly is a cadence

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:31.870 
wanted to know what exactly is a cadence
well<00:00:29.989> the<00:00:30.409> cadence<00:00:30.769> is<00:00:30.919> a<00:00:30.979> movement<00:00:31.369> of

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
well the cadence is a movement of

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.910 
well the cadence is a movement of
ordinarily<00:00:32.630> two<00:00:32.899> chords<00:00:33.379> and<00:00:33.559> they<00:00:33.649> can<00:00:33.800> be

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
ordinarily two chords and they can be

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.160 
ordinarily two chords and they can be
triads<00:00:34.340> or<00:00:34.489> sevenths<00:00:35.030> and<00:00:35.420> basically<00:00:36.050> the

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
triads or sevenths and basically the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.380 
triads or sevenths and basically the
movement<00:00:36.379> marks<00:00:36.800> the<00:00:37.370> end<00:00:37.550> of<00:00:37.789> a<00:00:37.850> phrase<00:00:38.030> or

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
movement marks the end of a phrase or

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.060 
movement marks the end of a phrase or
the<00:00:38.420> completion<00:00:38.839> of<00:00:39.140> a<00:00:39.230> piece<00:00:39.530> or<00:00:39.829> it<00:00:39.920> could

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
the completion of a piece or it could

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.069 
the completion of a piece or it could
even<00:00:40.190> be<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:40.820> completion<00:00:41.179> of<00:00:41.359> a<00:00:41.449> section<00:00:41.899> of<00:00:42.019> a

00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
even be the completion of a section of a

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.319 
even be the completion of a section of a
piece<00:00:42.289> maybe<00:00:42.559> if<00:00:42.859> you<00:00:42.949> have<00:00:43.039> a<00:00:43.100> larger<00:00:43.699> formal

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
piece maybe if you have a larger formal

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.329 
piece maybe if you have a larger formal
structure<00:00:44.690> of<00:00:44.780> a<00:00:44.870> song<00:00:45.079> you<00:00:46.010> know<00:00:46.070> it<00:00:46.190> can

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
structure of a song you know it can

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.130 
structure of a song you know it can
basically<00:00:46.550> complete<00:00:47.149> that<00:00:47.329> to<00:00:47.510> move<00:00:47.749> you<00:00:47.870> into

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
basically complete that to move you into

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.650 
basically complete that to move you into
another<00:00:48.230> section<00:00:48.589> of<00:00:48.769> the<00:00:48.859> song<00:00:49.070> so<00:00:49.339> now

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
another section of the song so now

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.549 
another section of the song so now
essentially<00:00:50.660> what<00:00:50.960> you<00:00:51.079> want<00:00:51.199> to<00:00:51.260> be<00:00:51.320> aware<00:00:51.499> of

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
essentially what you want to be aware of

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.049 
essentially what you want to be aware of
before<00:00:51.739> you<00:00:51.949> get<00:00:52.070> heavy<00:00:52.249> into<00:00:52.519> this<00:00:52.640> stuff<00:00:52.909> is

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
before you get heavy into this stuff is

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:54.759 
before you get heavy into this stuff is
you<00:00:53.179> want<00:00:53.359> to<00:00:53.420> understand<00:00:53.899> the<00:00:54.350> principle

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
you want to understand the principle

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:56.590 
you want to understand the principle
triads<00:00:55.129> that<00:00:55.219> are<00:00:55.399> used<00:00:55.609> in<00:00:55.820> a<00:00:55.909> key<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:56.359> that's

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
triads that are used in a key so that's

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.569 
triads that are used in a key so that's
very<00:00:56.899> important<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:57.440> know<00:00:57.589> if<00:00:58.249> you're<00:00:58.429> in<00:00:58.519> a

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
very important to know if you're in a

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.340 
very important to know if you're in a
major<00:00:58.730> key<00:00:58.999> and<00:00:59.120> for<00:00:59.300> our<00:00:59.480> examples<00:00:59.960> in<00:01:00.170> this

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
major key and for our examples in this

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.040 
major key and for our examples in this
video<00:01:00.859> we'll<00:01:01.100> just<00:01:01.309> use<00:01:01.489> F<00:01:01.819> major<00:01:02.059> so<00:01:02.839> if<00:01:02.929> I

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
video we'll just use F major so if I

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.869 
video we'll just use F major so if I
look<00:01:03.620> at<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:03.920> tonic<00:01:04.400> sub-dominant<00:01:04.610> and

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
look at the tonic sub-dominant and

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.510 
look at the tonic sub-dominant and
dominant<00:01:05.269> families<00:01:06.170> and<00:01:06.500> I'm<00:01:07.100> in<00:01:07.280> the<00:01:07.369> key<00:01:07.490> of

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
dominant families and I'm in the key of

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.399 
dominant families and I'm in the key of
F<00:01:07.700> major<00:01:07.909> they<00:01:08.240> would<00:01:08.390> all<00:01:08.509> be<00:01:08.540> major<00:01:08.899> chords

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
F major they would all be major chords

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:11.499 
F major they would all be major chords
that<00:01:09.619> would<00:01:09.710> be<00:01:09.829> F<00:01:09.979> major<00:01:10.220> B<00:01:10.549> flat<00:01:10.579> and<00:01:11.000> C<00:01:11.270> major

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
that would be F major B flat and C major

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.929 
that would be F major B flat and C major
now<00:01:12.380> if<00:01:12.649> I<00:01:12.770> went<00:01:12.979> to<00:01:13.130> natural<00:01:13.520> minor<00:01:13.700> they

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
now if I went to natural minor they

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.030 
now if I went to natural minor they
would<00:01:14.090> just<00:01:14.240> convert<00:01:14.630> all<00:01:14.840> to<00:01:15.049> becoming<00:01:15.439> minor

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
would just convert all to becoming minor

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.270 
would just convert all to becoming minor
minor<00:01:16.909> chords<00:01:17.299> minor<00:01:17.479> triads<00:01:17.869> if<00:01:18.799> you<00:01:18.979> went<00:01:19.189> to

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
minor chords minor triads if you went to

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.920 
minor chords minor triads if you went to
harmonic<00:01:19.880> minor<00:01:20.149> for<00:01:20.450> instance<00:01:20.719> because<00:01:20.869> you

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
harmonic minor for instance because you

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.450 
harmonic minor for instance because you
got<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.079> remember<00:01:21.110> minor<00:01:21.860> has<00:01:22.100> different

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
got to remember minor has different

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.149 
got to remember minor has different
forms<00:01:22.850> so<00:01:23.329> harmonic<00:01:24.259> minor<00:01:24.409> we<00:01:24.680> have<00:01:24.799> a<00:01:24.860> one

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
forms so harmonic minor we have a one

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.609 
forms so harmonic minor we have a one
minor<00:01:25.460> chord<00:01:25.820> F<00:01:26.030> minor<00:01:26.329> D<00:01:26.810> flat<00:01:26.840> would<00:01:27.259> also<00:01:27.380> be

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
minor chord F minor D flat would also be

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:29.230 
minor chord F minor D flat would also be
minor<00:01:27.860> but<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.159> five<00:01:28.369> chord<00:01:28.729> would<00:01:28.880> either<00:01:29.000> be

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
minor but the five chord would either be

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.289 
minor but the five chord would either be
major<00:01:29.509> or<00:01:29.899> dominant<00:01:30.469> seventh<00:01:31.000> back<00:01:32.000> to<00:01:32.149> the

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
major or dominant seventh back to the

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.109 
major or dominant seventh back to the
minor<00:01:32.780> root<00:01:33.110> now<00:01:33.950> when<00:01:34.340> you<00:01:34.430> go<00:01:34.520> to<00:01:34.549> a<00:01:34.670> melodic

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
minor root now when you go to a melodic

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.880 
minor root now when you go to a melodic
minor<00:01:35.329> it's<00:01:35.990> a<00:01:36.110> little<00:01:36.289> bit<00:01:36.409> different<00:01:36.560> again

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
minor it's a little bit different again

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.770 
minor it's a little bit different again
melodic<00:01:37.310> minor<00:01:37.460> has<00:01:37.729> a<00:01:37.759> one<00:01:38.180> court<00:01:38.539> that's

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
melodic minor has a one court that's

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.990 
melodic minor has a one court that's
minor<00:01:39.079> the<00:01:39.409> fourth<00:01:39.680> chord<00:01:40.009> is<00:01:40.159> major<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:40.909> the

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
minor the fourth chord is major and the

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.029 
minor the fourth chord is major and the
five<00:01:41.210> chord<00:01:41.600> is<00:01:41.719> either<00:01:41.840> major<00:01:42.110> or<00:01:42.350> dominant

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
five chord is either major or dominant

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.330 
five chord is either major or dominant
seventh<00:01:43.369> back<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:44.299> the<00:01:44.450> tonic<00:01:45.409> again<00:01:45.710> so<00:01:46.250> you

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
seventh back to the tonic again so you

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.709 
seventh back to the tonic again so you
have<00:01:46.369> to<00:01:46.549> remember<00:01:46.789> that<00:01:47.060> minor<00:01:47.299> has<00:01:47.539> these

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 
have to remember that minor has these

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:49.719 
have to remember that minor has these
three<00:01:48.049> scale<00:01:48.320> forms<00:01:48.740> so<00:01:48.979> as<00:01:49.159> you<00:01:49.310> study<00:01:49.520> this

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
three scale forms so as you study this

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.279 
three scale forms so as you study this
stuff<00:01:49.909> and<00:01:50.060> you<00:01:50.149> go<00:01:50.270> through<00:01:50.479> every<00:01:50.750> form<00:01:51.049> in<00:01:51.229> a

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
stuff and you go through every form in a

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.410 
stuff and you go through every form in a
minor<00:01:51.500> you'll<00:01:52.189> want<00:01:52.399> to<00:01:52.490> keep<00:01:52.729> all<00:01:52.969> this<00:01:53.210> in

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
minor you'll want to keep all this in

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.170 
minor you'll want to keep all this in
mind<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:54.020> try<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:54.619> really<00:01:55.189> get<00:01:55.310> these<00:01:55.490> down<00:01:55.909> in

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
mind and try to really get these down in

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.690 
mind and try to really get these down in
each<00:01:56.329> of<00:01:56.450> your<00:01:56.659> keys<00:01:57.159> okay<00:01:58.159> so<00:01:58.219> with<00:01:58.460> that<00:01:58.490> out

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
each of your keys okay so with that out

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.310 
each of your keys okay so with that out
of<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:58.880> way<00:01:59.030> let's<00:01:59.689> move<00:01:59.840> on<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.109> the<00:02:00.200> whole

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
of the way let's move on to the whole

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.679 
of the way let's move on to the whole
cadence<00:02:00.799> thing<00:02:01.100> so<00:02:01.369> when<00:02:02.090> our<00:02:02.210> cadence<00:02:02.570> is

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
cadence thing so when our cadence is

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.510 
cadence thing so when our cadence is
applied<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.229> where<00:02:03.380> these<00:02:03.530> is<00:02:03.649> all<00:02:03.770> about<00:02:04.039> so

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
applied to where these is all about so

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.249 
applied to where these is all about so
they<00:02:04.640> basically<00:02:04.939> operate<00:02:05.600> around<00:02:05.719> two<00:02:06.079> main

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
they basically operate around two main

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.050 
they basically operate around two main
principles<00:02:06.469> you'll<00:02:06.950> have<00:02:07.100> authentic<00:02:07.670> cadence

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
principles you'll have authentic cadence

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.700 
principles you'll have authentic cadence
and<00:02:08.300> you'll<00:02:08.390> have<00:02:08.570> play<00:02:09.140> goal<00:02:09.320> cadence<00:02:09.620> and

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
and you'll have play goal cadence and

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.500 
and you'll have play goal cadence and
I'm<00:02:10.010> doing<00:02:10.160> a<00:02:10.280> very<00:02:10.430> basic<00:02:10.610> overview<00:02:11.060> here<00:02:11.300> so

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
I'm doing a very basic overview here so

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.000 
I'm doing a very basic overview here so
bear<00:02:11.750> with<00:02:11.780> me<00:02:11.960> if<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:12.290> know<00:02:12.470> a<00:02:12.500> lot<00:02:12.800> about

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
bear with me if you know a lot about

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.380 
bear with me if you know a lot about
this<00:02:13.160> stuff<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.580> you're<00:02:13.670> just

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
this stuff and you're just

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.900 
this stuff and you're just
viewing<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.050> city<00:02:15.260> in<00:02:15.440> this<00:02:15.709> video<00:02:16.069> for<00:02:16.730> fun

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
viewing the city in this video for fun

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.449 
viewing the city in this video for fun
but<00:02:17.780> basically<00:02:18.200> in<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.860> very<00:02:19.130> general<00:02:19.340> sense

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
but basically in a very general sense

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.100 
but basically in a very general sense
there's<00:02:19.880> authentic<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.540> there's<00:02:20.690> play<00:02:20.900> --gel

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
there's authentic and there's play --gel

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.780 
there's authentic and there's play --gel
so<00:02:21.260> authentic<00:02:21.800> is<00:02:21.920> when<00:02:22.069> you<00:02:22.160> have<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.310> tonic

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
so authentic is when you have a tonic

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.490 
so authentic is when you have a tonic
and<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.030> dominant<00:02:23.270> relationship<00:02:24.170> that<00:02:24.350> you're

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
and a dominant relationship that you're

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.410 
and a dominant relationship that you're
working<00:02:24.650> with<00:02:24.830> so<00:02:25.160> for<00:02:25.610> instance<00:02:25.910> if<00:02:26.030> I<00:02:26.180> went

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
working with so for instance if I went

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.710 
working with so for instance if I went
from<00:02:26.600> a<00:02:26.720> C<00:02:27.080> major<00:02:27.740> into<00:02:28.430> an<00:02:28.700> F<00:02:28.940> major<00:02:29.330> that

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
from a C major into an F major that

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.330 
from a C major into an F major that
would<00:02:29.810> be<00:02:29.900> considered<00:02:30.319> an<00:02:30.410> authentic<00:02:30.980> cadence

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
would be considered an authentic cadence

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.910 
would be considered an authentic cadence
play<00:02:32.120> goal<00:02:32.330> would<00:02:32.510> be<00:02:32.720> going<00:02:32.959> when<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:33.709> have

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
play goal would be going when you have

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.580 
play goal would be going when you have
the<00:02:34.790> four<00:02:35.150> chord<00:02:35.480> involved<00:02:36.050> so<00:02:36.170> if<00:02:36.290> I<00:02:36.380> went

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
the four chord involved so if I went

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.620 
the four chord involved so if I went
from<00:02:36.709> a<00:02:36.860> B<00:02:37.010> flat<00:02:37.160> major<00:02:37.459> chord<00:02:37.640> to<00:02:38.030> an<00:02:38.150> F<00:02:38.330> major

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
from a B flat major chord to an F major

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.720 
from a B flat major chord to an F major
chord<00:02:38.840> that<00:02:39.200> would<00:02:39.350> be<00:02:39.470> considered<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:40.190> play

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
chord that would be considered a play

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.400 
chord that would be considered a play
goal<00:02:41.000> cadence<00:02:41.569> so<00:02:41.660> that's<00:02:41.840> sub<00:02:42.170> dominant

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
goal cadence so that's sub dominant

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.530 
goal cadence so that's sub dominant
family<00:02:43.130> if<00:02:43.819> you're<00:02:43.940> familiar<00:02:44.120> with<00:02:44.360> your

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
family if you're familiar with your

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.449 
family if you're familiar with your
court<00:02:44.780> families<00:02:45.140> so<00:02:45.709> if<00:02:45.800> you<00:02:45.860> go<00:02:45.980> dominant

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
court families so if you go dominant

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.699 
court families so if you go dominant
family<00:02:46.730> to<00:02:46.850> tonic<00:02:47.150> that's<00:02:47.570> authentic<00:02:48.110> or<00:02:48.320> vice

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
family to tonic that's authentic or vice

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.259 
family to tonic that's authentic or vice
versa<00:02:48.830> because<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.489> can<00:02:49.730> work<00:02:49.910> the<00:02:50.090> other<00:02:50.180> way

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
versa because it can work the other way

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.630 
versa because it can work the other way
also<00:02:51.200> a<00:02:51.230> play<00:02:51.650> goal<00:02:51.830> is<00:02:51.950> going<00:02:52.130> from<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.459> four

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
also a play goal is going from the four

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.130 
also a play goal is going from the four
court<00:02:52.940> to<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.120> one<00:02:53.269> or<00:02:53.450> the<00:02:53.510> one<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.900> four

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
court to the one or the one to the four

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.870 
court to the one or the one to the four
and<00:02:54.410> we'll<00:02:54.890> talk<00:02:55.040> about<00:02:55.160> those<00:02:55.459> relationships

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
and we'll talk about those relationships

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.449 
and we'll talk about those relationships
a<00:02:56.330> little<00:02:56.450> bit<00:02:56.690> as<00:02:56.900> well<00:02:57.080> about<00:02:58.040> how<00:02:58.220> you<00:02:58.280> can

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
a little bit as well about how you can

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.800 
a little bit as well about how you can
go<00:02:58.550> back<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:58.940> forth<00:02:59.150> with<00:02:59.180> those<00:02:59.420> but

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
go back and forth with those but

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.840 
go back and forth with those but
basically<00:03:00.440> that's<00:03:00.620> it<00:03:00.739> you're<00:03:00.950> authentic<00:03:01.670> and

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
basically that's it you're authentic and

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.210 
basically that's it you're authentic and
your<00:03:01.940> play<00:03:02.090> goal<00:03:02.239> Cadence's<00:03:02.780> and<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:04.040> thing

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
your play goal Cadence's and the thing

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.830 
your play goal Cadence's and the thing
up<00:03:04.519> next<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.120> sort<00:03:05.300> of<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.420> next<00:03:05.569> level

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
up next the sort of the next level

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.690 
up next the sort of the next level
deeper<00:03:06.290> on<00:03:06.410> this<00:03:06.560> stuff<00:03:06.800> is<00:03:06.950> basically<00:03:07.160> when

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
deeper on this stuff is basically when

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.160 
deeper on this stuff is basically when
you're<00:03:07.850> getting<00:03:08.120> into<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.450> different<00:03:08.630> types

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
you're getting into the different types

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.380 
you're getting into the different types
of<00:03:09.410> authentic<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.580> play<00:03:10.730> GLE<00:03:10.880> Cadence's<00:03:11.360> and

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
of authentic and play GLE Cadence's and

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.180 
of authentic and play GLE Cadence's and
they're<00:03:11.690> identified<00:03:12.200> as<00:03:12.440> three<00:03:12.739> kinds<00:03:13.100> you

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
they're identified as three kinds you

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.600 
they're identified as three kinds you
have<00:03:13.310> perfect<00:03:13.870> imperfect<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:15.050> half<00:03:15.410> so<00:03:16.190> in

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
have perfect imperfect and half so in

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.449 
have perfect imperfect and half so in
let<00:03:17.030> start<00:03:17.180> with<00:03:17.239> perfect<00:03:17.720> basically<00:03:18.170> when

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
let start with perfect basically when

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.530 
let start with perfect basically when
when<00:03:19.459> you<00:03:19.519> have<00:03:19.610> a<00:03:19.670> perfect<00:03:20.180> type<00:03:20.420> of

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
when you have a perfect type of

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.319 
when you have a perfect type of
resolution<00:03:20.810> what's<00:03:21.230> happening<00:03:21.620> there<00:03:21.829> is<00:03:22.329> the

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
resolution what's happening there is the

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.600 
resolution what's happening there is the
soprano<00:03:24.170> tones<00:03:24.560> surround<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.370> upper

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
soprano tones surround the upper

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.699 
soprano tones surround the upper
register<00:03:26.299> tones<00:03:26.510> surround<00:03:26.959> toward<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.530> root

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
register tones surround toward the root

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.130 
register tones surround toward the root
of<00:03:27.829> the<00:03:27.950> tonic<00:03:28.280> so<00:03:28.790> if<00:03:29.090> I<00:03:29.239> have<00:03:29.510> a<00:03:29.540> situation

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
of the tonic so if I have a situation

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.680 
of the tonic so if I have a situation
like<00:03:30.709> maybe<00:03:30.980> a<00:03:31.130> c-major<00:03:31.670> chord<00:03:31.940> coming<00:03:32.570> two

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
like maybe a c-major chord coming two

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:34.120 
like maybe a c-major chord coming two
and<00:03:32.840> a<00:03:32.870> half<00:03:33.019> we're<00:03:33.410> going<00:03:33.620> that<00:03:33.799> where<00:03:34.010> I<00:03:34.040> have

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 
and a half we're going that where I have

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:36.400 
and a half we're going that where I have
two<00:03:34.250> e<00:03:34.280> coming<00:03:34.880> to<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.090> F<00:03:35.209> or<00:03:35.720> maybe<00:03:35.930> a<00:03:36.019> C<00:03:36.230> major

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
two e coming to the F or maybe a C major

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.460 
two e coming to the F or maybe a C major
with<00:03:36.650> a<00:03:36.680> high<00:03:36.860> G<00:03:37.130> on<00:03:37.280> top<00:03:37.549> coming<00:03:37.820> to<00:03:37.970> that<00:03:38.090> F

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
with a high G on top coming to that F

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.210 
with a high G on top coming to that F
that<00:03:39.470> would<00:03:39.560> be<00:03:39.650> considered<00:03:40.040> a<00:03:40.420> perfect<00:03:42.220> type

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
that would be considered a perfect type

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.819 
that would be considered a perfect type
of<00:03:43.370> resolution<00:03:43.790> now<00:03:44.420> when<00:03:44.750> we<00:03:44.870> deal<00:03:45.320> with<00:03:45.350> the

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
of resolution now when we deal with the

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:48.400 
of resolution now when we deal with the
imperfect<00:03:46.340> that's<00:03:46.880> when<00:03:47.090> we<00:03:47.269> have<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:48.079> final

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
imperfect that's when we have the final

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.650 
imperfect that's when we have the final
tonic<00:03:48.739> triad<00:03:48.920> resolving<00:03:49.640> with<00:03:49.850> the<00:03:50.150> third<00:03:50.420> or

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
tonic triad resolving with the third or

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.720 
tonic triad resolving with the third or
the<00:03:50.690> fifth<00:03:50.930> up<00:03:51.230> top<00:03:51.470> so<00:03:51.680> that<00:03:52.040> could<00:03:52.370> be<00:03:52.519> a

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
the fifth up top so that could be a

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.520 
the fifth up top so that could be a
resolution<00:03:53.239> when<00:03:53.930> I<00:03:53.959> would<00:03:54.170> take<00:03:54.320> perhaps

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
resolution when I would take perhaps

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.699 
resolution when I would take perhaps
like<00:03:54.920> a<00:03:54.950> C<00:03:55.400> major<00:03:55.609> chord<00:03:55.959> with<00:03:56.959> maybe<00:03:57.170> a<00:03:57.290> G<00:03:57.560> on

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
like a C major chord with maybe a G on

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.620 
like a C major chord with maybe a G on
top<00:03:57.950> even<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:58.489> I<00:03:58.549> would<00:03:58.700> move<00:03:58.910> that<00:03:59.060> into<00:03:59.269> an<00:03:59.480> F

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
top even and I would move that into an F

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.390 
top even and I would move that into an F
chord<00:03:59.660> with<00:04:00.170> an<00:04:00.320> A<00:04:00.500> on<00:04:00.530> top<00:04:00.920> so<00:04:01.100> you<00:04:01.160> see<00:04:01.310> the

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
chord with an A on top so you see the

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.720 
chord with an A on top so you see the
third<00:04:01.579> is<00:04:01.760> on<00:04:01.910> top<00:04:03.070> let<00:04:04.070> me<00:04:04.160> get<00:04:04.280> one<00:04:04.430> with<00:04:04.609> the

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
third is on top let me get one with the

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.520 
third is on top let me get one with the
fifth<00:04:04.940> on<00:04:05.120> top<00:04:05.359> if<00:04:05.570> I<00:04:05.690> go<00:04:05.870> to<00:04:05.930> higher<00:04:06.230> on<00:04:06.440> the

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
fifth on top if I go to higher on the

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.380 
fifth on top if I go to higher on the
neck<00:04:06.709> and<00:04:06.950> I<00:04:07.010> have<00:04:07.190> a<00:04:07.220> C<00:04:07.459> major<00:04:07.670> chord<00:04:07.850> with

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
neck and I have a C major chord with

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.810 
neck and I have a C major chord with
this<00:04:08.570> C<00:04:09.049> root<00:04:09.290> on<00:04:09.440> top<00:04:09.650> and<00:04:09.890> I<00:04:10.310> keep<00:04:10.519> the<00:04:10.670> sea

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
this C root on top and I keep the sea

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.230 
this C root on top and I keep the sea
route<00:04:11.030> on<00:04:11.150> top<00:04:11.329> and<00:04:11.720> I<00:04:11.750> go<00:04:11.870> to<00:04:11.959> an<00:04:12.079> F<00:04:12.260> and<00:04:12.590> I<00:04:13.010> can

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:13.240 
route on top and I go to an F and I can

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.210 
route on top and I go to an F and I can
that<00:04:13.360> the<00:04:13.900> C<00:04:14.080> is<00:04:14.170> the<00:04:14.290> fifth<00:04:14.530> of<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.800> F<00:04:14.920> so<00:04:15.190> now

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
that the C is the fifth of the F so now

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.240 
that the C is the fifth of the F so now
we've<00:04:15.880> just<00:04:15.910> executed<00:04:16.660> an<00:04:16.780> imperfect<00:04:17.350> type<00:04:18.100> of

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
we've just executed an imperfect type of

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.370 
we've just executed an imperfect type of
resolution<00:04:18.489> so<00:04:19.030> the<00:04:19.600> last<00:04:19.750> one<00:04:19.959> to<00:04:20.140> take<00:04:20.350> a

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
resolution so the last one to take a

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.480 
resolution so the last one to take a
look<00:04:20.620> at<00:04:20.739> is<00:04:20.890> half<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:22.090> with<00:04:22.780> a<00:04:22.810> half<00:04:23.490> idea

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
look at is half so with a half idea

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.910 
look at is half so with a half idea
where<00:04:24.730> we're<00:04:25.090> basically<00:04:25.240> looking<00:04:26.050> at<00:04:26.410> going

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
where we're basically looking at going

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.280 
where we're basically looking at going
to<00:04:26.950> an<00:04:27.280> another<00:04:28.030> note<00:04:28.420> other<00:04:28.660> than<00:04:28.810> tonically

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:29.290 
to an another note other than tonically

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.380 
to an another note other than tonically
it<00:04:29.440> would<00:04:29.530> be<00:04:29.620> as<00:04:29.740> if<00:04:29.890> I<00:04:30.010> took<00:04:30.040> up<00:04:30.370> an<00:04:31.120> F<00:04:31.360> chord

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
it would be as if I took up an F chord

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.740 
it would be as if I took up an F chord
and<00:04:31.930> I<00:04:31.990> went<00:04:32.200> into<00:04:32.500> a<00:04:32.770> seaport<00:04:33.430> so<00:04:34.180> that's<00:04:34.630> a

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
and I went into a seaport so that's a

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.360 
and I went into a seaport so that's a
half<00:04:34.960> cadence<00:04:35.710> now<00:04:35.860> you<00:04:35.920> got<00:04:36.070> to<00:04:36.160> remember

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
half cadence now you got to remember

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.730 
half cadence now you got to remember
with<00:04:36.640> these<00:04:36.790> they<00:04:37.270> would<00:04:37.510> normally<00:04:37.840> occur<00:04:38.470> in

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
with these they would normally occur in

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.320 
with these they would normally occur in
the<00:04:38.860> middle<00:04:39.070> of<00:04:39.190> a<00:04:39.280> piece<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:39.760> similar<00:04:40.150> where

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
the middle of a piece and similar where

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.120 
the middle of a piece and similar where
you're<00:04:40.510> kind<00:04:40.810> of<00:04:40.870> wrapping<00:04:41.290> up<00:04:41.380> a<00:04:41.560> section<00:04:41.980> of

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
you're kind of wrapping up a section of

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.250 
you're kind of wrapping up a section of
the<00:04:42.220> piece<00:04:42.430> and<00:04:42.640> you're<00:04:42.790> going<00:04:43.510> to<00:04:43.570> go<00:04:43.780> on<00:04:43.990> to

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
the piece and you're going to go on to

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.900 
the piece and you're going to go on to
another<00:04:44.530> section<00:04:45.100> that's<00:04:45.310> normally<00:04:45.730> where

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
another section that's normally where

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.420 
another section that's normally where
those<00:04:46.090> types<00:04:46.690> would<00:04:46.930> occur<00:04:47.230> so<00:04:47.860> when<00:04:48.220> you<00:04:48.310> hear

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
those types would occur so when you hear

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.130 
those types would occur so when you hear
all<00:04:48.580> these<00:04:48.730> is<00:04:48.970> not<00:04:49.090> hard<00:04:49.330> to<00:04:49.390> tell<00:04:49.660> that<00:04:49.990> the

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
all these is not hard to tell that the

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.780 
all these is not hard to tell that the
perfect<00:04:50.500> provides<00:04:50.830> us<00:04:51.010> with<00:04:51.070> the<00:04:51.250> strongest

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
perfect provides us with the strongest

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:53.760 
perfect provides us with the strongest
implication<00:04:52.450> of<00:04:52.570> finality<00:04:52.930> when<00:04:53.590> we're

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
implication of finality when we're

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.500 
implication of finality when we're
wrapping<00:04:54.160> things<00:04:54.190> up<00:04:54.550> so<00:04:54.790> that<00:04:54.820> 5:1

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
wrapping things up so that 5:1

wrapping things up so that 5:1

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
resolution that's the strongest one if

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.130 
resolution that's the strongest one if
you're<00:04:57.670> in<00:04:57.730> minor<00:04:57.940> probably<00:04:58.570> most<00:04:59.020> people

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
you're in minor probably most people

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.250 
you're in minor probably most people
would<00:04:59.500> say<00:05:00.400> that<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.790> 5<00:05:01.510> has<00:05:01.750> a<00:05:01.780> dominant

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
would say that the 5 has a dominant

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.780 
would say that the 5 has a dominant
coming<00:05:02.590> around<00:05:02.800> to<00:05:02.980> the<00:05:03.100> minor<00:05:03.310> would<00:05:03.550> be<00:05:03.670> the

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:03.790 
coming around to the minor would be the

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.000 
coming around to the minor would be the
strongest<00:05:04.150> there<00:05:04.420> so<00:05:04.990> basically<00:05:05.380> that's<00:05:05.770> it

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
strongest there so basically that's it

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.650 
strongest there so basically that's it
those<00:05:06.310> are<00:05:06.430> Cadence's<00:05:06.880> they're<00:05:07.060> resolutions

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
those are Cadence's they're resolutions

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.780 
those are Cadence's they're resolutions
that's<00:05:08.350> that's<00:05:09.010> all<00:05:09.160> there<00:05:09.340> is<00:05:09.460> to<00:05:09.670> it

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
that's that's all there is to it

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.490 
that's that's all there is to it
essentially<00:05:10.240> a<00:05:10.270> cadence<00:05:10.630> basically<00:05:11.260> marks

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
essentially a cadence basically marks

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.650 
essentially a cadence basically marks
the<00:05:11.620> end<00:05:11.800> of<00:05:12.040> a<00:05:12.130> phrase<00:05:12.370> in<00:05:12.580> music<00:05:12.880> and<00:05:13.030> it

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
the end of a phrase in music and it

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.320 
the end of a phrase in music and it
essentially<00:05:14.230> combines<00:05:14.710> authentic<00:05:15.550> or<00:05:15.730> play

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
essentially combines authentic or play

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.510 
essentially combines authentic or play
GLE<00:05:16.540> with<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.560> forms<00:05:17.890> of<00:05:18.040> them<00:05:18.250> which<00:05:18.400> are

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
GLE with the forms of them which are

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.610 
GLE with the forms of them which are
basically<00:05:18.850> perfect<00:05:19.150> imp<00:05:19.600> for<00:05:19.840> imperfect<00:05:20.440> or

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
basically perfect imp for imperfect or

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.640 
basically perfect imp for imperfect or
half<00:05:20.920> when<00:05:21.910> they<00:05:22.090> are<00:05:22.420> basically<00:05:22.870> executed<00:05:23.530> so

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
half when they are basically executed so

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.100 
half when they are basically executed so
hopefully<00:05:24.160> that<00:05:24.490> helps<00:05:24.730> you<00:05:25.150> guys<00:05:25.600> out<00:05:25.870> and
