00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.660
 yes hello together now welcome to 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:10.500
 another let's play and yes there is 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:16.320
 yes now dry ball on I'll be there 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:18.619
 times with with holding green contrast that 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.619
 will 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.970
 Of course that's also it was 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.349
 pretty cool but positive 72 cards 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.250
 in there must be very short now 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.929
 see through 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.700
 then you have already times a 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.980
 Overview of the cards The educator 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.980
 think will be 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.790
 I also have flying creatures 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.790
 I will do that here accordingly 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.790
 to build 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:28.350
 nothing really had many 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.920
 grabbed is now but take out everything 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.260
 have to 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.940
 lisa gauck from I think a lot 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.650
 Artifacts that's why the removal is there 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.650
 Now I do not think so important 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.520
 this is well known the intro video think 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.520
 I 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.760
 It goes straight to the fight because that has 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.910
 I believe it all before 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.910
 shown and off you go the city hand 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.130
 should be with you life form for 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.130
 every creature that comes into play 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.080
 all combined with a card well 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.610
 nothing with noodle goes for example, the will 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.020
 more and more if you live the war 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.860
 now can not be a good combination 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.000
 become 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.850
 he wanted to have a look I have here 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.650
 so chastise a call as a barking 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.220
 second place and bound the angel 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.930
 he can also be nice about it 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.000
 It does not matter if you feel such a kind now 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.290
 Spider has or cares the host 55 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.430
 angels not really finished yet 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:42.280
 fire the 11.9 Lich with must be 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.340
 he can not do anything with that anyway 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.300
 to do the old country 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.370
 it does not hurt then 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.459
 yes yes calendars are missing now 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:55.780
 still good then two trains around 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.070
 to attract the quarter as reasonably well 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.750
 is already the country that is already 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:05.290
 pretty good I would say led 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.860
 2 I'm not under time pressure 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.730
 The deck makes good living points 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:13.299
 benefits from the life points 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:17.489
 of course I think that could be relative 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:20.500
 relax against baroque times look 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.760
 welcomes creatures to lay 45 leather 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.790
 back balance now i can, of course 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.290
 But I do not want to attack anymore 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.549
 I do not even think so 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.850
 let's just keep it open for 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.560
 Addicts think I'm running in four fives 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.030
 Canada where I shoot when I am 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.030
 have the my rc at disposal 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.150
 well, I'm not there on 66 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.340
 get there only from 30 life points 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.500
 I always do not get your bonus 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:51.319
 I prefer to breed that 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.160
 after 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.580
 which then brings me again the 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.730
 whole piece closer to the 30 life points 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.209
 there comes the funny run that gives 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.890
 I have two life points on 25 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:09.450
 of course, no shame how close the 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:14.310
 over 25 I'm cheating that 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.840
 little i play the very ascendant 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.940
 gets injured again 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.220
 leg po has come into play through it 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.889
 I live 31 and the ascendant is 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.889
 66 course that is now relatively so 

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.690
 painfully of course that an eu 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.690
 member 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.860
 because then he gets more brands which 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.620
 then live a pool player 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.620
 wars, et cetera, and is also itself 

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:54.610
 since 26 6 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:56.049
 that's pretty solid, I would 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.059
 times maintain the whole here has 

00:04:56.049 --> 00:05:00.059
 but 66 are life connections 

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:11.139
 Gauck puts his fifth country in attacks 

00:05:09.369 --> 00:05:15.849
 I did the thing that goes on 77 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:17.139
 if I remember right now 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.179
 But I'm supposed to keep us clean 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.439
 because I would like to be here with the 66 

00:05:19.179 --> 00:05:22.689
 attack live ticker 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:23.919
 then I have enough life for jobs 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:25.569
 to ignore attacks 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.199
 that's where the index on the bollard comes from 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:28.199
 unfortunately no goal 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.750
 okay there comes the next one tomorrow 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:53.710
 attack or offensive there is none 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.710
 reason to hold back the chains here 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:59.990
 for wearing brand blog speaks alike 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.150
 again at most one attacker as long 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.190
 he has not damaged a tramp is that 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.630
 everything relaxes that a good one 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:12.380
 relative goes to 99 because I'm six 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:15.820
 have life got hunting weapons ok 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.820
 shoots a horde nabg 

00:06:26.509 --> 00:06:33.689
 he does not attack because he 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:36.449
 probably wants to block 99 exactly 

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:42.809
 that's how it looks like in the future, however 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:50.039
 on 47 or his youtube meanwhile 

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:53.219
 11 11 now has even though I guess one 

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:55.229
 So the problem of the angels is enough for everyone 

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:56.759
 Three creatures kill him 

00:06:55.229 --> 00:07:00.199
 he would have to have three bloggers or 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:07:00.199
 can somehow prevent the damage 

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:11.219
 we are still a bit overkill me 

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:14.879
 say my life is still doubling 

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:16.800
 point once yes that can do this now 

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:17.939
 exactly made that should have 

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.279
 works wonderfully 

00:07:17.939 --> 00:07:23.029
 The fight was not really 

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:26.249
 hard though the revenge campaign was 

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:28.819
 we'll see who in the next video 

00:07:26.249 --> 00:07:28.819
 it works 

00:07:30.499 --> 00:07:36.000
 april instead 

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:37.230
 well here was gone and liliana I am 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.370
 curious I think I will now 

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:39.120
 even if I'm one last 

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.800
 Upload 

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.270
 that's always the two you are 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:44.910
 Now for the slightly longer plain chase 

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:46.620
 used to games and then that here 

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:50.690
 not so short it will be two 

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:52.440
 Then upload videos per day 

00:07:50.690 --> 00:07:53.610
 then you want to someday 

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.740
 to make the extension 

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.910
 So there is still a lot to do and yes me 

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:58.440
 hope you liked the video 

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.590
 Weber wish you a nice day until 

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.590
 soon
