a stent is a small metal scaffolding to

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:25.659 

with<00:05:23.959> recovery<00:05:24.439> first<00:05:24.709> and<00:05:24.979> basically

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:25.669 
with recovery first and basically

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:28.089 
with recovery first and basically
involves<00:05:26.449> usually<00:05:26.689> being<00:05:27.289> in<00:05:27.439> bed<00:05:27.649> after<00:05:28.009> the

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.099 
involves usually being in bed after the

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:30.549 
involves usually being in bed after the

procedure for four to six hours after

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:32.409 
procedure for four to six hours after
that<00:05:30.889> generally<00:05:31.339> a<00:05:31.369> patient<00:05:31.789> can<00:05:31.939> get<00:05:32.059> up<00:05:32.209> and

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:32.419 
that generally a patient can get up and

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:34.479 
that generally a patient can get up and
walk<00:05:32.539> around<00:05:32.779> and<00:05:33.229> should<00:05:33.409> do<00:05:33.529> fine<00:05:33.739> and

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:34.489 
walk around and should do fine and

00:05:34.489 --> 00:05:36.249 
walk around and should do fine and
almost<00:05:34.849> every<00:05:35.239> patient<00:05:35.449> that<00:05:35.689> we<00:05:35.869> treat<00:05:36.110> with

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:36.259 
almost every patient that we treat with

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:38.169 
almost every patient that we treat with
the<00:05:36.319> stent<00:05:36.619> goes<00:05:36.949> home<00:05:37.189> through<00:05:37.489> the<00:05:37.549> hospital

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:38.179 
the stent goes home through the hospital

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:41.139 
the stent goes home through the hospital
either<00:05:38.569> the<00:05:38.809> same<00:05:39.019> day<00:05:39.079> or<00:05:39.319> the<00:05:39.709> next<00:05:39.860> day

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:41.149 
either the same day or the next day

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:43.149 
either the same day or the next day
so<00:05:41.509> the<00:05:41.629> recovery<00:05:41.899> is<00:05:42.169> extremely<00:05:42.709> quick<00:05:42.919> the

00:05:43.149 --> 00:05:43.159 
so the recovery is extremely quick the

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:44.979 
so the recovery is extremely quick the
patient<00:05:43.549> may<00:05:43.639> be<00:05:43.669> a<00:05:43.819> bit<00:05:44.059> sore<00:05:44.360> in<00:05:44.659> the<00:05:44.749> groin

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:44.989

from where the tubes were placed to put

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.579 
from where the tubes were placed to put
the<00:05:48.499> stent<00:05:48.769> in<00:05:48.979> but<00:05:49.579> recovery<00:05:50.179> is<00:05:50.719> almost

00:05:51.579 --> 00:05:51.589 
the stent in but recovery is almost

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:54.459 
the stent in but recovery is almost
always<00:05:51.919> within<00:05:52.429> 24<00:05:52.969> hours<00:05:52.999> and<00:05:53.779> patients<00:05:54.349> are

a<00:06:15.020> procedure

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
a procedure

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.920 
a procedure
what<00:06:17.130> is<00:06:17.220> it<00:06:17.370> going<00:06:17.520> to<00:06:17.610> do<00:06:17.760> for<00:06:17.970> me<00:06:18.419> there<00:06:18.810> are

what is it going to do for me there are

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.870 
what is it going to do for me there are
basically<00:06:19.380> two<00:06:19.500> reasons<00:06:20.010> that<00:06:20.460> we<00:06:20.610> place

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
basically two reasons that we place

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.180 
basically two reasons that we place

vents and people's coronary arteries one

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.370 
vents and people's coronary arteries one
is<00:06:23.490> to<00:06:23.790> relieve<00:06:24.090> the<00:06:24.330> chest<00:06:24.600> discomfort<00:06:24.840> that

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:25.380 
is to relieve the chest discomfort that

comes from heart blockage in that chest

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.960 
comes from heart blockage in that chest
discomfort<00:06:27.330> is<00:06:27.750> called<00:06:28.020> angina<00:06:28.500> or<00:06:28.830> angina

that's<00:06:30.720> an<00:06:30.870> excellent<00:06:31.169> reason<00:06:31.680> to<00:06:31.710> places

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
that's an excellent reason to places

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:01.470 
type of heart attack where we place the

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.170 
type of heart attack where we place the
step<00:07:01.710> to<00:07:01.920> prevent<00:07:02.250> them<00:07:02.430> from<00:07:02.460> having<00:07:02.820> another

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:06.510 
type of the heart attack so I think it's

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:09.340 
type of the heart attack so I think it's
important<00:07:07.020> to<00:07:07.230> understand

that that stent needs to be placed and

that that stent needs to be placed and
