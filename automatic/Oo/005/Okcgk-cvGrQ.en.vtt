00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
your very first setup when you bought

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.350 
your very first setup when you bought
your<00:02:11.620> phone<00:02:11.860> a<00:02:11.890> brand<00:02:12.370> new<00:02:12.610> so<00:02:13.209> that's

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
your phone a brand new so that's

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.880 
your phone a brand new so that's
essentially<00:02:13.810> what<00:02:14.019> it<00:02:14.110> is<00:02:14.140> what<00:02:14.470> a<00:02:14.500> factory

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
essentially what it is what a factory

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.790 
essentially what it is what a factory
reset<00:02:15.069> is<00:02:15.400> so<00:02:15.670> maybe<00:02:16.300> your<00:02:16.569> phone<00:02:16.870> is<00:02:17.019> slowing

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
reset is so maybe your phone is slowing

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.490 
reset is so maybe your phone is slowing
down<00:02:17.830> over<00:02:18.250> time<00:02:18.700> or<00:02:19.660> maybe<00:02:19.870> you<00:02:20.080> just<00:02:20.110> found

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.039 
down over time or maybe you just found
something<00:02:20.800> for<00:02:21.489> other<00:02:21.730> reasons<00:02:22.150> or<00:02:22.629> personal

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
something for other reasons or personal

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.809
