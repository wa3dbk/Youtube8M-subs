00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:08.200 
attaching a kreega u.s. 30 bag to my

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.999 
attaching a kreega u.s. 30 bag to my
iron<00:00:08.800> 883<00:00:09.360> I<00:00:10.360> had<00:00:10.809> one<00:00:10.960> attached<00:00:11.230> in<00:00:11.440> Ward<00:00:11.709> and

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:12.009 
iron 883 I had one attached in Ward and

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.730 
iron 883 I had one attached in Ward and
the<00:00:12.669> way<00:00:12.759> I<00:00:12.789> attached<00:00:13.209> it<00:00:13.450> is<00:00:13.599> by<00:00:13.809> tying<00:00:14.230> two

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
the way I attached it is by tying two

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.340 
the way I attached it is by tying two
straps<00:00:15.280> together<00:00:15.669> and<00:00:16.150> I'm<00:00:16.539> placing<00:00:16.840> it<00:00:17.140> on

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:17.350 
straps together and I'm placing it on

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.930 
straps together and I'm placing it on
the<00:00:17.410> seat<00:00:17.800> here

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:18.940 
the seat here

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.580 
the seat here
so<00:00:19.420> the<00:00:19.539> actual<00:00:19.840> straps<00:00:20.109> will<00:00:20.289> be<00:00:20.349> running

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
so the actual straps will be running

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.589 
so the actual straps will be running
under<00:00:20.740> the<00:00:20.920> seat<00:00:21.160> I<00:00:21.460> encountered<00:00:22.390> a<00:00:22.449> little

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:22.599 
under the seat I encountered a little

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:24.900 
under the seat I encountered a little
bit<00:00:22.810> of<00:00:22.900> a<00:00:22.960> problem<00:00:23.199> with<00:00:23.679> the<00:00:23.800> bike<00:00:24.009> because<00:00:24.880> I

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
bit of a problem with the bike because I

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.999 
bit of a problem with the bike because I
found<00:00:25.240> the<00:00:25.599> whole<00:00:25.869> bag<00:00:26.109> was<00:00:26.320> shifting<00:00:26.740> towards

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 
found the whole bag was shifting towards

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:28.769 
found the whole bag was shifting towards
the<00:00:27.160> back<00:00:27.369> and<00:00:27.699> all<00:00:28.179> the<00:00:28.330> weight<00:00:28.509> was<00:00:28.750> just

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
the back and all the weight was just

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.740 
the back and all the weight was just
pressing<00:00:29.230> here<00:00:29.529> on<00:00:29.650> the<00:00:29.769> screw<00:00:30.070> now<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:31.539> screw

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:31.750 
pressing here on the screw now the screw

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.330 
pressing here on the screw now the screw
looks<00:00:31.990> pretty<00:00:32.200> heavy<00:00:32.380> enough<00:00:32.680> to<00:00:32.740> be<00:00:33.010> holding

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.340 
looks pretty heavy enough to be holding

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.700 
looks pretty heavy enough to be holding
at<00:00:33.430> least<00:00:33.460> a<00:00:33.730> 30<00:00:34.000> bag<00:00:34.270> but<00:00:34.990> my<00:00:35.230> plan<00:00:35.500> is<00:00:35.680> to

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
at least a 30 bag but my plan is to

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.299 
at least a 30 bag but my plan is to
eventually<00:00:36.070> attach<00:00:37.050> two<00:00:38.050> 20s<00:00:38.620> to<00:00:38.770> the<00:00:38.800> 30<00:00:39.129> as

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
eventually attach two 20s to the 30 as

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:41.369 
eventually attach two 20s to the 30 as
well<00:00:39.520> so<00:00:40.149> that's<00:00:40.300> going<00:00:40.420> to<00:00:40.480> be<00:00:40.629> significantly

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
well so that's going to be significantly

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.670 
well so that's going to be significantly
more<00:00:41.469> weight<00:00:42.539> my<00:00:43.539> idea<00:00:43.780> right<00:00:43.930> now<00:00:43.989> instead<00:00:44.620> of

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
more weight my idea right now instead of

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.160 
more weight my idea right now instead of
putting<00:00:45.160> the<00:00:45.550> straps<00:00:46.360> underneath<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:46.899> seat

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
putting the straps underneath the seat

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.020 
putting the straps underneath the seat
I'm<00:00:47.890> going<00:00:48.039> to<00:00:48.100> actually<00:00:48.370> attach<00:00:48.430> them<00:00:48.789> to<00:00:48.910> the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
I'm going to actually attach them to the

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.900 
I'm going to actually attach them to the
frame<00:00:49.210> right<00:00:49.870> here<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:51.160> let's<00:00:51.460> do<00:00:51.609> it

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910

make<00:02:08.380> sure<00:02:08.649> it's<00:02:08.800> nice<00:02:08.920> and<00:02:09.160> tight

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.869 

this<00:02:13.580> way

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
this way

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:23.720 
this way
Byron's<00:02:15.569> development

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:34.559 

all<00:02:24.150> right<00:02:24.440> she<00:02:25.440> is<00:02:25.470> nice<00:02:26.160> and<00:02:26.190> tight

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.589 

okay

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
okay

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.880 
okay
now<00:02:36.749> we're<00:02:36.870> going<00:02:36.959> to<00:02:37.019> cut<00:02:37.170> these<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.530> burn<00:02:37.739> it

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
now we're going to cut these and burn it

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.140 
now we're going to cut these and burn it
so<00:02:38.549> that<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:38.879> doesn't<00:02:39.120> get<00:02:39.329> caught<00:02:39.540> on

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.869 

to<00:02:43.209> make<00:02:43.390> our<00:02:43.540> lives<00:02:43.750> really<00:02:44.140> really<00:02:44.440> bad<00:02:44.879> last

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 
to make our lives really really bad last

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.930 
to make our lives really really bad last
step<00:02:46.150> before<00:02:46.450> we<00:02:46.690> actually<00:02:47.140> attach<00:02:47.379> the<00:02:47.409> bag

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
step before we actually attach the bag

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.530 
step before we actually attach the bag
is<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.209> cut<00:02:49.390> off<00:02:49.540> some<00:02:49.780> of<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.959> slack<00:02:50.640> I<00:02:51.640> don't

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
is to cut off some of the slack I don't

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.180 
is to cut off some of the slack I don't
want<00:02:52.659> to<00:02:52.720> cut<00:02:52.870> off<00:02:52.959> so<00:02:53.260> much<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:53.769> I<00:02:53.890> won't<00:02:54.099> be

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
want to cut off so much that I won't be

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.190 
want to cut off so much that I won't be
able<00:02:54.310> to<00:02:54.400> use<00:02:55.000> this<00:02:55.239> as<00:02:55.480> leverage<00:02:55.629> anymore

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
able to use this as leverage anymore

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.110 
able to use this as leverage anymore
something<00:02:57.069> and<00:02:57.220> right<00:02:57.340> around<00:02:57.519> here<00:02:57.849> should

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
something and right around here should

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:09.580 
something and right around here should
be<00:02:58.209> pretty<00:02:58.450> good

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.430 

now<00:03:10.040> the<00:03:10.220> trick<00:03:10.459> once<00:03:10.880> you<00:03:11.000> cut<00:03:11.840> them<00:03:12.020> off<00:03:12.170> it's

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
now the trick once you cut them off it's

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.290 
now the trick once you cut them off it's
just<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.709> Burnett<00:03:13.160> we<00:03:13.850> just<00:03:14.000> want<00:03:14.120> to<00:03:14.180> make<00:03:14.240> sure

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
just a Burnett we just want to make sure

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.290 
just a Burnett we just want to make sure
that<00:03:14.540> n<00:03:14.690> is<00:03:14.780> not<00:03:14.900> going<00:03:15.050> to<00:03:15.110> unravel<00:03:16.150> I'm<00:03:17.150> going

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
that n is not going to unravel I'm going

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:22.920 
that n is not going to unravel I'm going
to<00:03:17.360> do<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.540> same<00:03:17.690> thing<00:03:17.930> here<00:03:18.170> on<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.380> cent

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.540 

again<00:03:23.500> I'm<00:03:23.590> just<00:03:23.709> making<00:03:24.010> sure<00:03:24.040> that<00:03:24.220> it's<00:03:24.459> not

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:24.550 
again I'm just making sure that it's not

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:32.770 
again I'm just making sure that it's not
gonna<00:03:24.700> get<00:03:24.849> caught<00:03:25.060> up<00:03:25.239> in<00:03:25.360> anything

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.440
