this<00:00:45.840> side<00:00:46.079> maybe<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.410> should<00:00:46.559> turn<00:00:46.649> it

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
here on both sides and it should just

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.730 
here on both sides and it should just
drop<00:01:11.189> right<00:01:11.610> into<00:01:11.820> your<00:01:12.180> air<00:01:12.930> intake<00:01:13.200> box<00:01:13.560> and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
they still want to get the power

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.289 
they still want to get the power
benefits<00:01:19.020> from<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.409> by<00:01:20.130> going<00:01:20.369> with<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.820> just

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
benefits from it by going with a just

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.999 
benefits from it by going with a just
even<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.570> filter<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.140> stock<00:01:22.380> filter<00:01:22.740> is<00:01:22.799> so

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
even a filter the stock filter is so

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.039 
even a filter the stock filter is so
restrictive<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.820> by<00:01:24.540> going<00:01:24.750> with<00:01:24.840> one<00:01:25.020> of

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
restrictive that by going with one of

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.810 
restrictive that by going with one of
these<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.500> increase<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> lot<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.220> air<00:01:26.759> flow

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
these you can increase a lot of air flow

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.270 
these you can increase a lot of air flow
which<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.390> great<00:01:27.630> increases<00:01:28.290> power<00:01:28.560> fuel

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
which is great increases power fuel

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.429 
which is great increases power fuel
economy<00:01:29.490> torque<00:01:29.970> pretty<00:01:30.720> much<00:01:30.840> good<00:01:31.140> for

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
economy torque pretty much good for

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.319 
economy torque pretty much good for
everything<00:01:32.369> which<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.520> nice<00:01:32.790> but<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.030> do<00:01:33.150> have

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
everything which is nice but you do have

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.149 
everything which is nice but you do have
to<00:01:33.450> sometimes<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:33.900> careful<00:01:34.259> just<00:01:34.770> make<00:01:34.979> sure

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
to sometimes be careful just make sure

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:37.850 
to sometimes be careful just make sure
