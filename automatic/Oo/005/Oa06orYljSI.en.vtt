00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.160 

it<00:01:11.979> was<00:01:12.100> it<00:01:13.090> was<00:01:13.209> bothered<00:01:13.509> me<00:01:13.600> a<00:01:13.630> lot<00:01:13.810> actually

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
it was it was bothered me a lot actually

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.480

especially<00:01:14.530> during<00:01:14.649> the<00:01:14.770> drills<00:01:15.039> yeah<00:01:15.340> it

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
especially during the drills yeah it

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.699 
especially during the drills yeah it
wasn't<00:01:15.670> it<00:01:16.270> wasn't<00:01:16.420> killing<00:01:16.689> me<00:01:16.749> down<00:01:16.899> 40<00:01:17.319> but

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:17.709 
wasn't it wasn't killing me down 40 but

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:21.280 
wasn't it wasn't killing me down 40 but
once<00:01:18.340> I<00:01:18.429> got<00:01:18.579> to<00:01:18.759> position

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.350 

it<00:01:21.890> was<00:01:22.010> the<00:01:22.160> period<00:01:22.610> like<00:01:22.760> between<00:01:23.240> the

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
it was the period like between the

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.720 
it was the period like between the
combine<00:01:23.870> and<00:01:24.140> today<00:01:24.470> I<00:01:24.500> mean<00:01:24.860> that's<00:01:25.070> I'm<00:01:25.520> sure

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
combine and today I mean that's I'm sure

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.180 
combine and today I mean that's I'm sure
there's<00:01:25.970> a<00:01:26.030> lot<00:01:26.180> of<00:01:26.270> anxiety<00:01:26.980> yeah<00:01:27.980> actually

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
there's a lot of anxiety yeah actually

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.320 
there's a lot of anxiety yeah actually
there's<00:01:28.970> a<00:01:29.030> lot<00:01:29.150> of<00:01:29.270> downtime<00:01:29.800> that's<00:01:30.800> I<00:01:31.330> think

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
there's a lot of downtime that's I think

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.280 
there's a lot of downtime that's I think
it<00:01:32.390> was<00:01:32.480> a<00:01:32.510> good<00:01:32.660> thing<00:01:32.780> because<00:01:32.900> it<00:01:33.080> gave<00:01:33.170> me<00:01:33.230> a

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
it was a good thing because it gave me a

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.900 
it was a good thing because it gave me a
chance<00:01:33.440> to<00:01:33.560> kind<00:01:33.830> of<00:01:33.890> recover<00:01:34.160> and<00:01:34.610> stuff<00:01:34.790> like

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
chance to kind of recover and stuff like

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.790 
chance to kind of recover and stuff like
that<00:01:35.120> but<00:01:35.360> uh<00:01:35.420> you<00:01:36.050> know<00:01:36.140> it<00:01:36.290> was<00:01:36.440> very<00:01:36.650> little

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
that but uh you know it was very little

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.260 
that but uh you know it was very little
working<00:01:37.160> out<00:01:37.280> and<00:01:37.460> just<00:01:37.610> kind<00:01:37.910> of<00:01:37.940> working<00:01:38.150> on

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
working out and just kind of working on

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:44.860 
working out and just kind of working on
technique<00:01:38.600> stuff<00:01:43.120> I<00:01:44.120> think<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.420> first<00:01:44.690> time

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:44.870 
technique stuff I think the first time

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.440 
technique stuff I think the first time
was<00:01:44.960> four<00:01:45.140> six<00:01:45.350> five<00:01:47.350> I<00:01:49.030> was<00:01:50.030> shooting<00:01:50.330> just
