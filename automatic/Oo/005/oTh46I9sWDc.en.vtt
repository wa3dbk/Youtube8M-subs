00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:04.620
 the net through the building in Rotterdam was transformed into a Friday morning 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.070
 pinball machine 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.460
 It is the first time that a mega large canvas covers the entire side of the building 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.639
 ornaments 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.530
 car manufacturer nissan kicks with this stunt the campaign for the nissan qasqai design 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:19.449
 Sidewalk 2 is the series off it is the booms blood sweat and tears 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.270
 but the result is good, the summer started 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:26.720
 from today 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.509
 it's all true 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:29.739
 Dutchman 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.030
 we have very limited but i can not go so well the windows media player 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.760
 required 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.200
 look behind the scenes 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.769
 Spain fits in perfectly with the opportunity 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:41.769
 the campaign we already had on TV 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.840
 in the city 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.609
 to commit that case with city 

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:48.020
 so where can we express better 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.210
 then you are in the middle of a big city 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.580
 we came to this location because 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.050
 Rotterdam of course winning the second city of the Netherlands is a big city 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.500
 the building it is on is one of the line bars of Rotterdam all over 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.950
 recognizable in the skyline so everyone sees it immediately 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.580
 is in the big city 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.610
 the rotterdammers think this car is on the wall 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.610
 no I have never seen such a product before 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.340
 mh 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.500
 I think he drives sees that 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.960
 beware of the shape of the building of the texture that the supports 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.330
 he is now like this 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.460
 nice stunt 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.660
 a number of tourists have the keys to the saker sprint 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.980
 moments later, however, it was proceeding 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.100
 it is not clear there is author of the showers 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.399
 then watch out that you put that afterwards and then 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.929
 that he suited 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:43.179
 I know that this is larger than what is in the making but I think there is that makes it 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:44.400
 we in the west 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.540
 almost 12,000 square meters 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.450
 what is hanging there has never hung such a large canvas in the city and 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.840
 of course not that it is built that is 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.770
 I say what an absolute the first time is 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.230
 are two elements that make it special 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.230
 First, that is the 3D effect because of the button 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.850
 shooting the car in the city 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.640
 is actually in 3d on the roof of the building 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.759
 on the second the light effects are the bottom 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.409
 especially the slices 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:14.859
 at the bottom of the screen 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:15.870
 they will in the evening 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.670
 to light up 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.759
 allowing it to get real pinball machines 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:22.129
 haarlem the nest was always looking for promotions that fit very well with our brand 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.559
 and our cars and this is that person who expressed all those things 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:29.909
 those elements come together 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:33.569
 constantly looking for this kind of spectacular manifestations there will be 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:34.909
 no doubt even more 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.409
 the scaffolding will remain in the port of Rotterdam for another two months
