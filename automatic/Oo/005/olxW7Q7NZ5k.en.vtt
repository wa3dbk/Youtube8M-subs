we hit the G in the bass on the C garden
but<00:02:46.640> down<00:02:46.850> on<00:02:46.880> the<00:02:47.150> picture<00:02:47.630> of<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.930> chord<00:02:48.470> on

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
but down on the picture of the chord on

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.890 
but down on the picture of the chord on
the<00:02:48.739> PDF<00:02:49.100> but<00:02:49.580> you'll<00:02:50.060> figure<00:02:50.330> that<00:02:50.420> not<00:02:50.750> only

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
the PDF but you'll figure that not only

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.580 
the PDF but you'll figure that not only
happens<00:02:51.320> once<00:02:51.620> and<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.880> other<00:02:53.000> court<00:02:53.390> is<00:02:53.570> a<00:02:53.870> g7

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
would be in the base and that on a few

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.850 
would be in the base and that on a few
occasions<00:03:00.140> will<00:03:00.830> grab<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:02.900> know<00:03:03.019> I'm<00:03:03.290> a<00:03:03.500> corn

times

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:16.050 
times
and<00:03:09.400> that's<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:09.940> two<00:03:10.510> chords<00:03:14.610> so<00:03:15.610> obviously
