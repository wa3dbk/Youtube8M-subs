00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
genres that I don't like so I'm not

play<00:02:21.890> five<00:02:22.220> hours<00:02:22.519> of<00:02:22.700> music<00:02:22.940> that<00:02:23.360> I

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
play five hours of music that I

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.930 
play five hours of music that I
absolutely<00:02:23.750> don't<00:02:24.290> like<00:02:24.560> very<00:02:25.280> simple<00:02:25.760> I

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
absolutely don't like very simple I

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.809 
absolutely don't like very simple I
would<00:02:26.480> feel<00:02:26.810> miserable<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:28.280> I<00:02:28.400> mean<00:02:28.550> this<00:02:28.670> is

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
would feel miserable and I mean this is

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.430 
would feel miserable and I mean this is
this<00:02:29.000> is<00:02:29.060> extreme<00:02:29.510> is<00:02:29.660> five<00:02:29.900> hours<00:02:30.110> long

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
this is extreme is five hours long

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.360 
this is extreme is five hours long
that's<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.560> reason<00:02:33.800> why<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:33.920> wouldn't<00:02:34.250> do<00:02:34.340> it

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
that's the reason why I wouldn't do it

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.660 
that's the reason why I wouldn't do it
now<00:02:34.610> of<00:02:34.790> course<00:02:35.060> if<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:36.200> could<00:02:36.440> step<00:02:36.890> past<00:02:37.310> that

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
now of course if I could step past that

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.210 
now of course if I could step past that
because<00:02:38.540> the<00:02:38.720> paycheck<00:02:39.260> would<00:02:39.410> be<00:02:39.590> so<00:02:39.950> good

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
because the paycheck would be so good

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.449 
because the paycheck would be so good
and<00:02:40.489> I<00:02:41.480> would<00:02:41.540> say<00:02:41.930> alright<00:02:42.440> I'm<00:02:43.099> gonna<00:02:43.310> be

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
and I would say alright I'm gonna be

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.190 
and I would say alright I'm gonna be
miserable<00:02:43.730> for<00:02:44.120> five<00:02:44.330> hours<00:02:44.360> but<00:02:44.930> it's<00:02:45.049> gonna

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
miserable for five hours but it's gonna

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.920 
miserable for five hours but it's gonna
give<00:02:45.440> me<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.680> lot<00:02:45.890> of<00:02:45.950> money<00:02:46.450> I'm<00:02:47.450> not<00:02:47.510> gonna<00:02:47.810> do

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
give me a lot of money I'm not gonna do

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.800 
give me a lot of money I'm not gonna do
that<00:02:47.959> but<00:02:48.230> just<00:02:48.530> imagine<00:02:49.340> if<00:02:49.430> I<00:02:49.519> would<00:02:49.810> that

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
that but just imagine if I would that

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.059 
that but just imagine if I would that
would<00:02:51.019> mean<00:02:51.200> that<00:02:51.230> I<00:02:51.440> would<00:02:51.560> have<00:02:51.830> to<00:02:51.950> play

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
would mean that I would have to play

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.979 
would mean that I would have to play
five<00:02:52.370> hours<00:02:52.819> of<00:02:52.849> music<00:02:53.269> that<00:02:53.390> I<00:02:53.450> don't<00:02:53.720> like

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
five hours of music that I don't like

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.259 
five hours of music that I don't like
now<00:02:54.560> when<00:02:55.069> it<00:02:55.160> comes<00:02:55.250> to<00:02:55.430> music<00:02:55.549> that<00:02:55.849> I<00:02:56.060> don't

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
now when it comes to music that I don't

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.420 
now when it comes to music that I don't
like<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:57.290> this<00:02:57.530> also<00:02:57.739> means<00:02:58.069> that<00:02:58.280> I<00:02:58.310> don't

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
like that this also means that I don't

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.190 
like that this also means that I don't
play<00:02:58.790> that<00:02:58.970> music<00:02:59.090> I<00:02:59.480> don't<00:02:59.690> listen<00:02:59.870> to<00:03:00.019> that
