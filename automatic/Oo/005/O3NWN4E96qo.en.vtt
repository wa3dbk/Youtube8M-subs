 his YouTube channel called elsa 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.079
 vargas let's start the materials I'm going 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.320
 to put down here in the box 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.750
 information just get you're going to 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.750
 need a box that fits your 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.910
 I have this doll but you can 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.320
 use any box but you have to 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.290
 be sure that the doll that goes 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.630
 perfectly 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.270
 and as I have these pasta 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:54.240
 then I will use two to make it 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.430
 wider the bed and you will cover 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.380
 with this paper was from the store 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.200
 crafts and I found this paper that 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:05.330
 simulates being marble the mind is very 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.330
 cheap here is the price 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.600
 so it's very easy to get and it's 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.280
 very cheap and what are you going to do 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.280
 it is simply to line your box 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.670
 the one very well with you with silicone 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.590
 hot and then proceeds lining 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.000
 this part not because this part is going to be 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.150
 for the header then we're going to 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.799
 get this thick cardboard or like 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.700
 I teach you in a previous video you're going to 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:34.140
 take 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:37.799
 in normal cookie box in this case 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:40.189
 of any box if you have in your 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.189
 home 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.649
 we are not going to talk about how 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.290
 and you are going to make your header you are going to choose 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.390
 the height of the header and the shape of the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.270
 header or you can do it with this type 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.820
 of cardboard that is a little thicker that 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.159
 It depends on what you have in your house 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:08.579
 then what you simply do 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.579
 do you design your header just like 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:16.410
 black so that it feels very good 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.410
 plus the width of your bed 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.750
 you do the design 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.510
 once you made this design 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.640
 just what you're going to do is you're going to 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.490
 cut it with the help of scissors and 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.430
 an adult with the help of a cutter you go to 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:40.070
 well your perfect design that is 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:45.330
 even but you can do it round 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:47.670
 or as you want that is something that 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.520
 you have to decide the cuts and you go 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.480
 to go to cover you take your fill napa 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.820
 which you use to fill to fill 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.430
 stuffed animals or pillows and with a little 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:03.500
 silicone you will proceed to paste it like this 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.090
 that 's a bit of silicone and put reyno 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.180
 nothing for being little and press and 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.819
 stuffed and then you're going to take a cloth 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.609
 in this case I'm going to use pink I'm going to 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.879
 use the same fabric that I used to 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:19.950
 my katrina bed because they are 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.140
 in my roommate's house 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.900
 so I want the beds to be a 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.230
 little similar 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.069
 then you're just going to cover it and 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:30.069
 then you are going to catch 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:36.569
 here I have it lined 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.970
 stick some silicon here for 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:42.720
 secure the metal and then you take your 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.100
 wire and with the help of your fingers or 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.930
 a 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.930
 round nose pliers 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:53.720
 I do not know where you are simply going to do 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.730
 Thread design with your hands because 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.250
 really this craft wire 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.890
 it's very soft it's very easy to work 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.890
 with him and you're going to start making your design 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.670
 because we are doing this design for 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:12.250
 the catrÃ­n and for rosell exactly 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.220
 the same detail I hope that both 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.410
 share 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.170
 this same detail in your shoes 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.780
 then as they are partners of 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:24.350
 room my house monster skype 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.350
 I want that 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.490
 have this detail of the two 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:42.540
 is that with even a nail clipper 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:46.170
 I can cut it is very easy to work 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:49.110
 If necessary, you can ensure your 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:51.120
 wire with thread and needle you give 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.790
 stitches here in some areas 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.310
 strategic 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.720
 to secure the wire and give it more 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.720
 fixing in your bed head 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.420
 I'm going to insure it from the back 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.230
 with a little silicone 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.460
 hot licona 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:10.380
 to keep it from moving 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:12.569
 and that was why you're just going to do 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:15.000
 is that you're going to take the bed the box that 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:16.740
 you formed with the paper that pretends to be 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.440
 marble 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.450
 and you're going to hit the header 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.640
 like in the catering bed of it 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:27.510
 way you are going to leave this part without filling 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:29.670
 napa and you're going to stick the fabric very well with 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:31.530
 the hot silicone so that when 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.750
 paste the header to stay fixed and not 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.840
 is a place very match and move 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.150
 then the head of your bed 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.300
 and then now made with silicone 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.300
 hot 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:50.060
 we simply proceed to put the 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.060
 Headboard 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:56.510
 it fits very well that everything fits 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.040
 perfectly 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:00.040
 you do some pressure 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:29.069
 and this stays from this 

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:32.310
 optionally here you can put a 

00:06:29.069 --> 00:06:34.110
 felt patch of the same color a 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.220
 piece of cardboard to cover and a 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:36.569
 I'm really going to leave it like this because 

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.759
 part goes to the wall and nobody goes to 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:41.220
 see then I do not want to spend materials 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:43.949
 for something that nobody is going to see and this is 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.370
 the result as I told you in the video 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:51.580
 previous in the video of the bed of 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:55.449
 katrin they two have this same 

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:58.210
 detail in their shoes is very similar 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:07:00.070
 then their beds are similar 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:01.960
 as well 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:04.630
 and there it is, I hope you like it, I hope 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.460
 that you do it I hope that you comment 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.420
 subscribe and see you in the next 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:10.800
 video bye 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:10.800
 a monstrous hug for all of you
