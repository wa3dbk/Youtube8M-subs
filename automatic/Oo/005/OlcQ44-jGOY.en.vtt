00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:08.220
 let's see other examples to be able to extract 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:11.190
 prime factors for example 80 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:16.110
 the 80 is divisible by 2 remember 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.029
 always use 2 on 3 and 5 on 7 and 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.540
 which we first use as for 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:28.410
 be able to invoice much faster 80's 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:33.420
 videos 240 divided 220 hybrid 2 and 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.800
 gave 25 on 5 only is spotted 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.300
 divisible by 5 therefore 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:44.190
 finish the decomposition of 80 that 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.780
 I say 80 is the same 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.800
 a 2 1 2 3 4 times 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.800
 for 5 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.160
 this is the decomposition of the other 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.960
 let's see another example 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.960
 the number 29 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.800
 well we said that we have to use 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:13.060
 to know if it's easier 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:16.570
 any of these as I realized if 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.090
 is divisible by 2 its termination must 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:25.270
 be even figure remember that the figures 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:27.990
 pairs are those ending in 0 2 4 8 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.990
 6 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.740
 and how do I know if it's divisible by 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:38.790
 3 the sum of these 2 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.880
 if you have to give a number 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.720
 divisible by 3 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.420
 this gives me 11 and 11 it's not hard anyone 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.229
 my sun 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.229
 13 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.430
 forgiveness is not a multiple of 3 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.300
 then you can not divide it either by 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.360
 3 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.300
 to be divisible by 5 has to 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.780
 end in zero and in 5 then do not 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.850
 can live if it's number 29 is a 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.910
 case of prime number therefore the 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:19.620
 prime numbers in this part we made that 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:25.019
 only the prime numbers go 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.019
 29 can only be divided by 29 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.159
 but sensible
