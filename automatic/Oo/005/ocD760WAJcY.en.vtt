00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
and in this case it's screw threaded

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.660 
and in this case it's screw threaded
through<00:00:22.770> the<00:00:23.220> baffle<00:00:25.130> into<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.279> exhaust

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
through the baffle into the exhaust

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.819 
through the baffle into the exhaust
sleeve<00:00:29.660> by<00:00:30.660> bit<00:00:30.899> are<00:00:31.110> in<00:00:31.320> key<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.710> this

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:31.829 
sleeve by bit are in key in this

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.389 
sleeve by bit are in key in this
instance<00:00:32.510> usually<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.860> get<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.130> point

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
instance usually is get it to the point

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.500 
instance usually is get it to the point
where<00:00:35.550> it's<00:00:35.700> pretty<00:00:35.910> straight

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
where it's pretty straight

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.450 
where it's pretty straight

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
that the screw will fall out

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.860 
that the screw will fall out
not<00:00:46.019> into<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.890> when<00:00:47.280> it's<00:00:47.429> loose<00:00:48.120> make

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.040 

so<00:00:58.649> there<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:58.980> see<00:00:59.249> the<00:00:59.690> baffle<00:01:00.690> inside

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
so there you can see the baffle inside

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.899 
so there you can see the baffle inside
now<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.559> will<00:01:02.129> struggle<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.489> get<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.789> out

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:02.909 
now you will struggle to get that out

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.050 
now you will struggle to get that out
from<00:01:03.179> new<00:01:03.359> especially<00:01:03.929> so<00:01:04.589> here's<00:01:05.430> how<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.790> do

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
from new especially so here's how I do

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
it now I'm fortunate I've got this thing

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.020 
it now I'm fortunate I've got this thing
here<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.909> if<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.210> see<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:11.030> from

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
here and if you can see that it's from

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.300 
here and if you can see that it's from
my<00:01:12.210> other<00:01:12.450> stand<00:01:12.780> it's<00:01:13.470> basically<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.100> Jack

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
my other stand it's basically the Jack

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.600 
my other stand it's basically the Jack
pump<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.950> what<00:01:16.950> I'm<00:01:17.009> going<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.189> do<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.460> I'm

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
pump and what I'm going to do is I'm

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.719 
pump and what I'm going to do is I'm
just<00:01:17.640> going<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.290> put<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> piece<00:01:19.530> of<00:01:19.680> rag<00:01:20.460> over

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
just going to put a piece of rag over

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.960 
just going to put a piece of rag over
the<00:01:20.820> end<00:01:21.710> because<00:01:22.710> if<00:01:22.829> you<00:01:22.920> look<00:01:23.100> down<00:01:23.340> inside

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
the end because if you look down inside

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.310 
the end because if you look down inside
the<00:01:24.299> can<00:01:25.700> you<00:01:26.700> will<00:01:26.880> see<00:01:27.149> actually<00:01:27.960> see<00:01:28.200> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
the can you will see actually see the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.740 
the can you will see actually see the
baffles<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.920> don't<00:01:29.399> let<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.610> can<00:01:29.759> see<00:01:29.969> that<00:01:30.180> but

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
baffles I don't let you can see that but

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.719 
baffles I don't let you can see that but
I<00:01:30.899> can<00:01:31.439> when<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.649> cast<00:01:31.950> my<00:01:32.130> eye<00:01:32.159> down<00:01:32.310> through

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
I can when I cast my eye down through

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.109 
I can when I cast my eye down through
there

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
there

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.889 
there
now<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.689> baffle<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:35.700> piece<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.149> tube<00:01:36.450> with<00:01:36.869> a

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:36.899 
now the baffle is a piece of tube with a

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.910 
now the baffle is a piece of tube with a
welded<00:01:37.860> end<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.180> can<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:40.229> looks<00:01:40.680> like

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
welded end and in the can it looks like

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.959 
welded end and in the can it looks like
that<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.979> obviously<00:01:43.979> that's<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.430> exit<00:01:44.729> point

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
that and obviously that's the exit point

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:50.450 
that and obviously that's the exit point
there<00:01:45.320> so<00:01:46.670> just<00:01:47.670> up<00:01:48.149> to<00:01:48.329> gently<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.100> bit<00:01:50.369> of

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
there so just up to gently and a bit of

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.130 
there so just up to gently and a bit of
shove<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.719> one<00:01:51.840> was<00:01:51.960> really

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
shove and that one was really

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.590 
shove and that one was really
straightforward<00:01:53.030> the<00:01:54.030> other<00:01:54.180> one<00:01:54.359> was<00:01:54.570> a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
straightforward the other one was a

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.450 
straightforward the other one was a
little<00:01:54.840> more<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.159> turned<00:01:56.340> that<00:01:56.399> around

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
little more so I just turned that around

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.160 
little more so I just turned that around
for<00:01:56.880> you<00:01:56.969> can<00:01:57.119> see<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.630> other<00:01:57.780> battle

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
for you can see that the other battle

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.399 
for you can see that the other battle
sticking<00:01:58.740> out<00:01:58.859> of<00:01:59.009> there<00:01:59.509> hey<00:02:00.509> he'll<00:02:00.689> baffled

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
sticking out of there hey he'll baffled

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.069 
sticking out of there hey he'll baffled
done<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.250> dusted<00:02:02.430> set<00:02:03.390> them<00:02:03.509> aside<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.810> want<00:02:04.020> to

they<00:02:30.930> put<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.200> bit<00:02:31.380> of<00:02:33.830> silicone<00:02:34.830> around<00:02:35.100> here

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
they put a bit of silicone around here

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.890 
they put a bit of silicone around here
it's<00:02:35.550> also<00:02:35.730> looking<00:02:35.940> around<00:02:36.270> here<00:02:36.450> however<00:02:36.630> in

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
it's also looking around here however in

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:37.970 
it's also looking around here however in
this<00:02:37.020> instance<00:02:37.410> doesn't<00:02:37.740> appear<00:02:37.950> that

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
this instance doesn't appear that

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.830 
this instance doesn't appear that
they've<00:02:38.220> done<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.610> but<00:02:39.270> I<00:02:39.300> got<00:02:39.450> a<00:02:39.480> feeling

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
they've done that but I got a feeling

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.300 
they've done that but I got a feeling
that<00:02:39.870> what<00:02:40.140> really<00:02:40.410> holds<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.920> in<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.160> actually

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
that what really holds it in is actually

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.400 
that what really holds it in is actually
just<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.820> angle<00:02:42.300> as<00:02:43.050> the<00:02:44.480> as<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.540> battle

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
just the angle as the as the battle

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.470 
just the angle as the as the battle
enters<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.460> exit<00:02:48.500> part<00:02:49.500> of<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:49.860> exhaust<00:02:50.640> and

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
enters the exit part of the exhaust and

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.180 
enters the exit part of the exhaust and
I<00:02:51.660> think<00:02:51.870> that's<00:02:52.200> what<00:02:52.410> causes<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.040> be<00:02:53.160> a

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
I think that's what causes it to be a

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.540 
I think that's what causes it to be a
bit<00:02:53.370> stubborn<00:02:54.320> so<00:02:55.320> obvious<00:02:55.830> things<00:02:56.070> make<00:02:56.310> sure

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
bit stubborn so obvious things make sure

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.430 
bit stubborn so obvious things make sure
your<00:02:56.760> exhaust<00:02:57.030> is<00:02:57.210> cooled<00:02:57.450> down<00:02:57.660> not<00:02:58.230> just

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
your exhaust is cooled down not just

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.300 
your exhaust is cooled down not just
because<00:02:58.590> you<00:02:58.650> don't<00:02:58.740> want<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:59.040> burn<00:02:59.190> yourself

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
because you don't want to burn yourself

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.310 
because you don't want to burn yourself
brother<00:02:59.760> because<00:03:00.000> that's<00:03:00.150> obvious<00:03:00.540> but<00:03:01.110> also

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
brother because that's obvious but also

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:08.170 
brother because that's obvious but also
because<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:04.200> want<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.710> metals<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:06.020> basically

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
because you want the metals to basically

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.410 
because you want the metals to basically
return<00:03:09.180> to<00:03:09.420> their<00:03:09.630> natural<00:03:10.080> state<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:11.580> make

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
return to their natural state and make

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.230 
return to their natural state and make
sure<00:03:12.570> that<00:03:12.690> there's<00:03:12.900> no<00:03:13.460> heat<00:03:14.460> expansion<00:03:14.910> in

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
sure that there's no heat expansion in

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.840 
sure that there's no heat expansion in
there<00:03:15.420> causing<00:03:15.690> you<00:03:15.960> additional<00:03:16.440> friction

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
there causing you additional friction

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.040 
there causing you additional friction
because<00:03:17.850> if<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.030> do<00:03:18.180> start<00:03:18.450> forcing<00:03:18.690> things

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
because if you do start forcing things

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.410 
because if you do start forcing things
as<00:03:19.230> I've<00:03:19.380> said<00:03:19.530> before<00:03:20.180> chances<00:03:21.180> are<00:03:21.300> you

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
as I've said before chances are you

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.580 
as I've said before chances are you
going<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.600> do<00:03:21.690> in<00:03:21.810> wronging<00:03:22.020> in<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.230> goal<00:03:22.410> some

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
going to do in wronging in a goal some

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.070 
going to do in wronging in a goal some
damage<00:03:22.920> so<00:03:23.400> just<00:03:23.610> take<00:03:23.760> it<00:03:23.880> easy<00:03:23.970> and<00:03:24.810> if<00:03:24.960> you

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
damage so just take it easy and if you

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.390 
damage so just take it easy and if you
feel<00:03:25.440> if<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:25.770> have<00:03:26.550> any<00:03:26.730> excess<00:03:28.400> pressure

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
feel if you have any excess pressure

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.930 
feel if you have any excess pressure
that<00:03:29.880> you<00:03:30.000> feel<00:03:30.240> is<00:03:30.360> a<00:03:30.390> little<00:03:30.600> bit<00:03:30.740> untoward

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
that you feel is a little bit untoward

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.580 
that you feel is a little bit untoward
you<00:03:32.940> know<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.090> would<00:03:33.510> just<00:03:33.780> just<00:03:34.260> step<00:03:34.440> back

you know I would just just step back

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.960 
you know I would just just step back
from<00:03:34.800> it<00:03:34.950> and<00:03:35.040> give<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.310> another<00:03:35.490> go<00:03:35.670> little

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
from it and give it another go little

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.050 
from it and give it another go little
little<00:03:36.210> bit<00:03:36.300> later<00:03:37.460> right<00:03:38.460> hope<00:03:38.730> they<00:03:38.850> found

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
little bit later right hope they found

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.900 
little bit later right hope they found
