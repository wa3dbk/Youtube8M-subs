okay<00:00:13.530> so<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.860> first<00:00:14.099> test<00:00:14.400> I<00:00:14.549> will<00:00:14.700> be<00:00:14.790> showing

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
okay so the first test I will be showing

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.769 
okay so the first test I will be showing
is<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.360> water<00:00:15.690> test<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.350> currently<00:00:16.770> have<00:00:17.160> the

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:17.779 
is the water test I currently have the

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.540 
is the water test I currently have the
Patriot<00:00:18.779> thumb<00:00:19.020> drive<00:00:19.289> plugged<00:00:19.590> into<00:00:19.890> my

Patriot thumb drive plugged into my

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.840 
Patriot thumb drive plugged into my
laptop<00:00:20.699> right<00:00:21.150> here<00:00:21.560> it<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.680> recognized<00:00:23.369> with

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
laptop right here it is recognized with

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.910 
laptop right here it is recognized with
the<00:00:24.029> window<00:00:24.330> open<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.930> threw<00:00:25.199> some<00:00:25.380> files<00:00:25.650> on

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
the window open I threw some files on

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.310 
the window open I threw some files on
there<00:00:26.160> just<00:00:26.430> so<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.939> know<00:00:27.359> there's<00:00:27.869> some<00:00:28.080> data

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
there just so you know there's some data

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.520 
there just so you know there's some data
on<00:00:28.560> there<00:00:29.210> we'll<00:00:30.210> take<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.570> out<00:00:33.079> pop<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.320> cap

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
on there we'll take it out pop the cap

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.940 
on there we'll take it out pop the cap
on<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.520> then<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.960> have<00:00:37.230> glass<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.649> water<00:00:37.829> right

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
on and then I have glass of water right

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.240 
on and then I have glass of water right
here<00:00:38.370> we'll<00:00:38.489> just<00:00:38.550> give<00:00:38.820> it<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.000> nice<00:00:39.149> drop<00:00:43.250> take

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
here we'll just give it a nice drop take

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:58.060 
here we'll just give it a nice drop take
it<00:00:44.430> out<00:00:44.579> dry<00:00:44.969> it<00:00:45.030> off

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.990 

clutter<00:00:59.070> vacuum<00:01:01.550> lights<00:01:02.550> are<00:01:02.760> flashing

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
clutter vacuum lights are flashing

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.660 
clutter vacuum lights are flashing
everything<00:01:03.720> is<00:01:03.840> recognized<00:01:06.260> and<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:08.400> files

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
everything is recognized and the files

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.870 
everything is recognized and the files
are<00:01:08.940> still<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.360> there<00:01:09.590> so<00:01:10.590> pass<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.610> spill

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
are still on there so pass the spill

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.450 
are still on there so pass the spill
test<00:01:12.150> oh<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.870> would<00:01:13.170> say<00:01:13.320> submerge<00:01:13.830> test<00:01:14.310> so

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
test oh I would say submerge test so

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.250 
test oh I would say submerge test so
this<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.910> just<00:01:15.120> a<00:01:15.210> glass<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.600> water<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.930> haven't

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 
this is just a glass of water I haven't

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.960 
this is just a glass of water I haven't
like<00:01:16.410> thrown<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:17.010> pool<00:01:17.220> or<00:01:17.460> anything<00:01:17.670> like

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
like thrown in a pool or anything like

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.450 
like thrown in a pool or anything like
that<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.420> don't<00:01:19.170> know<00:01:19.380> as<00:01:19.530> far<00:01:19.710> as<00:01:19.770> depth<00:01:20.130> but

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
that so don't know as far as depth but

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.430 
that so don't know as far as depth but
as<00:01:20.610> far<00:01:20.850> as<00:01:20.880> splashing<00:01:21.570> general<00:01:21.960> water<00:01:22.170> will

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
as far as splashing general water will

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.310 
as far as splashing general water will
works<00:01:23.070> fine<00:01:23.390> all<00:01:24.390> right<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.869> next<00:01:25.050> test

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
works fine all right so the next test

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.810 
works fine all right so the next test
I'm<00:01:25.470> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.740> performing<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.580> boost

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
I'm going to be performing on the boost

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.530 
I'm going to be performing on the boost
XT<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.869> just<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.440> general<00:01:28.800> shock<00:01:29.130> test<00:01:29.460> I<00:01:29.729> have

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
XT is just a general shock test I have

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.180 
XT is just a general shock test I have
an<00:01:30.660> 8<00:01:30.810> foot<00:01:31.080> ladder<00:01:31.320> right<00:01:31.649> here<00:01:32.009> I'm<00:01:32.130> just

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
an 8 foot ladder right here I'm just

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.950 
an 8 foot ladder right here I'm just
gonna<00:01:32.430> climb<00:01:32.729> up<00:01:32.790> there<00:01:33.180> so<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.630> height<00:01:33.780> I'll

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
gonna climb up there so the height I'll

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.870 
gonna climb up there so the height I'll
be<00:01:34.110> dropping<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.590> from<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.860> probably<00:01:35.130> about<00:01:35.310> 12

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
be dropping it from is probably about 12

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.230 
be dropping it from is probably about 12
foot<00:01:36.119> maybe<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.720> then<00:01:37.350> we'll<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.130> see<00:01:38.369> if<00:01:38.729> it

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
foot maybe and then we'll just see if it

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.080 
foot maybe and then we'll just see if it
survives<00:01:39.660> the<00:01:40.350> boost<00:01:40.560> XT<00:01:41.040> has<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.850> nice

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
survives the boost XT has that nice

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:56.880 
survives the boost XT has that nice
rubber<00:01:42.450> casing<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.790> should<00:01:44.790> be<00:01:44.970> okay

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.650 

and<00:01:57.460> just<00:01:57.670> to<00:01:57.760> know<00:01:57.880> this<00:01:58.120> is<00:01:58.300> just<00:01:58.450> my

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
and just to know this is just my

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.900 
and just to know this is just my
driveway<00:01:58.990> general<00:01:59.560> blacktop<00:02:00.070> so<00:02:02.910> something

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
driveway general blacktop so something

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.300 
driveway general blacktop so something
that<00:02:03.940> might<00:02:04.390> normally<00:02:05.170> happen<00:02:05.830> if<00:02:05.950> you<00:02:06.070> drop

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
that might normally happen if you drop

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.160 
that might normally happen if you drop
it<00:02:06.460> out<00:02:06.520> of<00:02:06.670> your<00:02:06.820> pocket<00:02:07.030> while<00:02:07.510> getting<00:02:07.930> into

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
it out of your pocket while getting into

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:20.400 
it out of your pocket while getting into
the<00:02:08.259> car<00:02:08.500> or<00:02:08.710> something<00:02:13.740> still<00:02:14.740> there<00:02:19.410> now

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
the car or something still there now

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.780 
the car or something still there now
next<00:02:20.800> I'll<00:02:20.920> be<00:02:20.950> moving<00:02:21.400> on<00:02:21.490> to<00:02:21.610> a<00:02:21.700> more

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
next I'll be moving on to a more

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.710 
next I'll be moving on to a more
torturous<00:02:22.420> test<00:02:24.000> running<00:02:25.000> it<00:02:25.180> over<00:02:25.390> with<00:02:25.540> my

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
torturous test running it over with my

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.770 
torturous test running it over with my
car<00:02:26.550> alright<00:02:27.550> now<00:02:27.790> this<00:02:27.970> test<00:02:28.300> is<00:02:28.450> going<00:02:28.600> to<00:02:28.660> be

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
car alright now this test is going to be

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.270 
car alright now this test is going to be
a<00:02:28.810> little<00:02:29.020> more<00:02:29.230> extreme<00:02:29.500> but<00:02:29.860> it's<00:02:30.010> still<00:02:30.220> a

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
a little more extreme but it's still a

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.070 
a little more extreme but it's still a
practical<00:02:30.940> test<00:02:31.210> how<00:02:31.420> many<00:02:31.600> times<00:02:31.810> have<00:02:32.020> you

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
practical test how many times have you

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.740 
practical test how many times have you
gotten<00:02:32.410> into<00:02:32.740> your<00:02:32.860> car<00:02:33.100> and<00:02:33.370> craps<00:02:34.330> falling

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
gotten into your car and craps falling

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.080 
gotten into your car and craps falling
out<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:34.900> your<00:02:35.050> pocket<00:02:35.580> that<00:02:36.580> so<00:02:36.730> that's<00:02:36.910> what

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
out of your pocket that so that's what

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.390 
out of your pocket that so that's what
we're<00:02:37.209> going<00:02:37.330> to<00:02:37.360> do<00:02:37.600> with<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:38.470> boost<00:02:38.680> XT<00:02:39.220> I'm

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
we're going to do with the boost XT I'm

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.310 
we're going to do with the boost XT I'm
going<00:02:39.580> to<00:02:39.670> run<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.240> over<00:02:40.360> with<00:02:40.630> my<00:02:40.810> car<00:02:40.840> and

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
going to run it over with my car and

00:02:41.320 --> 00:03:09.280 
going to run it over with my car and
we'll<00:02:41.440> see<00:02:41.620> how<00:02:41.740> it<00:02:41.860> fares

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.479 

and<00:03:09.400> as<00:03:10.400> for<00:03:10.849> it<00:03:10.939> looks<00:03:11.360> like<00:03:11.540> it<00:03:11.689> actually

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
and as for it looks like it actually

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:20.360 
and as for it looks like it actually
kind<00:03:13.489> of<00:03:13.610> just<00:03:13.849> crushed<00:03:15.159> the<00:03:16.159> tip

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370
