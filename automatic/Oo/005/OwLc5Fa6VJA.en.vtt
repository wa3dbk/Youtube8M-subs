wanted to try doing was every now and

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.660 
wanted to try doing was every now and
then<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.820> get<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.270> game<00:01:06.510> early<00:01:07.020> like<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.770> I

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
then we get a game early like that and I

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.969 
then we get a game early like that and I
feel<00:01:09.330> stupid<00:01:09.750> just<00:01:10.170> putting<00:01:10.409> up<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.590> video<00:01:10.799> like

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
feel stupid just putting up a video like

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.390 
feel stupid just putting up a video like
hey<00:01:11.159> guys<00:01:11.400> look<00:01:11.700> what<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.880> got<00:01:12.180> at<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.900> end<00:01:13.400> but

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
hey guys look what I got at the end but

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.280
