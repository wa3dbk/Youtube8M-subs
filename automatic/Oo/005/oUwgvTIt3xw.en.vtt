00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
to get the High Templar out so this is

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.409 
to get the High Templar out so this is
going<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.220> be<00:00:02.340> a<00:00:02.370> slightly<00:00:02.669> longer<00:00:02.879> macro<00:00:03.270> game

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:03.419 
going to be a slightly longer macro game

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:04.220 
going to be a slightly longer macro game
than<00:00:03.570> one<00:00:03.689> might<00:00:03.810> have<00:00:03.899> initially

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
than one might have initially

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.570 
than one might have initially
anticipated<00:00:04.440> much<00:00:04.799> now<00:00:05.069> getting<00:00:05.339> on<00:00:05.400> being

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
anticipated much now getting on being

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.280 
anticipated much now getting on being
the<00:00:05.910> only<00:00:06.029> advantage<00:00:06.359> for<00:00:06.690> Bako<00:00:06.870> is<00:00:07.049> gonna<00:00:07.200> be

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
the only advantage for Bako is gonna be

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.600 
the only advantage for Bako is gonna be
that<00:00:07.319> his<00:00:07.529> nexus<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:08.040> going<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.280> be<00:00:08.370> up<00:00:08.519> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
that his nexus is going to be up the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.220 
that his nexus is going to be up the
cast<00:00:08.790> expansion<00:00:09.300> so<00:00:09.389> he's<00:00:09.540> gonna<00:00:09.690> have<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.050> gas

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
cast expansion so he's gonna have to gas

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.470 
cast expansion so he's gonna have to gas
too<00:00:10.410> much<00:00:10.530> as<00:00:10.679> one<00:00:10.830> gas<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.219> as<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.330> game

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
too much as one gas and as the game

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.610 
too much as one gas and as the game
progresses<00:00:12.809> he<00:00:12.990> hasn't<00:00:13.259> taken<00:00:13.380> that<00:00:13.590> a

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
progresses he hasn't taken that a

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.230 
progresses he hasn't taken that a
simulator<00:00:14.009> yet<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.549> he<00:00:14.790> really<00:00:15.000> needs<00:00:15.150> to

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
simulator yet and he really needs to

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.540 
simulator yet and he really needs to
take<00:00:15.360> us<00:00:15.480> over<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:16.100> take<00:00:17.100> advantage<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.460> that

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
take us over to take advantage of that

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.980 
take us over to take advantage of that
as<00:00:17.699> quickly<00:00:18.060> as<00:00:18.210> possible<00:00:18.539> he<00:00:18.660> still<00:00:18.869> I'm

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
as quickly as possible he still I'm

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.390 
as quickly as possible he still I'm
putting<00:00:19.500> on<00:00:19.560> his<00:00:19.650> target<00:00:20.039> but<00:00:20.160> looks<00:00:20.310> like

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
putting on his target but looks like

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.529 
putting on his target but looks like
he's<00:00:20.490> not<00:00:20.609> right<00:00:20.760> technics<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.300> has<00:00:21.390> been

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
he's not right technics that has been

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.420 
he's not right technics that has been
only<00:00:21.689> so<00:00:22.230> backward<00:00:22.890> takes<00:00:23.039> an<00:00:23.130> ex<00:00:23.250> that<00:00:23.279> has

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
only so backward takes an ex that has

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.130 
only so backward takes an ex that has
been<00:00:23.550> only<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:23.820> both<00:00:24.000> players<00:00:24.330> in<00:00:24.539> terms<00:00:25.050> of

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
been only so both players in terms of

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.420 
been only so both players in terms of
the<00:00:25.320> only<00:00:25.500> difference<00:00:25.830> really<00:00:25.890> in<00:00:26.160> terms<00:00:26.279> of

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
the only difference really in terms of

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.550 
the only difference really in terms of
their<00:00:26.550> economy<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.449> fact<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.720> much<00:00:28.439> his

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
their economy is the fact that much his

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.080 
their economy is the fact that much his
nexus<00:00:28.830> was<00:00:29.010> down<00:00:29.130> earlier<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.609> potentially

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
nexus was down earlier so potentially

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.250 
nexus was down earlier so potentially
you<00:00:30.150> might<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.480> few<00:00:30.689> more<00:00:30.779> probes<00:00:31.050> oh<00:00:31.170> he

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
you might have a few more probes oh he

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.179 
you might have a few more probes oh he
didn't<00:00:31.439> commit<00:00:31.590> himself<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.920> getting<00:00:32.130> that

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
didn't commit himself to getting that

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.130 
didn't commit himself to getting that

archives down so r enough so i'm not

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.490 
archives down so r enough so i'm not
sure<00:00:35.820> if<00:00:36.239> he<00:00:36.540> sacrifice<00:00:37.020> building<00:00:37.350> some

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
sure if he sacrifice building some

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.780 
sure if he sacrifice building some
probes<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:37.950> order<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.460> order<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.670> achieve

probes in order to in order to achieve
that<00:00:39.059> secondly<00:00:39.780> he<00:00:40.500> did<00:00:40.680> put<00:00:40.860> his<00:00:40.950> nexus<00:00:41.190> down

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
that secondly he did put his nexus down

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.920 
that secondly he did put his nexus down
at<00:00:41.489> this<00:00:41.610> min<00:00:41.850> only<00:00:42.000> first<00:00:42.420> which<00:00:42.600> means<00:00:42.809> he's

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
at this min only first which means he's

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.959 
at this min only first which means he's
not<00:00:43.469> gonna<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.829> as<00:00:43.980> much<00:00:44.100> gas<00:00:44.340> as<00:00:44.399> backhoe

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
not gonna have as much gas as backhoe

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.340 
not gonna have as much gas as backhoe
provided<00:00:45.360> backhoe<00:00:45.660> takes<00:00:45.870> his<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> simulator

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
provided backhoe takes his a simulator

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.660 
provided backhoe takes his a simulator
soon<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:46.800> got<00:00:46.920> home<00:00:47.070> soon<00:00:47.190> should<00:00:47.489> have<00:00:47.640> a

soon so got home soon should have a

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.250 
soon so got home soon should have a
slight<00:00:47.850> gasp<00:00:48.030> advantage<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:48.570> other<00:00:48.989> than

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
slight gasp advantage in that other than

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.990 
slight gasp advantage in that other than
that<00:00:49.379> there<00:00:49.530> isn't<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.860> lot<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.039> differentiate

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
that there isn't a lot to differentiate

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
similar now going up so Paco is gonna

similar now going up so Paco is gonna
have<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.020> second<00:00:55.230> gasps<00:00:55.350> slightly<00:00:55.559> order

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
have that second gasps slightly order

defensive<00:01:12.600> posture<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.439> think<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:13.710> is

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
defensive posture and I think this is

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.960 
defensive posture and I think this is
one<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.159> things<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.340> we<00:01:14.490> have<00:01:14.640> seen<00:01:14.850> on

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
one of the things that we have seen on

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.310 
one of the things that we have seen on
Andromeda<00:01:15.180> we<00:01:15.479> have<00:01:15.570> seen<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.810> lot<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:15.960> turtling

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
Andromeda we have seen a lot of turtling

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.539 
Andromeda we have seen a lot of turtling
from<00:01:16.560> Terran<00:01:16.860> players<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.220> now<00:01:17.280> we're<00:01:17.460> seeing

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
from Terran players and now we're seeing

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.340

he's news Dark Templar a bit on this to
me<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> very<00:01:23.640> strange<00:01:24.090> choice<00:01:24.540> of<00:01:24.720> strategy

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
me is a very strange choice of strategy

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.380 
me is a very strange choice of strategy
because<00:01:25.380> he's<00:01:26.310> knows<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.790> his<00:01:26.880> opponent<00:01:27.299> has

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
because he's knows that his opponent has

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.640 
because he's knows that his opponent has
got<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.689> perhaps<00:01:27.869> he<00:01:28.049> didn't<00:01:28.229> realize<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.500> his

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
a decent size Dragoon force and i'm not

sure what he hopes to effect with this
job<00:01:34.680> i<00:01:34.770> think<00:01:34.979> he<00:01:35.369> feels<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.880> maybe<00:01:36.060> if<00:01:36.240> he

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
job i think he feels that maybe if he

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.539 
job i think he feels that maybe if he
can<00:01:36.450> do<00:01:36.659> her<00:01:36.750> much<00:01:37.409> his<00:01:37.590> forces<00:01:37.950> away<00:01:37.979> from<00:01:38.430> his

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
can do her much his forces away from his

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.030 
can do her much his forces away from his
base<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.479> get<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.810> drop<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.170> but<00:01:40.770> much

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
base and get that drop in but much

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.319 
base and get that drop in but much
better<00:01:41.189> she<00:01:41.430> scout<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.759> shuttle<00:01:42.180> because

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
better she scout the shuttle because

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.639 
better she scout the shuttle because

he's putting photon cannon down his main
perhaps<00:02:03.210> that's<00:02:03.390> why<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.540> didn't<00:02:03.780> bother

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930

a<00:04:17.329> backhoe<00:04:17.690> into<00:04:17.930> with<00:04:18.200> it<00:04:18.349> and<00:04:18.530> that's

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
a backhoe into with it and that's

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.990 
a backhoe into with it and that's
exactly<00:04:18.799> what<00:04:19.099> much<00:04:19.220> as<00:04:19.340> when<00:04:19.430> he's<00:04:19.519> box<00:04:19.789> back

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
exactly what much as when he's box back

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.610 
exactly what much as when he's box back
here<00:04:20.269> this<00:04:20.630> would<00:04:20.750> be<00:04:20.840> an<00:04:20.900> example

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
here this would be an example

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.750 
here this would be an example
for<00:04:21.739> him<00:04:21.829> to<00:04:21.889> get<00:04:21.949> some<00:04:22.130> storms<00:04:22.430> up<00:04:22.550> if<00:04:22.669> we<00:04:22.729> can

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
for him to get some storms up if we can

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.250 
for him to get some storms up if we can
keep<00:04:23.030> our<00:04:23.270> cool<00:04:23.419> corner<00:04:23.690> in<00:04:23.900> that<00:04:24.080> in<00:04:24.229> that

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
keep our cool corner in that in that

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.710 
keep our cool corner in that in that
base<00:04:24.560> Archon<00:04:25.220> coming<00:04:25.430> into<00:04:25.580> play<00:04:25.669> for<00:04:25.760> Michael

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
base Archon coming into play for Michael

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.540 
base Archon coming into play for Michael
but<00:04:27.260> much<00:04:27.560> looks<00:04:27.830> like<00:04:27.979> he's<00:04:28.100> in<00:04:28.220> trouble<00:04:28.340> your

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
but much looks like he's in trouble your

but much looks like he's in trouble your
storm<00:04:28.820> going<00:04:29.000> off<00:04:29.120> I'm<00:04:29.300> not<00:04:29.419> sure<00:04:29.570> who's<00:04:29.780> storm

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
storm going off I'm not sure who's storm

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.300 
storm going off I'm not sure who's storm
that<00:04:30.139> is<00:04:30.260> I<00:04:30.320> think<00:04:30.350> I<00:04:30.710> probably<00:04:30.949> I'm<00:04:31.160> guessing

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
that is I think I probably I'm guessing

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.189 
that is I think I probably I'm guessing
that<00:04:31.760> it<00:04:31.880> would<00:04:32.060> be<00:04:32.210> much<00:04:32.660> a<00:04:32.720> storm<00:04:32.990> another

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
that it would be much a storm another

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.330 
that it would be much a storm another
storm<00:04:33.500> will<00:04:33.650> not<00:04:33.770> this<00:04:33.889> time<00:04:34.040> from<00:04:34.160> backhoe

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
storm will not this time from backhoe

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.980 
storm will not this time from backhoe
and<00:04:34.639> much<00:04:35.180> looks<00:04:35.449> like<00:04:35.570> he's<00:04:35.690> losing<00:04:35.810> his

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
and much looks like he's losing his

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.810 
and much looks like he's losing his

much<00:04:52.040> because<00:04:52.280> I<00:04:52.340> think<00:04:52.460> now<00:04:53.300> back<00:04:53.570> was<00:04:53.780> taking

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
much because I think now back was taking

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.750 
much because I think now back was taking
an<00:04:54.080> insurmountable<00:04:54.320> lead<00:04:54.650> backhoes<00:04:55.100> got<00:04:55.280> also

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
an insurmountable lead backhoes got also

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:56.980 
an insurmountable lead backhoes got also
the<00:04:55.850> expansion<00:04:56.210> Billy<00:04:56.419> it<00:04:56.479> looks<00:04:56.630> like<00:04:56.720> a<00:04:56.750> true

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
the expansion Billy it looks like a true

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:58.090 
the expansion Billy it looks like a true
proposition<00:04:57.139> much<00:04:57.620> looks<00:04:57.830> like<00:04:57.889> he<00:04:58.010> might

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
proposition much looks like he might

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.770 
proposition much looks like he might
bring<00:04:58.310> splash<00:04:58.669> in<00:04:58.789> the<00:04:58.820> natural<00:04:59.120> position<00:04:59.449> I'm

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
bring splash in the natural position I'm

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:00.879 
bring splash in the natural position I'm
not<00:04:59.960> sure<00:05:00.110> if<00:05:00.199> much<00:05:00.350> is<00:05:00.440> gonna<00:05:00.560> be<00:05:00.680> able<00:05:00.770> to

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:00.889 
not sure if much is gonna be able to

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.159 
not sure if much is gonna be able to
defend<00:05:01.100> it<00:05:01.280> and<00:05:01.669> it<00:05:02.600> definitely<00:05:02.810> looks<00:05:03.110> like

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
defend it and it definitely looks like

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.510 
defend it and it definitely looks like
Bako<00:05:03.440> has<00:05:03.680> the<00:05:03.740> advantage<00:05:04.160> in<00:05:04.250> terms<00:05:04.370> of

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
Bako has the advantage in terms of

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.040 
Bako has the advantage in terms of
upgrades<00:05:04.910> because<00:05:05.270> of<00:05:05.389> that<00:05:05.479> force<00:05:05.810> that<00:05:05.960> he

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
upgrades because of that force that he

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.350 
upgrades because of that force that he
took<00:05:06.229> out<00:05:06.410> versus<00:05:07.100> much<00:05:07.220> and<00:05:07.430> much<00:05:07.610> struggling

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
took out versus much and much struggling

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.180 
took out versus much and much struggling
here<00:05:08.660> really<00:05:09.110> struggling<00:05:09.350> he's<00:05:09.830> trying<00:05:10.070> to

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
here really struggling he's trying to

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.320 
here really struggling he's trying to
get<00:05:10.280> some<00:05:10.430> her<00:05:10.520> ass<00:05:10.639> going<00:05:10.820> with<00:05:10.970> that<00:05:11.000> shuttle

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
get some her ass going with that shuttle

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.250 
get some her ass going with that shuttle
but<00:05:11.449> I<00:05:11.479> think<00:05:11.720> there's<00:05:11.840> an<00:05:11.930> observer<00:05:12.199> of

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
but I think there's an observer of

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.740 
but I think there's an observer of
battles<00:05:12.680> waiting<00:05:12.949> just<00:05:13.160> just<00:05:13.580> for<00:05:13.880> that<00:05:13.910> and

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
battles waiting just just for that and

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.689 
battles waiting just just for that and
there's<00:05:15.350> a<00:05:15.410> dragoon<00:05:16.070> photon<00:05:16.400> generator

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:16.699 
there's a dragoon photon generator

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:17.950 
there's a dragoon photon generator
intercepted<00:05:17.180> that<00:05:17.240> I<00:05:17.330> don't<00:05:17.570> mind<00:05:17.660> she<00:05:17.840> had

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
intercepted that I don't mind she had

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.210 
intercepted that I don't mind she had
taken<00:05:18.169> out<00:05:18.260> before<00:05:18.350> he<00:05:18.560> can<00:05:18.650> get<00:05:18.740> the<00:05:18.860> drop<00:05:18.889> in

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
taken out before he can get the drop in

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.010 
taken out before he can get the drop in
he<00:05:19.580> managed<00:05:19.910> to<00:05:20.030> drop<00:05:20.180> the<00:05:20.330> zone<00:05:20.449> theme<00:05:20.660> to<00:05:20.900> try

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
he managed to drop the zone theme to try

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.210 
he managed to drop the zone theme to try
and<00:05:21.110> drop<00:05:21.229> us<00:05:21.380> out<00:05:21.470> in<00:05:21.650> a<00:05:21.710> high<00:05:21.830> and<00:05:22.039> a<00:05:22.130> high

and drop us out in a high and a high

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.040 
and drop us out in a high and a high
templar<00:05:22.610> he<00:05:23.000> wasn't<00:05:23.389> able<00:05:23.510> to<00:05:23.660> do<00:05:23.750> that<00:05:23.870> and

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
templar he wasn't able to do that and

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:25.690 
templar he wasn't able to do that and
you<00:05:24.110> can<00:05:24.229> just<00:05:24.380> see<00:05:24.500> the<00:05:24.530> look<00:05:24.860> of<00:05:25.010> disgust<00:05:25.340> on

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
you can just see the look of disgust on

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.279 
you can just see the look of disgust on
much<00:05:25.880> his<00:05:26.030> face<00:05:26.180> it<00:05:26.330> being<00:05:26.510> thwarted<00:05:26.780> their<00:05:27.110> by

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
much his face it being thwarted their by

much his face it being thwarted their by
his<00:05:27.889> opponent<00:05:28.310> and<00:05:28.400> really<00:05:28.729> that<00:05:28.849> DT<00:05:29.240> drop

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
his opponent and really that DT drop

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.240 
his opponent and really that DT drop
seems<00:05:29.750> to<00:05:29.930> have<00:05:30.050> won<00:05:30.260> the<00:05:30.410> game<00:05:30.440> I<00:05:30.770> think<00:05:31.130> two

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
seems to have won the game I think two

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.310 
seems to have won the game I think two
factors<00:05:31.610> first<00:05:31.849> of<00:05:31.970> all<00:05:32.060> his<00:05:32.180> own<00:05:32.389> DTS<00:05:33.139> being

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
factors first of all his own DTS being

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.379 
factors first of all his own DTS being
scouted<00:05:33.620> by<00:05:33.800> backhoe<00:05:34.280> and<00:05:34.310> his<00:05:34.669> own<00:05:34.849> dt<00:05:35.180> drop

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
scouted by backhoe and his own dt drop

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.379 
scouted by backhoe and his own dt drop
and<00:05:35.510> then<00:05:35.720> his<00:05:35.870> dt<00:05:36.139> drop<00:05:36.849> failing<00:05:37.849> and<00:05:38.030> then

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:38.389 
and then his dt drop failing and then

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.420 
and then his dt drop failing and then
the<00:05:38.510> dt<00:05:38.750> drop<00:05:38.930> from<00:05:39.289> the<00:05:39.560> start<00:05:39.979> of<00:05:40.070> each<00:05:40.190> drop

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
the dt drop from the start of each drop

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.980 
the dt drop from the start of each drop
is<00:05:40.460> dt<00:05:40.760> rush<00:05:40.970> feeling<00:05:41.330> and<00:05:41.450> then<00:05:41.539> the<00:05:41.630> dt<00:05:41.840> drop

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
is dt rush feeling and then the dt drop

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.060 
is dt rush feeling and then the dt drop
from<00:05:42.139> backhoe<00:05:42.380> seems<00:05:42.590> to<00:05:42.680> have<00:05:42.770> swung<00:05:42.919> the
