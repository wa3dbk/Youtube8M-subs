one<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.160> the<00:01:05.220> biggest<00:01:05.550> problems<00:01:05.910> in<00:01:06.090> North

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
one of the biggest problems in North

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.260 
one of the biggest problems in North
America<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.530> insect<00:01:08.130> eating<00:01:08.280> bats<00:01:08.400> are

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
America is that insect eating bats are

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.830 
America is that insect eating bats are
dying<00:01:10.050> because<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.950> fungus<00:01:11.340> and

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
dying because of a fungus and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.330 
dying because of a fungus and
unfortunately<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.050> grows<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.680> bats<00:01:13.980> while

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
unfortunately it grows on bats while

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.970 
unfortunately it grows on bats while
they<00:01:14.550> hibernate<00:01:15.090> during<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.570> winter

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
they hibernate during the winter

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.430 
they hibernate during the winter
millions<00:01:16.980> of<00:01:17.130> bats<00:01:17.400> are<00:01:17.820> dying<00:01:18.060> each<00:01:18.390> year<00:01:18.440> so

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
millions of bats are dying each year so

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.260 
millions of bats are dying each year so
far<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.770> disease<00:01:20.340> called<00:01:20.700> white-nose<00:01:21.060> syndrome

far a disease called white-nose syndrome

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
far a disease called white-nose syndrome
has<00:01:21.960> killed<00:01:22.290> about<00:01:22.770> 6<00:01:23.160> million<00:01:23.460> bats<00:01:24.270> in<00:01:24.840> North

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
has killed about 6 million bats in North

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.250 
has killed about 6 million bats in North
America<00:01:25.850> essentially<00:01:26.850> these<00:01:27.540> bats<00:01:27.840> are<00:01:28.110> on

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
America essentially these bats are on

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.680 
America essentially these bats are on
the<00:01:28.410> verge<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.950> completely<00:01:29.460> dying<00:01:29.640> out<00:01:29.910> not

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
the verge of completely dying out not

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.719 
the verge of completely dying out not
only<00:01:30.720> would<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:31.229> lose<00:01:31.530> an<00:01:31.890> extraordinary

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
only would we lose an extraordinary

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.450 
only would we lose an extraordinary
species<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.780> death<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.290> our<00:01:34.410> bats<00:01:34.650> would<00:01:35.280> be

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
species the death of our bats would be

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.700 
species the death of our bats would be
catastrophic<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:36.240> our<00:01:36.390> ecosystem<00:01:37.050> there<00:01:37.590> was

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
catastrophic to our ecosystem there was

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.590 
catastrophic to our ecosystem there was
just<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:37.950> little<00:01:38.130> blurb<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.090> news<00:01:39.300> I<00:01:39.450> saw

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
just this little blurb in the news I saw

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.150 
just this little blurb in the news I saw
about<00:01:39.840> that's<00:01:40.290> getting<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:40.740> thing<00:01:40.950> called

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
about that's getting this thing called

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.249 
about that's getting this thing called
white-nose<00:01:41.369> fungus<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.060> think<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:43.080> all

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
white-nose fungus I think that we all

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.749 
white-nose fungus I think that we all
just<00:01:43.530> take<00:01:43.680> for<00:01:43.920> granted<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.310> there's<00:01:44.520> bats

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
just take for granted that there's bats

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.120 
just take for granted that there's bats
and<00:01:45.030> bats<00:01:45.119> are<00:01:45.600> gonna<00:01:45.960> be<00:01:46.050> fine<00:01:46.290> but<00:01:46.770> then<00:01:46.920> as

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
and bats are gonna be fine but then as

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.350 
and bats are gonna be fine but then as
we<00:01:47.160> started<00:01:47.640> doing<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.910> research<00:01:48.150> we

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
we started doing the research we

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.600 
we started doing the research we
actually<00:01:48.660> found<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.229> bats<00:01:49.440> are<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:50.070> dire

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
actually found that the bats are in dire

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.490 
actually found that the bats are in dire
straits<00:01:51.030> actually<00:01:51.570> as<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.960> movie<00:01:52.350> that

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
straits actually as a movie that

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.190 
straits actually as a movie that
benefits<00:01:53.220> from<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.670> bats<00:01:53.880> we<00:01:54.690> thought<00:01:54.930> we're

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
benefits from the bats we thought we're

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.050 
benefits from the bats we thought we're
gonna<00:01:55.290> build<00:01:55.560> these<00:01:55.740> bad<00:01:55.920> habitats<00:01:56.490> as<00:01:56.760> a<00:01:56.820> way

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
gonna build these bad habitats as a way

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.570 
gonna build these bad habitats as a way
to<00:01:57.120> raise<00:01:57.630> awareness<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.290> just<00:01:58.890> generally

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
to raise awareness and just generally

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.460 
to raise awareness and just generally
let's<00:01:59.790> learn<00:02:00.000> about<00:02:00.180> bat<00:02:00.480> to<00:02:00.630> know<00:02:00.810> how<00:02:01.290> they

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
let's learn about bat to know how they

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.300 
let's learn about bat to know how they
benefit<00:02:01.830> us<00:02:01.890> because<00:02:02.070> they're<00:02:02.190> really

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
benefit us because they're really

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.060 
benefit us because they're really
important<00:02:02.730> bat<00:02:03.510> houses<00:02:03.780> get<00:02:04.470> healthy<00:02:04.860> bats

important bat houses get healthy bats

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.250 
important bat houses get healthy bats
