of people seem to be much to it now were
because<00:00:15.150> not<00:00:15.509> probably<00:00:16.080> top<00:00:16.320> dyrdek<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:16.910> it

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
because not probably top dyrdek and it

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.279 
because not probably top dyrdek and it
doesn't<00:00:18.210> really<00:00:18.359> do<00:00:18.510> well<00:00:18.690> at<00:00:18.810> all<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.260> not

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
doesn't really do well at all and to not

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.939 
doesn't really do well at all and to not
many<00:00:19.590> people<00:00:19.920> tend<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.699> use<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.289> but<00:00:22.289> it's<00:00:22.859> a

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
many people tend to use it but it's a

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.370 
many people tend to use it but it's a
deck<00:00:23.100> i'll<00:00:23.310> use<00:00:23.910> when<00:00:24.150> we<00:00:24.240> first<00:00:24.420> came<00:00:24.600> out<00:00:24.750> and

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
deck i'll use when we first came out and

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.710 
deck i'll use when we first came out and
then<00:00:25.800> might<00:00:26.039> have<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.189> turn<00:00:26.939> back<00:00:27.180> on<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.449> for<00:00:27.689> a

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
then might have a turn back on it for a

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.929 
then might have a turn back on it for a
while<00:00:27.750> but<00:00:28.050> I've<00:00:28.260> come<00:00:28.380> back<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.949> think

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
while but I've come back to it I think

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.999 
while but I've come back to it I think
if<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.390> can<00:00:30.449> guess<00:00:30.630> by<00:00:30.779> from<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.410> tallies<00:00:31.769> is

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
if you can guess by from the tallies is

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.000 
if you can guess by from the tallies is
obviously<00:00:32.369> heroes<00:00:32.850> I<00:00:33.030> mean<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.930> do<00:00:34.500> like<00:00:34.800> them

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
obviously heroes I mean I do like them

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.850 
obviously heroes I mean I do like them
there's<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.820> potential<00:00:36.149> just<00:00:36.510> them<00:00:36.860> don't

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
there's the potential just them don't

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.000 
there's the potential just them don't
use<00:00:38.010> them<00:00:38.190> anymore<00:00:39.079> it<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.379> definite<00:00:40.800> bill

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
use them anymore it is a definite bill

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.360 
use them anymore it is a definite bill
and<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.730> works<00:00:42.210> really<00:00:42.360> largely<00:00:42.739> so<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.950> like<00:00:44.219> to

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
and it works really largely so I like to

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.740 
and it works really largely so I like to
know<00:00:44.399> your<00:00:44.879> opinion<00:00:44.910> me<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:47.750> to
