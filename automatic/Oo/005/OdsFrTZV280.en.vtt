00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.060 
I think from the things that he's done
the<00:01:49.710> past<00:01:50.149> it<00:01:51.149> just<00:01:51.390> hasn't<00:01:51.600> got<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.409> fans<00:01:52.680> all

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
the past it just hasn't got the fans all

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.230 
the past it just hasn't got the fans all
the<00:01:53.100> clubs<00:01:54.000> interest<00:01:54.619> at<00:01:55.619> heart<00:01:56.240> obviously

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
the clubs interest at heart obviously

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.969 
the clubs interest at heart obviously
you<00:01:57.750> would<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:57.960> thought<00:01:58.079> somebody<00:01:58.469> that<00:01:58.619> had

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
you would have thought somebody that had

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.469 
you would have thought somebody that had
wouldn't<00:01:59.579> have<00:01:59.670> made<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.969> decisions<00:02:00.360> that

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
wouldn't have made the decisions that

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.590 
wouldn't have made the decisions that
he's<00:02:00.990> had<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.560> past<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.610> repercussions

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
he's had in the past so repercussions

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.330 
he's had in the past so repercussions
like<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.320> said<00:02:04.469> what<00:02:04.649> would<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.189> be<00:02:05.219> that

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340

different world I guess from the from
the<00:05:30.660> real<00:05:30.870> world<00:05:30.900> and<00:05:31.560> people<00:05:31.919> tend<00:05:32.190> to<00:05:32.280> have

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
the real world and people tend to have

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:34.279 
the real world and people tend to have
Freddie<00:05:32.550> the<00:05:33.240> fans<00:05:33.479> often<00:05:33.720> do<00:05:33.960> have<00:05:34.080> very

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
Freddie the fans often do have very

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:35.450 
Freddie the fans often do have very
short<00:05:34.500> memories<00:05:34.530> about<00:05:34.860> these<00:05:35.100> things<00:05:35.280> you

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
think if they did get a big name in the

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.560 
think if they did get a big name in the
the<00:05:38.340> fans<00:05:38.580> would<00:05:38.729> be<00:05:38.850> kind<00:05:39.030> of<00:05:39.090> won<00:05:39.240> over<00:05:39.539> by

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
the fans would be kind of won over by

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.890 
the fans would be kind of won over by
that<00:05:39.900> and<00:05:40.229> maybe<00:05:40.410> not<00:05:40.860> as<00:05:41.250> upset<00:05:42.180> about<00:05:42.510> the

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
that and maybe not as upset about the

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.110 
that and maybe not as upset about the
Chris<00:05:43.440> Hughton<00:05:43.830> decision<00:05:44.520> well<00:05:44.850> the<00:05:44.910> thing<00:05:45.090> is

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
Chris Hughton decision well the thing is

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.880 
Chris Hughton decision well the thing is
if<00:05:45.330> he<00:05:45.690> gets<00:05:45.870> a<00:05:45.960> manager<00:05:46.200> that's<00:05:46.410> a<00:05:46.530> big<00:05:46.710> name

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:46.890 
if he gets a manager that's a big name

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:49.279 
if he gets a manager that's a big name
then<00:05:47.610> that<00:05:47.760> manager<00:05:48.180> is<00:05:48.360> wantin<00:05:48.750> assurances

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
then that manager is wantin assurances

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.200 
then that manager is wantin assurances
and<00:05:49.470> he's<00:05:49.620> gonna<00:05:49.800> want<00:05:50.010> money<00:05:50.190> now<00:05:50.940> if<00:05:51.060> it's

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
and he's gonna want money now if it's

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.219 
and he's gonna want money now if it's
not<00:05:51.300> going<00:05:51.390> to<00:05:51.479> get<00:05:51.600> that<00:05:51.750> he's<00:05:51.900> not<00:05:51.990> gonna<00:05:52.110> go

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:52.229 
not going to get that he's not gonna go

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:53.300 
not going to get that he's not gonna go
so<00:05:52.620> you're<00:05:52.740> not<00:05:52.800> going<00:05:52.919> to<00:05:53.010> get<00:05:53.070> the<00:05:53.160> big

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
so you're not going to get the big

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
so you're not going to get the big
manager<00:05:53.669> you're<00:05:53.850> not<00:05:53.940> going<00:05:54.090> to<00:05:54.150> get<00:05:54.210> a<00:05:54.270> big

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
manager you're not going to get a big

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:55.969 
manager you're not going to get a big
manager<00:05:54.810> that's<00:05:55.050> going<00:05:55.229> to<00:05:55.320> go<00:05:55.380> on<00:05:55.410> a<00:05:55.530> club<00:05:55.770> and

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979 
manager that's going to go on a club and

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.180
