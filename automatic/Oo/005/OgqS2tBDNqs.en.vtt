to share a bit of knowledge with you
guys<00:00:06.279> and<00:00:06.670> how<00:00:06.879> to<00:00:06.940> break<00:00:07.390> in<00:00:07.600> your<00:00:07.720> cleats

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
guys and how to break in your cleats

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.280 
guys and how to break in your cleats
effectively<00:00:09.700> and<00:00:09.880> efficiently<00:00:10.050> so<00:00:11.050> that<00:00:11.080> you

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:11.290 
effectively and efficiently so that you

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.709 
effectively and efficiently so that you
don't<00:00:11.469> get<00:00:11.559> blisters<00:00:12.070> and<00:00:12.099> you<00:00:12.519> can<00:00:12.670> get<00:00:13.509> the

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:13.719 
don't get blisters and you can get the

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.070 
don't get blisters and you can get the
boot<00:00:14.259> to<00:00:14.290> perfectly<00:00:15.040> fit<00:00:15.160> your<00:00:15.759> feet<00:00:16.090> it's

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
boot to perfectly fit your feet it's

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.810 
boot to perfectly fit your feet it's
called<00:00:17.230> a<00:00:17.289> shower<00:00:17.500> method<00:00:17.920> don't<00:00:18.430> judge<00:00:18.609> it's

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
called a shower method don't judge it's

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.260 
called a shower method don't judge it's
kind<00:00:19.000> of<00:00:19.029> weird<00:00:19.270> I<00:00:19.390> guess<00:00:19.630> but<00:00:20.050> um<00:00:20.789> yeah<00:00:21.789> so

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
kind of weird I guess but um yeah so

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.429 
kind of weird I guess but um yeah so
basically<00:00:22.480> what<00:00:22.900> you're<00:00:22.930> going<00:00:23.050> to<00:00:23.199> be<00:00:23.289> doing

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
basically what you're going to be doing

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:24.990 
basically what you're going to be doing
is<00:00:23.740> you're<00:00:24.279> making<00:00:24.519> a<00:00:24.550> shower<00:00:24.730> with<00:00:24.970> your

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
is you're making a shower with your

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.439 
is you're making a shower with your
cleats<00:00:25.330> on<00:00:25.650> I'll<00:00:26.650> get<00:00:26.800> more<00:00:26.949> into<00:00:27.010> it<00:00:27.189> later

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
cleats on I'll get more into it later

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.159 
cleats on I'll get more into it later
the<00:00:28.449> reason<00:00:28.720> for<00:00:28.750> this<00:00:28.990> is<00:00:29.050> because<00:00:29.939> lately

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
the reason for this is because lately

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.690 
the reason for this is because lately
soccer<00:00:32.169> shoes<00:00:32.500> or<00:00:32.800> boots<00:00:32.829> or<00:00:33.340> place<00:00:33.520> whatever

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
soccer shoes or boots or place whatever

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.290 
soccer shoes or boots or place whatever
I<00:00:34.030> have<00:00:34.420> been<00:00:35.340> moving<00:00:36.340> towards<00:00:36.370> synthetic

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
I have been moving towards synthetic

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.450 
I have been moving towards synthetic
materials<00:00:37.930> compared<00:00:38.320> to<00:00:38.440> leather<00:00:38.649> and<00:00:38.980> the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
materials compared to leather and the

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.069 
materials compared to leather and the
reason<00:00:40.030> for<00:00:40.059> that<00:00:40.180> is<00:00:40.420> leather<00:00:40.629> is<00:00:40.840> kind<00:00:41.020> of

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
reason for that is leather is kind of

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.930 
reason for that is leather is kind of
hard<00:00:41.200> to<00:00:41.290> get<00:00:41.620> and<00:00:41.950> synthetic<00:00:42.370> materials<00:00:42.879> are

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
hard to get and synthetic materials are

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.610 
hard to get and synthetic materials are
so<00:00:43.030> much<00:00:43.180> cheaper<00:00:43.540> and<00:00:43.719> easier<00:00:43.780> to<00:00:44.110> make<00:00:44.320> and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
so much cheaper and easier to make and

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.979 
so much cheaper and easier to make and
leather<00:00:45.460> takes<00:00:45.730> on<00:00:45.850> a<00:00:45.879> lot<00:00:46.090> of<00:00:46.239> water<00:00:46.390> water

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
leather takes on a lot of water water

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.340 
leather takes on a lot of water water
and<00:00:47.760> synthetic<00:00:48.760> does<00:00:49.239> not<00:00:49.420> as<00:00:49.600> much<00:00:49.780> so

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
and synthetic does not as much so

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.500 
and synthetic does not as much so
they're<00:00:51.309> kind<00:00:51.640> of<00:00:51.730> lean<00:00:51.850> more<00:00:52.090> towards

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
they're kind of lean more towards

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.090 
they're kind of lean more towards
synthetic<00:00:52.930> materials<00:00:53.289> there<00:00:53.500> even<00:00:53.530> phasing

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
synthetic materials there even phasing

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.709 
synthetic materials there even phasing
out<00:00:54.190> a<00:00:54.250> lot<00:00:54.489> of<00:00:54.579> other<00:00:54.760> boots<00:00:55.059> that<00:00:55.390> have<00:00:55.449> been

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
out a lot of other boots that have been

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:57.510 
out a lot of other boots that have been
traditional<00:00:56.350> or<00:00:56.530> yeah<00:00:57.100> under<00:00:57.430> the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
traditional or yeah under the

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.510 
traditional or yeah under the
traditional<00:00:58.079> label<00:00:59.079> so<00:00:59.920> that's<00:01:00.100> why<00:01:00.219> I<00:01:00.250> think

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
traditional label so that's why I think

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.250 
traditional label so that's why I think
it's<00:01:00.789> really<00:01:01.000> important<00:01:01.449> that<00:01:01.480> you<00:01:01.750> can<00:01:01.989> break

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
it's really important that you can break

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.880 
it's really important that you can break
in<00:01:02.410> your<00:01:02.530> synthetic<00:01:02.770> cleats<00:01:03.510> very<00:01:04.530> fast<00:01:05.530> and

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
in your synthetic cleats very fast and

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.039 
in your synthetic cleats very fast and
well<00:01:06.580> so<00:01:06.909> I<00:01:06.970> think<00:01:07.150> no<00:01:07.270> chair<00:01:07.479> fit<00:01:07.659> perfectly

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
well so I think no chair fit perfectly

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.219 
well so I think no chair fit perfectly
because<00:01:09.540> that's<00:01:10.540> really<00:01:10.659> what<00:01:10.869> it's<00:01:11.049> all

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
because that's really what it's all

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.820 
because that's really what it's all
about<00:01:11.670> synthetic<00:01:12.670> boots<00:01:13.000> um<00:01:13.350> when<00:01:14.350> you<00:01:14.619> first

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
about synthetic boots um when you first

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.780 
about synthetic boots um when you first
get<00:01:14.920> them<00:01:15.040> out<00:01:15.100> of<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.220> box<00:01:15.400> they<00:01:15.640> don't

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
get them out of the box they don't

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.370 
get them out of the box they don't
really<00:01:15.970> fit<00:01:16.240> your<00:01:16.390> feet<00:01:16.540> as<00:01:16.720> well<00:01:16.990> as<00:01:17.200> t'other

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
really fit your feet as well as t'other

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.590 
really fit your feet as well as t'other
night<00:01:17.500> and<00:01:17.890> they<00:01:18.580> don't<00:01:18.700> tend<00:01:18.939> to<00:01:19.060> mold<00:01:19.360> or

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
night and they don't tend to mold or

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.210 
night and they don't tend to mold or
break<00:01:19.780> in<00:01:19.960> as<00:01:20.080> easily<00:01:20.259> as<00:01:20.500> leather<00:01:20.710> so<00:01:21.100> that's

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
break in as easily as leather so that's

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.590 
break in as easily as leather so that's
why<00:01:21.369> I<00:01:21.400> think<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.759> shower<00:01:22.000> technique<00:01:22.390> is<00:01:22.570> a

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
why I think the shower technique is a

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.890 
why I think the shower technique is a
really<00:01:23.290> good<00:01:23.470> for<00:01:23.799> breaking<00:01:24.070> them<00:01:24.159> cleats<00:01:24.490> and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
really good for breaking them cleats and

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.450 
really good for breaking them cleats and
yeah<00:01:25.900> so<00:01:26.290> let's<00:01:26.650> give<00:01:26.770> in<00:01:26.860> to<00:01:27.009> it<00:01:27.040> so<00:01:27.340> before

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
yeah so let's give in to it so before

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.429 
yeah so let's give in to it so before
you<00:01:27.640> do<00:01:27.820> this<00:01:27.970> what<00:01:28.150> you<00:01:28.210> need<00:01:28.479> is<00:01:28.630> your<00:01:28.990> cleats

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:31.590 
you do this what you need is your cleats
are<00:01:30.310> going<00:01:30.640> to<00:01:30.700> need<00:01:30.759> a<00:01:30.850> pair<00:01:31.030> of<00:01:31.060> socks<00:01:31.329> /

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600
