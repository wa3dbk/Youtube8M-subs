00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
that goes around your waist so that

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.460 
that goes around your waist so that
saves<00:01:02.399> a<00:01:02.489> little<00:01:02.699> bit<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.879> weight<00:01:03.199> also<00:01:04.199> not<00:01:04.350> as

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
saves a little bit of weight also not as

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.179 
saves a little bit of weight also not as
much<00:01:04.710> thickness<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> bag<00:01:06.950> what<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.010> did

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
much thickness to the bag what I did

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.750 
much thickness to the bag what I did
here<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.430> I've<00:01:09.210> decided<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.110> my<00:01:10.460> loadout<00:01:11.460> with

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
here is I've decided on my loadout with

here is I've decided on my loadout with
the<00:01:12.030> camera<00:01:12.990> equipment<00:01:14.210> first<00:01:15.210> half<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.479> k7<00:01:16.759> so

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
the camera equipment first half of k7 so

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.600 
the camera equipment first half of k7 so
I<00:01:17.930> potentially<00:01:18.930> have<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.439> lens<00:01:20.220> always

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
I potentially have a lens always

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.440 
I potentially have a lens always
attached<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.210> or<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:23.210> then<00:01:24.210> I<00:01:24.299> go

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
attached to this or not and then I go

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:35.740 
attached to this or not and then I go
with<00:01:25.670> standard<00:01:26.670> zoom<00:01:27.090> lens<00:01:29.420> wide-angle<00:01:30.420> prime

wash<00:01:45.890> probably<00:01:46.890> had<00:01:46.980> a<00:01:47.010> few<00:01:47.220> extra<00:01:47.520> things<00:01:47.550> in

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
wash probably had a few extra things in

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.890 
wash probably had a few extra things in
here<00:01:48.060> as<00:01:48.480> well<00:01:48.720> but<00:01:48.870> and<00:01:49.140> then<00:01:49.290> these<00:01:49.410> are<00:01:50.900> RF

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
here as well but and then these are RF

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.860 
here as well but and then these are RF
flash<00:01:52.830> triggers<00:01:56.360> instead<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.450> using<00:01:57.660> the

flash triggers instead of using the

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.730 
flash triggers instead of using the
concept<00:01:58.080> like<00:01:58.979> they<00:01:59.310> show<00:01:59.640> on<00:01:59.880> the

really<00:02:09.360> works<00:02:09.600> too<00:02:09.959> well<00:02:10.229> for<00:02:10.530> me<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:11.039> does

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
really works too well for me it does

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.360 
really works too well for me it does
work<00:02:11.670> but<00:02:12.000> not<00:02:12.750> how<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.140> usually<00:02:13.290> use<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.190> back

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
work but not how I usually use the back

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.699 
work but not how I usually use the back
I<00:02:14.790> took<00:02:15.390> all<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.810> padded<00:02:16.110> sections<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.680> I

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
I took all the padded sections and I

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.670 
I took all the padded sections and I
made<00:02:16.860> a<00:02:16.890> standard<00:02:17.550> layout<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.959> see<00:02:19.170> most<00:02:19.380> bags

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
made a standard layout you see most bags

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.180 
made a standard layout you see most bags
it's<00:02:20.010> like<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:22.260> instead<00:02:22.709> of<00:02:22.770> heaviness

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
it's like that and instead of heaviness

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.740 
it's like that and instead of heaviness
always<00:02:24.060> connected<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.840> just<00:02:25.560> use<00:02:26.720> one<00:02:27.720> of

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
always connected and just use one of

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.729 
always connected and just use one of
these<00:02:28.020> guys<00:02:28.380> to<00:02:30.890> zip<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.010> bag<00:02:32.160> close<00:02:33.739> that's

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
these guys to zip the bag close that's

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.060 
these guys to zip the bag close that's
first<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.489> I<00:02:35.730> can<00:02:35.760> also<00:02:36.500> we<00:02:37.500> connect<00:02:37.830> one<00:02:38.040> of

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
first and I can also we connect one of

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.300 
first and I can also we connect one of
those<00:02:38.310> just<00:02:38.670> in<00:02:38.820> case<00:02:39.030> but<00:02:40.070> someone<00:02:41.070> I<00:02:41.100> want<00:02:41.280> to

you've got everything quick access that

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.850 
you've got everything quick access that
works<00:02:50.519> better<00:02:50.760> for<00:02:50.880> me<00:02:51.380> instead<00:02:52.380> of<00:02:52.590> these

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
works better for me instead of these

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:53.750 
works better for me instead of these
side<00:02:53.190> panels

I can never fit enough equipment with
these<00:02:57.860> with<00:02:58.860> that<00:02:58.890> configuration

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
these with that configuration

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.229 
these with that configuration
what<00:03:02.239> I<00:03:02.270> also<00:03:02.480> have<00:03:02.810> is<00:03:03.220> one<00:03:04.220> more<00:03:04.430> camera<00:03:04.700> in

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
what I also have is one more camera in

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:12.760 
what I also have is one more camera in
the<00:03:05.540> top<00:03:05.750> section<00:03:06.050> I<00:03:08.230> would<00:03:09.230> be<00:03:09.560> using<00:03:11.170> k5<00:03:12.170> but

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
the top section I would be using k5 but

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.720 
the top section I would be using k5 but
I'm<00:03:13.190> using<00:03:13.400> that<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:13.880> record<00:03:14.330> this<00:03:14.569> video<00:03:15.730> get

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
I'm using that to record this video get

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.390 
I'm using that to record this video get
the<00:03:18.099> three<00:03:19.099> lenses<00:03:19.280> extra<00:03:20.269> camera<00:03:20.540> body<00:03:20.720> flash

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
the three lenses extra camera body flash

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.949 
the three lenses extra camera body flash
probably<00:03:22.400> a<00:03:22.430> diffuser<00:03:22.940> or<00:03:23.090> something<00:03:23.630> else<00:03:23.780> in

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
probably a diffuser or something else in

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:30.240 
probably a diffuser or something else in
there<00:03:24.140> and<00:03:24.950> then<00:03:25.099> the<00:03:25.220> two<00:03:26.590> flash<00:03:27.590> triggers

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.600 

that's<00:03:31.250> good<00:03:31.670> to<00:03:31.910> go<00:03:32.090> for<00:03:32.750> that<00:03:33.340> this<00:03:34.340> works

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
that's good to go for that this works

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.479 
that's good to go for that this works
pretty<00:03:34.850> well<00:03:34.970> I<00:03:35.150> think<00:03:35.390> that<00:03:36.170> configuration

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:46.900 

down<00:03:40.489> here<00:03:41.560> let's<00:03:42.560> have<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.920> bag<00:03:45.910> under

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
down here let's have the bag under

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.630 
down here let's have the bag under
camera<00:03:47.390> body<00:03:47.569> and<00:03:48.380> that's<00:03:48.530> just<00:03:48.769> what<00:03:49.220> they'll

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
camera body and that's just what they'll

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.449 
camera body and that's just what they'll
have<00:03:49.760> the<00:03:49.880> k5<00:03:50.209> instead<00:03:50.630> of<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.870> SD<00:03:51.769> here<00:03:52.099> but

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
have the k5 instead of the SD here but

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.030 
have the k5 instead of the SD here but
same<00:03:53.239> size<00:03:55.959> use<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.080> top<00:03:57.290> compartment<00:03:57.560> for<00:03:57.920> my

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
same size use the top compartment for my

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:04.690 
same size use the top compartment for my
main<00:03:58.250> camera<00:04:02.680> so<00:04:03.680> that's<00:04:03.830> about<00:04:03.920> it<00:04:04.040> for<00:04:04.160> the

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
main camera so that's about it for the

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.060 
main camera so that's about it for the
cups<00:04:04.910> at<00:04:05.150> three<00:04:05.450> and<00:04:05.600> one<00:04:05.780> using<00:04:06.590> it<00:04:06.680> as<00:04:06.890> a

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
cups at three and one using it as a
