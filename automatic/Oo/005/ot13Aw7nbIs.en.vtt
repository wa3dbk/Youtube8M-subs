00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 fucking at first were sonic games 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.240
 on consoles of nintendo and now it goes 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.370
 to roll a paradigm shift still 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.510
 biggest nintendo games on the platform 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.510
 that is not from nintendo 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.510
 the novelty of today in the world of games 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.130
 You must have already heard if you 're 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.070
 on the outside is basically the following to 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.010
 nintendo reversing a philosophy of hers 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.289
 has finally decided to open up the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.199
 hand to keep your property 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.450
 intellectual her games on consoles 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.790
 that it actually manufactures the 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.430
 nintendo has already released games for her 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.770
 other platforms a long time ago in 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.930
 a game 12 years would go and phelps is a 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.809
 console was completely forgotten by the 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.120
 time had some mario games on pc 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.340
 it's also a long time ago but already has a 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.890
 time that Nintendo might have 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.559
 this new this new dogma of just 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.690
 launch her games on the consoles she 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.510
 same does because the main interest 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.329
 of nintendo is to sell console not only 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.369
 selling games then keeping the games on 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.340
 platform that she herself does in case 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.680
 currently the io and 3ds 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.409
 it kind of encourages people to buy 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.770
 The only console I can only play is Mario 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.780
 zelda metroid pokémon from their consoles 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.759
 metroid however why until today it does not 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.380
 out a metroid for three tenths if 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.340
 understood the idea and metroid also a 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.080
 dead right 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.810
 If I say so, do not comment here. 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.549
 below you have a metroid is in 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.020
 planning some years something of the 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.000
 I did not search to know how many 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.799
 walk the metroid franchise but for now 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.810
 in recent years it also means 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.610
 Stop right and saw the following today 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.979
 nintendo presented historic partnership 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.390
 with the Japanese developer of the enem 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.290
 energy makes games for the platform 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.210
 mobile 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.310
 many years ago then the idea is that 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.070
 will roll type a super mario world 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.689
 then pokémon on the phone on your tablet to 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.630
 idea is not that footprint that nintendo 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.759
 will lend, so to speak, your 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.740
 intellectual property their characters 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.390
 classics so that I could then 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.880
 develop games for the platform 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.740
 mobile adnet already has a lot of experience with 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.469
 This is the guys' breadth then. 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.209
 makes a lot of sense if it was to 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.340
 have some form of nintendo will put the 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.410
 her games on mobile platform as a 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.300
 tablet a cell phone 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.490
 - is to partner with those already 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.590
 Understand that this news was super 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.960
 polarizing because on the one hand there 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.700
 many fans would like to have access to 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.830
 nintendo games with the seal of 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.620
 quality of nintendo with the characters 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.570
 classics on platforms that 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.060
 they have to suddenly you have to one 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:35.370
 tablet but you do not have a 3ds you 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.650
 I would like to play a game there one 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.840
 pokémon doubt a milestone of brave life 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.600
 will not play the games that we already 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.940
 bread is readily imported 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:47.700
 there makes plenty of sense I understand 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.640
 which experiences what a console 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.710
 with push buttons do not translate 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.430
 also to the platform with a screen of 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.420
 Touch 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.540
 so if you were expecting to play 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.760
 pokémon fire red or else zelda 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.950
 ocarina of time and the cell phones will not 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.150
 roll that plate a little the fury of the 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.220
 because the people who are super 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.870
 faithful to understand are against the games of the 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.430
 will be released in other 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.680
 platforms because they fear that the 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.840
 nintendo will abandon her consoles 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.850
 This is not going to happen so soon but you. 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.160
 there are people who think that 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.110
 this will for example devalue the 3ds 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.380
 when most people who have already 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.750
 have cell phones can play some kind of 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.820
 I do not play with my husband for more than 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.750
 it's not the mario's games that people 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.220
 has 13 10 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.660
 if they can play something that 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.300
 have a sailor half of it already 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.530
 discourage the purchase of 13 10 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.660
 for example this theory that they have 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.150
 they fear that this will 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.190
 development community is the 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.200
 things have cooled a bit and holly one 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.570
 little less incentive to develop 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.790
 for 3ds for example that I know the 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.860
 People who really liked the idea. 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.080
 people who want to see nintendo 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.940
 adapting to this new time that people 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.160
 live a new game paradigm 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.050
 portable but have a staff that has 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.300
 thinking that this may not 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.980
 so sure by 3ds also has the question 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.470
 that people are afraid that the 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.770
 dinei do nothing just those hunting 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.810
 free-to-play slot machines with Mario with the sky 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.709
 the rock wedge with the pikachu and such 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:18.930
 really this is very much part of the 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.970
 current environment of portable games 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.860
 games on mobile phones and tablets that 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.050
 we see it is quite capable of this happening 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.500
 indeed it is the case I no longer like 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.420
 ask I got it 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.250
 in Xhosa of these games 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.110
 free-to-play to be honest with you 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.540
 then scrolls are not downloaded in the 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.340
 cell phone the next something mario 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.410
 super something cool that will leave 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.060
 for iphone let's say except for years dreaming 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.950
 even excited about the news because I think 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.080
 nice or I wanted 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.210
 I can not imagine you in a while. 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.400
 Are you going to have a donkey kong game? 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.530
 that it will not be the gift that as the 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.290
 We remember the super nintendo 3ds the 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.850
 wii u some more game with the essence 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:57.040
 So let's say Donkey Kong with those 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.070
 Such classic songs as I think 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.830
 Fuck, I find it very difficult. 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.020
 actually canibalize the 3ds bandage or 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.340
 and I do not think it's going to roll 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.010
 This is going to say that I do not 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.660
 I was really hoping to hear that Nintendo is 

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.850
 one of the perhaps because of the culture 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.860
 Asian culture in Japanese culture 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.720
 of that thing of staying there fixed 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.550
 on the path they decided to tread and 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.590
 not deviate from one side to the other that 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.540
 thing're Asian discipline think 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.669
 perhaps because of this the philosophy 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.060
 business and cinema, always having 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:30.700
 was characterized by stubbornness of 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.630
 adherence to the old models of making 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:34.570
 things 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.580
 and by the way they finally changed from 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.100
 idea and are about to offer 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.310
 new to us gamers 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.410
 consumers 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.810
 I'm excited, there's no talking here. 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.850
 there is this concern that some people 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.919
 Talk, but I only played a slot machine there. 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.720
 but it's going to be a totally 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.669
 nothing to see let's just put your face 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.440
 of mario to sell such is capable of 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.630
 actually happens but I'm a little 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.430
 More hopeful tone I guess and the deal 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.260
 is the following I expect very little to 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.030
 The trick to this life is you have 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.950
 low expectations sent I saw the 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:04.600
 news and make a cool game and 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.510
 Passion fruit is being good at training. 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.430
 hoping this will be a revolution 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:11.229
 of the videogames mano left Juninho bateria 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.910
 with pikachu they 'll get it there 

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:14.380
 anyway this is what I think you 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:15.910
 think covers the comments here 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.260
 underneath I'll stay here 

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.120
 if you were video you dodged getting 

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:20.650
 here if you like this video falls 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.720
 video that almost every day and leaves 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.070
 here it costs nothing and it helped me. 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.640
 Fuck that and that's it. 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:26.640
 to the next 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.340
 Mother I know they said it will not 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.500
 classic games group size 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.510
 for mobile platforms because the 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.890
 control system on the buttons on the 

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:42.320
 touch screen does not work so well but 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.900
 strategy game in tunnels afp way 

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:46.970
 In this game more of slower gameplay 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:49.250
 works perfectly on the touch screen 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:51.890
 I understand how you can see it coming out of the game boy. 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:54.350
 advance on iphone go for it please 

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:57.520
 just for me please a favor for me 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.520
 but asking that good
