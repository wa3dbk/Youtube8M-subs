00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
my JVC av selector here and this one is

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.710 
my JVC av selector here and this one is
a<00:02:42.300> JX<00:02:43.140> at<00:02:43.440> 700<00:02:44.280> my<00:02:44.760> last<00:02:44.970> video<00:02:45.300> where<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.510> showed

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
a JX at 700 my last video where I showed

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.880 
a JX at 700 my last video where I showed
my<00:02:45.870> monitor<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.260> also<00:02:46.470> have<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.730> JX<00:02:47.730> s<00:02:48.230> 777<00:02:49.230> which

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
my monitor I also have a JX s 777 which

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.800 
my monitor I also have a JX s 777 which
is<00:02:50.010> has<00:02:50.580> a<00:02:50.610> few<00:02:50.850> more<00:02:50.970> features<00:02:51.030> than<00:02:51.390> this<00:02:51.630> one

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
is has a few more features than this one

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.960 
is has a few more features than this one
this<00:02:51.900> one<00:02:52.080> doesn't<00:02:52.290> do<00:02:52.500> component<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.220> it

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
this one doesn't do component and it

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.940 
this one doesn't do component and it
can't<00:02:54.270> run<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.720> different<00:02:55.020> systems<00:02:55.380> on<00:02:55.620> two

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
can't run to different systems on two

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.920 
can't run to different systems on two
separate<00:02:56.280> monitors<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:57.270> it's<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.690> same

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
separate monitors so it's the same

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.300 
separate monitors so it's the same
system<00:02:58.170> on<00:02:58.410> two<00:02:58.590> monitors<00:02:58.890> but<00:02:59.160> that's

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
system on two monitors but that's

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.410 
system on two monitors but that's
alright<00:02:59.490> because<00:02:59.550> I'm<00:02:59.730> only<00:02:59.820> playing<00:03:00.060> one<00:03:00.240> at

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
alright because I'm only playing one at

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.670 
alright because I'm only playing one at
a<00:03:00.480> time<00:03:00.630> in<00:03:00.840> here<00:03:00.990> anyway<00:03:02.630> and<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:03.780> also<00:03:03.900> it

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
a time in here anyway and it also it

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.490 
a time in here anyway and it also it
allows<00:03:04.920> you<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.070> hook<00:03:05.160> in<00:03:05.340> one<00:03:05.580> less<00:03:06.020> source<00:03:07.020> so

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
allows you to hook in one less source so

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.140 
allows you to hook in one less source so
seven<00:03:08.010> instead<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.310> eight<00:03:08.400> but<00:03:08.760> that's<00:03:08.940> fine

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
seven instead of eight but that's fine

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.240 
seven instead of eight but that's fine
I've<00:03:09.990> got<00:03:10.170> my<00:03:10.290> six<00:03:10.470> permanence<00:03:10.890> which<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.130> all

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
protector I believe it's called the XC

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.580 
protector I believe it's called the XC
one<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.810> nice<00:03:42.930> thing<00:03:43.140> about<00:03:43.170> that<00:03:43.380> is

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
one and the nice thing about that is

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.590 
one and the nice thing about that is
that<00:03:43.800> it's<00:03:44.220> switched<00:03:44.489> so<00:03:44.820> every<00:03:45.209> one<00:03:45.390> of<00:03:45.510> the

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
that it's switched so every one of the

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.020 
that it's switched so every one of the
AC<00:03:45.750> adapters<00:03:46.350> has<00:03:46.500> its<00:03:46.650> own<00:03:46.800> switch<00:03:47.100> to<00:03:47.340> it<00:03:47.489> so

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
AC adapters has its own switch to it so

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.630 
AC adapters has its own switch to it so
see<00:03:48.780> if<00:03:48.840> I<00:03:48.930> can<00:03:49.110> show<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:49.620> one<00:03:49.830> there<00:03:50.070> and<00:03:50.519> you

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
see if I can show you one there and you

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.930 
see if I can show you one there and you
can<00:03:50.790> see<00:03:50.940> it<00:03:51.030> right<00:03:51.209> next<00:03:51.390> to<00:03:51.690> the<00:03:52.940> Nintendo

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
can see it right next to the Nintendo

can see it right next to the Nintendo
power<00:03:54.300> supply<00:03:54.870> there<00:03:55.110> there's<00:03:55.320> a<00:03:55.380> switch<00:03:56.900> and

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
power supply there there's a switch and

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.259 
power supply there there's a switch and
why<00:03:58.080> I<00:03:58.110> did<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:58.590> is<00:03:58.709> because<00:03:59.120> the<00:04:00.120> majority

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
why I did that is because the majority

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.750 
why I did that is because the majority
of<00:04:00.570> these<00:04:00.720> are<00:04:00.870> Japanese<00:04:01.050> systems<00:04:01.800> and<00:04:02.250> you

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
of these are Japanese systems and you

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.040 
of these are Japanese systems and you
don't<00:04:02.970> want<00:04:03.120> to<00:04:03.209> leave<00:04:03.330> the<00:04:03.420> power<00:04:03.600> supplies
