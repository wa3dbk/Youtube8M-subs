00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.660

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.050

 same way and end with the count of 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.280
 Pandoro 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.710
 finally decoration with the currant balls 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.740
 as if it were a real sapling of 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:02.740
 Christmas 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.480
