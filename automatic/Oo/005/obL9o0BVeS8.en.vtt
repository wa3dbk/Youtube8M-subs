00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.630
 you are greeted by the channel helpful tips and 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:10.879
 device for cottages and houses 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:15.740
 the other day I shot a video and put it up already 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:21.089
 means how to cut a sheet 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:23.119
 lumber using electric 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:27.720
 circular saw and that 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:30.900
 plastering rules and one of my 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.470
 subscribers approved this video on said 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.540
 you need a miracle first and buy a saw 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.200
 and then after that he will buy and 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.580
 rules here with this I do not agree well 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.280
 first electric saw 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:50.220
 this expensive tool rule is cheaper in 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.030
 times and rules 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:57.150
 as a tool it is indispensable at the dacha 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.190
 tule private house either in 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.100
 the apartment just to keep his quartile 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.080
 a but on the summer cottage in the private 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.620
 sector store rides 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.750
 and it can be applied from the name 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:13.890
 Plaster generally yes, as it were only up to 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.910
 for plaster but it's like a tool 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.310
 universal 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:23.640
 firstly as the ruler itself who built 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:28.830
 plasterboard walls that know that always 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.560
 can be cut with a knife drywall with 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.110
 help this rule 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.290
 that is, apply it as a ruler afterwards 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.210
 put a profile well let's say 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:44.130
 started two profiles horizontally 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.950
 back vertically and then after 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.200
 profile to profile rule 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.860
 you put and connect 2 profiles 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.670
 but i'm applying one such as 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.220
 jingle 0 here let's say did the arch 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.270
 I needed a horizon that is 0 to find 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:07.040
 what i did i took just pegs i 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:10.670
 actually took the cams of the armature and 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.340
 here's a rule of two and a half meters here on 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.790
 such a distance I just three times 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.180
 Tomsk pegs time two three 4 5 or 6 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.350
 cams make a rule in a crust 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.210
 I stick in the level and then 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:31.190
 by pegging, I set 0 by 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:33.560
 level and like that punch horizon yes 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.250
 there is still a rule with a level 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:40.130
 built into the rules but I don't 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:44.470
 welcome why because it is 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.470
 the rule I have already dropped many times 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.650
 randomly knives on that clip 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:54.680
 it is clear that a piece of wesby falls along with 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.640
 the rule so this one was already held 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.010
 have sent 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.950
 level he would have long been killed and 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.760
 showed wrong and so with 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:08.950
 using this little level 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:11.060
 I set it to zero as expected 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.630
 now you can 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.390
 apply rules for screeds 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.500
 but for this you see I made myself such 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:24.380
 rails with profile pipe can be well 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.440
 from a round pipe I painted them 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:30.380
 specifically so that then just wipe and 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.450
 they were normal but I have to 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.850
 I will make a tie well, that's how it is 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:42.380
 you can make a tie using the rule 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:43.570
 that is, here it is first possible using 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.630
 regulations 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:50.380
 here we are putting this one first 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:58.790
 guide to the horizon 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:04:01.269
 here he threw and expose well 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.269
 then already 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:14.340
 here you can solution 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:18.150
 lay and using the rule then 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.230
 just take out extract 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.770
 guides 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:28.680
 when after a day and screed and for doing 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:32.210
 these channel here is another rule here has 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.700
 see this trapezoidal shape 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:41.340
 Well, this stiffener is great 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:43.410
 the thing here is this cone side 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.990
 You see how well the line can and 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:50.600
 knife and pencil take away and also 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:55.500
 tie buckle that's this side a 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:58.590
 on this side you can here and electric saw 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:02.010
 jigsaw and what you need as 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:05.130
 guides can be used like this 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:10.640
 still use the rule for screed 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:10.640
 but I still use the extensions of the fence 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:20.630
 here for example when I built the fence here 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:25.520
 I first took the first fence secured 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:28.639
 and then the latter fixed it up 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.419
 made a rule to fasten it with 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:34.610
 clamps and then from every single picket fence 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.580
 brought under the rules and crepe under 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.970
 rules and crepe and it was without shoelaces 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:45.010
 it was very smooth and perfect so 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.010
 so you can still apply the rules 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:55.900
 now here is sewed up with cheval siding 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:06:00.340
 rather the house yes here is the same with 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:04.580
 using the rule exhibited and level 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:06.650
 all mortgages or crate with son 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:10.250
 forged wood profile is also his 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.060
 race and then leveled profile with 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.460
 regulations 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.800
 that is, it is universal good 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.930
 I said the tool probably that 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:22.010
 still better to buy two and a half 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:24.919
 meter rule it sort of fits and 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:30.199
 ceilings apartment here in general at least about 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:33.380
 250 where there is stalinka there four meters well 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:36.110
 here it is 250 she arrange it 

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:39.710
 such length because principle can 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:44.080
 still apply rake well rake can lead 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:47.289
 there and kill and generally all the same it 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:51.349
 reliable and good tool 

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:54.380
 so here are my wishes after all 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:58.510
 need to buy first rule 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:07:02.720
 then she will pay for herself and discourage and 

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:07.340
 improve your work and then you can 

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:08.680
 electric saw buy thank you all for 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.880
 Attention 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:20.750
 as always thumb up or thumb down 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:24.370
 Questions and comments are still waiting 

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:24.370
 new videos see you
