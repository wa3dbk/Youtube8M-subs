00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
swoosh right there and you also see that

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.870 
swoosh right there and you also see that
redwood<00:01:37.450> that's<00:01:37.720> towards<00:01:38.260> the<00:01:38.380> toe<00:01:38.620> of<00:01:38.740> the

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
redwood that's towards the toe of the

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.430 
redwood that's towards the toe of the
sneaker<00:01:39.880> and<00:01:40.030> that<00:01:40.479> does<00:01:40.690> rise<00:01:40.960> up<00:01:41.229> to<00:01:41.410> the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
sneaker and that does rise up to the

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.740 
sneaker and that does rise up to the
midsole<00:01:41.830> okay<00:01:42.790> now<00:01:42.970> to<00:01:43.030> the<00:01:43.240> midsole<00:01:43.570> of<00:01:43.630> the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
midsole okay now to the midsole of the

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.040 
midsole okay now to the midsole of the
shoe<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:44.620> midsole<00:01:45.040> feels<00:01:45.670> like<00:01:46.360> a<00:01:46.390> vulcanized

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
shoe the midsole feels like a vulcanized

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.990 
shoe the midsole feels like a vulcanized
sole<00:01:47.440> and<00:01:47.800> I<00:01:48.070> think<00:01:48.310> that's<00:01:48.460> probably<00:01:48.670> one<00:01:48.970> of

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
sole and I think that's probably one of

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.090 
sole and I think that's probably one of
the<00:01:49.150> best<00:01:49.330> features<00:01:49.960> of<00:01:50.170> the<00:01:50.530> shoe<00:01:50.740> that<00:01:50.770> it

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
the best features of the shoe that it

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.130 
the best features of the shoe that it
does<00:01:51.280> feel<00:01:51.520> like<00:01:51.550> a<00:01:51.700> vulcanized<00:01:52.180> sole<00:01:52.479> but<00:01:53.020> it

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
does feel like a vulcanized sole but it

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.590 
does feel like a vulcanized sole but it
is<00:01:53.259> not<00:01:53.500> this<00:01:54.040> is<00:01:54.100> cup<00:01:54.550> sole<00:01:54.850> which<00:01:55.390> is
