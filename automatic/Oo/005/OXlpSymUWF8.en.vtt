right there mobilesubstrate make sure
you<00:02:15.310> download<00:02:15.459> that<00:02:15.670> and<00:02:15.970> I<00:02:16.420> have<00:02:16.600> no<00:02:16.900> sim<00:02:17.170> just

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
you download that and I have no sim just

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.690 
you download that and I have no sim just
now<00:02:17.530> because<00:02:17.800> it's<00:02:17.920> doing<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.190> steps<00:02:18.430> in<00:02:18.610> the

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
now because it's doing the steps in the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.460 
now because it's doing the steps in the
background<00:02:19.150> that's<00:02:19.750> why<00:02:19.930> it's<00:02:20.050> on<00:02:20.110> tethered

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
background that's why it's on tethered

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.980 
background that's why it's on tethered
so<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.220> takes<00:02:21.400> probably<00:02:21.670> I<00:02:21.850> probably<00:02:22.450> have

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
so it takes probably I probably have

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.570 
so it takes probably I probably have
another<00:02:23.200> minute<00:02:23.620> or<00:02:23.709> so<00:02:23.920> for<00:02:24.100> it<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.250> go<00:02:24.370> so

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
another minute or so for it to go so

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.610 
another minute or so for it to go so
that's<00:02:25.150> all<00:02:25.330> you<00:02:25.450> got<00:02:25.569> to<00:02:25.660> do<00:02:25.720> and<00:02:25.870> then<00:02:26.050> it'll

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
that's all you got to do and then it'll

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.070 
that's all you got to do and then it'll
be<00:02:26.770> untethered<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.120> this<00:02:28.480> works<00:02:28.750> with<00:02:28.959> the

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
be untethered and this works with the

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.370 
be untethered and this works with the
jailbreak<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.739> that's<00:02:29.950> what's<00:02:30.160> cool<00:02:30.430> about<00:02:30.489> it

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
jailbreak to that's what's cool about it

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.979 
jailbreak to that's what's cool about it
so<00:02:32.380> yeah<00:02:32.530> I've<00:02:33.190> tested<00:02:33.610> it<00:02:33.670> probably<00:02:34.120> for<00:02:34.420> half

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
so yeah I've tested it probably for half

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.979 
so yeah I've tested it probably for half
a<00:02:35.080> day<00:02:35.230> works<00:02:35.830> flawlessly<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:37.540> now<00:02:37.750> I<00:02:37.780> should

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
a day works flawlessly so now I should
