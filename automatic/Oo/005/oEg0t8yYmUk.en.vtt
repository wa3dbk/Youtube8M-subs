screen<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.979> us<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.400> didn't<00:01:26.729> work<00:01:26.820> all<00:01:27.000> the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
screen for us this didn't work all the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.550 
screen for us this didn't work all the
time<00:01:27.119> but<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.659> wasn't<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> problem<00:01:28.170> because

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
time but it wasn't a problem because

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.679 
time but it wasn't a problem because
it's<00:01:28.710> easy<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.100> start<00:01:29.280> up<00:01:29.520> if<00:01:29.700> you<00:01:30.270> do<00:01:30.450> succeed

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
it's easy to start up if you do succeed

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.420 
it's easy to start up if you do succeed
in<00:01:31.020> restarting<00:01:31.320> you'll<00:01:31.829> start<00:01:32.070> at<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.280> front

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
in restarting you'll start at the front

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.280 
in restarting you'll start at the front
I<00:01:32.700> suggest<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.299> two<00:01:33.479> or<00:01:33.630> more<00:01:33.750> people<00:01:33.990> go

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
I suggest that two or more people go

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.569 
I suggest that two or more people go
around<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.710> left<00:01:34.799> side<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.280> make<00:01:35.430> things

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
around to the left side to make things

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.609 
around to the left side to make things
easier<00:01:36.030> every<00:01:36.570> time<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.869> happened<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.470> took

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
easier every time this happened it took

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.080 
easier every time this happened it took
a<00:01:37.740> little<00:01:37.860> longer<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.340> actually<00:01:38.670> complete<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
a little longer to actually complete the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.670 
a little longer to actually complete the
mission<00:01:39.479> but<00:01:39.810> at<00:01:39.930> least<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.259> didn't<00:01:40.530> have<00:01:40.560> to

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
mission but at least we didn't have to

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.990 
mission but at least we didn't have to
wait<00:01:40.890> through<00:01:41.040> multiple<00:01:41.400> loading<00:01:41.700> screens

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
wait through multiple loading screens

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.120 
wait through multiple loading screens
and<00:01:42.180> menus<00:01:42.509> now<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.140> show<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.470> how<00:01:43.680> quick<00:01:43.890> this
