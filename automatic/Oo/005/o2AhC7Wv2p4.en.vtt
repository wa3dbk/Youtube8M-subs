00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
so today i finished the space shuttle

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.999 
so today i finished the space shuttle
the<00:00:02.580> EDF<00:00:03.120> Space<00:00:03.540> Shuttle<00:00:03.570> version<00:00:04.259> to<00:00:04.470> the

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
the EDF Space Shuttle version to the

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.880 
the EDF Space Shuttle version to the
difference<00:00:05.850> is<00:00:06.000> this<00:00:06.240> one<00:00:06.480> just<00:00:07.350> a<00:00:07.560> flat

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
difference is this one just a flat

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.290 
difference is this one just a flat
fuselage<00:00:08.370> that<00:00:08.849> one<00:00:09.059> was<00:00:09.690> 3d<00:00:10.260> fuselage<00:00:11.300> same

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
fuselage that one was 3d fuselage same

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.470 
fuselage that one was 3d fuselage same
EPP<00:00:12.870> wing<00:00:13.110> same<00:00:13.679> servos<00:00:14.160> same<00:00:14.610> battery<00:00:15.030> same

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
EPP wing same servos same battery same

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.609 
EPP wing same servos same battery same
EDF<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.699> have<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> different<00:00:17.970> receiver<00:00:18.660> because

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
EDF I have a different receiver because

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.240 
EDF I have a different receiver because
my<00:00:19.830> other<00:00:20.039> receiver<00:00:20.660> where'd<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.779> go<00:00:22.250> one

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
my other receiver where'd it go one

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.880 
my other receiver where'd it go one
other<00:00:23.369> receiver<00:00:23.939> was<00:00:24.840> being<00:00:25.109> lame<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.830> it

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
other receiver was being lame so it

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.349 
other receiver was being lame so it
didn't<00:00:26.070> work<00:00:26.539> 40<00:00:27.539> amp<00:00:27.720> ESC<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:29.150> besides<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
didn't work 40 amp ESC and besides the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.920 
didn't work 40 amp ESC and besides the
receiver<00:00:30.660> everything's<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.439> same<00:00:31.550> so<00:00:32.930> I'll

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
receiver everything's the same so I'll

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.560 
receiver everything's the same so I'll
fly<00:00:34.469> up<00:00:34.500> pretty<00:00:34.800> soon<00:00:35.090> like<00:00:36.090> tonight<00:00:36.420> or

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
fly up pretty soon like tonight or

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.900 
fly up pretty soon like tonight or
tomorrow<00:00:36.960> morning<00:00:37.440> I've<00:00:37.800> got<00:00:38.190> these<00:00:38.489> hinges

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
tomorrow morning I've got these hinges

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.360 
tomorrow morning I've got these hinges
on<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.750> had<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.200> same<00:00:40.350> hinges<00:00:40.770> on<00:00:40.950> that<00:00:41.190> one

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
on it I had the same hinges on that one

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.660 
on it I had the same hinges on that one
so<00:00:42.329> basically<00:00:42.840> everything<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.559> same

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
so basically everything is the same

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.400 
so basically everything is the same
except<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.969> EDF<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.750> little<00:00:46.110> bit<00:00:46.230> farther

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
except the EDF is a little bit farther

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.880 
except the EDF is a little bit farther
back<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> other<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:47.550> I<00:00:47.579> was<00:00:47.760> up<00:00:47.910> here<00:00:48.239> and

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
back on the other one I was up here and

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.459 
back on the other one I was up here and
different<00:00:49.890> fuselage<00:00:50.399> size<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.210> now<00:00:51.960> I'll<00:00:52.230> turn

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
different fuselage size so now I'll turn

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.979 
different fuselage size so now I'll turn
it<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.070> show<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.610> what<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.600> control

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
it on and show you what the control

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.350 
it on and show you what the control
services<00:00:55.530> move<00:00:55.860> like<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.670> dark<00:00:57.059> fan

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
services move like in the dark fan

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.819 
services move like in the dark fan
running<00:00:57.600> okay<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.050> here<00:00:58.320> are<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.440> control

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
running okay so here are the control

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.500 
running okay so here are the control
surfaces<00:01:00.079> elevator<00:01:02.809> aileron<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:05.270> then<00:01:06.270> dual

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
surfaces elevator aileron and then dual

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.719 
surfaces elevator aileron and then dual
rates<00:01:06.810> are<00:01:07.049> on<00:01:07.439> now<00:01:08.210> elevator<00:01:09.470> either<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.770> now

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
rates are on now elevator either on now

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.550 
rates are on now elevator either on now

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.940 
will take a for sale they're not bad and
when<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.250> hold<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.640> up<00:01:35.759> like<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.259> run

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
when you hold it up like this and run

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.100 
when you hold it up like this and run
the<00:01:38.130> motor<00:01:38.310> you<00:01:39.060> can<00:01:39.240> tell<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.659> probably<00:01:39.990> has

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
the motor you can tell it probably has

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.260 
the motor you can tell it probably has
like<00:01:41.299> almost<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.659> two<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.590> one<00:01:43.820> or<00:01:44.820> like<00:01:45.000> power

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
like almost a two to one or like power

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.740 
like almost a two to one or like power
weight<00:01:45.600> ratio<00:01:46.189> so<00:01:47.189> it's<00:01:47.670> pretty<00:01:48.619> powerful<00:01:49.619> uh

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
weight ratio so it's pretty powerful uh

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.399 
weight ratio so it's pretty powerful uh
the<00:01:51.750> plane<00:01:51.990> weighs<00:01:52.229> about<00:01:52.740> 13<00:01:53.399> ounces<00:01:53.579> total

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
the plane weighs about 13 ounces total

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.569 
the plane weighs about 13 ounces total
so<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:56.100> first<00:01:56.579> flight<00:01:56.880> will<00:01:57.180> be<00:01:57.210> tomorrow<00:01:58.020> or

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
so the first flight will be tomorrow or

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.079 
so the first flight will be tomorrow or
tonight<00:01:59.579> whichever<00:02:00.540> one<00:02:00.630> comes<00:02:00.899> first
