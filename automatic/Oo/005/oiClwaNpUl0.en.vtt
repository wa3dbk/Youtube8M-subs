00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:11.480
 hello friends now we are with you 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.720
 make the backlight for the blue keyboard 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.200
 colors for this you need a led 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:20.570
 3 mm 19 pieces I need 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:23.330
 a resistor and a minimum power of 1 watt with 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:28.130
 3 side resistance and also need 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:45.050
 switch to begin with, let's take our 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:49.760
 my keyboard is holding the keyboard 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.329
 on 16 screws now with a screwdriver 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.329
 analyze 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.910
 look carefully here friends here 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.670
 me keyboard genius 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.460
 and I will use the final product 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.060
 since it is plus 5 volts and gray 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.270
 since it is land on each 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.190
 keyboard different manufacturers make 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.740
 different markings by color like these 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:22.090
 grooves you need to turn on this 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:25.899
 Internet attention is detailed 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.090
 description for different companies and now 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:38.649
 let's sort our culture to the end 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:42.460
 and now we make a hole 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:45.330
 places for light bulbs and for button 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.330
 I will be right here 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:13.110
 like a hole under the LEDs here 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:16.020
 make the top of the summer and now 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:28.530
 Insert the LEDs and the button into the hole 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:32.280
 which we did and now we solder everything 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.400
 together for each resistor let's start 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.310
 I will sit down will 5 LEDs 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.120
 on the radio 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.530
 the resistors are soldered to the switch so 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.530
 that's what I did 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.870
 resistor q3 switch when extremely 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.860
 parallel to each resistor go off 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.520
 approach to wiring 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.630
 which is attached to 5 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.230
 LEDs on taxiing 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.230
 same and 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.710
 it now remains to put everything together 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.410
 steep 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.660
 so friends are what I did 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.810
 still working under the buttons 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:58.810
 there is also a bottom illumination thank you all 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.640
 for attention if you liked the video 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.319
 like to subscribe to the channel 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.319
 there will be many more interesting videos
