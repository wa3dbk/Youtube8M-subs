00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
something that's easier to carry around

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.710 
something that's easier to carry around
because<00:04:09.800> this<00:04:09.980> is

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.930 

I<00:04:15.799> wanted<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:16.860> get<00:04:17.040> him<00:04:17.250> something<00:04:17.519> that<00:04:17.700> was<00:04:17.910> a

I wanted to get him something that was a

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.720 
I wanted to get him something that was a
little<00:04:18.120> bit<00:04:18.299> chunkier<00:04:18.870> because<00:04:19.260> his<00:04:19.739> camera

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 
little bit chunkier because his camera

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:22.430 
little bit chunkier because his camera
that<00:04:20.850> he<00:04:20.910> had<00:04:21.030> before<00:04:21.330> this<00:04:21.570> got<00:04:21.810> lost<00:04:22.080> right

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
that he had before this got lost right

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.560 
that he had before this got lost right
because<00:04:23.010> he<00:04:23.100> got<00:04:23.190> drunk<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.820> carried<00:04:24.390> it<00:04:24.480> with

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
because he got drunk and carried it with

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.860 
because he got drunk and carried it with
him<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:25.050> it<00:04:25.590> just<00:04:25.730> disappeared<00:04:26.730> right<00:04:26.910> so<00:04:27.510> I

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
him and it just disappeared right so I

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.330 
him and it just disappeared right so I
wanted<00:04:28.290> something<00:04:28.410> that<00:04:28.890> was<00:04:28.980> a<00:04:29.010> little<00:04:29.130> bit

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
wanted something that was a little bit

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.040 
wanted something that was a little bit
chunkier<00:04:29.790> that's<00:04:30.240> what<00:04:30.420> we<00:04:30.540> had<00:04:30.660> now<00:04:30.870> right

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
chunkier that's what we had now right

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.320 
chunkier that's what we had now right
here<00:04:31.200> I<00:04:31.440> think<00:04:32.400> that's<00:04:32.670> exactly<00:04:32.850> what<00:04:33.240> I'm

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
here I think that's exactly what I'm

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
here I think that's exactly what I'm
recording<00:04:33.750> on

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
is very very nice and I love the quality

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.220 
is very very nice and I love the quality
on<00:04:39.340> this<00:04:39.430> camera<00:04:39.670> but<00:04:40.450> it's<00:04:40.600> just<00:04:40.720> simply<00:04:41.110> not

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
on this camera but it's just simply not

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.230

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
something that I can pick up and grab on

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.060 
something that I can pick up and grab on
the<00:04:43.330> go<00:04:43.480> that's<00:04:44.410> an<00:04:44.590> it<00:04:44.680> should<00:04:44.710> not<00:04:44.860> be<00:04:45.040> very

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
the go that's an it should not be very

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.090 
the go that's an it should not be very
very<00:04:45.490> grand<00:04:45.790> if<00:04:45.850> I<00:04:45.910> were<00:04:46.030> to<00:04:46.120> mess<00:04:46.240> it<00:04:46.360> up<00:04:46.950> okay
