dock or the iPod ovo we're building kind

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.950 
dock or the iPod ovo we're building kind
of<00:01:29.640> like<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> backstop<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:30.720> then<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:32.960> doctor's

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
note you fall backwards here it is on

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.230 
note you fall backwards here it is on
the<00:01:37.650> dock<00:01:38.490> itself<00:01:40.909> over<00:01:41.909> here<00:01:42.090> we're<00:01:42.210> just

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
the dock itself over here we're just

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.920 
the dock itself over here we're just
adding<00:01:42.630> some<00:01:42.869> flat<00:01:43.200> pieces<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:44.820> help<00:01:45.299> with<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
adding some flat pieces to help with the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.889 
adding some flat pieces to help with the
mechanism<00:01:48.259> and<00:01:50.240> over<00:01:51.240> here<00:01:51.540> we<00:01:51.659> start

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
mechanism and over here we start

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.950 
mechanism and over here we start
building<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.500> mechanism<00:01:53.189> for<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.579> fold<00:01:54.119> as

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
building the mechanism for the fold as

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.660 
building the mechanism for the fold as
you<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:55.290> see<00:01:55.500> we<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.829> few<00:01:56.009> hinge<00:01:56.250> pieces

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
you can see we have a few hinge pieces

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.130 
you can see we have a few hinge pieces
we<00:01:57.659> stick<00:01:57.899> them<00:01:58.079> together<00:01:58.259> and<00:02:00.020> then<00:02:01.020> we

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
we stick them together and then we

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.950 
we stick them together and then we
connect<00:02:01.380> them<00:02:01.530> together<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.100> add<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:03.600> trigger

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
connect them together and add a trigger

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.529 
connect them together and add a trigger
for<00:02:04.290> enough<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:06.590> 2x2<00:02:07.590> piece<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.520> make<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.509> a

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
for enough to and 2x2 piece to make it a

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.140 
for enough to and 2x2 piece to make it a
little<00:02:09.840> stronger<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.920> then<00:02:11.610> we<00:02:11.700> just<00:02:11.879> connect

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
little stronger and then we just connect

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.880 
little stronger and then we just connect
that<00:02:12.300> onto<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.690> dock<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.140> you're<00:02:13.260> done

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
that onto the dock and you're done

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.880 
that onto the dock and you're done
