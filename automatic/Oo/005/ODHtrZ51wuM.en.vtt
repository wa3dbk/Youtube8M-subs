00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
depending on how they chew it up might

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.950 
depending on how they chew it up might
turn<00:00:49.730> into<00:00:49.910> 4<00:00:50.180> or<00:00:50.210> even<00:00:50.390> 5<00:00:52.510> we<00:00:53.510> haven't<00:00:53.750> as<00:00:53.900> much

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
turn into 4 or even 5 we haven't as much

turn into 4 or even 5 we haven't as much
winching<00:00:54.440> as<00:00:54.590> we<00:00:54.890> probably<00:00:55.070> would<00:00:55.309> have

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
winching as we probably would have

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.220 
winching as we probably would have
wanted<00:00:55.580> this<00:00:55.850> stage<00:00:56.120> here<00:00:56.360> now<00:00:56.570> hopefully<00:00:56.989> we

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
wanted this stage here now hopefully we

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.630 
wanted this stage here now hopefully we
can<00:00:57.350> get<00:00:57.410> some<00:00:57.470> winching<00:00:58.070> happening<00:00:58.430> there's

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
can get some winching happening there's

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.100 
can get some winching happening there's
a<00:00:58.850> few<00:00:59.000> little<00:00:59.120> mud<00:00:59.360> puddles<00:00:59.690> which<00:00:59.930> would

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
a few little mud puddles which would

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.229 
a few little mud puddles which would
soften<00:01:00.320> up<00:01:00.590> and<00:01:00.800> very<00:01:00.980> muddy<00:01:01.310> trooper<00:01:02.059> mates

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239

some really good mud to give the boys a
bit<00:01:21.350> of<00:01:21.440> a<00:01:21.500> challenge<00:01:21.680> if<00:01:22.670> we<00:01:22.880> don't<00:01:23.030> get<00:01:23.149> rain

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
bit of a challenge if we don't get rain

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.060 
bit of a challenge if we don't get rain
over<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.840> next<00:01:23.899> twelve<00:01:24.259> months<00:01:24.320> these<00:01:24.710> holes

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
over the next twelve months these holes

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.320 
over the next twelve months these holes
will<00:01:25.220> probably<00:01:25.460> be<00:01:25.520> dried<00:01:25.729> your<00:01:25.910> mullet<00:01:26.119> only

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
will probably be dried your mullet only

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.219 
will probably be dried your mullet only
get<00:01:26.450> back<00:01:26.570> next<00:01:26.750> year<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:29.630> stage<00:01:29.869> should<00:01:30.110> be

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
get back next year the stage should be

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:31.690 
get back next year the stage should be
pretty<00:01:30.440> interesting<00:01:30.680> for<00:01:31.040> a<00:01:31.100> few<00:01:31.400> of<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:31.549> boys

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
pretty interesting for a few of the boys

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.370 
pretty interesting for a few of the boys
here<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.450> cars<00:01:32.659> are<00:01:32.869> drawing<00:01:33.080> board<00:01:33.320> and

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 
here the cars are drawing board and

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.750 
here the cars are drawing board and
running<00:01:33.710> but<00:01:34.010> if<00:01:34.159> you're<00:01:34.310> from<00:01:34.430> don't<00:01:34.610> have

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:34.760 
running but if you're from don't have

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.580 
running but if you're from don't have
reverse<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:35.420> this<00:01:35.510> course<00:01:35.780> is<00:01:35.900> pretty<00:01:36.320> tight

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
reverse and this course is pretty tight

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.770 
reverse and this course is pretty tight
so<00:01:37.250> we<00:01:37.610> may<00:01:37.790> lose<00:01:37.970> a<00:01:38.030> little<00:01:38.210> bit<00:01:38.330> of<00:01:38.420> bunting

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
so we may lose a little bit of bunting

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.730 
so we may lose a little bit of bunting
and<00:01:38.900> might<00:01:39.020> have<00:01:39.110> a<00:01:39.140> bit<00:01:39.290> of<00:01:39.320> work<00:01:39.409> to<00:01:39.619> do

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
and might have a bit of work to do

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.859 
and might have a bit of work to do
during<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.070> course<00:01:40.280> of<00:01:40.400> the<00:01:40.490> stage<00:01:40.869> the
