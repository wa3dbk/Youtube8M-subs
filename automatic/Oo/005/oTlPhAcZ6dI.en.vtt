happen<00:03:52.480> you<00:03:52.989> know<00:03:53.140> like<00:03:53.290> I<00:03:53.410> said<00:03:53.590> I<00:03:53.620> have<00:03:53.799> a

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:53.829 
happen you know like I said I have a

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:55.620 
happen you know like I said I have a
background<00:03:54.130> in<00:03:54.459> sports<00:03:54.760> in<00:03:55.090> track<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:55.480> field

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
background in sports in track and field

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.750 
background in sports in track and field
and<00:03:56.079> you<00:03:56.380> know<00:03:56.500> so<00:03:56.680> I'm<00:03:56.799> used<00:03:56.980> apply<00:03:57.280> metrics

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
and you know so I'm used apply metrics

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.160 
and you know so I'm used apply metrics
and<00:03:57.910> I<00:03:57.970> like<00:03:58.150> this<00:03:58.299> stuff<00:03:58.540> and<00:03:58.750> I<00:03:58.810> think<00:03:59.019> that

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
and I like this stuff and I think that

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.949 
and I like this stuff and I think that
makes<00:03:59.380> a<00:03:59.470> difference<00:03:59.680> too<00:03:59.980> but<00:04:00.700> in<00:04:01.269> the

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
makes a difference too but in the

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.199 
makes a difference too but in the
upcoming<00:04:02.140> days<00:04:02.620> weeks<00:04:03.250> or<00:04:03.430> whatever<00:04:03.579> imma<00:04:04.000> try

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209

you know keep in mind i am training for
track<00:04:37.120> and<00:04:37.180> field<00:04:37.360> also<00:04:37.720> so<00:04:38.199> I'm<00:04:38.470> at<00:04:38.650> least

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
track and field also so I'm at least

going<00:04:39.069> to<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.370> track<00:04:39.580> maybe<00:04:39.819> at<00:04:40.090> least<00:04:40.240> two

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:40.509 
going to the track maybe at least two

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.330 
going to the track maybe at least two
three<00:04:40.780> times<00:04:40.960> a<00:04:41.139> week<00:04:41.169> you<00:04:41.919> know<00:04:41.949> I'm<00:04:42.190> not

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
three times a week you know I'm not

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.580 
three times a week you know I'm not
training<00:04:42.669> at<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.419> level<00:04:43.870> that<00:04:43.900> i<00:04:44.020> was<00:04:44.259> when<00:04:44.500> i

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
training at the level that i was when i

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.990 
training at the level that i was when i
was<00:04:44.680> a<00:04:44.740> little<00:04:44.919> bit<00:04:45.099> younger<00:04:45.250> you<00:04:45.849> know<00:04:45.970> i

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
was a little bit younger you know i

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.909 
was a little bit younger you know i
guess<00:04:46.509> as<00:04:46.750> you<00:04:46.870> get<00:04:47.050> older<00:04:47.349> you<00:04:47.440> got<00:04:47.590> a<00:04:47.620> trend

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
guess as you get older you got a trend

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.830 
guess as you get older you got a trend
lot<00:04:48.099> smarter<00:04:48.340> as<00:04:48.849> opposed<00:04:49.210> to<00:04:49.330> hard<00:04:49.509> all<00:04:49.720> the

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
lot smarter as opposed to hard all the

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.619 
lot smarter as opposed to hard all the
time<00:04:49.900> so<00:04:50.349> but<00:04:51.220> i<00:04:51.250> am<00:04:51.550> you<00:04:51.819> know<00:04:51.849> doing<00:04:52.389> those
