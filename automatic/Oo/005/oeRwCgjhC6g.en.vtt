00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
that everyone can play so that you can

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:17.010 
that everyone can play so that you can
play<00:00:09.570> this

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.720 

all<00:00:18.020> right<00:00:18.230> here<00:00:18.590> it<00:00:18.680> is<00:00:18.710> played<00:00:19.160> a<00:00:19.310> little<00:00:19.610> bit

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
all right here it is played a little bit

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:35.009 
all right here it is played a little bit
slower

00:00:35.009 --> 00:00:35.019 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:41.130 

so<00:00:36.019> this<00:00:36.199> is<00:00:36.440> a<00:00:38.079> c7<00:00:39.079> a<00:00:39.339> dominant<00:00:40.339> 7sus4

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
so this is a c7 a dominant 7sus4

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.229 
so this is a c7 a dominant 7sus4
arpeggio<00:00:42.140> basically<00:00:42.829> based<00:00:43.250> on<00:00:43.519> the<00:00:43.699> notes<00:00:43.879> e

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
arpeggio basically based on the notes e

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.709 
arpeggio basically based on the notes e
a<00:00:45.250> B<00:00:46.250> and<00:00:46.690> D<00:00:47.829> which<00:00:48.829> are<00:00:49.190> basically<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:49.940> 1<00:00:50.149> 4<00:00:50.449> 5

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 
a B and D which are basically the 1 4 5

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.740 
a B and D which are basically the 1 4 5
&amp;<00:00:51.019> &amp;<00:00:51.409> 7<00:00:52.089> so<00:00:53.089> I<00:00:53.479> actually<00:00:53.960> start<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:54.860> lick<00:00:55.129> on

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
&amp; &amp; 7 so I actually start the lick on

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.020 
&amp; &amp; 7 so I actually start the lick on
the<00:00:56.750> 4th<00:00:57.079> you<00:00:58.040> could<00:00:58.190> look<00:00:58.339> you<00:00:58.489> can<00:00:58.760> look<00:00:58.879> at

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
the 4th you could look you can look at

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.579 
the 4th you could look you can look at
it<00:00:59.149> as<00:00:59.269> being<00:00:59.299> a<00:00:59.600> few<00:00:59.809> different<00:01:00.140> things<00:01:00.350> I'm

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
it as being a few different things I'm

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:13.230 
it as being a few different things I'm
looking<00:01:00.799> at<00:01:01.100> it<00:01:01.250> right<00:01:01.430> now<00:01:01.489> is<00:01:01.789> in<00:01:01.940> a<00:01:02.149> 747

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.080 

right<00:01:14.240> there<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:15.069> then<00:01:16.069> hammer<00:01:16.369> on<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.850> the

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
right there and then hammer on to the

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.070 
right there and then hammer on to the
root<00:01:17.270> note<00:01:17.479> to<00:01:17.720> eat<00:01:17.899> and<00:01:18.970> then<00:01:19.970> I<00:01:20.000> hate<00:01:20.390> again

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
root note to eat and then I hate again

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.930 
root note to eat and then I hate again
on<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.590> second<00:01:21.920> string<00:01:22.130> so<00:01:22.340> that<00:01:22.369> creates<00:01:22.819> a

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
on the second string so that creates a

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.639 
on the second string so that creates a
really<00:01:23.090> cool<00:01:23.330> pattern<00:01:23.539> when<00:01:23.960> you're<00:01:24.350> here<00:01:24.560> in

00:01:24.639 --> 00:01:24.649 
really cool pattern when you're here in

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.100 
really cool pattern when you're here in
the<00:01:24.770> root<00:01:24.950> note<00:01:25.159> twice<00:01:25.580> but<00:01:26.300> on<00:01:26.630> a<00:01:26.659> different

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
the root note twice but on a different

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.570 
the root note twice but on a different
string<00:01:28.810> so<00:01:29.810> I<00:01:30.110> just<00:01:30.440> do<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.679> same<00:01:30.920> pattern<00:01:31.340> and

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
string so I just do the same pattern and

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.080 
string so I just do the same pattern and
from<00:01:32.420> here<00:01:32.780> you're<00:01:33.710> going<00:01:33.950> to<00:01:34.069> a<00:01:34.520> so<00:01:34.700> you're

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
from here you're going to a so you're

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.330 
from here you're going to a so you're
going<00:01:35.330> 1<00:01:35.630> to<00:01:35.929> the<00:01:36.740> 4th<00:01:37.450> to<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.479> 5th<00:01:38.599> which

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
going 1 to the 4th to the 5th which

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.540 
going 1 to the 4th to the 5th which
gives<00:01:40.340> you<00:01:40.550> all<00:01:40.789> the<00:01:41.060> notes<00:01:41.179> that<00:01:41.509> you<00:01:41.629> need

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
gives you all the notes that you need

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.210 
gives you all the notes that you need
and<00:01:43.599> all<00:01:44.599> you're<00:01:44.869> doing<00:01:45.200> next<00:01:45.739> is<00:01:46.069> basically

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
and all you're doing next is basically

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.969 
and all you're doing next is basically
just<00:01:46.610> taking<00:01:47.090> it<00:01:47.300> down<00:01:47.479> to<00:01:47.690> more<00:01:47.959> octaves<00:01:48.500> so

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 
just taking it down to more octaves so

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.570 
just taking it down to more octaves so
you<00:01:49.069> just<00:01:49.599> basically<00:01:50.599> take<00:01:51.560> that<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:51.950> you<00:01:52.340> bring

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
you just basically take that a you bring

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.729 
you just basically take that a you bring
it<00:01:52.700> down<00:01:52.819> an<00:01:53.000> octave<00:01:53.119> to<00:01:53.420> this<00:01:53.569> a<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:54.140> then<00:01:54.590> you

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:54.739 
it down an octave to this a and then you

00:01:54.739 --> 00:02:01.300 
it down an octave to this a and then you
just<00:01:54.979> step<00:01:55.759> back<00:01:59.349> do<00:02:00.349> the<00:02:00.470> same<00:02:00.739> thing<00:02:01.039> it's<00:02:01.280> a

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
just step back do the same thing it's a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.910 
just step back do the same thing it's a
very<00:02:01.340> simple<00:02:01.879> pattern<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.479> then<00:02:03.080> again<00:02:03.440> just

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
very simple pattern and then again just

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:11.619 
very simple pattern and then again just
down<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:05.539> the<00:02:05.569> next<00:02:06.110> octave

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:14.020 

I'll<00:02:11.840> just<00:02:12.110> play<00:02:12.290> it<00:02:12.379> twice<00:02:12.530> here<00:02:13.040> just<00:02:13.340> so<00:02:13.550> so

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
I'll just play it twice here just so so

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.690 
I'll just play it twice here just so so
it's<00:02:14.209> even<00:02:14.599> but<00:02:14.959> you<00:02:15.560> don't<00:02:15.830> have<00:02:16.370> to<00:02:16.519> do<00:02:16.640> it

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
it's even but you don't have to do it

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.640 
it's even but you don't have to do it
there's<00:02:17.180> so<00:02:17.360> many<00:02:17.450> variations<00:02:17.870> you<00:02:18.470> don't

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
there's so many variations you don't

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.050 
there's so many variations you don't
have<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:18.890> play<00:02:19.099> the<00:02:19.250> whole<00:02:19.370> thing<00:02:19.670> you<00:02:19.879> can

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
have to play the whole thing you can

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:28.539 
have to play the whole thing you can
start<00:02:20.180> from<00:02:20.480> here<00:02:26.860> so<00:02:27.860> you<00:02:27.980> can<00:02:28.190> just<00:02:28.340> play

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
start from here so you can just play

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.970 
start from here so you can just play
around<00:02:28.670> with<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.150> it's<00:02:29.390> not<00:02:29.599> just<00:02:29.930> I'm<00:02:30.739> just

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
around with it it's not just I'm just

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.740 
around with it it's not just I'm just
showing<00:02:31.250> you<00:02:31.340> ideas<00:02:31.730> here<00:02:32.030> it's<00:02:32.540> not<00:02:32.720> a

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
showing you ideas here it's not a

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.390 
showing you ideas here it's not a
specific<00:02:33.019> lick<00:02:33.620> that<00:02:33.799> you<00:02:33.920> have<00:02:34.099> to<00:02:34.220> play

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
specific lick that you have to play

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.119 
specific lick that you have to play
exactly<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.910> same<00:02:35.180> but<00:02:36.170> what<00:02:36.379> I<00:02:36.410> was<00:02:36.650> doing<00:02:36.950> is

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
exactly the same but what I was doing is

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:45.880 
exactly the same but what I was doing is
basically<00:02:37.670> I<00:02:37.700> played

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.940 

just<00:02:46.610> hit<00:02:46.819> that<00:02:47.000> low<00:02:47.270> E<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:47.750> then<00:02:48.319> straight<00:02:48.920> to

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
just hit that low E and then straight to

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:55.120 
just hit that low E and then straight to
a<00:02:49.370> regular<00:02:49.880> ESS<00:02:50.690> 4<00:02:50.900> chord<00:02:53.590> so<00:02:54.590> here's<00:02:54.860> where<00:02:55.069> I

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
a regular ESS 4 chord so here's where I

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.380 
a regular ESS 4 chord so here's where I
like<00:02:55.459> using<00:02:55.819> these<00:02:56.090> ideas<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:57.440> sus<00:02:57.650> for<00:02:57.920> ideas

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
like using these ideas the sus for ideas

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.680 
like using these ideas the sus for ideas
I<00:02:59.390> feel<00:03:00.350> like<00:03:00.700> probably<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.850> most<00:03:02.060> overused

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
I feel like probably the most overused

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.580 
I feel like probably the most overused
cliché<00:03:03.590> in<00:03:03.830> heavy<00:03:04.130> Melo<00:03:04.430> is<00:03:05.320> going<00:03:06.320> from<00:03:06.440> the
