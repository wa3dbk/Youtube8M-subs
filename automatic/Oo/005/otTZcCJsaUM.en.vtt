00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.480 
so yeah I have a problem so need some
work

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.920 

he'd<00:00:25.060> say<00:00:25.090> let<00:00:25.630> me<00:00:25.690> get<00:00:25.810> over<00:00:25.840> here

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
he'd say let me get over here

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.710 
he'd say let me get over here
it's<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.650> new<00:00:28.860> water<00:00:29.130> pump<00:00:29.250> cover<00:00:29.640> term<00:00:30.450> so<00:00:30.570> our

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
it's a new water pump cover term so our

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.170 
it's a new water pump cover term so our
water<00:00:30.930> brightside<00:00:31.650> case<00:00:31.860> thing<00:00:32.340> that's<00:00:33.030> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
water brightside case thing that's the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.080 
water brightside case thing that's the
word<00:00:33.890> these<00:00:34.890> things<00:00:35.010> for<00:00:35.160> me<00:00:35.280> down<00:00:35.430> magnesium

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
word these things for me down magnesium

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.370 
word these things for me down magnesium
from<00:00:36.390> 85<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.900> about<00:00:37.650> eighty<00:00:37.890> nine<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.489> half

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:39.380 
from 85 to about eighty nine and a half

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.160 
from 85 to about eighty nine and a half
so<00:00:40.380> the<00:00:41.010> coolant<00:00:41.520> will<00:00:42.360> actually<00:00:42.989> write<00:00:43.140> out

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
so the coolant will actually write out

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.480 
so the coolant will actually write out
that<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.890> magnesium<00:00:44.280> as<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.000> can<00:00:45.120> see

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:46.490 
that that magnesium as you can see

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.510 
that that magnesium as you can see
so<00:00:47.090> simple<00:00:47.420> fix<00:00:47.720> for<00:00:47.810> that<00:00:47.930> is<00:00:48.320> just<00:00:48.560> buying<00:00:48.770> 85

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
so simple fix for that is just buying 85

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.990 
so simple fix for that is just buying 85
and<00:00:49.970> a<00:00:50.030> half<00:00:50.240> and<00:00:50.540> up<00:00:51.070> water<00:00:52.070> cover<00:00:52.610> thing

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
and a half and up water cover thing

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.780 
and a half and up water cover thing
right<00:00:53.330> side<00:00:53.500> case<00:00:54.500> and<00:00:55.100> everyone<00:00:55.400> referred<00:00:55.700> to

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
right side case and everyone referred to

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.250 
right side case and everyone referred to
it<00:00:55.880> as<00:00:56.560> needs<00:00:57.560> a<00:00:57.620> new<00:00:57.740> top<00:00:57.950> end<00:00:58.190> i<00:00:59.140> also<00:01:00.140> just

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
it as needs a new top end i also just

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.850 
it as needs a new top end i also just
some<00:01:00.650> aesthetic<00:01:01.220> stuff<00:01:02.440> so<00:01:03.440> you<00:01:03.530> got<00:01:03.680> a<00:01:03.710> nice

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
paddle tire this is a 5.3 by whatever

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.450 
paddle tire this is a 5.3 by whatever
that's<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.270> same<00:01:13.420> pattern<00:01:13.720> oh<00:01:13.930> no<00:01:14.920> I<00:01:15.100> get<00:01:15.340> I

fmf turbine core and the Power Core with
a<00:01:47.560> sparky<00:01:48.399> Cobra<00:01:48.819> sparkling

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.130 

let's<00:01:53.560> got<00:01:53.740> some<00:01:53.860> other<00:01:53.979> miscellaneous<00:01:54.550> parts

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
let's got some other miscellaneous parts

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.610 
let's got some other miscellaneous parts
fill<00:01:56.140> it<00:01:57.360> if<00:01:58.360> everyone<00:01:58.600> thought<00:01:58.870> gas<00:01:59.380> cap

00:01:59.610 --> 00:01:59.620 
fill it if everyone thought gas cap

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.090 
fill it if everyone thought gas cap
that's<00:01:59.860> the<00:02:00.100> word<00:02:00.690> spare<00:02:01.690> tank<00:02:01.930> number<00:02:02.770> plate

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
that's the word spare tank number plate

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.740 
that's the word spare tank number plate
tank

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.300 

so<00:02:06.290> you<00:02:06.380> can<00:02:06.530> pretty<00:02:06.650> much<00:02:06.710> assume<00:02:06.890> that<00:02:07.190> this

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
so you can pretty much assume that this

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.790 
so you can pretty much assume that this
was<00:02:07.520> used<00:02:07.730> primarily<00:02:08.000> for<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.479> dunes<00:02:09.550> so

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
was used primarily for the dunes so

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.840 
was used primarily for the dunes so
it<00:02:12.920> old<00:02:13.130> stuff

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.150 

but<00:02:17.450> uh<00:02:17.480> yeah<00:02:17.870> just<00:02:18.230> thought<00:02:18.320> I'd<00:02:18.440> make<00:02:18.560> a<00:02:18.590> make

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
but uh yeah just thought I'd make a make

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.830 
but uh yeah just thought I'd make a make
a<00:02:19.190> quick<00:02:19.460> video<00:02:19.640> showing<00:02:19.820> you<00:02:20.150> guys<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.420> new

a quick video showing you guys the new

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.140 
a quick video showing you guys the new
