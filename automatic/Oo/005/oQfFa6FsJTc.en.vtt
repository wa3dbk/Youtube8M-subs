00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
that what's good about being around kids

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.060 
that what's good about being around kids
is<00:04:34.120> to<00:04:34.360> hang<00:04:34.630> on<00:04:34.840> to<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.139> childlike<00:04:35.470> qualities

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
is to hang on to the childlike qualities

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:37.409 
is to hang on to the childlike qualities
because<00:04:36.220> they<00:04:36.400> have<00:04:36.550> a<00:04:36.580> lot<00:04:36.940> of<00:04:36.970> beautiful

because they have a lot of beautiful
qualities<00:04:37.840> I<00:04:37.960> think<00:04:38.169> if<00:04:38.260> you<00:04:38.350> let<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:38.680> sticky

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.850 
qualities I think if you let the sticky
part<00:04:39.250> go<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:39.789> and<00:04:40.539> follow<00:04:40.870> a<00:04:40.990> lot<00:04:41.260> more<00:04:41.590> of
