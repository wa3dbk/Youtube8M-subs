alright here's how to wire your own glow
plug<00:00:05.220> relay<00:00:05.960> if<00:00:06.960> you<00:00:07.140> have<00:00:07.350> one<00:00:07.649> of<00:00:07.770> those<00:00:08.120> in<00:00:09.120> a

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
plug relay if you have one of those in a

6.2<00:00:09.900> diesel<00:00:11.599> first<00:00:12.599> things<00:00:12.809> first<00:00:12.929> I'm<00:00:13.769> about

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
6.2 diesel first things first I'm about

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.140 
6.2 diesel first things first I'm about
to<00:00:14.130> pull<00:00:14.280> this<00:00:14.370> motor<00:00:14.610> because<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.969> motor

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
to pull this motor because the motor

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.210 
to pull this motor because the motor
blew<00:00:15.360> up<00:00:15.540> on<00:00:15.719> me<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:16.650> I<00:00:16.680> figured<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:17.010> might<00:00:17.039> as

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
blew up on me so I figured I might as

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.040 
blew up on me so I figured I might as
well<00:00:17.369> show<00:00:17.550> people<00:00:17.730> how<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:17.940> do<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.300> this

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
well show people how to do this this

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.179 
well show people how to do this this
wire<00:00:19.350> right<00:00:19.380> here<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:20.130> added<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.890> comes<00:00:22.890> over

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
wire right here I added this comes over

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.820 
wire right here I added this comes over
here<00:00:23.340> like<00:00:23.490> this<00:00:23.670> if<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.660> do<00:00:24.869> right<00:00:25.470> down<00:00:25.680> to

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
here like this if it to do right down to

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.080 
here like this if it to do right down to
here<00:00:27.080> this<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.340> starter<00:00:29.340> solenoid<00:00:29.609> switch

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090

460<00:00:35.370> something<00:00:35.670> like<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:37.340> this<00:00:38.340> terminal

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
460 something like that this terminal

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.799 
460 something like that this terminal
here<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.960> one<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.230> says<00:00:40.410> s<00:00:41.570> this<00:00:42.570> one

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
here is the one that says s this one

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.810 
here is the one that says s this one
hand<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.320> just<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.680> dead<00:00:43.860> wire<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.160> had<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.700> on

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
hand is just a dead wire I had it on

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.270 
hand is just a dead wire I had it on
there<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.210> was<00:00:45.270> doing<00:00:45.570> nothing<00:00:45.899> all<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:47.070> need

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
there it was doing nothing all you need

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.510 
there it was doing nothing all you need
to<00:00:47.370> use<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.210> one<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:48.510> says<00:00:48.719> s<00:00:49.430> what<00:00:50.430> you

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
to use is the one that says s what you

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.819 
to use is the one that says s what you
do<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.030> bring<00:00:51.180> your<00:00:51.239> power<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.870> here<00:00:52.199> to

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
do is you bring your power to here to

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.490 
do is you bring your power to here to
this<00:00:52.949> terminal<00:00:53.510> you<00:00:54.510> bring<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.870> wire<00:00:55.140> into

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
this terminal you bring this wire into

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.939 
this terminal you bring this wire into

from the factory are connected to on the
left-hand<00:01:23.800> side<00:01:24.040> there<00:01:24.340> you<00:01:24.580> see<00:01:25.330> my<00:01:25.480> wire<00:01:25.690> try

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
left-hand side there you see my wire try

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.310 
left-hand side there you see my wire try
to<00:01:26.020> get<00:01:26.200> close<00:01:26.550> there<00:01:27.550> it<00:01:27.670> is<00:01:27.790> right<00:01:27.940> there

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
to get close there it is right there

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.390 
to get close there it is right there
that's<00:01:29.320> it<00:01:29.470> now<00:01:29.620> if<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:29.770> don't<00:01:29.950> disconnect

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
that's it now if you don't disconnect

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.240 
that's it now if you don't disconnect
anything<00:01:31.140> then<00:01:32.140> what<00:01:32.260> will<00:01:32.350> happen<00:01:32.680> is<00:01:32.830> when

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
anything then what will happen is when

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.650 
anything then what will happen is when
you<00:01:33.370> throw<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.760> switch<00:01:33.880> in<00:01:34.120> the<00:01:34.180> cab<00:01:34.390> the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
you throw the switch in the cab the

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.870 
you throw the switch in the cab the
weight<00:01:34.870> light<00:01:35.140> will<00:01:35.380> come<00:01:35.530> on<00:01:35.710> even<00:01:36.700> if<00:01:36.790> the

weight light will come on even if the

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.090 
weight light will come on even if the
glow<00:01:37.030> plugs<00:01:37.330> cycled<00:01:37.750> normally<00:01:38.110> they'll<00:01:38.680> cycle

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
glow plugs cycled normally they'll cycle

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.270 
glow plugs cycled normally they'll cycle
normally<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.729> way<00:01:39.850> I<00:01:39.910> have<00:01:40.090> it<00:01:40.240> wired<00:01:40.420> now

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
normally the way I have it wired now

normally the way I have it wired now
that<00:01:42.280> right<00:01:42.490> there<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.860> a<00:01:45.160> 1<00:01:45.520> ohm<00:01:45.640> resistor

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
that right there is a a 1 ohm resistor

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.580 
that right there is a a 1 ohm resistor

whether<00:01:47.770> these<00:01:47.920> you<00:01:48.040> can<00:01:48.160> look<00:01:48.280> it<00:01:48.370> up<00:01:48.430> on<00:01:48.580> the

forums that lengthens your glow time to
about<00:01:53.170> 15<00:01:53.560> seconds<00:01:54.720> but<00:01:55.720> that<00:01:55.900> right<00:01:56.080> there

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
about 15 seconds but that right there

about 15 seconds but that right there
you<00:01:57.070> can<00:01:57.250> run<00:01:57.460> you<00:01:57.550> can<00:01:57.610> glow<00:01:57.880> this<00:01:58.119> thing<00:01:58.300> for

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
you can run you can glow this thing for

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.410 
you can run you can glow this thing for
an<00:01:58.540> hour<00:01:58.660> if<00:01:58.930> you<00:01:59.050> want<00:01:59.460> but<00:02:00.460> it<00:02:00.850> really<00:02:01.180> helps

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
an hour if you want but it really helps
