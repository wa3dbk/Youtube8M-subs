 and you 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.410
 how about friends talking here with another 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.719
 video review and this time I bring you nothing 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.629
 more and nothing less than the of dawn of 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.560
 extension transformers so is my 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.110
 Dear friends 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.970
 this figure comes to us courtesy of 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.700
 our good friend the goals that the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.010
 borrowed and unfortunately did not bring the 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.160
 weapon but good since the good the giles 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.039
 pacense indeed his youtube channel 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.579
 also the lou rawls reviews 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.260
 youtube.com of giles and this for 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.230
 see their videos that you have to 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.720
 offer a different style to the one 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.970
 are you used to and but the 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.160
 truth is that it works also 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.860
 go to the channel of my good friend rodrigo 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.260
 prime rodrÃ­guez prime tv and there they are going to 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.149
 see find ok I'm going to put the links 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.570
 down here but good my darlings 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.950
 friends here we see block down class 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.230
 deluxe that transforms into a 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:05.250
 lamborghini aventador 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.680
 I think that's the model, not me 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:13.500
 interesting enough to like 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.690
 to take it out to google it but good 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.390
 you the truth the auto mode is very 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.240
 pretty whatever of each one a very 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.180
 very nice, although something simple after 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.310
 lamborghini this although he has been involved 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.630
 is licensed then if it is a 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.150
 lamborghini aventador is not one is not 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.630
 made to look like it's the auto model 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.080
 they put the bloc here as a symbol 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.890
 decepticon is not a decepticon I like 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:47.369
 that has orange here on the wheels 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:50.910
 like the self of the movie 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:53.640
 very beautiful now the transformation is 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.280
 based on road booster engineering 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.560
 of transformers dark of the moon 'is not 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.750
 the same mold just that with another 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.380
 shell 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:07.250
 it's not very engineering based it 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:10.570
 it's half loose but it does not matter 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.550
 cannon would go back here if I had it 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.700
 then we see that I'm with the cannon but 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.410
 good to transform what we're going to 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.870
 do is we 're going to separate these 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.200
 pieces from here back and we're going to 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:29.270
 collapse on the sides of the vehicle 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.010
 in this way ok now these sides of the 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.650
 vehicle are on the small poles 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.640
 here and here and what we are going to do is 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.640
 separate them 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:44.330
 and extend them in this way ok this we 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.040
 will allow to raise all the 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.160
 assembly of the legs that are 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.520
 stuck almost like road booster 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:55.280
 This way roadsters to tie to thani 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.120
 7 ok and what we're going to do is we're going 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.240
 to take these pieces of the lights 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.510
 front and we're going to separate them and go 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.240
 to do all this backwards from this 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.970
 way and we're going to take this hinge that 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.470
 it's on a rotator, we're going to rotate it 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.130
 this form 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.110
 so and if you notice here you have a 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.120
 small post 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:23.030
 in the translucent plastic that goes to 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.510
 skewer here let's skewer what of 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.710
 this form here has a tab that goes 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.710
 to enter here 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.330
 but first what we are going to do is that 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.299
 we are going to build all this assembly of 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:40.180
 the hinge here that collapses in the 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:44.110
 back of lamborghini we are going to 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:47.980
 put this the parts that the 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:52.580
 chest as much as we can as well as for 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:57.300
 make it thinner and we're going to 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:59.200
 connect it here is what would be the audible 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.940
 click 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:06.430
 ok let's rotate the head there is 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.319
 let's take the arms down to 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.180
 that are in proportion to oneself 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.569
 let's take this let's throw it towards 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.940
 we do now opposite side will 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:19.630
 take this panel and turn it towards 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:22.350
 in front we are going to separate the legs of 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.660
 this form and rotate them towards the front 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.200
 that are looking towards us we are going to 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.920
 pull apart 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:35.570
 the feet stop and there are my dear ones 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:38.470
 friends achieves a blog of transformers and 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.080
 extension 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:44.240
 evil bounty hunter what 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.509
 he made his luck at optimus prime 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:51.949
 during the movie there we have it 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:54.710
 dear friends in all their glory and something 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:58.159
 What we can see is that the truth is that 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.770
 is small this lock is very small 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:03.669
 down 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.379
 and I did not want to believe the rumors 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:09.099
 but it 's very small here we have a 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:13.800
 figure to compare it with a convoy 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:13.800
 networks here is with silver volts 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:20.190
 with all the box true but you are 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:27.110
 small is a deluxe is very small 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:27.110
 the truth to see with this that is skydive 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.420
 another de luxe to compose words 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:42.719
 been more or less proportionally 

00:05:38.549 --> 00:05:44.939
 same but skydive like he has a 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:49.559
 little bit more than engineering has a 

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:51.929
 little bit more of involved parties and 

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:55.069
 Well yes we already know the chemical of the canyon 

00:05:51.929 --> 00:05:59.879
 here I am going to put a photo there is to the side 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:06:03.749
 see it is what you do with the cannon 

00:05:59.879 --> 00:06:07.429
 puts on the head and here is that 

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:11.849
 result like the cannon he uses to 

00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:14.669
 to be shot to ratchet and optimus prime 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:20.189
 in the movie because the truth is that 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:22.049
 Well, it's a pretty figure, I tell myself that 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:24.599
 this is the best thing they could do to him 

00:06:22.049 --> 00:06:27.839
 the main villain of the movie that 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:30.059
 veneer the truth and you already know my 

00:06:27.839 --> 00:06:33.150
 feelings about them extension has 

00:06:30.059 --> 00:06:35.160
 good detail molded the truth but 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.820
 well, it's not the best 

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:40.800
 representation of the lock down but if it is 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.450
 rather it is the best representation of 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.000
 lock down of the movie and that's 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:46.920
 quite sad and post has good 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.220
 possibility until that your arms rotate 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:52.320
 360 degrees your elbows flex you can 

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:57.720
 turn sideways but can not see 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:07:01.110
 the 360 degrees their their legs are 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:04.230
 flex your knees have rotation 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:09.240
 here in the east 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:11.880
 in the ankles his head rotates 360 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.689
 degrees and that's all the truth is that there 

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:18.289
 There is a lot to be said for this figure 

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:22.159
 it's quite the truth if you 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:24.860
 they want a lock down as well as it was 

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:27.199
 is the principle of the concept was born in 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.999
 become animated I recommend them 

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:32.100
 much more the figure of transformers 

00:07:28.999 --> 00:07:34.680
 animated because just as it is 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.930
 they do not miss anything, this one arrived 

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:40.050
 in very limited amounts to Mexico 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.880
 thanks to the Soria stores and the 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.740
 I truly believe that those who did not reach it 

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.350
 well, they did not miss absolutely 

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.910
 nothing my dear friends is very very 

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:51.780
 small compared to the others 

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:54.180
 figures and like he has nothing of 

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:57.660
 you joke the truth at least to me what 

00:07:54.180 --> 00:08:00.750
 it seems but who am I to 

00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.770
 say yes and no good to them 

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.590
 I want friends 

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:07.290
 talk too much I'm skillful jr this is 

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:11.480
 lockdown of transformers and extension 

00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:11.480
 deluxe class and we said goodbye
