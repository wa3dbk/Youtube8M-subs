parents<00:00:24.510> should<00:00:24.660> get<00:00:24.750> more<00:00:24.990> up-to-date<00:00:25.320> or

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
parents should get more up-to-date or

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.990 
parents should get more up-to-date or
they<00:00:26.010> should<00:00:26.189> step<00:00:26.550> back<00:00:26.760> from<00:00:26.910> the

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
they should step back from the

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.250 
they should step back from the
technology<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:27.720> after<00:00:27.990> their<00:00:28.109> kids

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
technology and just after their kids

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.339 
technology and just after their kids
well<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.369> think<00:00:29.490> that<00:00:29.849> parents<00:00:30.599> need<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.140> keep

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
well I think that parents need to keep

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.459 
well I think that parents need to keep
up<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.830> date<00:00:32.070> but<00:00:32.850> by<00:00:33.510> communicating<00:00:34.440> with

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
up to date but by communicating with

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.380 
up to date but by communicating with
their<00:00:34.770> kids<00:00:35.180> so<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.420> think<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:37.370> they<00:00:38.370> are<00:00:39.239> not

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
their kids so I think that they are not

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.940 
their kids so I think that they are not
very<00:00:39.750> familiar<00:00:39.960> with<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.410> Internet<00:00:40.739> maybe

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
very familiar with the Internet maybe

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.650 
very familiar with the Internet maybe
they<00:00:41.160> need<00:00:41.340> a<00:00:41.370> tourist<00:00:41.790> guide<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.239> show<00:00:42.420> them

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
they need a tourist guide to show them

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.660 
they need a tourist guide to show them
what<00:00:42.840> all<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.170> new<00:00:43.350> world<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.710> about<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.129> in

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
what all this new world is about and in

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.250 
what all this new world is about and in
some<00:00:44.850> cases<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.300> kids<00:00:45.480> can<00:00:45.660> play<00:00:45.750> this<00:00:45.960> role

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
some cases the kids can play this role

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.430 
some cases the kids can play this role
and<00:00:46.500> probably<00:00:47.489> snooping<00:00:48.000> up<00:00:48.200> behind<00:00:49.200> their

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
and probably snooping up behind their

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.369 
and probably snooping up behind their
kids<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:50.239> for<00:00:51.239> me<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.660> kind<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.020> last<00:00:52.230> resort

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
kids is for me a kind of last resort

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.869 
kids is for me a kind of last resort
thing<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.920> do<00:00:53.010> when<00:00:53.160> communication<00:00:53.789> has

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
thing to do when communication has

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.510 
thing to do when communication has
broken<00:00:54.090> down<00:00:54.239> but<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.020> guess<00:00:55.260> kids<00:00:55.530> throughout

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
broken down but I guess kids throughout

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.130 
broken down but I guess kids throughout
the<00:00:56.670> generations<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.449> always<00:00:57.719> needed

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the generations that have always needed

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.750 
the generations that have always needed
to<00:00:58.230> keep<00:00:58.350> secrets<00:00:58.890> from<00:00:58.980> their<00:00:59.190> parents<00:00:59.670> and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
to keep secrets from their parents and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.490 
to keep secrets from their parents and
the<00:00:59.850> idea<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.600> they<00:01:00.719> might<00:01:00.750> guide<00:01:01.170> them

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
the idea that they might guide them

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.470 
the idea that they might guide them
willingly<00:01:01.890> through<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.460> web<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.879> slightly

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
willingly through the web is slightly

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.590 
willingly through the web is slightly
unrealistic<00:01:03.840> isn't<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.439> well<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:05.729> think<00:01:06.479> there

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
unrealistic isn't it well I think there

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.630 
unrealistic isn't it well I think there
two<00:01:06.720> things<00:01:06.930> there's<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.500> world<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.040> world

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
two things there's the world the world

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.460 
two things there's the world the world
of<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> web<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.360> then<00:01:09.810> there's<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.110> keeping

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
of the web and then there's a keeping

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.429 
of the web and then there's a keeping
secrets<00:01:10.830> parts<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:12.060> obviously<00:01:12.720> as<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.290> say

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
secrets parts so obviously as you say

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.050 
secrets parts so obviously as you say
kids<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.920> always<00:01:14.070> kept<00:01:14.369> secrets<00:01:14.729> from<00:01:14.850> their

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
kids have always kept secrets from their

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.520 
kids have always kept secrets from their
parents<00:01:15.420> they<00:01:15.479> almost<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.900> they<00:01:16.140> have<00:01:16.500> a

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
parents they almost have they have a

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.789 
parents they almost have they have a
right<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.040> certain<00:01:17.280> amount<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.580> privacy<00:01:17.820> but

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
right to a certain amount of privacy but

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.530 
right to a certain amount of privacy but
maybe<00:01:19.799> there<00:01:20.280> are<00:01:20.400> places<00:01:20.610> on<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.939> Internet

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
maybe there are places on the Internet

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.410 
maybe there are places on the Internet
which<00:01:21.720> are<00:01:21.900> not<00:01:22.020> private<00:01:22.799> for<00:01:23.280> example<00:01:23.670> kids

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
which are not private for example kids

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.630 
which are not private for example kids
often<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.020> blogs<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.560> public<00:01:26.070> spaces<00:01:26.310> not

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
often have blogs in public spaces not

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.640 
often have blogs in public spaces not
necessarily<00:01:27.210> on<00:01:27.330> Facebook<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:27.960> they<00:01:28.470> don't

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
necessarily on Facebook and they don't

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.700 
necessarily on Facebook and they don't
realize<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.979> it's<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.549> public<00:01:29.820> space<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.710> in

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
realize that it's a public space so in

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.760 
realize that it's a public space so in
that<00:01:32.220> case<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.850> think<00:01:32.939> it's<00:01:33.270> normal<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.770> they

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
that case I think it's normal that they

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.109 
that case I think it's normal that they
should<00:01:34.979> be<00:01:35.130> aware<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.369> their<00:01:35.640> parents<00:01:35.970> can

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
should be aware that their parents can

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.080 
should be aware that their parents can
come<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.420> visit<00:01:36.479> these<00:01:36.840> what<00:01:37.590> about<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.579> sort

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
come and visit these what about the sort

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.670 
come and visit these what about the sort
of<00:01:39.119> natural<00:01:39.420> response<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.869> parents<00:01:40.320> would<00:01:40.650> be

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
of natural response of parents would be

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.859 
of natural response of parents would be
to<00:01:40.950> sort<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.159> block<00:01:41.430> certain<00:01:42.060> sites<00:01:42.360> or<00:01:42.659> try

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
to sort of block certain sites or try

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.780 
to sort of block certain sites or try
and<00:01:42.930> stop<00:01:43.290> their<00:01:43.770> children<00:01:43.799> from<00:01:44.159> entering<00:01:44.579> I

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
and stop their children from entering I

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.749 
and stop their children from entering I
mean<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.060> this<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.479> realistic<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.799> be<00:01:46.950> worth<00:01:47.490> it

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
mean is this a realistic and be worth it

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.330 
mean is this a realistic and be worth it
well<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.689> think<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.290> things<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:49.829> filters

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
well I think that things like filters

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.520 
well I think that things like filters
prevent<00:01:50.880> accidents<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.079> will<00:01:52.229> prevent

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
prevent accidents so it will prevent

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.260 
prevent accidents so it will prevent
your<00:01:52.740> eight-year-old<00:01:53.310> from<00:01:53.729> stumbling<00:01:54.090> upon

your eight-year-old from stumbling upon

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.270 
your eight-year-old from stumbling upon
a<00:01:54.420> porn<00:01:54.659> site<00:01:54.899> when<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.200> hadn't<00:01:55.710> intended

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
a porn site when you hadn't intended

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.420 
a porn site when you hadn't intended

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
when he hadn't intended to that was not

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.700 
when he hadn't intended to that was not
going<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.670> stop<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.000> teenager<00:02:00.509> who<00:02:00.840> has<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.560> was
