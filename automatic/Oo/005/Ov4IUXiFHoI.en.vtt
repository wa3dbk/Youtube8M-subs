dollars<00:02:35.610> per<00:02:36.610> bundle<00:02:36.820> plus<00:02:37.810> X<00:02:39.540> but<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:41.200> is<00:02:41.740> just

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
dollars per bundle plus X but it is just

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.940

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:56.100 
paying a wonderful price for this hair I
think<00:02:50.320> i<00:02:50.380> probably<00:02:50.530> paid<00:02:50.709> 65<00:02:51.459> for<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.870> i<00:02:55.110> think

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
think i probably paid 65 for the i think

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.840

it<00:02:56.200> was<00:02:56.260> like<00:02:56.320> 65<00:02:57.010> for<00:02:57.459> the<00:02:57.580> 20<00:02:58.239> inch<00:02:58.390> and<00:02:59.850> 55

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
it was like 65 for the 20 inch and 55

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.100 
it was like 65 for the 20 inch and 55
for<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:02.800> 18<00:03:03.340> or<00:03:03.550> 60<00:03:03.940> for<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.150> 80<00:03:04.330> 90<00:03:04.810> something

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
for the 18 or 60 for the 80 90 something

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.710 
for the 18 or 60 for the 80 90 something
like<00:03:05.350> that<00:03:05.530> but<00:03:06.190> it's<00:03:06.880> really<00:03:07.270> good<00:03:07.450> for<00:03:07.570> two

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
like that but it's really good for two

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.380

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
was like my go-to thing or what I have a

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.150 
was like my go-to thing or what I have a
picture<00:03:44.769> of<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:45.010> other<00:03:46.110> picture<00:03:47.110> when<00:03:47.350> I<00:03:47.380> saw

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
picture of the other picture when I saw

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.280 
picture of the other picture when I saw
it<00:03:50.160> on<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.220> week<00:03:51.580> at<00:03:51.880> it<00:03:52.150> was<00:03:52.660> much<00:03:52.959> thicker

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
it on the week at it was much thicker

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.060 
it on the week at it was much thicker
back<00:03:53.590> then<00:03:53.860> because<00:03:54.690> I<00:03:55.690> was<00:03:56.380> a<00:03:56.440> simple<00:03:56.830> fact

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
back then because I was a simple fact

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.949 
back then because I was a simple fact
that<00:03:57.250> I<00:03:57.700> had<00:03:57.940> burst<00:03:58.120> out<00:03:58.360> the<00:03:58.450> hair<00:03:58.630> of<00:03:58.660> course

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
that I had burst out the hair of course

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.070 
that I had burst out the hair of course
they<00:03:59.140> had<00:03:59.350> stand<00:03:59.680> out<00:03:59.890> a<00:03:59.920> little<00:04:00.130> bit<00:04:00.370> but<00:04:01.209> this

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:02.080 
they had stand out a little bit but this

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.770 
they had stand out a little bit but this
where<00:04:02.350> does<00:04:02.680> um<00:04:03.540> this<00:04:04.540> hair<00:04:04.959> doesn't

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
where does um this hair doesn't

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.690 
where does um this hair doesn't
maybe<00:04:07.780> a<00:04:07.900> little<00:04:07.989> bit<00:04:08.470> just<00:04:08.950> a<00:04:09.040> little<00:04:09.100> bit<00:04:09.340> but

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
maybe a little bit just a little bit but

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.190 
maybe a little bit just a little bit but
that's<00:04:09.790> because<00:04:10.030> I<00:04:10.269> cut<00:04:10.510> the<00:04:10.600> trick<00:04:10.870> when<00:04:11.170> i

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
that's because I cut the trick when i

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.009 
that's because I cut the trick when i
sold<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:11.650> in<00:04:11.799> this<00:04:12.010> time<00:04:12.360> first<00:04:13.360> time<00:04:13.600> I<00:04:13.750> used

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
sold it in this time first time I used

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.289 
sold it in this time first time I used
it<00:04:14.260> I<00:04:14.320> didn't<00:04:14.799> cut<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.340> whip<00:04:15.579> that<00:04:15.760> I<00:04:15.820> just

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
it I didn't cut the whip that I just

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.890 
it I didn't cut the whip that I just
kept<00:04:16.750> going<00:04:18.900> it<00:04:19.900> has<00:04:20.290> a<00:04:20.590> natural<00:04:21.599> luster<00:04:22.599> to<00:04:22.630> it

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
kept going it has a natural luster to it

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.440 
kept going it has a natural luster to it
which<00:04:23.860> I<00:04:24.010> really<00:04:24.220> like<00:04:24.430> but<00:04:24.580> it's<00:04:24.760> not

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
which I really like but it's not

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.110

shiny<00:04:25.870> and<00:04:26.260> too<00:04:26.560> silky<00:04:27.130> so<00:04:27.370> that<00:04:27.550> it<00:04:27.910> doesn't

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
shiny and too silky so that it doesn't

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.490 
shiny and too silky so that it doesn't
match<00:04:28.450> the<00:04:28.690> texture<00:04:29.140> of<00:04:29.320> my<00:04:29.980> natural<00:04:30.220> hair<00:04:30.670> um
