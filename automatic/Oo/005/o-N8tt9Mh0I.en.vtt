00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.660
 let's prepare a recipe that are about 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.970
 muffins and muffins that can be 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.970
 sweet and salty at the same time 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:23.400
 we need to do the 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:30.330
 base flour gluten-free chemical yeast 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.330
 butter egg sugar oil and milk 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:36.690
 this is the base we will add cookies 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:40.270
 of chocolate and cream also without gluten 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.250
 Sobrasada cocoa powder until 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.660
 black olives and red berries 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.660
 raspberries and blueberries 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:53.500
 that we put the gluten-free flour 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.500
 yeast chemistry 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:00.060
 butter and sugar 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.060
 the egg 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.059
 sunflower oil 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.960
 the milk 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.000
 we take 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.050
 the túrmix 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.610
 must be left 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:21.820
 a homogenous mass and now what we're going 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.180
 to do is going to be separated into four 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.180
 parts 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.850
 we are not going to stain anymore we have the 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.470
 cocoa 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.330
 the olives 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.010
 the sobrasada that we take the gut 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:41.940
 important when buying 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:45.360
 sobrasada that is gluten free ask for it 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.650
 fight putero and sobrasadas without gluten and 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.650
 the red fruits 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:58.570
 we break them we already have the four masses 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:01.080
 each one with a flavor we fill the 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.080
 pastry bag 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.810
 the easy ones are no longer clean 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.810
 dirty moss 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.819
 we cut 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.819
 to fill 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.790
 of chocolate 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.720
 it's not exactly finished 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.680
 to the olives 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.290
 Y 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.290
 those of sobrasada 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.170
 to know that they are salty is a bit of 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:57.610
 japanese sea ​​salt 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:00.250
 and what I like most is therefore 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.760
 break chocolate and cream cookies 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.599
 and put them on top of the muffins 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.599
 chocolate 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.670
 in the oven will be the big seven 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.670
 minutes 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.480
 we will take out the small cupcakes 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.250
 small muffins because the big ones still 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.250
 they have a little left 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.800
 how will we know if they are clicking with 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.160
 a stick and that the party comes out 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.160
 cleansed 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:41.660
 that now what we will do is carefully 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.660
 take out the hoops 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.770
 I do not like to leave the well-known 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.200
 because if not what happens is that they are left 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.170
 that are left dry I do not prefer that 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.470
 they have juicy juicy from within and 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.470
 we have 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.360
 the muffins 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.360
 of 4 flavors
