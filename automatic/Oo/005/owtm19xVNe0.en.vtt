00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.120
 DVD review with another trailer 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.500
 check or more precisely a remake of 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.240
 1 to 3, I actually 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.950
 already made one but now is a new one 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.410
 trailer for a few hours from the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.490
 other looks at the story and raises 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.490
 Let's take a look at it now 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:25.970
 i am toni star cool stuff has one 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.850
 great girlfriend and every now and then would have 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:35.050
 me the world 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:37.680
 so why can not i sleep them 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.090
 have only chosen me for a reason 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.540
 that this country is at any price 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.540
 defend 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.750
 the man has to be stopped 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.810
 they do not know who I am 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.630
 they will never see me coming 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.960
 what are they cited against this 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.960
 company to be the whole world witness 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.430
 the question is where does tony stay strong the 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.840
 Things have changed, I have to change that 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.740
 protect without ever living 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.740
 could be important to me 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:28.040
 today 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:28.040
 the first day of the rest of your life 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.210
 I present you with the choice 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.680
 Do you want a meaningless life? 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.680
 a meaningful dead 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:01.270
 you are not a human 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.270
 just a madman 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.939
 I'm not afraid of him 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.939
 this is not about politics 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.060
 but simply the good old revenge 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.730
 we could use reinforcement then 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.730
 is also what 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.150
 are my boys 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.710
 ironman as later the third part is 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.450
 one of my top 5 kinostarts this 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.480
 year the concorde film fall from the 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.100
 first may 2013 in german cinemas 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.140
 brings and i love ironman i love 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.760
 robert downey junior as tony strong as 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.320
 arrogant billionaire by the way still 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.570
 a scientist tournament and the 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.310
 world rescues part one was terrific part 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.260
 2 was still cool and part three 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.240
 complete trailer really great 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.710
 had fun with the first trailer knew 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.330
 you do not really care about what's going on 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:03.350
 There had to be tonigs days 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.910
 somehow confused after all that 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.160
 which he did together with thor 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.050
 Captain America and Hulk and the Shiit 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.280
 had to experience organization in New York 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.050
 but you did not really know what 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.640
 lies and you have seen that serbia 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.900
 Pebble played the villain you could 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.000
 just suppose it maybe in the 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.740
 Mandarin is now in the trailer 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.600
 it is said several times it is clear 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.700
 The Tangerine Tony is going strong 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.350
 somehow between the rescue of the world 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.730
 he usually always cool by the way 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.590
 done as at the beginning of the trailer 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.450
 tells or just the woman at his 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.220
 page pepper potts have to decide 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.330
 or at least he says that himself and 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.080
 I am also a little bit at the point that 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.910
 I ask myself 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.200
 hey part 3 it would not be time 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.850
 that maybe an important figure 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.410
 it dies is a bit presumptuous 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.370
 pepper potts might believe it 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.480
 what do you think 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.860
 Write me in any case in the 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.900
 Comments on the spot I hold it 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.470
 not unlikely but 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.450
 curious; excited 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.860
 otherwise tony has him a whole strong 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.750
 another motive is not only possible 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.360
 somehow to do the right thing 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.460
 very cool it's about revenge and that 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.650
 could be really great fun to do so 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.720
 don cheadle here in ironman america 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.670
 This is not a cool costume 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.140
 and prepared to serve his country and 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:05.390
 the presidents to save the world 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.130
 and most of all, I think that's cool 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.660
 the showdown offers and trailer 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.720
 in the last 23 seconds you can see 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.160
 just a mouse a human from 20 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.450
 30 pieces apparently like robots 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.580
 remote controlled are also still 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.290
 different modes have run so 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.270
 has an easy through a wall us 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.010
 very robust look so there it is 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:23.840
 many different new ironman 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.520
 models apparently I'm curious 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.500
 I'm really looking forward to the start 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.210
 first mai'm definitely going there 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.980
 which also in the cinema that makes the question 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.450
 you and where will the movie maybe 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.040
 go and I'm wondering at the moment three 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.129
 only slightly as cool as the 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:36.959
 trailer is suspect 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.879
 How cabbage will then please avengers two 

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:40.889
 I'm really excited and I think 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:42.989
 the poster I want to say megageil 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.979
 ok friends it was with me now 

00:04:42.989 --> 00:04:45.719

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.309
