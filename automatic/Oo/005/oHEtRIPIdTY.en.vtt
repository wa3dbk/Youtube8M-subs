another five weird about one and a half
times<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:30.480> recommended<00:02:30.980> distance<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.790> we

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
times the recommended distance and we

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:40.550 
times the recommended distance and we
start<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.300> see<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.480> glitch<00:02:33.750> there<00:02:39.170> this<00:02:40.170> is<00:02:40.350> the

came back with a clean bill help from
them<00:03:20.400> so<00:03:20.760> if<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.989> is<00:03:22.200> known<00:03:22.410> good<00:03:22.739> equipment

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
them so if it is known good equipment

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.820 
them so if it is known good equipment
but<00:03:23.880> as<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.570> can<00:03:24.660> see<00:03:24.840> in<00:03:24.959> the<00:03:25.050> previous<00:03:25.260> shots

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
but as you can see in the previous shots

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.820 
but as you can see in the previous shots
there's<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.760> huge<00:03:27.330> performance<00:03:28.320> difference

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
there's a huge performance difference

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.090 
there's a huge performance difference
between<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.190> 7060<00:03:30.180> 200<00:03:30.600> in<00:03:30.750> fact<00:03:31.440> I<00:03:31.800> was<00:03:31.890> Bill

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
between the 7060 200 in fact I was Bill

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.580 
between the 7060 200 in fact I was Bill
go<00:03:32.430> as<00:03:32.489> far<00:03:32.700> as<00:03:32.730> to<00:03:32.850> say<00:03:33.090> as<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.330> 6200<00:03:33.750> is<00:03:34.170> is

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
go as far as to say as the 6200 is is

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.580 
go as far as to say as the 6200 is is
almost<00:03:34.800> unsafe<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:36.390> battery<00:03:36.720> using<00:03:37.080> this<00:03:37.200> was

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
almost unsafe the battery using this was

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.130 
almost unsafe the battery using this was
an<00:03:37.739> 1100<00:03:38.250> milliamp<00:03:38.640> spectrum<00:03:39.300> for<00:03:39.930> colonial
