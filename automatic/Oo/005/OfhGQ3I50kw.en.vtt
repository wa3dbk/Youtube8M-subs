 In this tutorial I will show you how to have the Nintendo's lurator in 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.549
 your psp 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:14.369
 very famous for successes like mario bros 1 2 and 3 mortal double kombat graduate the 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:15.649
 pce tera 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:19.089
 for this they will first need the emulator and game thefts 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.980
 here I leave the emulator in the description 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.800
 If the video is being viewed from the website, go to the section 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.310
 downloads and there you will find 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.489
 the name of the emulator is nester j the robberies it's your turn to look for them 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.770
 they look for them with the name of browns for mester j do not forget that to be able 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.480
 do this need to have your psp pirated or has it been 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.810
 once they have it, we are going to unzip the walter file 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.280
 drag that folder to the desktop 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.960
 there they open it and inside they will see a folder called nester j now connect 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.050

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.860
 open the folder called psp 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.360
 and there to create a folder with the name of there I feel 50 in capital letters 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.590
 some will already have it so it will not be necessary to create the 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.470
 now there will be in the incense folder 50 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.640

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.220

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.930
 there you will see a folder called roux 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.450
 there they will introduce their thefts of month 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.730
 now disconnect the psp and open the emulator from pspv 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.950
