00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.189
 I really like this flower because it was the one that 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:27.340

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.019

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:35.590

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:37.660
 truly enduring and good then 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:42.040

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.470

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:10.850

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:17.540
 some wonderful papers that you find 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.820

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.100
 to do is in the plastic bag we are going 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.190
 to put the pot there is so that 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.590
 hurt our 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.230

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.600

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:38.140
 little bit more of the laminar amaryllis and liz 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.590
 is a plant of Brazilian origin and 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.080
 Argentina is a bulb plant that is 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.120
 gives its flowering the bloom of 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:50.800
 amarilis more or less can last about 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:55.020
 two to four months usually gives between 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:59.910
 three and five flowers and you can have it in 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.910
 inside the house or in full sun 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.730
 here what I did was put the papers 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.850
 We put the china paper first in 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:21.170
 cross the plain paper and then over it 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.170
 we made the color paper 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:29.740
 and below we have the plastic bag 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.860
 so that when you can follow 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.170
 watering even though he has the role and 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.260
 Now, well , you know, the queen of 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.880

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.880
 laths because it's not true 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.190
 I had forgotten to tell you 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.420
 ask around here or yale why you 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.270

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.660
 thanks thanks 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.300
 we put this stick because 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.640
 as the flowers grow, the 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.950
 flowers are going this one is barely half 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.650
 open is going to open quite like a 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:12.530
 so much more and obviously all are going 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.650
 to be opening so more then the stem 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.230
 it's going to weigh a lot and we need it to be 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.209
 hold then that's why we have the 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.310
 stick that is up to the bottom so that 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:26.120

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.060
