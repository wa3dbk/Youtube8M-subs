hello dear music store television

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.339 
hello dear music store television
spectators<00:00:09.150> were<00:00:09.300> here<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.690> big<00:00:09.900> booth<00:00:10.110> of

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
spectators were here the big booth of

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.150 
spectators were here the big booth of
Vox<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.219> I'm<00:00:12.000> very<00:00:12.269> happy<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:12.950> David<00:00:13.950> will

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
Vox and I'm very happy that David will

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.890 
Vox and I'm very happy that David will
show<00:00:14.190> us<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.790> new<00:00:15.170> dynamic<00:00:16.170> looper<00:00:17.300> yeah<00:00:18.300> yeah

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
show us the new dynamic looper yeah yeah

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.400 
show us the new dynamic looper yeah yeah
so<00:00:19.500> what's<00:00:20.160> what's<00:00:20.460> new<00:00:21.000> there<00:00:21.330> but<00:00:22.109> this<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.289> a

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
so what's what's new there but this is a

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.870 
so what's what's new there but this is a
totally<00:00:22.710> new<00:00:22.859> concept<00:00:23.070> in<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.519> performance

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
totally new concept in a performance

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.509 
totally new concept in a performance
device<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.689> blintz<00:00:25.170> effects<00:00:25.590> processing<00:00:26.099> with

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
device it blintz effects processing with

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.060 
device it blintz effects processing with
a<00:00:26.550> looper<00:00:26.939> all<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.570> nice<00:00:27.869> compact<00:00:28.320> foot

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
a looper all in a nice compact foot

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.490 
a looper all in a nice compact foot
controller<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:30.300> there's<00:00:30.720> two<00:00:30.929> independent

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
controller and there's two independent

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.440 
controller and there's two independent
effects<00:00:31.769> processors<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.730> pre<00:00:32.940> effects<00:00:33.270> will

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
effects processors the pre effects will

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.049 
effects processors the pre effects will
affect<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.200> actual<00:00:34.380> input<00:00:34.860> signal<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.700> then

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
affect the actual input signal and then

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.520 
affect the actual input signal and then
the<00:00:36.210> loop<00:00:36.390> effects<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.899> can<00:00:36.989> apply<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.350> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
the loop effects you can apply to the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.440 
the loop effects you can apply to the
loops<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.100> already<00:00:38.280> make<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.879> then<00:00:39.329> you

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
loops that you already make and then you

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.750 
loops that you already make and then you
can<00:00:39.600> resample<00:00:40.200> those<00:00:40.379> loops<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.219> you<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:41.550> all

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
can resample those loops so you have all

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.049 
can resample those loops so you have all
kinds<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:42.120> creative<00:00:42.390> possibilities<00:00:43.290> okay<00:00:44.059> now

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
kinds of creative possibilities okay now

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.910 
kinds of creative possibilities okay now
there's<00:00:45.239> two<00:00:45.450> loops<00:00:45.780> they<00:00:46.469> can<00:00:46.620> be<00:00:46.710> used

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
there's two loops they can be used

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.569 
there's two loops they can be used
independently<00:00:47.309> or<00:00:47.960> simultaneously<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.579> you

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
independently or simultaneously and you

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.220 
independently or simultaneously and you
can<00:00:50.730> overdub<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.449> each<00:00:51.629> one<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:51.899> these<00:00:52.020> loops

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
can overdub on each one of these loops

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.439 
can overdub on each one of these loops
as<00:00:52.440> many<00:00:52.770> times<00:00:53.039> as<00:00:53.219> you'd<00:00:53.370> like<00:00:53.430> there's<00:00:54.360> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
as many times as you'd like there's a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.350 
as many times as you'd like there's a
built-in<00:00:55.199> tap<00:00:55.890> tempo<00:00:56.129> metronome<00:00:56.820> with

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
built-in tap tempo metronome with

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.619 
built-in tap tempo metronome with
adjustable<00:00:58.109> time<00:00:58.710> signatures<00:00:59.250> and

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
adjustable time signatures and

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.540 
adjustable time signatures and
adjustable<00:01:00.629> levels<00:01:00.960> as<00:01:01.170> well<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:02.309> course

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
adjustable levels as well and of course

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.340 
adjustable levels as well and of course
it<00:01:02.699> has<00:01:02.820> quantizing<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.690> your<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.260> out

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
it has quantizing so your in and out

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.890 
it has quantizing so your in and out
points<00:01:04.409> will<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:04.949> very<00:01:05.250> smooth<00:01:05.610> how<00:01:06.240> does<00:01:06.570> that

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
points will be very smooth how does that

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.219 
points will be very smooth how does that
sound<00:01:07.790> it<00:01:08.790> sounds<00:01:09.119> very<00:01:09.270> very<00:01:09.390> nice<00:01:09.689> maybe<00:01:10.080> I

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
sound it sounds very very nice maybe I

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.200 
sound it sounds very very nice maybe I
can<00:01:10.439> give<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.680> an<00:01:10.740> example<00:01:11.130> that's<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.850> okay

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
can give you an example that's it okay

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.030 
can give you an example that's it okay
then<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.780> example<00:01:13.350> right<00:01:13.500> over<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:13.860> once

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
then this example right over here once

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.620 
then this example right over here once
we<00:01:14.159> get<00:01:14.280> started<00:01:14.820> I'll<00:01:15.060> try<00:01:15.330> and<00:01:15.479> like

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
we get started I'll try and like

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.330 
we get started I'll try and like
affiliate<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.409> some<00:01:16.650> of<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.799> moves<00:01:17.009> I'll<00:01:17.189> be

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
affiliate on some of the moves I'll be

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.230 
affiliate on some of the moves I'll be
making<00:01:17.729> but<00:01:19.159> right<00:01:20.159> now<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.340> have<00:01:20.430> my<00:01:20.670> input<00:01:20.909> a

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
making but right now I have my input a

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.929 
making but right now I have my input a
pre<00:01:21.420> effect<00:01:22.310> you<00:01:23.310> brought<00:01:23.520> me<00:01:23.610> here<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.820> has

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
pre effect you brought me here it has

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.749 
pre effect you brought me here it has
some<00:01:24.360> delay<00:01:24.659> on<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.900> okay<00:01:25.409> okay<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.400> I'll<00:01:26.549> get

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
some delay on it okay okay and I'll get

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.580 
some delay on it okay okay and I'll get
a<00:01:26.790> loop<00:01:27.180> started<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.810> what<00:01:28.080> I'll<00:01:28.170> probably<00:01:28.290> do

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
a loop started and what I'll probably do

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.770 
a loop started and what I'll probably do
is<00:01:28.619> I'll<00:01:28.890> layer<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:30.030> couple<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.420> different

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
is I'll layer on a couple of different

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.289 
is I'll layer on a couple of different
layers<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.650> then<00:01:31.950> I'll<00:01:32.100> also<00:01:32.490> move<00:01:33.090> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
layers and then I'll also move the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.749 
layers and then I'll also move the
expression<00:01:33.900> pedal<00:01:33.930> right<00:01:34.259> over<00:01:34.409> here<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.759> it

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
expression pedal right over here and it

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.880 
expression pedal right over here and it
too<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.150> controlling<00:01:36.900> a<00:01:36.990> delay<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.680> loop

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
too is controlling a delay on the loop

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.109 
too is controlling a delay on the loop
and<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.460> will<00:01:38.549> control<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
and it will control like the

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.300 
and it will control like the
regeneration<00:01:39.720> you<00:01:40.380> can<00:01:40.470> kind<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.710> see<00:01:40.890> what's

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
regeneration you can kind of see what's

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.490 
regeneration you can kind of see what's
going<00:01:41.549> on<00:01:41.640> there<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.030> then<00:01:42.540> I'll<00:01:42.780> run<00:01:43.290> through

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
going on there and then I'll run through

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.740 
going on there and then I'll run through
a<00:01:43.560> couple<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.950> different<00:01:44.009> effects<00:01:44.729> for<00:01:45.600> you

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
a couple of different effects for you

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.810 
a couple of different effects for you
okay<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.710> let's<00:01:46.890> get<00:01:47.009> started<00:01:47.430> if<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.640> want

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
okay so let's get started if you want

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.760 
okay so let's get started if you want
that's<00:01:48.060> here<00:01:48.420> okay<00:01:48.990> I'm<00:01:49.259> going<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.470> turn<00:01:49.619> on

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
that's here okay I'm going to turn on

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.410 
that's here okay I'm going to turn on
the<00:01:49.890> metronome<00:01:50.070> especially<00:01:50.939> for<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.210> first

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
the metronome especially for the first

00:01:51.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
the metronome especially for the first
track<00:01:51.750> okay

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:58.280 

I<00:03:56.030> changed<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.120> key<00:03:57.330> while<00:03:57.720> we're<00:03:57.870> playing<00:03:57.990> oh

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
I changed the key while we're playing oh

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
to me it's more than only a dynamic
