 automatism with this parameter of each 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.310
 Roll assure to millimeter and we have it 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.719

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:11.549
 by certain standards 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.019
 that is, a very simple reduction option on 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.029
 Japanese 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:16.939

 now she sure 

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:19.809
 and we try 

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:21.189
 respectively 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.329

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.319
 how our sushi production is different from 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.129
 Japanese is a gender issue 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:35.769
 Japan sushi master traditionally male 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.219
 profession because women have a fever 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:40.769
 bodies higher in the process of cooking from 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.790
 seafood consider the Japanese this 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.979
 fundamental difference 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.149
 they have working for Sasha

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.390
 and that which is characteristic of several degrees 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:51.409
 but warmer 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:54.040
 dozens of times faster than male soldiers on 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.689
 products 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.909
