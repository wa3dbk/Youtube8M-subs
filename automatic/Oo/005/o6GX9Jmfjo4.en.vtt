themselves<00:02:23.090> that<00:02:23.240> are<00:02:23.360> bad<00:02:23.510> or<00:02:23.780> if<00:02:23.900> it's<00:02:24.080> just

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
themselves that are bad or if it's just

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.640 
themselves that are bad or if it's just
the<00:02:24.410> booster<00:02:24.850> that's<00:02:25.850> not<00:02:26.810> as<00:02:26.930> powerful<00:02:27.140> as

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.100 
probably do a rear disc conversion I
don't<00:02:58.010> know<00:02:58.070> much<00:02:58.220> about<00:02:58.250> it<00:02:58.640> but<00:02:58.850> I<00:02:59.090> feel<00:02:59.989> like

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
don't know much about it but I feel like

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.720 
don't know much about it but I feel like
that'd<00:03:00.290> be<00:03:00.380> pretty<00:03:00.500> cool<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.340> got<00:03:04.520> a<00:03:04.550> bunch

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
that'd be pretty cool so I got a bunch

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.780 
that'd be pretty cool so I got a bunch
of<00:03:04.820> brake<00:03:05.270> so<00:03:05.930> I'm<00:03:06.080> gonna<00:03:06.340> do<00:03:07.340> some<00:03:07.580> stuff

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
of brake so I'm gonna do some stuff

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.220 
of brake so I'm gonna do some stuff
I<00:03:07.940> guess<00:03:09.520> so<00:03:10.520> here<00:03:11.060> we<00:03:11.180> are<00:03:11.209> new<00:03:11.540> brake<00:03:11.780> system

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
I guess so here we are new brake system

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.530 
I guess so here we are new brake system
components<00:03:12.860> we<00:03:13.100> have<00:03:13.130> new<00:03:13.520> rotor<00:03:13.760> knee<00:03:14.270> pads

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
components we have new rotor knee pads

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:21.660 
components we have new rotor knee pads
and<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:15.230> new<00:03:15.380> caliper<00:03:16.989> and<00:03:18.340> quick<00:03:19.340> paint<00:03:19.610> job

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
and a new caliper and quick paint job

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
line there the MS tubing has been

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.320 
line there the MS tubing has been
removed<00:04:10.770> because<00:04:11.550> we<00:04:11.760> have<00:04:11.970> new<00:04:12.150> wheel

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
removed because we have new wheel

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:13.730 
removed because we have new wheel
cylinders<00:04:12.840> because<00:04:13.020> the<00:04:13.170> old<00:04:13.320> ones<00:04:13.500> look

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
cylinders because the old ones look

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
tubing out of the back of the wheel

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.990 
tubing out of the back of the wheel
cylinder<00:04:19.380> was<00:04:19.950> not<00:04:20.190> too<00:04:20.430> easily

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
cylinder was not too easily

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.330 
cylinder was not too easily
yeah<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:22.140> nut<00:04:22.290> was<00:04:22.440> grinded<00:04:22.830> down<00:04:22.860> to<00:04:23.190> like

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
yeah the nut was grinded down to like

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.790 
yeah the nut was grinded down to like
nothing<00:04:23.640> we<00:04:24.030> couldn't<00:04:24.270> spin<00:04:24.510> it<00:04:24.660> we<00:04:25.530> ended<00:04:25.710> up

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
nothing we couldn't spin it we ended up

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.500 
nothing we couldn't spin it we ended up
breaking<00:04:26.220> off<00:04:26.460> the<00:04:26.490> tubing<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.030> taking<00:04:27.390> it

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
breaking off the tubing and taking it

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.180 
breaking off the tubing and taking it
off<00:04:27.600> with<00:04:27.780> a<00:04:27.810> socket<00:04:29.780> so<00:04:30.780> uh<00:04:30.810> we<00:04:31.710> cut<00:04:31.890> off<00:04:32.010> both

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
off with a socket so uh we cut off both

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.550 
off with a socket so uh we cut off both
ends<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:33.270> though<00:04:33.630> we<00:04:33.750> got<00:04:33.900> some<00:04:34.050> replacement

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
ends and though we got some replacement

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.300 
ends and though we got some replacement
tubing<00:04:34.860> the<00:04:35.370> fittings<00:04:35.670> and<00:04:35.760> everything<00:04:37.310> again

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
tubing the fittings and everything again

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.490 
tubing the fittings and everything again
ourselves<00:04:38.760> a<00:04:39.440> flaring<00:04:40.440> set<00:04:40.710> so<00:04:41.610> we<00:04:41.700> can<00:04:42.500> reflex

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
ourselves a flaring set so we can reflex

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.220 
ourselves a flaring set so we can reflex
cuz<00:04:43.860> this<00:04:44.010> sounds<00:04:44.310> way<00:04:44.490> too<00:04:44.520> big<00:04:45.080> and<00:04:46.080> then

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
cuz this sounds way too big and then

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:47.930 
cuz this sounds way too big and then
we'll<00:04:46.350> bend<00:04:46.560> it<00:04:46.710> up<00:04:46.830> I'll<00:04:47.160> put<00:04:47.340> the<00:04:47.490> new<00:04:47.670> one<00:04:47.910> in

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
we'll bend it up I'll put the new one in

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.520 
we'll bend it up I'll put the new one in

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
and then we'll put the new wheel

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.500 
and then we'll put the new wheel
cylinders<00:04:50.220> in<00:04:50.460> and<00:04:50.730> the<00:04:50.790> new<00:04:50.910> hardware<00:04:51.450> and
