okay<00:00:32.079> John<00:00:32.320> what's<00:00:32.559> your<00:00:32.770> second<00:00:33.280> area<00:00:33.730> of

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
okay John what's your second area of

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.110 
okay John what's your second area of
concern<00:00:34.210> for<00:00:34.540> Welsh<00:00:34.809> pony<00:00:35.489> well<00:00:36.489> we<00:00:36.640> know<00:00:36.820> the

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
concern for Welsh pony well we know the

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.160 
concern for Welsh pony well we know the
the<00:00:37.629> mainframes<00:00:38.199> of<00:00:38.500> the<00:00:38.620> loco<00:00:39.010> are<00:00:39.190> not<00:00:39.879> in

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
the mainframes of the loco are not in

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.640 
the mainframes of the loco are not in
good<00:00:41.170> order<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:43.270> mainframes<00:00:43.690> run<00:00:44.050> from<00:00:44.440> the

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
good order the mainframes run from the

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.530 
good order the mainframes run from the
front<00:00:45.070> of<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.309> fire<00:00:45.550> box<00:00:45.760> here<00:00:46.059> of<00:00:46.330> all<00:00:46.480> the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:46.540 
front of the fire box here of all the

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.850 
front of the fire box here of all the
way<00:00:46.720> to<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:46.960> cylinders<00:00:47.350> at<00:00:47.440> the<00:00:47.530> front

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
way to the cylinders at the front

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.310 
way to the cylinders at the front
basically<00:00:48.550> contain<00:00:49.059> the<00:00:49.210> axle<00:00:49.510> boxes<00:00:49.989> and<00:00:50.170> the

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
basically contain the axle boxes and the

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.060 
basically contain the axle boxes and the
wheel<00:00:50.980> sets<00:00:53.100> at<00:00:54.100> the<00:00:54.129> back<00:00:54.460> here<00:00:54.850> there<00:00:55.329> is<00:00:56.070> we

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
wheel sets at the back here there is we

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.970 
wheel sets at the back here there is we
can<00:00:57.220> see<00:00:57.430> from<00:00:57.610> underneath<00:00:57.940> there's<00:00:58.510> a<00:00:58.980> an

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
can see from underneath there's a an

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.209 
can see from underneath there's a an
interesting<00:01:00.550> repair<00:01:01.030> that's<00:01:01.539> been<00:01:01.750> done<00:01:02.219> some

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
interesting repair that's been done some

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.460 
interesting repair that's been done some
time<00:01:03.520> probably<00:01:03.969> in<00:01:04.089> the<00:01:04.390> I<00:01:04.690> would<00:01:05.050> guess<00:01:05.259> in

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
time probably in the I would guess in

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.859 
time probably in the I would guess in
them<00:01:05.619> maybe<00:01:05.800> in<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.009> nineteen<00:01:06.369> twenties<00:01:06.869> it

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
them maybe in the nineteen twenties it

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.410 
them maybe in the nineteen twenties it
looks<00:01:08.170> like<00:01:08.350> the<00:01:08.560> frame<00:01:08.979> is<00:01:09.670> probably<00:01:10.030> cracked

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
looks like the frame is probably cracked

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.480 
looks like the frame is probably cracked
and<00:01:10.810> it's<00:01:10.990> been<00:01:11.229> strapped<00:01:11.800> together<00:01:12.039> with

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
and it's been strapped together with

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.050 
and it's been strapped together with
some<00:01:12.759> saying<00:01:13.630> interesting<00:01:14.259> repair<00:01:14.649> so<00:01:15.640> do<00:01:16.000> you

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
some saying interesting repair so do you

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.850 
some saying interesting repair so do you
think<00:01:16.330> it<00:01:16.479> it's<00:01:16.780> possible<00:01:17.289> you<00:01:17.470> might<00:01:17.590> be<00:01:17.740> able

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
think it it's possible you might be able

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.510 
think it it's possible you might be able
to<00:01:17.950> reuse<00:01:18.280> the<00:01:18.460> brain<00:01:18.810> yes<00:01:19.810> with<00:01:20.170> them

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
to reuse the brain yes with them

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.840 
to reuse the brain yes with them
hopefully<00:01:21.520> we<00:01:21.970> can<00:01:22.560> weld<00:01:23.560> repair<00:01:24.130> any<00:01:24.490> cracks

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
hopefully we can weld repair any cracks

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.240 
hopefully we can weld repair any cracks
and<00:01:26.940> straighten<00:01:27.940> out<00:01:28.060> any<00:01:28.649> kinks<00:01:29.649> or<00:01:30.009> rather<00:01:30.160> a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
and straighten out any kinks or rather a

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.780 
and straighten out any kinks or rather a
damage<00:01:31.799> until<00:01:32.799> we<00:01:32.860> get<00:01:32.979> in<00:01:33.070> a<00:01:33.100> loco<00:01:33.400> properly

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
damage until we get in a loco properly

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.340 
damage until we get in a loco properly
apart<00:01:34.060> we<00:01:34.299> can't<00:01:34.509> really<00:01:34.720> tell<00:01:34.930> we<00:01:35.079> need<00:01:35.200> to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
apart we can't really tell we need to

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.590 
apart we can't really tell we need to
see<00:01:35.500> how<00:01:35.590> straight<00:01:35.950> they<00:01:36.159> are<00:01:36.340> and<00:01:36.700> how<00:01:37.090> badly

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
see how straight they are and how badly

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.929 
see how straight they are and how badly
cracked<00:01:38.640> but<00:01:39.720> usually<00:01:40.720> we<00:01:40.990> can<00:01:41.229> repair<00:01:42.220> frames

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
cracked but usually we can repair frames

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.800 
cracked but usually we can repair frames
like<00:01:43.240> this<00:01:43.299> and<00:01:44.729> reuse<00:01:45.729> them<00:01:45.939> again<00:01:46.030> if

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
like this and reuse them again if

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.600 
like this and reuse them again if
they're<00:01:47.020> really<00:01:47.200> bad<00:01:47.470> we<00:01:47.860> might<00:01:48.340> have<00:01:48.520> to

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
they're really bad we might have to

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.330 
they're really bad we might have to
replace<00:01:48.850> them<00:01:49.149> but<00:01:49.390> that's<00:01:50.020> not<00:01:50.979> me<00:01:51.130> in<00:01:51.220> the

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
replace them but that's not me in the

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.840 
replace them but that's not me in the
world<00:01:51.490> it's<00:01:51.729> a<00:01:52.240> job<00:01:53.079> that<00:01:53.770> certainly<00:01:54.549> the<00:01:54.700> old

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
world it's a job that certainly the old

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.760 
world it's a job that certainly the old
western<00:01:55.240> railway<00:01:55.540> company<00:01:56.340> would<00:01:57.340> have<00:01:57.460> done

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
western railway company would have done

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.580 
western railway company would have done
several<00:01:59.770> times<00:01:59.950> so<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:01.750> wouldn't<00:02:02.469> be<00:02:02.560> a

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
several times so it's wouldn't be a

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.440 
several times so it's wouldn't be a
problem<00:02:03.040> if<00:02:03.250> we<00:02:03.399> had<00:02:03.549> to<00:02:03.700> replace<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.180> frames

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
problem if we had to replace the frames

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.990 
problem if we had to replace the frames
all<00:02:05.320> these<00:02:05.590> are<00:02:06.070> slightly<00:02:06.219> unusual<00:02:06.460> in

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
all these are slightly unusual in

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.770 
all these are slightly unusual in
railway<00:02:07.329> loco<00:02:07.689> terms<00:02:07.990> in<00:02:08.259> that<00:02:08.470> there's<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.910> set

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
of frames right at the back of the loco

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.289 
of frames right at the back of the loco
here<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.950> go<00:02:15.190> from<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.549> rear<00:02:15.730> buffer<00:02:16.120> beam

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299

further set of frames runs forward from

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
the front of the loco so a lot of the

the front of the loco so a lot of the
