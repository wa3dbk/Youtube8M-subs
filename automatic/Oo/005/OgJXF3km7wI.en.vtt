00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:20.310 

God

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.130 

the<00:00:21.100> idea<00:00:21.430> of<00:00:21.520> zigtech<00:00:21.789> is<00:00:22.180> to<00:00:22.390> kind<00:00:22.689> of<00:00:22.779> fuse

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
the idea of zigtech is to kind of fuse

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.019 
the idea of zigtech is to kind of fuse
energy<00:00:23.710> return<00:00:24.039> and<00:00:24.250> cushioning<00:00:24.670> and<00:00:24.820> one

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
energy return and cushioning and one

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.900 
energy return and cushioning and one
shoe<00:00:25.330> so<00:00:25.869> the<00:00:26.020> the<00:00:26.590> cushioning<00:00:27.010> platform<00:00:27.670> very

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
shoe so the the cushioning platform very

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.580 
shoe so the the cushioning platform very
distinctive<00:00:28.419> to<00:00:28.509> look<00:00:28.660> at<00:00:28.840> obviously<00:00:29.410> but

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
distinctive to look at obviously but

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.980 
distinctive to look at obviously but
design<00:00:30.220> that<00:00:30.430> way<00:00:30.550> for<00:00:30.820> a<00:00:30.849> reason<00:00:30.910> so<00:00:31.720> we<00:00:31.840> took

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:31.990 
design that way for a reason so we took

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.890 
design that way for a reason so we took
the<00:00:32.140> influence<00:00:32.529> of<00:00:32.710> a<00:00:33.160> slinky<00:00:33.670> if<00:00:33.910> you<00:00:34.059> will<00:00:34.270> in

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
the influence of a slinky if you will in

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.600 
the influence of a slinky if you will in
the<00:00:34.989> idea<00:00:35.290> of<00:00:35.410> all<00:00:35.559> these<00:00:35.710> individuals<00:00:36.309> zigs

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610 
the idea of all these individuals zigs

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.610 
the idea of all these individuals zigs
is<00:00:36.879> they<00:00:37.150> bounce<00:00:37.420> the<00:00:37.660> energy<00:00:38.019> return<00:00:38.320> back<00:00:38.590> to

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
is they bounce the energy return back to

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.530 
is they bounce the energy return back to
you<00:00:38.890> so<00:00:39.129> what<00:00:39.489> energy<00:00:39.820> you<00:00:39.940> land<00:00:40.239> with<00:00:40.390> it

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
you so what energy you land with it

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.299 
you so what energy you land with it
he'll<00:00:40.750> strike<00:00:41.019> comes<00:00:41.530> back<00:00:41.769> to<00:00:41.949> you<00:00:42.040> with<00:00:42.160> two

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
he'll strike comes back to you with two

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.189 
he'll strike comes back to you with two
off<00:00:42.489> they're<00:00:43.330> really<00:00:43.570> comfortable<00:00:43.809> to<00:00:44.080> wear

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:44.199 
off they're really comfortable to wear

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:46.229 
off they're really comfortable to wear
that<00:00:44.350> rely<00:00:44.800> you're<00:00:45.070> going<00:00:45.460> to<00:00:45.550> fairly<00:00:46.030> even

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
that rely you're going to fairly even

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.270 
that rely you're going to fairly even
notice<00:00:46.690> that<00:00:46.720> they're<00:00:46.930> on<00:00:47.080> they<00:00:47.739> look<00:00:47.920> kind<00:00:48.190> of

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
notice that they're on they look kind of

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.979 
notice that they're on they look kind of
they<00:00:48.400> look<00:00:48.550> so<00:00:48.760> much<00:00:48.879> different<00:00:48.940> and<00:00:49.420> you<00:00:49.809> kind

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
they look so much different and you kind

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.299 
they look so much different and you kind
of<00:00:50.019> look<00:00:50.170> at<00:00:50.260> them<00:00:50.350> to<00:00:50.410> think<00:00:50.500> odd<00:00:50.800> they're

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
of look at them to think odd they're

of look at them to think odd they're
really<00:00:51.580> different<00:00:51.670> but<00:00:52.030> they<00:00:52.239> feel<00:00:52.480> they<00:00:53.020> feel

great to run in kind of put an extra

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.560 
great to run in kind of put an extra
spring<00:00:55.180> in<00:00:55.210> your<00:00:55.300> step

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.120 

zetec<00:00:58.570> was<00:00:58.720> actually<00:00:58.989> inspired<00:00:59.079> by<00:00:59.440> some<00:00:59.860> the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
zetec was actually inspired by some the

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:02.280 
zetec was actually inspired by some the
energy<00:01:00.700> transfer<00:01:01.000> found<00:01:01.510> in<00:01:01.720> the<00:01:01.810> slinky<00:01:02.170> as<00:01:02.260> a

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:02.290 
energy transfer found in the slinky as a

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.530 
energy transfer found in the slinky as a
bootstrapping<00:01:02.890> for<00:01:03.220> actually<00:01:03.970> inspired<00:01:04.360> the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
bootstrapping for actually inspired the

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.790 
bootstrapping for actually inspired the
new<00:01:04.750> geometric<00:01:04.989> shape<00:01:05.590> zigtech<00:01:07.650> today<00:01:08.650> we've

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
new geometric shape zigtech today we've

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.670 
new geometric shape zigtech today we've
had<00:01:08.830> a<00:01:09.790> huge<00:01:10.510> crowd<00:01:10.720> of<00:01:10.750> journalists<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:11.620> we

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
had a huge crowd of journalists and we

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.210 
had a huge crowd of journalists and we
separate<00:01:12.280> them<00:01:12.400> into<00:01:12.550> two<00:01:13.000> teams<00:01:13.180> I<00:01:14.010> had<00:01:15.010> the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
separate them into two teams I had the

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.219 
separate them into two teams I had the
real<00:01:15.430> privilege<00:01:15.700> and<00:01:15.970> honor<00:01:16.119> to<00:01:16.240> meet<00:01:16.900> that

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
real privilege and honor to meet that

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:20.400 
real privilege and honor to meet that
theory<00:01:17.770> was<00:01:18.010> a<00:01:18.280> huge<00:01:18.760> fan<00:01:18.940> is<00:01:19.210> so<00:01:19.540> really<00:01:20.260> cool

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
theory was a huge fan is so really cool

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.350 
theory was a huge fan is so really cool
to<00:01:20.530> chill<00:01:20.650> with<00:01:20.770> him<00:01:20.860> today<00:01:21.010> and<00:01:21.820> we<00:01:21.940> competed

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
to chill with him today and we competed

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.540 
to chill with him today and we competed
on<00:01:22.509> this<00:01:22.869> on<00:01:23.410> this<00:01:23.470> obstacle<00:01:23.890> course<00:01:24.250> behind

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
on this on this obstacle course behind

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.550 
on this on this obstacle course behind
us<00:01:24.670> it<00:01:25.119> was<00:01:25.270> really<00:01:25.420> good<00:01:25.600> fun<00:01:25.780> you<00:01:26.050> know<00:01:26.170> and<00:01:26.470> I

us it was really good fun you know and I
think<00:01:26.770> every<00:01:27.100> every<00:01:27.490> individual<00:01:28.000> or<00:01:28.360> the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
think every every individual or the

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.030 
think every every individual or the
journalists<00:01:29.050> they<00:01:29.140> all<00:01:29.350> had<00:01:29.500> an<00:01:29.619> incredible

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
journalists they all had an incredible

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.100 
journalists they all had an incredible
time<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:30.970> very<00:01:31.210> competitive<00:01:31.720> I<00:01:31.810> don't<00:01:31.960> think

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
time the very competitive I don't think

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.300 
time the very competitive I don't think
that<00:01:32.140> I<00:01:32.290> don't<00:01:32.470> expect<00:01:32.770> them<00:01:32.979> to<00:01:33.100> be<00:01:33.190> so

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
that I don't expect them to be so

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.070 
that I don't expect them to be so
competitive<00:01:33.550> but<00:01:33.970> it<00:01:34.090> was<00:01:34.210> really<00:01:34.570> a<00:01:34.600> great

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080
