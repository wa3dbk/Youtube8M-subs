00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.170
 hello to all today it's time 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.059
 to do the review of boxing 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.290
 of the month of January so in boxing me 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.940
 trusted again for 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.889
 renew our partnership this year 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.139
 and I'm excited to introduce you to 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.070
 January post content 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.900
 it was a bit of a disappointment and 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.830
 same time I was super happy you want 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.660
 explain why 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.800
 in this video I reassure you had 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.779
 not been a big disappointment 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.890
 it was rather compared to ghost I 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.900
 think it's more of a fault of 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.309
 ghost it's a disappointment but I'm going 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.190
 explain all this in this video 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.559
 so there was as usual the mia 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.890
 umag too cute off game i too much 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.320
 loved it best this month so 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.270
 it's a night at the box good resolutions 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.700
 so there were a few things 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.680
 to run your cat and for the 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.329
 make it a bit more sporty for 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.340
 to make him lose a little his Christmas grade 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.350
 even if bongo style at low noise at all 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.899
 that they will have the month of December 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.180
 we start with the first that it is 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.820
 not so much for we're going to say lose 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.030
 weights are liquid delicacies 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.180
 so the vitakraft brand so liquid 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.610
 snack polls let's say the food 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.290
 in liquid form a little pasty I 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.140
 have not tested yet because this is the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.520
 thing that disappoints me in fact boxing 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.830
 the compo is not necessarily the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.229
 better and we'll say I'm not 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.090
 Too much fan of this kind of thing I 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.159
 do not know why I do not stick to 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.810
 squeeze staff I prefer them 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.460
 croquettes I can do to the limit the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.110
 paws and occasionally 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.770
 I think I had already explained 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.210
 in several videos or vox but there 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:39.090
 even if it's liquid treats 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.710
 to beef I do not know I find that these 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.710
 practices because it is because 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.960
 stick form but I know I 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.800
 do not adhere too much I do not adhere too much to this 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.070
 type 2 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.370
 to this type of stuff after it's everyone 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.540
 mm each what he likes I feel that I 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.180
 to say a lot of nonsense in this video 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.920
 it's okay I'm sorry I 'm coming 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.870
 job I'm a little flat but 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:05.220
 I 'm trying to put a little bit 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:07.020
 so is brief we'll say mid review 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.910
 fig grapes then there was good 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.590
 sure of other clues that was going with a 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.780
 toy by cons these treats I there 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.450
 super well located so are 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.270
 similar snacks in the form of small 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.090
 wise hearts and golden king so you have 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.370
 this bacon chicken and this to 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.670
 shrimp and actually these treats there 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.200
 go with that ball so in fact you 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.780
 put inside and it's without 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.580
 had fun with your cat he is supposed to 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.890
 play with this ball running everywhere 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.440
 to get out the treats and that 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.850
 it's also not a disappointment but I 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.380
 think it's because of late kid the 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.690
 player himself I'm sure he'll go to 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.860
 a lot of a lot of cats my 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.080
 kids who did not understand the principle 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.210
 that is to say, we must run after the 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.090
 ball to make out the food he he 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.880
 throws him to the muse when he 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.890
 launches and after my home there is a there is 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.290
 like a black out that is done in 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.180
 this brain there is nothing happening and it 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.590
 will not run after it feels 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.910
 that she food inside and 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.410
 it is he finds it funny besides it 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.790
 just got here he finds it 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.950
 funny that is something that is 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.600
 wandered inside but here you go 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.790
 aside from that not much that happens 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.950
 go in there we also and that I 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.290
 find it super fun like game I think 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.550
 that many cats will love kid 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.080
 you do not know his thing 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.360
 unfortunately he prefers to play 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.230
 with the play without the mechanism I'm going 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.950
 explain why 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.930
 so it's a mouse that you can 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.120
 unrolled to the ghost that happens that you 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.640
 can unwind and actually it does it 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.360
 move around the whole apartment where in 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.440
 the whole house 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.140
 I think it's really great 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.370
 like to play I totally adhere I you 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.080
 will do a little video clip for 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.470
 show you how they are having fun with 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.410
 my kids actually he prefers to play 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:49.610
 without the mechanism that is to say that it 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.440
 just take the mouse and 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.390
 to play with two dengue bins is a 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.880
 little everywhere in short but by cons I love 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.580
 the mouse concept actually that goes a 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.200
 little everywhere girl just funny ah 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.370
 yeah that in the office good it was not 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.780
 a toy for me a monkey but for 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.580
 ghost so we'll leave him but I 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.060
 really liked to play anyway for 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.620
 me from january 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.180
 penultimate objects that were 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.220
 in the boxing of the month of January it's 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.470
 a brush that is supposed to remove the 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.450
 dead hair that is on the cat 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.700
 So we are particular about ghost 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.400
 other brush in fact we like 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.410
 used and of which this one in fact she is going 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.270
 serve for anything else so I 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.100
 recommend that you test at home if 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.110
 you have this box in your box 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.669
 letters or at home I'm going 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.910
 use it to remove walrus hair 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:35.150
 from my sofa because I have a couch 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.360
 who grabbed the hair of my cat so 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.370
 an ikea couch for not quoting it and 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.050
 inevitably that was deadly what this 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:44.720
 kind of sofas grips all the hairs 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.910
 dead it's really burke and even on 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.950
 the plaids I think it will work well 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.260
 I tested on the sofa by the way 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.030
 I am currently on it up 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.290
 just tested you're not going 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.960
 see but it works very well 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:05:00.020
 sarah flu well the hair I find that 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.940
 it's as practical as a glove with 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.979
 static electricity that removes all 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.169
 hairs so if you do not want to 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:08.330
 use it on your cat use the 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.250
 on your furniture it's really effective 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.960
 and here it is the happiness of 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.530
 masters rather than cat but I 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.310
 say thank you 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:19.640
 last object that happened to one will say 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.229
 at the right time because right now 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.310
 we really wanted to take care of this 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:23.660
 kid party i'm going to show you 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.250
 right now what it is because 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.130
 otherwise it will be super weird that 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:31.310
 that I say it's a gel for them 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:34.270
 ears so a milk for ears for 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.950
 that your cat's ears are well 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.350
 cleaned up and actually the day the day before 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.580
 I believe the arrival of this box the 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.050
 ears of the kids were really 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.360
 all alone and it's true that we tend 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.770
 step by step it had him regularly enough 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.870
 I think that once a month it's not 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.390
 wrong so that's like this and 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:52.190
 frankly it is convenient 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.230
 kids a few drops it's true that 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.700
 in the moment 

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:56.170
 you did not seem to understand this 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.730
 who was going to rub them the 

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:59.950
 ears but after that it's fast gone 

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.300
 everything was fine and I think 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:03.730
 that's the kind of thing that would have to be 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.100
 have in his medical kit his 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:08.380
 kit with brushes and cleaning 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.180
 etc for his cat because 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:11.230
 frankly do not think this is actually 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.030
 we do not necessarily think about it 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:15.610
 and when we need it we are well 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.440
 glad to have received this in a box by 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.820
 example so big crush for his 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.280
 Also I am very happy to 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:23.380
 finally be able to use that kind of 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.700
 products this video would have been a little 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.800
 little weird because I would have been 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.210
 disturbed by ghost who turn me around 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.560
 I'm not used to filming in this 

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.900
 frame there 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.100
 this video in general I get to the 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.260
 put in his box but there he is 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.000
 completely subjugated by what I 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.710
 am showing on camera 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.270
 so I hope this review will have you 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.770
 more I find you I think for the 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.400
 February for the next review 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.350
 better in the box 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.910
 thanks again to this company of 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:47.890
 trust me I love everything 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.000
 case this concept it's true that I have some 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.880
 favorites for some products and 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.850
 then sometimes not so much but it's 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.590
 my opinion and I like to share what 

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.450
 I think in relation to these products of 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.620
 frank way so I found for a 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.830
 next video I tell you to very 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.830
 soon
