which<00:01:44.320> one<00:01:44.380> had<00:01:45.219> those<00:01:45.549> but<00:01:46.179> this<00:01:46.329> one<00:01:46.570> doesn't

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
which one had those but this one doesn't

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.649 
which one had those but this one doesn't
so<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:47.979> game<00:01:48.130> basically<00:01:48.609> condenses<00:01:49.390> all<00:01:49.509> the

so the game basically condenses all the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
pirates movies into one video game and

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.760 
pirates movies into one video game and

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
what you're really doing is running

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.510 
what you're really doing is running
around<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:20.020> linear<00:02:20.350> 3d<00:02:20.800> environment<00:02:21.400> and

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
collecting as many LEGO pieces as you

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.190 
collecting as many LEGO pieces as you
can<00:02:23.830> simple<00:02:24.580> as<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.820> gameplay<00:02:25.210> is<00:02:25.420> though<00:02:25.720> the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
can simple as the gameplay is though the

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.050 
can simple as the gameplay is though the
Lego<00:02:26.440> games<00:02:26.560> are<00:02:26.920> always<00:02:27.070> really<00:02:27.460> polished

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
Lego games are always really polished

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.630 
Lego games are always really polished
and<00:02:28.210> well<00:02:28.420> made<00:02:28.720> and<00:02:29.020> that's<00:02:29.410> half<00:02:29.890> true<00:02:29.920> of

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
unwatchable and the graphics definitely

unwatchable and the graphics definitely

something much simpler that accommodates

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
shortcoming of the DS version is its

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.510 
shortcoming of the DS version is its
lack<00:03:02.020> of<00:03:02.050> multiplayer<00:03:02.830> that's<00:03:03.220> the<00:03:03.310> feature

lack of multiplayer that's the feature

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.460 
lack of multiplayer that's the feature
that<00:03:03.670> makes<00:03:03.970> Lego<00:03:04.270> games<00:03:04.630> most<00:03:05.050> enjoyable

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
that makes Lego games most enjoyable
