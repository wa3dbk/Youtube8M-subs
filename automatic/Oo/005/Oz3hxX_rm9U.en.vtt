00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:03.839
 Then I will explain how to take the engine 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.949
 If it's not changing at all, this gear 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:11.439
 Please check if you have entered cancer screening five days 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.269
 It is said that it has not been 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:17.560
 Because it does not go around 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.839
 There is Heisei romance, too 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:22.959
 When it is good that the neighbor is not determined 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.489
 Because there is no reason for these 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:28.759
 For the first time in heaven 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.399
 It was also a post 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.399
 Take a look at whether you have a sense of physical activity 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.340
 So here's what I want people to see 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.740
 This is a story 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.100
 It is Asahi net though 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.740
 Our home answer 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.770
 It will be said after the gas charges so much care 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.900
 The scene that I wanted to watch the performance was also noticeable 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.920
 Mets got higher 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.100
 I was asked between companies 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.560
 See if it will be money 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.600
 I think that there are almost no problems if Friday 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.680
 But still there is still some tension 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.560
 this 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.790
 The middle of the axel 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.600
 In this way 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.090
 When I get a part-time job 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.710
 It will be strange state from now on 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.770
 Because 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.350
 The cruising distance is determined by having it in this state 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.760
 I will be there for a while 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.130
 There is a part related to others 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.650
 Please hang up here 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.460
 Still 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.970
 I have a meeting 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.370
 At that time 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.500
 With the warehouse 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.240
 The next morning I will not use this but I will hear a lot of censorship 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.570
 Big deal 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.570
 Let me tell you 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:50.070
 The plow is worn if it is used too much in the second half of the extension 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.070
 It may be difficult to take on schedule 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.790
 Only when it doesn't rot 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.790
 Please try using the audition 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.890
 Then I'm actually running the engine 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.059
 For principals and instructors 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:11.379
 At that time 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.379
 So it has increased since old days 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.090
 This may also be difficult to use with morning market ntt data people 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.359
 so 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:25.349
 At that time 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.849
 Men are adjusted 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:30.369
 You can spend it here 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:33.369
 I'm using the same device 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:46.589
 Note 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.659
 Currently this one year
