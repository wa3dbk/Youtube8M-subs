okay<00:00:00.510> hi<00:00:00.659> chip<00:00:00.989> mr.<00:00:01.199> Basit<00:00:01.709> and<00:00:02.100> this<00:00:02.580> video

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
okay hi chip mr. Basit and this video

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:14.089 
okay hi chip mr. Basit and this video
will<00:00:02.970> be<00:00:03.000> talking<00:00:03.270> about<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.540> galaxy<00:00:03.929> s6<00:00:13.099> so

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
will be talking about the galaxy s6 so

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.770 
will be talking about the galaxy s6 so
I'm<00:00:14.340> actually<00:00:14.519> doing<00:00:14.730> this<00:00:14.820> video<00:00:15.150> because<00:00:15.330> I

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
I'm actually doing this video because I

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.680 
I'm actually doing this video because I
saw<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.199> s5<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.340> know<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.910> sold<00:00:18.180> very<00:00:18.300> well

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
saw the s5 and I know it sold very well

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.970 
saw the s5 and I know it sold very well
but<00:00:18.930> I'm<00:00:19.020> actually<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.350> brilliant<00:00:19.560> operator

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
but I'm actually a brilliant operator

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.590 
but I'm actually a brilliant operator
happier<00:00:20.310> there<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.270> video<00:00:21.449> I'm

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
happier there and in this video I'm

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.970 
happier there and in this video I'm
going<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.750> talk<00:00:21.869> about<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.170> things<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.590> really

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
going to talk about the things I really

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.040 
going to talk about the things I really
really<00:00:23.189> want<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.430> see<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.880> s6<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.600> if

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
really want to see in the s6 and if

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.960 
really want to see in the s6 and if
these<00:00:25.230> things<00:00:25.410> do<00:00:25.710> happen<00:00:25.980> then<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.519> s6<00:00:26.849> will

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
these things do happen then the s6 will

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.450 
these things do happen then the s6 will
definitely<00:00:27.359> be<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.689> best<00:00:27.960> phone<00:00:28.199> of<00:00:28.529> 2015<00:00:29.220> so

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
definitely be the best phone of 2015 so

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.980 
definitely be the best phone of 2015 so
the<00:00:29.970> first<00:00:30.150> thing<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.390> want<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.570> see<00:00:30.750> is<00:00:30.960> a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
the first thing I want to see is a

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.290 
the first thing I want to see is a
graphene<00:00:31.380> battery<00:00:31.920> now<00:00:32.669> as<00:00:32.940> you<00:00:33.090> may<00:00:33.210> already

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
graphene battery now as you may already

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.910 
graphene battery now as you may already
realize<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:33.870> know<00:00:33.989> while<00:00:34.200> smartphones<00:00:34.800> you

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
realize you know while smartphones you

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.740 
realize you know while smartphones you
know<00:00:35.010> they're<00:00:35.160> making<00:00:35.489> exponential<00:00:36.329> leaps<00:00:36.540> in

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
know they're making exponential leaps in

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.569 
know they're making exponential leaps in
terms<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.079> performance<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.920> innovation<00:00:38.040> and

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
terms of performance and innovation and

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.100 
terms of performance and innovation and
all<00:00:38.670> these<00:00:38.820> sorts<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.059> things<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:39.450> one<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
all these sorts of things but one of the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.229 
all these sorts of things but one of the
few<00:00:40.290> things<00:00:40.500> that's<00:00:40.770> really<00:00:40.920> stayed<00:00:41.399> where<00:00:42.090> it

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
few things that's really stayed where it

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.930 
few things that's really stayed where it
is<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.600> battery<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.489> you<00:00:44.489> know<00:00:44.610> there's<00:00:44.820> been

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
is is battery and you know there's been

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.299 
is is battery and you know there's been
a<00:00:44.969> lot<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.210> recent<00:00:45.590> research<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.829> development

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
a lot of recent research and development

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.340 
a lot of recent research and development
into<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.670> use<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.969> graphene<00:00:48.390> now<00:00:48.960> graphene

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
into the use of graphene now graphene

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.680 
into the use of graphene now graphene
actually<00:00:49.620> promises<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.280> be<00:00:50.399> able<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.690> give

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
actually promises to be able to give

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.779 
actually promises to be able to give
something<00:00:52.050> like<00:00:52.170> 7<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.649> 8<00:00:52.800> times<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:53.520> normal

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
something like 7 to 8 times the normal

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.100 
something like 7 to 8 times the normal
battery<00:00:54.000> life<00:00:54.329> of<00:00:54.480> what<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.750> see<00:00:54.930> at<00:00:55.020> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
battery life of what we see at the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.750 
battery life of what we see at the
minute<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.890> something<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.340> sort<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.550> fits

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
minute for something that sort of fits

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.689 
minute for something that sort of fits
into<00:00:57.000> maybe<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.660> fifth<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.289> space<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:59.670> I

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
into maybe a fifth of the space so I

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.430 
into maybe a fifth of the space so I
mean<00:00:59.879> if<00:01:00.059> actually<00:01:00.660> Samsung<00:01:01.020> managed<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.289> put

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
mean if actually Samsung managed to put

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.260 
mean if actually Samsung managed to put
this<00:01:01.590> into<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.890> galaxy<00:01:02.250> s6<00:01:02.520> it'll<00:01:03.149> be

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
this into the galaxy s6 it'll be

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.210 
this into the galaxy s6 it'll be
incredible<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:04.320> top<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.920> should<00:01:05.100> be

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
incredible on top of that it should be

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.890 
incredible on top of that it should be
able<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.430> charge<00:01:05.700> within<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> fifth<00:01:06.390> at<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> time

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
able to charge within a fifth at a time

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.300 
able to charge within a fifth at a time
so<00:01:07.200> you<00:01:07.439> know<00:01:07.770> we're<00:01:07.920> talking<00:01:08.070> about

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
so you know we're talking about

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.429 
so you know we're talking about
something<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:08.939> an<00:01:09.360> hour<00:01:09.540> charge<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.260> give<00:01:10.409> a

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
something like an hour charge to give a

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.200 
something like an hour charge to give a
battery<00:01:10.799> life<00:01:10.979> of<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.220> week<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.729> that's

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
battery life of a week and that's

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.300 
battery life of a week and that's
incredible<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.650> next<00:01:13.799> thing<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.040> want<00:01:14.220> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
incredible so the next thing I want to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.590 
incredible so the next thing I want to
see<00:01:14.430> in<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.549> goggles<00:01:14.820> here<00:01:14.880> six<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.570> a

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
see in the goggles here six is a

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.630 
see in the goggles here six is a
flexible<00:01:16.049> display<00:01:16.350> now<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.159> may<00:01:17.310> be<00:01:17.340> aware

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
flexible display now you may be aware

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.460 
flexible display now you may be aware
that<00:01:17.850> two<00:01:18.060> years<00:01:18.240> ago<00:01:18.299> at<00:01:18.540> CES<00:01:18.930> Samsung

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
that two years ago at CES Samsung

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.800 
that two years ago at CES Samsung
demonstrated<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.880> exa<00:01:21.420> Balazs<00:01:21.630> play

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
demonstrated it's you exa Balazs play

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.080 
demonstrated it's you exa Balazs play
technology<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.220> basically<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.939> way

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
technology and this is basically a way

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.940 
technology and this is basically a way
of<00:01:24.119> making<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.810> LCD<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.860> actually

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
of making the LCD so that it actually

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.399 
of making the LCD so that it actually
flexes<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.360> actually<00:01:27.659> using<00:01:28.020> some<00:01:28.049> sort

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
flexes and is actually using some sort

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.840 
flexes and is actually using some sort
of<00:01:28.470> plastic<00:01:28.710> which<00:01:29.189> actually<00:01:29.549> looks<00:01:29.729> like

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
of plastic which actually looks like

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.870 
of plastic which actually looks like
glass<00:01:30.090> now<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.110> mean<00:01:31.320> they're<00:01:31.680> actual<00:01:32.040> benefits

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
glass now I mean they're actual benefits

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.249 
glass now I mean they're actual benefits
of<00:01:33.000> doing<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.329> are<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.659> ridiculous<00:01:34.229> you

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
of doing this are just ridiculous you

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.080 
of doing this are just ridiculous you
know<00:01:34.380> you<00:01:34.530> could<00:01:34.710> have<00:01:34.860> your<00:01:35.040> phone<00:01:35.820> that

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
know you could have your phone that

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.819 
know you could have your phone that
almost<00:01:36.360> falls<00:01:36.570> like<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> piece<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.290> paper<00:01:37.439> or

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
almost falls like a piece of paper or

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.010 
almost falls like a piece of paper or
you<00:01:37.860> could<00:01:38.100> have<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.520> tablet<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.329> sort<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.810> um

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
you could have a tablet that sort of um

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.810 
you could have a tablet that sort of um
fits<00:01:40.439> into<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.799> space<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.220> little<00:01:41.400> send<00:01:41.640> or

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
fits into the space of a little send or

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.389 
fits into the space of a little send or
something<00:01:42.060> like<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:43.159> you<00:01:44.159> know<00:01:44.280> it's

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
something like that and you know it's

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.830 
something like that and you know it's
just<00:01:44.460> incredible<00:01:45.149> if<00:01:45.299> they<00:01:45.450> can<00:01:45.600> actually

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
just incredible if they can actually

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.260 
just incredible if they can actually
manage<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.320> year<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:47.220> bend<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.790> displays

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
manage this year to bend the displays

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.899 
manage this year to bend the displays
round<00:01:48.630> then<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.110> think<00:01:49.259> they<00:01:49.380> could<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:49.680> have

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
round then I think they could just have

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.130 
round then I think they could just have
limitless<00:01:50.909> possibilities<00:01:51.570> with<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.780> galaxy

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
limitless possibilities with the galaxy

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.719 
limitless possibilities with the galaxy
s6<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.649> I'll<00:01:52.799> just<00:01:52.920> be<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> totally<00:01:53.549> awesome

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
s6 and I'll just be a totally awesome

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.149 
s6 and I'll just be a totally awesome
sell-off<00:01:54.299> feature<00:01:54.740> well<00:01:55.740> it's<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:55.979> third

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
sell-off feature well it's the third

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.950 
sell-off feature well it's the third
thing<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.430> really<00:01:56.790> want<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.060> see<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.570> galaxy

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
thing I really want to see in the galaxy

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.260 
thing I really want to see in the galaxy
s6<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.890> massive<00:01:59.369> boost<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.790> processor

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
s6 is a massive boost in processor

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.630 
s6 is a massive boost in processor
technology<00:02:00.560> so<00:02:01.560> as<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:01.890> already<00:02:02.040> know<00:02:02.159> like

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
technology so as you already know like

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.760 
technology so as you already know like
the<00:02:02.759> snapdragon<00:02:03.210> 800<00:02:03.780> was<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> big<00:02:04.170> jump<00:02:04.469> over

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
the snapdragon 800 was a big jump over

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.059 
the snapdragon 800 was a big jump over
the<00:02:04.829> previous<00:02:05.219> year's<00:02:05.430> s4<00:02:05.850> pro<00:02:06.590> but<00:02:07.590> last<00:02:07.860> yeah

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
the previous year's s4 pro but last yeah

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.559 
the previous year's s4 pro but last yeah
I<00:02:08.099> mean<00:02:08.250> we've<00:02:08.429> not<00:02:08.580> really<00:02:08.849> had<00:02:08.970> any<00:02:09.270> progress

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
I mean we've not really had any progress

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.449 
I mean we've not really had any progress
you<00:02:09.840> know<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.020> 801<00:02:10.319> was<00:02:10.709> us<00:02:10.830> slightly

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
you know the 801 was us slightly

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.240 
you know the 801 was us slightly
overclocked<00:02:12.060> 800<00:02:12.900> and

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
overclocked 800 and

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.610 
overclocked 800 and
-<00:02:13.460> fibers<00:02:14.000> again<00:02:14.480> just<00:02:14.900> slightly<00:02:15.170> better<00:02:15.440> than

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
- fibers again just slightly better than

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.710 
- fibers again just slightly better than
me<00:02:15.860> -<00:02:16.100> one<00:02:16.400> and<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:17.090> sort<00:02:17.300> of<00:02:17.330> feels<00:02:17.510> like

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
me - one and it sort of feels like

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.120 
me - one and it sort of feels like
they're<00:02:17.870> making<00:02:18.170> new<00:02:18.320> chips<00:02:18.650> just<00:02:18.920> for<00:02:19.070> the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
they're making new chips just for the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.130 
they're making new chips just for the
sake<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.580> so<00:02:20.270> what<00:02:20.420> this<00:02:20.540> will<00:02:20.690> actually<00:02:20.990> do

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
sake of it so what this will actually do

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.230 
sake of it so what this will actually do
is<00:02:21.290> allow<00:02:21.530> developers<00:02:22.130> to<00:02:22.370> port<00:02:22.610> console

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
is allow developers to port console

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.450 
is allow developers to port console
games<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.810> our<00:02:23.930> phones<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.680> I<00:02:24.770> know<00:02:24.860> like<00:02:25.130> you

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
games to our phones and I know like you

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.830 
games to our phones and I know like you
know<00:02:25.550> all<00:02:25.700> the<00:02:25.790> companies<00:02:26.150> keep<00:02:26.300> saying<00:02:26.600> that

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
know all the companies keep saying that

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.390 
know all the companies keep saying that
each<00:02:27.320> generation<00:02:27.800> they<00:02:28.070> say<00:02:28.250> we're

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
each generation they say we're

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.040 
each generation they say we're
delivering<00:02:28.700> console<00:02:29.180> quality<00:02:29.570> experiences

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
delivering console quality experiences

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.810 
delivering console quality experiences
but<00:02:30.440> really<00:02:30.710> they're<00:02:30.860> not<00:02:30.890> and<00:02:31.400> that's

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
but really they're not and that's

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.640 
but really they're not and that's
because<00:02:32.240> the<00:02:32.630> actual<00:02:32.930> mobile<00:02:33.200> device<00:02:33.440> at<00:02:33.590> the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
because the actual mobile device at the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.750 
because the actual mobile device at the
minute<00:02:33.860> are<00:02:33.920> just<00:02:34.070> not<00:02:34.250> quite<00:02:34.430> powerful

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
minute are just not quite powerful

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.300 
minute are just not quite powerful
enough<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.180> port<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.870> console<00:02:36.230> games<00:02:36.410> over<00:02:36.800> so

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
enough to port the console games over so

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.740 
enough to port the console games over so
they've<00:02:37.430> got<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.670> make<00:02:37.760> mobile<00:02:38.030> equivalents

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
they've got to make mobile equivalents

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.450 
they've got to make mobile equivalents
which<00:02:38.990> you<00:02:39.560> know<00:02:39.650> they're<00:02:39.830> right<00:02:40.010> for<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.310> nut

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
which you know they're right for the nut

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.130 
which you know they're right for the nut
purchase<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:40.910> they're<00:02:41.000> really<00:02:41.120> terrible<00:02:41.420> so

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
purchase and they're really terrible so

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.930 
purchase and they're really terrible so
I'm<00:02:42.260> suggesting<00:02:42.440> but<00:02:42.920> if<00:02:43.040> some<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:43.520> managed<00:02:43.790> to

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
I'm suggesting but if some so managed to

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.640 
I'm suggesting but if some so managed to
double<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.330> performance<00:02:44.480> of<00:02:45.050> their<00:02:45.320> next

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
double the performance of their next

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.680 
double the performance of their next
gens<00:02:45.830> galaxy<00:02:46.520> phone<00:02:46.700> it'll<00:02:47.570> actually

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
gens galaxy phone it'll actually

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.330 
gens galaxy phone it'll actually
incentivize<00:02:48.350> developers<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:49.040> be<00:02:49.130> able<00:02:49.160> to

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
incentivize developers to be able to

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.220 
incentivize developers to be able to
port<00:02:49.670> their<00:02:49.880> console<00:02:50.270> games<00:02:50.420> over<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.840> mobile

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
port their console games over to mobile

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.870 
port their console games over to mobile
where<00:02:51.770> they<00:02:51.890> have<00:02:52.010> an<00:02:52.100> absolutely<00:02:52.490> massive

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
where they have an absolutely massive

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.310 
where they have an absolutely massive
audience<00:02:53.420> and<00:02:53.630> they'll<00:02:53.750> just<00:02:53.780> be<00:02:53.959> a<00:02:54.050> sellout

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
audience and they'll just be a sellout

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.199 
audience and they'll just be a sellout
success<00:02:54.860> I<00:02:55.160> mean<00:02:55.670> you<00:02:55.730> could<00:02:55.850> just<00:02:55.880> imagine

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
success I mean you could just imagine

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.790 
success I mean you could just imagine
going<00:02:56.630> to<00:02:56.780> work<00:02:56.959> and<00:02:57.170> being<00:02:57.320> able<00:02:57.440> to<00:02:57.560> sort<00:02:57.770> of

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
going to work and being able to sort of

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.440 
going to work and being able to sort of
take<00:02:58.310> your<00:02:58.550> phone<00:02:58.760> out<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:58.970> play<00:02:59.209> a<00:02:59.240> game<00:02:59.420> of

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
take your phone out and play a game of

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.660 
take your phone out and play a game of
Skyrim<00:03:00.080> on<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.320> way<00:03:00.440> it's<00:03:01.070> just<00:03:01.370> you<00:03:01.550> know

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
Skyrim on the way it's just you know

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.630 
Skyrim on the way it's just you know
it's<00:03:01.910> incredible<00:03:03.070> all<00:03:04.070> right<00:03:04.190> so<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.400> fourth

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
it's incredible all right so the fourth

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.100 
it's incredible all right so the fourth
thing<00:03:04.700> I<00:03:04.880> think<00:03:05.150> something<00:03:05.510> really<00:03:05.810> need<00:03:05.959> to

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
thing I think something really need to

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.480 
thing I think something really need to
do<00:03:06.260> is<00:03:06.440> to<00:03:06.560> make<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.770> best<00:03:06.950> camera<00:03:07.310> they<00:03:07.459> can

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 
do is to make the best camera they can

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.030 
do is to make the best camera they can
without<00:03:08.090> pushing<00:03:08.840> up<00:03:09.080> the<00:03:09.200> megapixel<00:03:09.770> camera

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
without pushing up the megapixel camera

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.160 
without pushing up the megapixel camera
necessarily<00:03:10.640> so<00:03:11.360> I<00:03:11.390> think<00:03:11.510> that<00:03:11.810> if<00:03:11.900> Samsung

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
necessarily so I think that if Samsung

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.290 
necessarily so I think that if Samsung
adopts<00:03:12.800> a<00:03:12.860> similar<00:03:13.220> image<00:03:13.459> sensor<00:03:13.910> to<00:03:14.060> that<00:03:14.180> of

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
adopts a similar image sensor to that of

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.480 
adopts a similar image sensor to that of
the<00:03:14.390> one<00:03:14.510> I<00:03:14.570> made<00:03:14.870> but<00:03:15.590> obviously<00:03:15.950> increases

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
the one I made but obviously increases

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.540 
the one I made but obviously increases
the<00:03:16.550> megapixel<00:03:17.090> count<00:03:17.269> to<00:03:17.570> say<00:03:17.780> 8<00:03:18.080> or<00:03:18.440> 12<00:03:18.860> or

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
the megapixel count to say 8 or 12 or

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.280 
the megapixel count to say 8 or 12 or
something<00:03:19.910> like<00:03:20.090> that<00:03:20.150> like<00:03:20.630> a<00:03:20.660> very<00:03:20.930> solid

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
something like that like a very solid

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.570 
something like that like a very solid
number<00:03:21.530> but<00:03:21.680> not<00:03:21.769> ridiculous

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 
number but not ridiculous

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.490 
number but not ridiculous
it'll<00:03:23.150> have<00:03:23.300> a<00:03:23.330> really<00:03:23.840> really<00:03:23.959> good<00:03:24.170> shooter

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
it'll have a really really good shooter

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.410 
it'll have a really really good shooter
so<00:03:24.739> I<00:03:24.800> think<00:03:24.860> if<00:03:25.100> we<00:03:25.190> have<00:03:25.310> that<00:03:25.519> ideal<00:03:26.120> flash

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
so I think if we have that ideal flash

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.870 
so I think if we have that ideal flash
and<00:03:26.750> 4k<00:03:27.200> recording<00:03:27.350> at<00:03:27.769> 60<00:03:28.130> frames<00:03:28.340> per<00:03:28.400> second

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
and 4k recording at 60 frames per second

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.520 
and 4k recording at 60 frames per second
we've<00:03:29.300> got<00:03:29.360> a<00:03:29.570> winner<00:03:29.750> on<00:03:29.930> our<00:03:29.959> hands<00:03:30.230> in<00:03:30.410> terms

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
we've got a winner on our hands in terms

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.009 
we've got a winner on our hands in terms
of<00:03:30.709> a<00:03:30.739> camera<00:03:31.150> now<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:32.209> last<00:03:32.420> thing<00:03:32.540> I<00:03:32.720> want<00:03:32.930> to

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
of a camera now the last thing I want to

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.259 
of a camera now the last thing I want to
see<00:03:33.200> on<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.470> galaxy<00:03:33.800> s6<00:03:33.950> is<00:03:34.430> better<00:03:34.640> speakers

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
see on the galaxy s6 is better speakers

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.870 
see on the galaxy s6 is better speakers
now<00:03:35.959> I<00:03:36.230> think<00:03:36.680> phone<00:03:37.190> manufacturers<00:03:37.790> actually

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
now I think phone manufacturers actually

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.729 
now I think phone manufacturers actually
underestimate<00:03:38.750> how<00:03:38.900> much<00:03:39.050> people<00:03:39.260> use<00:03:39.530> their

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
underestimate how much people use their

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.590 
underestimate how much people use their
phones<00:03:39.950> for<00:03:40.100> music<00:03:40.580> I<00:03:40.760> mean<00:03:40.880> for<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.450> lot<00:03:41.570> of

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
phones for music I mean for a lot of

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.720 
phones for music I mean for a lot of
people<00:03:41.900> it's<00:03:42.019> actually<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:42.350> primary<00:03:42.650> use<00:03:43.160> so

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
people it's actually the primary use so

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.490 
people it's actually the primary use so
what's<00:03:43.910> something<00:03:44.090> need<00:03:44.390> to<00:03:44.600> do<00:03:44.780> is<00:03:45.080> build<00:03:45.260> in

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
what's something need to do is build in

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.160 
what's something need to do is build in
a<00:03:45.739> dual<00:03:46.310> speaker<00:03:46.880> similar<00:03:47.209> to<00:03:47.330> that<00:03:47.450> HTC<00:03:47.930> One

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
a dual speaker similar to that HTC One

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.479 
a dual speaker similar to that HTC One
and<00:03:48.290> me<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.650> those<00:03:48.980> speakers<00:03:49.340> sound

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
and me and those speakers sound

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.640 
and me and those speakers sound
incredible<00:03:50.150> and<00:03:50.600> having<00:03:51.019> good<00:03:51.170> speakers<00:03:51.500> does

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
incredible and having good speakers does

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.410 
incredible and having good speakers does
a<00:03:51.680> lot<00:03:51.890> more<00:03:51.950> than<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:52.340> think<00:03:52.580> you<00:03:52.820> know<00:03:52.940> not

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
a lot more than you think you know not

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.610 
a lot more than you think you know not
only<00:03:53.480> does<00:03:53.690> it<00:03:53.810> make<00:03:53.930> your<00:03:54.019> music<00:03:54.200> more

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
only does it make your music more

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.080 
only does it make your music more
enjoyable<00:03:54.860> but<00:03:55.220> it<00:03:55.310> makes<00:03:55.430> all<00:03:55.549> your<00:03:55.640> videos

enjoyable but it makes all your videos

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.830 
enjoyable but it makes all your videos
more<00:03:56.299> enjoyable

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
more enjoyable

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.479 
more enjoyable
everything<00:03:57.590> you<00:03:57.709> do<00:03:57.830> on<00:03:57.860> your<00:03:58.100> phone<00:03:58.250> you<00:03:58.400> know

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
everything you do on your phone you know

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.490 
everything you do on your phone you know
your<00:03:58.640> games<00:03:58.880> your<00:03:59.420> apps<00:03:59.690> everything<00:04:00.140> just

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
your games your apps everything just

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.650 
your games your apps everything just
actually<00:04:00.650> comes<00:04:01.070> to<00:04:01.250> life<00:04:01.430> when<00:04:01.700> you<00:04:01.730> have<00:04:01.970> you

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
actually comes to life when you have you

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:04.360 
actually comes to life when you have you
know<00:04:02.690> dual<00:04:03.080> stereo<00:04:03.500> speakers<00:04:04.040> it<00:04:04.160> sound

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
know dual stereo speakers it sound

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.130 
know dual stereo speakers it sound
really<00:04:04.580> really<00:04:04.760> good<00:04:04.880> and<00:04:05.150> crisp<00:04:05.390> like<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:05.840> 1m

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
really really good and crisp like the 1m

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.050 
really really good and crisp like the 1m
aids<00:04:06.350> so<00:04:06.980> I<00:04:07.010> think<00:04:07.100> something<00:04:07.610> actually<00:04:07.730> has<00:04:08.030> a

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
aids so I think something actually has a

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.120 
aids so I think something actually has a
good<00:04:08.330> start<00:04:08.690> I<00:04:08.930> think<00:04:09.200> that<00:04:09.620> you<00:04:09.830> know<00:04:09.950> just

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
good start I think that you know just

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
good start I think that you know just
because<00:04:10.310> of<00:04:10.430> the<00:04:10.489> amount<00:04:10.610> of<00:04:10.700> buzz<00:04:10.910> that's

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
because of the amount of buzz that's

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.360 
because of the amount of buzz that's
created<00:04:11.570> on<00:04:11.720> Samsung's<00:04:12.200> devices<00:04:12.709> if<00:04:12.920> they

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
created on Samsung's devices if they

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.640 
created on Samsung's devices if they
nail<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:13.640> next<00:04:14.180> gen<00:04:14.390> Samsung<00:04:15.019> Galaxy

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
nail the next gen Samsung Galaxy

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.530 
nail the next gen Samsung Galaxy
you<00:04:15.920> know<00:04:16.070> it'll<00:04:16.250> just<00:04:16.280> be<00:04:16.489> ridiculous<00:04:17.390> I

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
you know it'll just be ridiculous I

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.360 
you know it'll just be ridiculous I
think<00:04:17.720> it<00:04:17.810> will<00:04:17.900> easily<00:04:18.200> outsold<00:04:18.859> the<00:04:18.979> iPhone

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
think it will easily outsold the iPhone

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.699 
think it will easily outsold the iPhone
so<00:04:19.729> for<00:04:20.000> example<00:04:20.419> the<00:04:20.510> Galaxy<00:04:20.900> s5<00:04:21.229> is<00:04:21.260> only<00:04:21.590> an

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
so for example the Galaxy s5 is only an

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.130 
so for example the Galaxy s5 is only an
incremental<00:04:22.340> improvement<00:04:22.430> on<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.060> s4<00:04:23.419> but<00:04:24.050> at

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
incremental improvement on the s4 but at

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.460 
incremental improvement on the s4 but at
the<00:04:24.200> same<00:04:24.380> time<00:04:24.650> it<00:04:24.830> like<00:04:24.950> how-to

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
the same time it like how-to

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.750 
the same time it like how-to
worldwide<00:04:25.770> success<00:04:26.070> you<00:04:26.430> know<00:04:26.520> it's<00:04:26.640> like

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
worldwide success you know it's like

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.460 
worldwide success you know it's like
some<00:04:26.970> songs<00:04:27.180> best-selling<00:04:27.750> smartphone<00:04:28.260> ever

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
some songs best-selling smartphone ever

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.190 
some songs best-selling smartphone ever
so<00:04:29.220> some<00:04:29.460> say<00:04:29.610> actually<00:04:29.940> managed<00:04:30.240> to<00:04:30.330> get<00:04:31.140> a

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
so some say actually managed to get a

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.350 
so some say actually managed to get a
revolutionary<00:04:32.190> phone<00:04:32.430> in<00:04:32.580> there<00:04:32.700> next<00:04:32.880> sort

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
revolutionary phone in there next sort

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.510 
revolutionary phone in there next sort
of<00:04:33.500> generation<00:04:34.500> I<00:04:34.740> think<00:04:34.980> they'll<00:04:35.070> just<00:04:35.220> blow

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
of generation I think they'll just blow
