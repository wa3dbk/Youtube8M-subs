00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.500 
the rule of thirds like if I want the
subject<00:05:44.560> it<00:05:45.039> should<00:05:45.520> be<00:05:45.669> add<00:05:45.849> at<00:05:46.270> the

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
subject it should be add at the

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.990 
subject it should be add at the
intersection<00:05:47.289> of<00:05:47.440> one<00:05:47.740> of<00:05:47.860> these<00:05:47.979> points<00:05:48.340> the

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
intersection of one of these points the

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.360 
intersection of one of these points the
focus<00:05:49.389> of<00:05:49.510> the<00:05:49.630> picture<00:05:49.990> is<00:05:50.169> that<00:05:50.199> watch<00:05:50.979> right

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
focus of the picture is that watch right

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.550 
focus of the picture is that watch right
so<00:05:52.120> if<00:05:52.180> I<00:05:52.270> don't<00:05:52.539> want<00:05:52.690> it<00:05:52.780> to<00:05:53.169> be<00:05:53.289> completely

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
so if I don't want it to be completely

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.560 
so if I don't want it to be completely
