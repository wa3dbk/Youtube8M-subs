00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.600 
them into the fire you know you
basically<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:01.439> sacrifice<00:02:02.100> them<00:02:02.280> to<00:02:02.369> get<00:02:02.460> the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610

scavenging<00:02:03.119> hyena<00:02:03.479> up<00:02:03.689> higher<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.200> also<00:02:05.130> a

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
scavenging hyena up higher and also a

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.770 
scavenging hyena up higher and also a
little<00:02:05.430> extra<00:02:05.759> bonus<00:02:06.119> if<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.360> if<00:02:06.570> you

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
little extra bonus if you if you

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.600 
little extra bonus if you if you
actually<00:02:06.930> have<00:02:07.259> snake<00:02:07.649> trap

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
actually have snake trap

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.029 
actually have snake trap
this<00:02:09.420> both<00:02:09.720> plays<00:02:10.080> nice<00:02:10.289> with<00:02:10.320> the<00:02:10.590> scavenging

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
this both plays nice with the scavenging

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.340 
this both plays nice with the scavenging
hyena<00:02:11.370> because<00:02:12.150> each<00:02:12.390> snake<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.870> dies<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.320> a

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
hyena because each snake that dies is a

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.590 
hyena because each snake that dies is a
beast<00:02:13.620> and<00:02:13.950> it<00:02:14.610> also<00:02:14.820> plays<00:02:15.120> nice<00:02:15.300> with<00:02:15.330> the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
beast and it also plays nice with the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.240 
beast and it also plays nice with the
starving<00:02:15.960> buzzard<00:02:16.290> because<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.860> counts<00:02:17.160> as

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
starving buzzard because it counts as

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.310 
starving buzzard because it counts as
three<00:02:17.280> beast<00:02:17.880> cards<00:02:18.120> summoned<00:02:18.750> so<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.110> can

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
three beast cards summoned so you can

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.660 
three beast cards summoned so you can
actually<00:02:19.440> get<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.770> draw<00:02:19.950> three<00:02:20.250> cards<00:02:20.280> from

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
actually get to draw three cards from

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.730 
actually get to draw three cards from
this<00:02:20.850> so<00:02:20.970> it's<00:02:21.120> really<00:02:21.270> nice<00:02:21.450> to<00:02:21.510> have<00:02:21.740> so

scavenging<00:05:17.730> hyena<00:05:18.030> and<00:05:18.440> you<00:05:19.440> know<00:05:19.530> you<00:05:19.590> won't

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
scavenging hyena and you know you won't

be able to set up combos like that or

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.300 
be able to set up combos like that or
you'll<00:05:21.630> just<00:05:21.750> never<00:05:21.960> get<00:05:22.229> the<00:05:22.320> damn<00:05:22.500> thing<00:05:22.830> in

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
you'll just never get the damn thing in

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.120 
you'll just never get the damn thing in
your<00:05:23.580> hand<00:05:23.729> but<00:05:24.150> as<00:05:24.900> you<00:05:25.020> can<00:05:25.110> see<00:05:25.290> in<00:05:25.380> 95<00:05:25.860> this

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
your hand but as you can see in 95 this

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.200 
your hand but as you can see in 95 this
early<00:05:26.430> on<00:05:26.550> it's<00:05:26.970> something<00:05:27.090> to<00:05:27.240> be<00:05:27.270> feared<00:05:27.600> and

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
early on it's something to be feared and

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.430 
early on it's something to be feared and
the<00:05:30.210> opponent<00:05:30.570> has<00:05:30.690> no<00:05:30.810> idea<00:05:31.080> what<00:05:31.229> to<00:05:31.290> do<00:05:31.410> with

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
the opponent has no idea what to do with

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.830 
the opponent has no idea what to do with
this<00:05:31.680> 95<00:05:32.190> so<00:05:33.030> he's<00:05:33.210> taking<00:05:33.540> his<00:05:33.630> sweet<00:05:33.840> time

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
this 95 so he's taking his sweet time

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.439 
this 95 so he's taking his sweet time
and<00:05:36.840> we<00:05:37.680> wait

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:39.449 
and we wait

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:41.570 
and we wait
and<00:05:39.629> that's<00:05:40.590> another<00:05:40.680> reason<00:05:40.889> why<00:05:41.189> the<00:05:41.340> the

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
and that's another reason why the the

Savannah hymen is also helpful because

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.260 
Savannah hymen is also helpful because
anything<00:05:44.099> that<00:05:44.279> has<00:05:44.490> death<00:05:44.789> rattle

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 
hyena see plays the taunt down but we're

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.640 
hyena see plays the taunt down but we're
not<00:06:51.150> gonna<00:06:51.240> let<00:06:51.480> that<00:06:51.540> scape<00:06:52.020> us<00:06:52.200> are<00:06:52.380> we<00:06:52.530> now

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
not gonna let that scape us are we now

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.530 
not gonna let that scape us are we now
because<00:06:52.890> we<00:06:53.010> have<00:06:53.040> explosive<00:06:53.550> shot<00:06:54.000> so<00:06:54.270> close

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:54.540 
because we have explosive shot so close

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:56.480 
because we have explosive shot so close
up<00:06:54.690> shots<00:06:54.900> gonna<00:06:55.140> remove<00:06:55.650> him<00:06:55.890> so<00:06:56.130> just<00:06:56.310> 5

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:56.490 
up shots gonna remove him so just 5

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.970 
up shots gonna remove him so just 5
damage<00:06:56.760> to<00:06:56.940> the<00:06:57.030> first<00:06:57.240> target<00:06:57.830> and<00:06:58.830> that

00:06:58.970 --> 00:06:58.980 
damage to the first target and that

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:02.840 
damage to the first target and that
cinches<00:06:59.310> the<00:06:59.370> game<00:07:01.010> so<00:07:02.010> as<00:07:02.100> you<00:07:02.160> can<00:07:02.310> see<00:07:02.550> that

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850 
cinches the game so as you can see that

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.900 
cinches the game so as you can see that
hung<00:07:03.510> in<00:07:03.750> it<00:07:03.900> I<00:07:04.220> mean<00:07:05.220> the<00:07:05.340> whole<00:07:05.460> deck<00:07:05.760> is

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:05.910 
hung in it I mean the whole deck is

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.150 
hung in it I mean the whole deck is
almost<00:07:06.180> it's<00:07:06.900> slightly<00:07:07.290> based<00:07:07.710> around<00:07:07.890> a

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 
almost it's slightly based around a

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.640 
almost it's slightly based around a
hyena<00:07:08.520> but<00:07:08.790> the<00:07:08.880> idea<00:07:09.240> is<00:07:09.300> that<00:07:09.450> you<00:07:09.960> know<00:07:10.380> you

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:10.650 
hyena but the idea is that you know you

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:12.320 
hyena but the idea is that you know you
get<00:07:10.800> a<00:07:10.830> lot<00:07:10.920> of<00:07:11.100> minions<00:07:11.610> you<00:07:11.940> grant<00:07:12.240> them

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330 
get a lot of minions you grant them

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.680 
get a lot of minions you grant them
charge<00:07:12.690> and<00:07:13.110> then<00:07:13.620> you<00:07:13.830> can<00:07:13.980> either<00:07:14.100> a

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:14.690 
charge and then you can either a

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.840 
charge and then you can either a
sacrifice<00:07:15.690> them<00:07:15.930> to<00:07:15.960> help<00:07:16.200> out<00:07:16.350> the<00:07:16.470> hyena

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:16.850 
sacrifice them to help out the hyena

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:18.830 
sacrifice them to help out the hyena
spawn<00:07:17.850> yummy<00:07:18.180> that<00:07:18.330> gives<00:07:18.480> you<00:07:18.570> a<00:07:18.600> lot<00:07:18.780> of

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 
spawn yummy that gives you a lot of

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.510 
spawn yummy that gives you a lot of
cards<00:07:19.320> I<00:07:19.440> mean<00:07:19.650> there's<00:07:19.800> a<00:07:19.860> lot<00:07:19.890> of<00:07:20.040> options

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 
cards I mean there's a lot of options

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.220 
cards I mean there's a lot of options
than<00:07:20.640> a<00:07:20.700> lot<00:07:20.730> of<00:07:20.850> synergy<00:07:21.360> but<00:07:21.960> that's<00:07:22.110> the

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:22.230 
than a lot of synergy but that's the

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:25.190 
than a lot of synergy but that's the
basic<00:07:22.380> idea<00:07:22.710> behind<00:07:23.160> the<00:07:23.640> beast<00:07:24.360> deck<00:07:24.660> or<00:07:24.930> I

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:25.200 
basic idea behind the beast deck or I

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.720 
basic idea behind the beast deck or I
suppose<00:07:25.350> you<00:07:25.620> can<00:07:25.800> call<00:07:25.980> it<00:07:26.040> the<00:07:26.130> hyena<00:07:26.460> deck

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:26.730 
suppose you can call it the hyena deck

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:31.130 
suppose you can call it the hyena deck
so<00:07:27.360> I<00:07:27.690> hope<00:07:28.020> this<00:07:28.080> was<00:07:28.380> helpful<00:07:28.410> and<00:07:29.040> I<00:07:30.140> suppose

so I hope this was helpful and I suppose

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:32.450 
so I hope this was helpful and I suppose
I<00:07:31.290> might<00:07:31.470> actually<00:07:31.650> see<00:07:31.980> some<00:07:32.160> more<00:07:32.250> people

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.460 
I might actually see some more people

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.100 
I might actually see some more people
after<00:07:32.820> this<00:07:32.940> video<00:07:33.240> using<00:07:33.450> this<00:07:33.630> debt<00:07:33.930> because
