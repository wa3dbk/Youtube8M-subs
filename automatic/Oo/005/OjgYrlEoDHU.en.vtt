00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
so just have a look at a buoyancy what

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.210 
so just have a look at a buoyancy what
are<00:00:02.310> the<00:00:02.399> options<00:00:03.090> have<00:00:03.210> we<00:00:03.300> got<00:00:03.799> well<00:00:04.799> moving

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
are the options have we got well moving

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.249 
are the options have we got well moving
on<00:00:05.370> from<00:00:05.490> that<00:00:05.700> you've<00:00:06.240> got<00:00:06.450> these<00:00:06.690> types<00:00:07.049> of

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
on from that you've got these types of

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.740 
on from that you've got these types of
lifejackets<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.639> problem<00:00:09.000> with<00:00:09.120> these<00:00:09.240> sort

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
lifejackets the problem with these sort

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.419 
lifejackets the problem with these sort
of<00:00:09.809> lifejackets<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.590> people<00:00:10.920> look<00:00:11.130> at<00:00:11.280> them

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
of lifejackets is people look at them

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.669 
of lifejackets is people look at them
and<00:00:11.639> they're<00:00:12.030> not<00:00:12.059> sure<00:00:12.570> what<00:00:13.440> mode<00:00:13.650> of

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
and they're not sure what mode of

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.250 
and they're not sure what mode of
operation<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.490> actually<00:00:15.240> this<00:00:15.570> lifejacket

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
operation is actually this lifejacket

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.930 
operation is actually this lifejacket
has<00:00:16.440> three<00:00:16.800> modes<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.160> operation<00:00:17.760> because

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
has three modes of operation because

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.330 
has three modes of operation because
it's<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.180> fully<00:00:18.480> automatic<00:00:19.020> lifejacket<00:00:19.770> which

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
it's a fully automatic lifejacket which

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.120 
it's a fully automatic lifejacket which
means<00:00:20.670> I<00:00:21.029> can<00:00:21.630> pull<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.260> toggle<00:00:22.590> which<00:00:22.980> it

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
means I can pull the toggle which it

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.670 
means I can pull the toggle which it
will<00:00:23.220> go<00:00:23.340> off<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.779> inside<00:00:24.779> just<00:00:25.350> to<00:00:25.439> show<00:00:25.619> you

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
will go off and inside just to show you

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:33.979 
will go off and inside just to show you
it<00:00:26.310> has<00:00:26.369> a<00:00:30.920> if<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:32.130> open<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.489> up<00:00:32.579> here<00:00:32.850> as<00:00:33.660> you<00:00:33.719> can

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
it has a if I open it up here as you can

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.040 
it has a if I open it up here as you can
see<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.710> ocean<00:00:35.070> safety<00:00:35.309> one<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.760> particular

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
see this ocean safety one in particular

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.950 
see this ocean safety one in particular
is<00:00:37.050> there<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.770> cylinder<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.960> what

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
is there is the cylinder and what

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.590 
is there is the cylinder and what
happens<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.770> if<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.670> pull<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.300> toggle

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
happens is this if I pull on this toggle

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.420 
happens is this if I pull on this toggle
that<00:00:42.960> will<00:00:43.110> pull<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.500> green<00:00:43.770> tab<00:00:44.100> out<00:00:44.280> which

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
that will pull that green tab out which

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.130 
that will pull that green tab out which
is<00:00:44.579> securing<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.149> at<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.329> moment<00:00:45.690> yeah<00:00:45.960> which

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
is securing it at the moment yeah which

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.900 
is securing it at the moment yeah which
will<00:00:46.289> then<00:00:46.410> activate<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.890> pin<00:00:47.219> going<00:00:47.520> into<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
will then activate a pin going into the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.540 
will then activate a pin going into the
cylinder<00:00:48.300> where<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.440> mechanism<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:50.370> as

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
cylinder where is this mechanism here as

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.150 
cylinder where is this mechanism here as
you<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.329> see<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.840> allows<00:00:52.469> water<00:00:52.800> ingress

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
you can see it allows water ingress

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.700 
you can see it allows water ingress
which<00:00:54.090> inside<00:00:54.570> you've<00:00:54.780> got<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.930> soluble<00:00:55.410> plug

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
which inside you've got a soluble plug

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.860 
which inside you've got a soluble plug
right<00:00:56.280> which<00:00:56.579> will<00:00:56.730> basically<00:00:56.910> expand<00:00:57.600> and

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
right which will basically expand and

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.580 
right which will basically expand and
insert<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.770> pin<00:00:59.010> into<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.399> tube<00:00:59.670> again

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
insert the pin into the tube again

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.990 
insert the pin into the tube again
inflating<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.710> lifejacket<00:01:01.890> now<00:01:02.699> just<00:01:02.910> to

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
inflating the lifejacket now just to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.759 
inflating the lifejacket now just to
show<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.270> what<00:01:03.480> side<00:01:03.780> they<00:01:04.049> sort<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.409> come<00:01:04.589> out

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
show you what side they sort of come out

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.899 
show you what side they sort of come out
to<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.850> roughly<00:01:06.659> something<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:08.159> okay

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
to is roughly something like that okay

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.250 
to is roughly something like that okay
so<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.180> lot<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.479> people<00:01:09.750> think<00:01:09.930> because<00:01:10.049> it

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
so a lot of people think because it

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.070 
so a lot of people think because it
looks<00:01:10.439> small<00:01:11.119> done<00:01:12.119> up<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.689> not<00:01:12.900> going<00:01:13.020> to

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
looks small done up it's not going to

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.179 
looks small done up it's not going to
support<00:01:13.350> them<00:01:13.560> but<00:01:13.650> I<00:01:13.740> think<00:01:13.950> you'll<00:01:14.070> agree

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
support them but I think you'll agree

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.550 
support them but I think you'll agree
even<00:01:15.030> on<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.360> what<00:01:15.750> that's<00:01:15.960> called<00:01:16.200> there<00:01:16.439> is<00:01:16.470> a

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
even on a what that's called there is a

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.440 
even on a what that's called there is a
a<00:01:17.090> 175<00:01:18.090> Newton<00:01:18.659> lifejacket<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.009> quite

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
a 175 Newton lifejacket this is quite

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.999 
a 175 Newton lifejacket this is quite
this<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.509> support<00:01:21.960> quite<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> large<00:01:22.500> person

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
this is support quite a large person

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.590 
this is support quite a large person
yeah<00:01:23.520> but<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:23.790> wouldn't<00:01:24.030> want<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.360> be

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
yeah but you wouldn't want it to be

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.780 
yeah but you wouldn't want it to be
fully<00:01:25.080> inflated<00:01:25.710> while<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.610> boat

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
fully inflated while you on the boat

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.190 
fully inflated while you on the boat
because<00:01:26.939> it<00:01:27.119> would<00:01:27.210> be<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.689> know<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:28.080> would

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
because it would be you know it would

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.590 
because it would be you know it would
get<00:01:28.320> anyway<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:28.710> that's<00:01:28.979> why<00:01:29.220> they

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
get anyway so that's why they

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.370 
get anyway so that's why they
manufacture<00:01:30.600> them<00:01:30.689> like<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.049> was<00:01:31.259> going

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
manufacture them like that I was going

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.539 
manufacture them like that I was going
to<00:01:31.470> say<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.680> wouldn't<00:01:31.950> think<00:01:32.159> there's<00:01:32.400> much

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
to say you wouldn't think there's much

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.940 
to say you wouldn't think there's much
flotation<00:01:33.210> in<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.560> but<00:01:34.560> when<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.740> see<00:01:34.920> it

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
flotation in that but when you see it

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.469 
flotation in that but when you see it
when<00:01:35.100> it's<00:01:35.250> fully<00:01:35.460> out<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.119> see<00:01:36.299> how

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
when it's fully out that you can see how

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.069 
when it's fully out that you can see how
it<00:01:36.600> works

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
it works

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.350 
it works
yeah<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.770> advantage<00:01:38.220> of<00:01:38.340> these<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.880> obviously

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
yeah the advantage of these is obviously

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.270 
yeah the advantage of these is obviously
it's<00:01:39.630> very<00:01:39.720> light<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.409> where<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.950> don't<00:01:41.159> know

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
it's very light to where you don't know

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.310 
it's very light to where you don't know
you've<00:01:41.430> got<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.700> on<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.780> what<00:01:42.930> are<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.079> common

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
you've got it on and what are the common

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.660 
you've got it on and what are the common
ask<00:01:43.530> questions<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.159> yeah<00:01:44.310> that's<00:01:44.520> all<00:01:44.640> good

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
ask questions is yeah that's all good
