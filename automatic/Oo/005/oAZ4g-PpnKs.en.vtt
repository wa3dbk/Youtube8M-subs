00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:08.320
 there is a pennies 25 pesetas for 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.410
 play street fighter 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.190
 Of course I could not miss here in 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:18.039
 you should play before you die a game 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.509
 like this one like street fighter 2 one of 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.000
 the best for all time for me 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:25.449
 and I especially like for this series 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.910
 you already know that it is not about the risk of 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:31.240
 before dying is not for me a series 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.309
 of good games simply but games 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.559
 that really as its name indicates 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.839
 you should play before you die ie 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.870
 you can play is very playable to day of 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:45.280
 today you have probably played 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.050
 the youngsters to the last of the fighter 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.020
 a street fighter 4 super street fighter 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.210
 4 and there are 25 thousand versions that have 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.739
 removed capcom from street fighter 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.500
 street fighter 3 to the best that has 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.719
 come out in downloadable but good 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.629
 first tee fighter appeared the year 87 if 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.920
 normal was not a game very much there only 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.619
 had two selectable characters that 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.380
 and deliver it in 91 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.960
 capcom presented this wonder raises 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.570
 coins literally the machines 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.640
 they received notices of 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.290
 repair notices constantly 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.020
 because he hopper of the coins was 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.190
 full 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:25.790
 and bases its success on 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.320
 I believe that in things in points 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.090
 strong who had the video games of 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.420
 the 90s 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.329
 and it was very simple very funny 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.020
 and that anyone could play without 

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.429
 make life too complicated 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.859
 another thing was that after you died step and 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:42.319
 fully placed closely and Mass 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:43.909
 my hands simple program a concept 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.789
 How could I have you actress or snow 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.569
 bros or any game of that and 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.600
 let's see what crazed that 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:52.590
 It was enough to fix you to the day of 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.539
 today is a game looks good 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.549
 it's a day that is a game that has 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.250
 has some good animations has some 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.770
 gigantic sprites and more for the time 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.240
 the characters are huge backgrounds 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.469
 they are huge has several planes of 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.319
 scroll and what to say is to say also that 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.629
 this game had a domestic version the 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:15.360
 first domestic version yes famous that 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:18.480
 it came out for super nintendo that was a 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.280
 20 consoles even came out an announcement of 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.110
 television that I remember street 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.390
 fighter 2 to make the bro of the beast 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.430
 and such that it really was amazing 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.270
 as one dies mine is eating 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.220
 now 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.960
 and that's saying that I love it is a 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.670
 awesome game that you must play if 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.290
 you have not played although the original is 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.860
 1 to 1 can jump completely 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.480
 something that was pretty 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.280
 It was not a bad game but certainly not 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.760
 it was street fighter 2 that has been the 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.700
 perfection made fight video game 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.129
 and that is to prove it to prove it with a 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.349
 emulator played super nintendo play it 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:56.510
 in mega drive tour versions came out for 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:01.810
 3d or even came out for game boy a 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.810
 somewhat unfortunate version amused 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.780
 it is a play not play not play 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.080
 It must be said that the following 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.940
 versions this this you are doing 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.280
 now with street fighter 4 they have 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.980
 taken from street fighter 4 super street 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.090
 fighter 4 super street fighter 4 arcade 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.800
 edition super street fighter 4 super 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.530
 arcade division 2013 look look for 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.550
 true to a small emphasis now here 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.980
 main seems to mean as now 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.360
 the new kick then from 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.920
 aversion the edition was extended if it remained 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.930
 that the kick of qena and in the car to a 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.030
 freak point and good that said this 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.980
 that makes helmet to take out 20 thousand versions 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.330
 he already did it in his day 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.670
 once in his life field appeared 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.400
 they say bad tongues or good tongues 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.870
 out there on the internet that because the 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.060
 recreational market was full 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.980
 of hacks of modified versions copies 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.480
 Chinese street fighter 2 out there with 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.320
 any changes even ye 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.280
 seen the shits that I have there 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.330
 would reflect under the street link 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.330
 fighter 2 rainbow edition 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.270
 because the market was full of 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.780
 copies of these 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.670
 and one of them was the possibility 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.170
 and play with the four bosses that are not 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.329
 selectable the four people from 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.549
 Endings and bosses can not be selected 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.490
 in the street fighter of original due 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.110
 because there were pirated versions that 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.120
 allowed play that the bosses allowed 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.670
 make new movements from the air and 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.120
 such 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.680
 the field decided to make its own version 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.080
 modified street fighter 2 the 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.370
 first was champions edition and then 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.050
 came the turbo version that went the most 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.210
 quickly and these versions allowed 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.670
 things like for example use according to 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.400
 that attacks in the air as I said 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:47.750
 they added a fireball for chuli 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.670
 they added the possibility that honda was 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.740
 move while social multi spanked 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:53.930
 etcetera etcetera a review of the 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.450
 game let's say and of course that's 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.940
 I could play professionally more 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.340
 later a version called super appeared 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.780
 street fighter 2 he had four 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.420
 new most added characters 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:09.740
 movements several colors for each 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:12.710
 character and such and the ending was that the 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.030
 super street fighter 2 turbo that was a 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.820
 version included all of the above and 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:18.540
 separate element of speed and a new 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.620
 energy bar 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:25.110
 that was leaving and we fought and allowed to do 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.760
 super movements is that I'm here 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.500
 will save the spam in doha dukes 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.210
 but to this when from another the machine and 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.200
 in love and war everything is worth 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.580
 of slut embryos 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.130
 and now is that it was not a very machine 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.400
 difficult but if you are a little attentive to 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.110
 game you will see that capcom in their games is 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.280
 pretty piggy with the difficulties not 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.790
 makes the difficulty by making the 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.860
 character fights better but simply 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:51.270
 gives you absurd advantages set the 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.640
 field advantage I just put a 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.720
 squirt but I should have killed 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.280
 but there he stayed with 0-2 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.520
 and apart also because they do many 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.520
 traps 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:07.539
 and command and can act on 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.759
 consequence if yes the game has decided 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:12.230
 that has already taken enough of your 25 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:19.280
 recipes and your currency 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:21.500
 stop subject is a system of difficulty 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.970
 it looks great on super street 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.980
 fighter the turbos because it is 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.360
 absurdly hard fact matters a 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.870
 the difficulty you choose in the 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:30.300
 machine 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:31.800
 because it is quite difficult 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:34.590
 machine tele movements and acting 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.330
 the revelation here acts less in fact 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.830
 now you will see that I am here I am 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.970
 killing the French with the truque t in your 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.050
 that you jump up is a 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:41.640
 character trying to grab you 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.930
 constantly you jump upwards 

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:44.880
 put a kick for a terrific fence and 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.570
 in fact I'm going to do a there is a 

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.570
 perfect lock 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:52.980
 good 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.870
 I think I think it's enough 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:58.290
 let's finish the round I hope that you 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.550
 have liked the said played his great game 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.610
 I just wanted to see you 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:04.860
 those people who are simpler 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.800
 you really have not had the 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:10.220
 opportunity to taste the street 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:16.030
 fighter 2 original is a game 

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:23.360
 that after so many years in 2013 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:25.729
 more than 20 years two years is a game for 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.339
 nintendo ds 

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:30.580
 I hope you liked it and even the 

00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:30.580
 next
