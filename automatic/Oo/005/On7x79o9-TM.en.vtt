00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.110 

one<00:02:11.069> second<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.519> think<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.819> just<00:02:11.849> need<00:02:12.000> to

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
one second I think you just need to

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.020 
one second I think you just need to
press<00:02:12.299> it<00:02:12.420> down<00:02:12.540> more<00:02:13.340> that<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.580> think<00:02:14.730> I'm

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
press it down more that I think I'm

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.030 
press it down more that I think I'm
failing<00:02:15.330> right<00:02:15.599> now<00:02:15.659> water<00:02:16.110> yeah<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.500> see

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
failing right now water yeah you see

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.070 
failing right now water yeah you see
so<00:02:17.370> just<00:02:17.549> needs<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.819> go<00:02:17.940> down<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.150> bit<00:02:18.330> more<00:02:18.540> so

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
so just needs to go down a bit more so

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.070 
so just needs to go down a bit more so
then<00:02:19.230> you'll<00:02:19.379> have<00:02:19.500> something<00:02:19.680> like<00:02:19.769> this
