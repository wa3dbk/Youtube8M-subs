00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.480
 but welcome again to browsing 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.490
 between books I am Yankee and the day of 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.199
 today as you can know by the title of 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.829
 this video here I'll tell you shortly 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:17.750
 of them open written by ian freed 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:20.029
 I think that about being one of the 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.980
 open wound authors is a trailer 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.650
 psychological that in the environment also 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.800
 of the lost book that he makes I think that a 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.070
 year or two years ago it was very much in the mouth 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.020
 of all the fillings he had is very very 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.670
 fashion that lost book was a book that 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.309
 caused a lot of fuss over the subject 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:41.149
 psychological that he had and open wounds 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.710
 apparently also contains part of 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.050
 that psychological trailer 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.539
 the author is characterized by writing 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.309
 this kind of books because because of what 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.120
 I could find out has another one that also 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.550
 the club calls the club of the club of the 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.260
 murderers I think something like that thing that 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.719
 specialist in 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.059
 from elias psychological thriller to diets 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.460
 begins with family history 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.409
 who is a girl who is a journalist 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.270
 in the city of chicago and they send it to 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.399
 cover a murder of a little girl 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.869
 to his hometown mom, well, exactly 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.299
 as the one who was called can 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.259
 download over here and it happens that to the 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:21.170
 girl murdered her in a very ugly way 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.880
 they suffocated her and there is a characteristic 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.960
 which is that his teeth are removed and 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.000
 as to how you brush your teeth but yes 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.819
 so they also have to investigate 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.539
 these murders to be able to take the 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:37.940
 exclusive to your newspaper that in newspaper 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:40.250
 medium did not look much in chicago 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.470
 he was not very well known but they wanted to have 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.539
 the exclusive of that case but it turns out 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.479
 that the town of Camille is quite 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.729
 strange because it has some modalities and 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:52.770
 very strange customs people 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.869
 that from there everything has to be perfect 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.030
 and girls have to be very feminine 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.240
 Men have to be very macho 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.759
 in a certain way and mom's 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.729
 Camila has a terrible relationship with 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.920
 they get very bad basically 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.190
 because Camila's mom wanted me to 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.900
 outside the 1000 mark is called adores and 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.209
 she wanted me to be a girl too 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.370
 perfect but it was always a 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.370
 very rebellious girl and kept many 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.620
 things and now that he goes back to his city 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.769
 natal all those things like they start 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.040
 to come out afloat so all this from the 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:31.860
 murders of the girl who justly 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.450
 a few months ago it had also been 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.769
 murdered another girl in the same way 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.569
 begins to turn around the 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.110
 road history and the citizens of 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.260
 webcams 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.849
 I do not want to tell you much about the story 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.950
 of the plot of the book because basically 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.170
 in the plot of the book are found 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.090
 all the details to know who is 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.420
 the serial killer of these two little girls 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.860
 It's a book that I loved very much 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.180
 open wounds of truth that I 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.189
 surprised I can 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.349
 I asked for this was a random collaboration 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.180
 house when I asked for it, you do not leave me 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.549
 what I could do like that basically was 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.560
 because this is the agriculture of loss 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.079
 they say 13 books very good can be the 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.909
 puntito si libro vélez and stay 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.489
 totally surprised because the book 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:18.900
 It's great for an hour or something 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.430
 back on sunday weekend and I do not know 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.950
 when will I upload this video so 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.540
 I do not know when you are going to see him 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.290
 I said I have a led the review already 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.329
 because the book I loved the end and you 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.250
 you think that up to a certain point 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.409
 until the end but when it continues 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.689
 telling the story narrates the way 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.400
 in the first person then when 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:40.290
 he also keeps telling us he has to 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.569
 happened after he allegedly 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.540
 found the killer and all that is something 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:48.780
 that you want as well as but as never 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.250
 I saw it coming or maybe I saw it coming but 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.159
 I never really imagined that 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:56.080
 truth could be that person is not step 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.120
 mucus and mom adores camila 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.000
 and I was reading it and already on the page 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.210
 100 and that on the page 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.730
 80 already began to feel like a kind 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:09.130
 of chills because every time the 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.100
 they described and the things he said and how 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.570
 spoke and all that was like there is not 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:18.070
 because it gives me a very 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:22.090
 strange that that woman is very very very 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.370
 strange but is very well written 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:28.060
 author knows how to get the attention of 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.700
 that of the reader because it is very good 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.620
 written is all all the lists 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.600
 of history are covered in the 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.970
 end of the book or rather by telespán 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.750
 explaining as nothing happens 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.180
 truthfully recommend it and that is already here 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.340
 the review of them open I'm going to 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.260
 leave the link to the review I did in the 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.270
 much more detailed blog where I speak 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.270
 objectively of paragraph books 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.690
 of the construction of the word of 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.560
 gillian and without saying that you guys if you 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.480
 taste 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.220
 that is, if you have already read this book or if 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.150
 they would have lost so they recommend me 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.310
 to read it because 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.720
 very much desire to do it as always 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:05.860
 all social networks will be 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.690
 There is little in the little box 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:13.170
 description I say goodbye see you in 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.170
 a next video very well and goodbye
