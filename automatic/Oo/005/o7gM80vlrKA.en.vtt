00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.290 
some fences up but I will I was out here
I<00:00:07.950> figured<00:00:08.280> I'd<00:00:08.340> light<00:00:08.519> up<00:00:08.670> this<00:00:08.790> brush<00:00:09.030> pile

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
I figured I'd light up this brush pile

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.499 
I figured I'd light up this brush pile
I'd<00:00:09.650> take<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.679> little<00:00:10.889> cardboard<00:00:11.429> and<00:00:11.580> which<00:00:12.360> we

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
I'd take a little cardboard and which we

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.180 
I'd take a little cardboard and which we
call<00:00:12.690> it<00:00:12.900> scrap<00:00:13.440> wood<00:00:13.650> and<00:00:13.799> stuff<00:00:13.950> out<00:00:14.160> here

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
call it scrap wood and stuff out here

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.820 
call it scrap wood and stuff out here
and<00:00:14.639> as<00:00:14.940> you<00:00:15.509> can<00:00:15.660> see<00:00:15.690> it's<00:00:16.109> getting<00:00:16.680> rather

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
and as you can see it's getting rather

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.140 
and as you can see it's getting rather
large<00:00:17.300> there's<00:00:18.980> just<00:00:19.980> right<00:00:20.130> there<00:00:20.340> about<00:00:20.640> 500

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
large there's just right there about 500

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.509 
large there's just right there about 500
gallons<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.660> planar<00:00:21.990> chips<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.590> scrap<00:00:23.310> wood

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
gallons of planar chips and scrap wood

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.939
