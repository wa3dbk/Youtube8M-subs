00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
ebay about four months ago it's got a

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.859 
ebay about four months ago it's got a
temperature<00:02:02.549> sensor<00:02:02.850> problem<00:02:03.479> we<00:02:03.600> think

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
temperature sensor problem we think

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.020 
temperature sensor problem we think
because<00:02:04.020> when<00:02:04.320> it<00:02:04.439> starts<00:02:04.979> when<00:02:05.579> it's<00:02:05.729> cold

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
because when it starts when it's cold

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.020 
because when it starts when it's cold
the<00:02:06.869> engine<00:02:07.170> will<00:02:07.259> start<00:02:07.439> up<00:02:07.860> fine<00:02:08.190> then<00:02:08.670> die

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
the engine will start up fine then die

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.949 
the engine will start up fine then die
and<00:02:10.400> once<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:11.580> warmed<00:02:11.849> up<00:02:12.000> it<00:02:12.569> runs<00:02:12.840> fine

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
and once it's warmed up it runs fine

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.369 
and once it's warmed up it runs fine
it's<00:02:15.959> got<00:02:16.140> fog<00:02:16.469> lights<00:02:16.709> as<00:02:16.950> well<00:02:18.170> that's<00:02:19.170> all

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
it's got fog lights as well that's all

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.709 
it's got fog lights as well that's all
ready<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.280> show<00:02:20.459> you<00:02:20.549> about<00:02:20.609> the<00:02:20.790> car<00:02:20.969> see<00:02:21.629> you
