then<00:02:47.630> we're<00:02:47.780> going<00:02:47.960> to<00:02:48.080> wrap<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.800> yarn<00:02:48.830> around

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
then we're going to wrap the yarn around

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.020 
then we're going to wrap the yarn around
the<00:02:49.580> bottom<00:02:50.770> pull<00:02:51.770> that<00:02:51.980> through<00:02:52.310> both<00:02:52.640> loops

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
the bottom pull that through both loops

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.980 
the bottom pull that through both loops
and<00:02:53.480> we're<00:02:54.350> going<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.560> just<00:02:55.210> drop<00:02:56.210> the<00:02:56.690> first

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
and we're going to just drop the first

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.170 
and we're going to just drop the first
stitch<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:59.450> repeat<00:02:59.690> the<00:03:00.020> slip<00:03:00.350> slip<00:03:00.680> knit

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
stitch and repeat the slip slip knit

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.420 
stitch and repeat the slip slip knit
dropping<00:03:02.180> only<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.600> first<00:03:02.870> stitch<00:03:03.230> until<00:03:04.130> the

dropping only the first stitch until the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.210 
dropping only the first stitch until the
end<00:03:04.610> of<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.850> row<00:03:05.050> until<00:03:06.050> you<00:03:06.140> have<00:03:06.230> one<00:03:06.470> stitch

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
end of the row until you have one stitch

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.070 
end of the row until you have one stitch
left<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.880> then<00:03:08.120> you'll<00:03:08.300> knit<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.900> last

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
left and then you'll knit the last

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.550 
left and then you'll knit the last
stitch<00:03:09.730> row<00:03:10.730> two<00:03:11.020> we're<00:03:12.020> going<00:03:12.110> to<00:03:12.200> begin<00:03:12.380> our

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
stitch row two we're going to begin our

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.730 
stitch row two we're going to begin our
pattern<00:03:13.070> by<00:03:13.310> purling<00:03:13.970> two<00:03:14.300> together<00:03:14.600> so<00:03:15.320> slip

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:15.740 
pattern by purling two together so slip

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.050 
pattern by purling two together so slip
through<00:03:16.610> the<00:03:16.760> first<00:03:17.030> two<00:03:17.390> stitches<00:03:17.750> purl<00:03:18.620> wise

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
through the first two stitches purl wise

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.640 
through the first two stitches purl wise
then<00:03:20.060> we're<00:03:20.209> going<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.510> wrap<00:03:20.750> our<00:03:20.990> yarn<00:03:21.050> around

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
then we're going to wrap our yarn around

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.440 
then we're going to wrap our yarn around
the<00:03:21.950> top<00:03:22.340> needle<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:23.350> pull<00:03:24.350> that<00:03:24.620> through

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
the top needle and pull that through

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.910 
the top needle and pull that through
both<00:03:26.450> stitches<00:03:26.660> to<00:03:27.440> make<00:03:27.470> sure<00:03:27.770> that

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
both stitches to make sure that

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.620 
both stitches to make sure that
everything's<00:03:28.459> really<00:03:28.850> loose<00:03:29.090> you<00:03:29.300> want<00:03:29.390> to<00:03:29.510> be

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
everything's really loose you want to be

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.010 
everything's really loose you want to be
loose<00:03:29.990> on<00:03:30.290> your<00:03:30.950> yarn<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.820> entire<00:03:32.300> pattern

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
loose on your yarn the entire pattern

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.660 
loose on your yarn the entire pattern
because<00:03:33.350> this<00:03:33.530> can<00:03:33.709> get<00:03:33.830> really<00:03:34.190> tight<00:03:34.430> really

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
because this can get really tight really

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.790 
because this can get really tight really
easily<00:03:35.090> and<00:03:35.420> then<00:03:36.110> we're<00:03:36.230> just<00:03:36.260> going<00:03:36.470> to<00:03:36.530> pull

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
easily and then we're just going to pull

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.150 
easily and then we're just going to pull
off<00:03:37.010> that<00:03:37.700> first<00:03:38.060> stitch<00:03:38.420> and<00:03:38.750> then<00:03:38.890> purl<00:03:39.890> two

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
off that first stitch and then purl two

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:46.369 
off that first stitch and then purl two
together<00:03:40.430> again<00:03:42.670> and<00:03:43.670> slip<00:03:44.480> through

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
together again and slip through

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:55.340 
together again and slip through
wrap<00:03:47.189> your<00:03:47.400> yarn<00:03:47.430> around

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.640 

and<00:03:56.350> I'm<00:03:56.680> using<00:03:56.890> really<00:03:57.190> big<00:03:57.430> needles<00:03:57.850> on<00:03:58.030> this

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
and I'm using really big needles on this

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.400 
and I'm using really big needles on this
bigger<00:03:59.650> than<00:03:59.710> normal<00:04:00.840> because<00:04:01.840> it<00:04:02.110> helps

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
bigger than normal because it helps

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.550 
bigger than normal because it helps
getting<00:04:03.130> through<00:04:03.400> all<00:04:03.730> these<00:04:04.390> stitches<00:04:04.810> most

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
getting through all these stitches most

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.870 
getting through all these stitches most
of<00:04:05.710> the<00:04:05.800> patterns<00:04:06.130> that<00:04:06.190> I've<00:04:06.370> seen<00:04:06.610> using

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
of the patterns that I've seen using

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.390 
of the patterns that I've seen using
this<00:04:07.210> stitch<00:04:07.480> are<00:04:07.840> on<00:04:08.080> the<00:04:08.200> size<00:04:08.410> Thirteen's

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
this stitch are on the size Thirteen's

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:20.030 
this stitch are on the size Thirteen's
at<00:04:09.730> least<00:04:14.520> okay<00:04:15.520> we'll<00:04:16.000> pull<00:04:16.269> through<00:04:18.390> and

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
at least okay we'll pull through and

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.520 
at least okay we'll pull through and
slip<00:04:21.040> that<00:04:21.280> first<00:04:21.360> stitch<00:04:22.360> off<00:04:22.840> you<00:04:23.350> could

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
slip that first stitch off you could

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.740 
slip that first stitch off you could
continue<00:04:23.950> the<00:04:24.280> purl<00:04:24.520> two<00:04:24.760> together<00:04:24.940> until<00:04:25.450> the

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
continue the purl two together until the

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.080 
continue the purl two together until the
end<00:04:25.780> of<00:04:26.050> the<00:04:26.200> row<00:04:26.410> and<00:04:26.680> when<00:04:27.550> you<00:04:27.640> have<00:04:27.790> one

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
end of the row and when you have one

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.010 
end of the row and when you have one
stitch<00:04:28.420> left<00:04:28.450> you're<00:04:29.410> just<00:04:29.590> going<00:04:29.740> to<00:04:29.770> purl

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
stitch left you're just going to purl

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.810 
stitch left you're just going to purl
so<00:04:32.020> repeat<00:04:32.350> rows<00:04:32.590> one<00:04:32.890> and<00:04:32.920> two<00:04:33.250> until<00:04:33.700> you

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:33.820 
so repeat rows one and two until you

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.810 
so repeat rows one and two until you
have<00:04:33.970> reached<00:04:34.210> your<00:04:34.330> desired<00:04:34.570> width<00:04:35.820> remember

have reached your desired width remember
that<00:04:36.970> this<00:04:37.090> pattern<00:04:37.510> will<00:04:37.720> not<00:04:37.990> reveal<00:04:38.560> itself

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
that this pattern will not reveal itself

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.190 
that this pattern will not reveal itself
until<00:04:39.490> you<00:04:39.700> have<00:04:39.940> two<00:04:40.780> rows<00:04:41.190> completed<00:04:42.190> after

a<00:04:44.200> few<00:04:44.530> repeats<00:04:44.980> your<00:04:45.310> pattern<00:04:45.700> should<00:04:45.730> look

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
a few repeats your pattern should look
