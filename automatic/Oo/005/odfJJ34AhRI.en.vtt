the<00:00:12.929> new<00:00:13.190> technology<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.309> going<00:00:14.459> to<00:00:14.580> talk

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
the new technology is going to talk

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.690 
the new technology is going to talk
about<00:00:14.910> this<00:00:15.629> yes<00:00:16.170> Anna<00:00:16.410> so<00:00:16.770> we<00:00:17.310> have<00:00:17.460> this

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:17.700 
about this yes Anna so we have this

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.930 
about this yes Anna so we have this
technology<00:00:18.000> that<00:00:18.690> it's<00:00:18.869> called<00:00:19.200> dipg<00:00:20.010> it's<00:00:20.760> a

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:20.940 
technology that it's called dipg it's a

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.460 
technology that it's called dipg it's a
new<00:00:21.090> technology<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:22.170> have<00:00:22.260> been

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
new technology that you have been

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.250 
new technology that you have been
developing<00:00:23.250> since<00:00:24.230> more<00:00:25.230> than<00:00:25.340> two<00:00:26.340> years<00:00:26.610> and

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
developing since more than two years and

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.130 
developing since more than two years and
this<00:00:28.260> technology<00:00:28.580> gives<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.850> possibility<00:00:30.360> to

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
this technology gives the possibility to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.360 
this technology gives the possibility to
make<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.770> fusion<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.989> graphics<00:00:34.469> into

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
make the fusion of the the graphics into

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.000 
make the fusion of the the graphics into
the<00:00:35.519> plastic<00:00:35.730> parts<00:00:36.329> as<00:00:37.109> you<00:00:37.320> probably

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
the plastic parts as you probably

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.020 
the plastic parts as you probably
already<00:00:38.519> know<00:00:39.800> on<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.129> class<00:00:41.370> they<00:00:41.399> have<00:00:41.760> used

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
already know on the class they have used

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.959 
already know on the class they have used
these<00:00:42.300> stickers<00:00:42.809> graphics<00:00:43.589> to<00:00:44.219> glue<00:00:44.699> it<00:00:44.730> into

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
these stickers graphics to glue it into

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.130 
these stickers graphics to glue it into
the<00:00:45.210> plastic<00:00:45.449> parts<00:00:46.019> now<00:00:46.559> polisport<00:00:47.249> using<00:00:48.149> we

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
the plastic parts now polisport using we

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.340 
the plastic parts now polisport using we
have<00:00:49.319> a<00:00:49.350> new<00:00:49.679> technology<00:00:50.429> that<00:00:50.460> allow<00:00:51.239> us<00:00:51.510> to

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
have a new technology that allow us to

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.669 
have a new technology that allow us to
fix<00:00:52.589> directly<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:55.050> stickers<00:00:55.499> the

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
fix directly the the stickers the

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:58.250 
fix directly the the stickers the
graphics<00:00:56.129> during<00:00:56.729> the<00:00:56.940> injection<00:00:57.510> process<00:00:57.719> as

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
graphics during the injection process as

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.459 
graphics during the injection process as
you<00:00:58.829> can<00:00:59.039> feel<00:00:59.309> as<00:00:59.670> you<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.690> feel<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.109> can<00:01:01.319> you

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
you can feel as you can feel you can you

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.790 
you can feel as you can feel you can you
can<00:01:01.889> feel<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.629> decorated<00:01:03.629> graphics<00:01:04.199> it's

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
can feel the decorated graphics it's

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.310 
can feel the decorated graphics it's
impossible<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.880> peel<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.510> off<00:01:06.690> is<00:01:07.259> a

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
impossible to peel it off is a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.810 
impossible to peel it off is a
completely<00:01:08.159> fusion<00:01:08.820> into<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.600> plastics

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.050 

Pedro<00:01:14.780> sadly<00:01:15.260> project<00:01:15.680> leader<00:01:15.950> or<00:01:16.280> these<00:01:16.460> ipd

Pedro sadly project leader or these ipd

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.980 
Pedro sadly project leader or these ipd
okay<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:18.140> so<00:01:18.770> for<00:01:19.310> this<00:01:19.520> technology<00:01:20.060> the<00:01:20.810> main

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
okay and so for this technology the main

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.430 
okay and so for this technology the main
benefits<00:01:21.620> of<00:01:21.740> this<00:01:22.100> it's<00:01:22.580> a<00:01:22.910> anti-scratch<00:01:23.870> the

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
benefits of this it's a anti-scratch the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.590 
benefits of this it's a anti-scratch the
first<00:01:24.650> very<00:01:24.920> important<00:01:25.400> deal<00:01:25.700> and<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.450> other

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
first very important deal and the other

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.200 
first very important deal and the other
is<00:01:27.080> very<00:01:27.470> difficult<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:28.250> remove<00:01:28.550> not<00:01:28.820> possible

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
is very difficult to remove not possible

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.760 
is very difficult to remove not possible
to<00:01:29.300> remove<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.690> graphics<00:01:30.110> graphics<00:01:30.380> are

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
to remove the graphics graphics are

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.810 
to remove the graphics graphics are
impregnated<00:01:31.400> on<00:01:31.580> top<00:01:31.820> plastic<00:01:33.400> EPD<00:01:34.400> levels

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
impregnated on top plastic EPD levels

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.999 
impregnated on top plastic EPD levels
are<00:01:34.970> three<00:01:35.270> times<00:01:35.479> lighter<00:01:35.840> than<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.350> current

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
are three times lighter than the current

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.969 
are three times lighter than the current
the<00:01:37.700> conventional<00:01:38.509> sticker<00:01:38.840> this<00:01:39.350> is<00:01:39.560> the

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
the conventional sticker this is the

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.219 
the conventional sticker this is the
environment<00:01:40.220> friendly<00:01:40.640> this<00:01:41.630> is<00:01:41.750> important

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
environment friendly this is important

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:44.380 
environment friendly this is important
because<00:01:42.320> it<00:01:42.680> could<00:01:42.830> recycle<00:01:43.220> this<00:01:43.490> product<00:01:43.910> is

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
because it could recycle this product is

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.480 
because it could recycle this product is
that<00:01:44.660> enough<00:01:45.020> cleaning<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:45.650> external<00:01:46.190> level

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
that enough cleaning the external level

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.510 
that enough cleaning the external level
okay<00:01:46.940> we<00:01:47.450> could<00:01:47.660> we<00:01:48.050> despite<00:01:48.410> f<00:01:48.890> depart<00:01:49.310> and

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
okay we could we despite f depart and

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.029 
okay we could we despite f depart and
put<00:01:49.700> on<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:49.850> bike<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.270> go<00:01:50.479> ready<00:01:50.960> to<00:01:51.380> drive

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
put on the bike and go ready to drive

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:57.180 
put on the bike and go ready to drive
this<00:01:52.430> is<00:01:52.729> also<00:01:52.970> important<00:01:53.570> no<00:01:53.750> extra<00:01:54.560> labor

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.310 

this<00:01:58.190> is<00:01:58.340> a<00:01:58.369> really<00:01:58.910> revolutionary<00:01:59.720> product
