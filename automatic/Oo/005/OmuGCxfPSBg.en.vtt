this it's the feet electric or the

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.880 
this it's the feet electric or the
original<00:00:05.670> vintage<00:00:06.029> style<00:00:06.299> bulb<00:00:06.540> it<00:00:06.750> is<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.440> bulb

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
original vintage style bulb it is a bulb

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.160 
original vintage style bulb it is a bulb
designed<00:00:08.429> to<00:00:08.910> look<00:00:09.269> like<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:10.139> original

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
designed to look like the original

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.340 
designed to look like the original
Edison<00:00:10.860> bulbs<00:00:13.490> it<00:00:14.490> was<00:00:14.610> eight<00:00:14.820> dollars<00:00:15.350> well

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
Edison bulbs it was eight dollars well

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.620 
Edison bulbs it was eight dollars well
it's<00:00:16.500> kind<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.460> interesting<00:00:18.000> it's

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
it's kind of interesting it's

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.769 
it's kind of interesting it's
interesting<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.170> have<00:00:19.289> a<00:00:19.320> bulb<00:00:19.560> like<00:00:19.619> this

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
interesting to have a bulb like this

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.240 
interesting to have a bulb like this
it's<00:00:21.779> really<00:00:22.050> interesting<00:00:22.260> that<00:00:22.500> the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
it's really interesting that the

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.509 
it's really interesting that the
filament<00:00:24.109> isn't<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.199> spring<00:00:25.590> it's<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:26.039> single

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
filament isn't a spring it's a single

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.810 
filament isn't a spring it's a single
wire<00:00:27.439> that's<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.650> string<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.160> moon<00:00:29.609> about

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
wire that's a string of a moon about

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.189 
wire that's a string of a moon about
inside<00:00:30.210> there<00:00:30.480> so<00:00:30.869> that's<00:00:31.019> pretty

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
inside there so that's pretty

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:31.820 
inside there so that's pretty
interesting

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
interesting

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.340 
interesting
it's<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.730> 60<00:00:33.059> watt<00:00:33.210> bulb<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.809> should<00:00:34.110> take

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
it's a 60 watt bulb so that should take

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.540 
it's a 60 watt bulb so that should take
about<00:00:34.469> half<00:00:34.860> an<00:00:35.010> amp<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.370> power<00:00:36.800> I'm<00:00:37.800> not<00:00:38.370> so

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
about half an amp of power I'm not so

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.200 
about half an amp of power I'm not so
sure<00:00:38.579> how<00:00:38.910> old<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.239> bowl<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:41.030> this<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.149> a

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
sure how old this bowl is this is a

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.130 
sure how old this bowl is this is a
General<00:00:42.540> Electric<00:00:42.600> one

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
General Electric one

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.380 
General Electric one
I<00:00:43.170> found<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.710> years<00:00:44.219> ago<00:00:44.520> Rick<00:00:44.940> for<00:00:45.149> 50

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
I found this years ago Rick for 50

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.959 
I found this years ago Rick for 50
Cent's<00:00:45.690> I<00:00:45.870> guess<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:47.010> probably<00:00:47.100> 1920s<00:00:47.850> or<00:00:47.910> so

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
Cent's I guess it's probably 1920s or so

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.560 
Cent's I guess it's probably 1920s or so
this<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.320> lot<00:00:50.010> newer<00:00:50.460> than<00:00:50.640> well<00:00:51.210> this<00:00:51.329> was

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
this is a lot newer than well this was

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.170 
this is a lot newer than well this was
designed<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:52.020> be<00:00:52.079> but<00:00:52.949> I<00:00:53.010> say<00:00:53.280> let's<00:00:53.789> open<00:00:53.969> this

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
designed to be but I say let's open this

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:01.360 
designed to be but I say let's open this
up<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.510> see<00:00:54.840> what<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.989> looks<00:00:55.110> like

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:12.490 

stupid<00:01:02.370> boxing

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.530 

so<00:01:13.100> here<00:01:13.250> we<00:01:13.370> have<00:01:13.490> my<00:01:13.640> portable<00:01:13.940> light<00:01:14.210> unit

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
so here we have my portable light unit

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.790 
so here we have my portable light unit
yes<00:01:14.750> she<00:01:14.960> has<00:01:15.140> an<00:01:15.650> old<00:01:16.040> IBM<00:01:17.260> alarm<00:01:18.260> on<00:01:18.500> it<00:01:18.530> which

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
yes she has an old IBM alarm on it which

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.490 
yes she has an old IBM alarm on it which
is<00:01:18.830> kind<00:01:19.070> of<00:01:19.100> interesting<00:01:20.080> anyway<00:01:21.080> so<00:01:21.140> let's

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
is kind of interesting anyway so let's

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.010 
is kind of interesting anyway so let's
take<00:01:21.680> this<00:01:21.830> bulb<00:01:22.750> which<00:01:23.750> looks<00:01:23.960> pretty

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
take this bulb which looks pretty

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:41.149 
take this bulb which looks pretty
interesting<00:01:34.330> well<00:01:35.330> that's<00:01:35.510> cool<00:01:35.810> I<00:01:36.110> like<00:01:36.620> that

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.700 

in<00:01:41.640> person<00:01:42.329> you<00:01:42.659> can<00:01:42.810> obviously<00:01:43.229> see<00:01:43.680> the

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
in person you can obviously see the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.789 
in person you can obviously see the
filaments<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.610> does<00:01:44.969> not<00:01:45.210> look<00:01:45.560> too<00:01:46.560> bright

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
filaments it does not look too bright

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.969 
filaments it does not look too bright
like<00:01:47.310> most<00:01:47.969> bulbs<00:01:48.360> because<00:01:48.659> see<00:01:49.049> thing<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
like most bulbs because see thing is the

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.480 
like most bulbs because see thing is the
filament<00:01:50.340> is<00:01:50.670> spaced<00:01:51.030> out<00:01:51.240> over<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.659> large<00:01:51.869> area

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
filament is spaced out over a large area

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.029 
filament is spaced out over a large area
like<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.640> yellowish<00:01:53.939> light<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.329> gives<00:01:54.509> to

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
like the yellowish light it gives to

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:09.770 
like the yellowish light it gives to
turn<00:01:56.039> off<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.369> light<00:02:01.009> turn<00:02:02.009> off<00:02:02.159> this<00:02:02.399> light

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.100 

if<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:10.990> were<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.319> use<00:02:11.620> this<00:02:12.550> in<00:02:12.880> a<00:02:13.120> steampunky

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
if I were to use this in a steampunky

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.220 
if I were to use this in a steampunky
there<00:02:14.650> is<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.830> steampunk<00:02:15.250> kind<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:16.060> lamp<00:02:16.330> that

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
there is a steampunk kind of lamp that

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.170 
there is a steampunk kind of lamp that
would<00:02:17.380> look<00:02:17.470> pretty<00:02:17.620> nice<00:02:17.860> I<00:02:18.130> like<00:02:18.819> that<00:02:19.000> quite

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
would look pretty nice I like that quite

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.940 
would look pretty nice I like that quite
a<00:02:19.209> bit

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.960 

the<00:02:23.950> camera<00:02:24.220> is<00:02:24.280> adjusting<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.760> brightness

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
the camera is adjusting the brightness

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.600 
the camera is adjusting the brightness
and<00:02:25.720> there<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.290> can<00:02:26.410> see<00:02:26.470> on<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.709> inside<00:02:26.800> this

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
and there you can see on the inside this

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.559 
and there you can see on the inside this
is<00:02:27.850> how<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.600> bulb<00:02:28.870> looks<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.800> human<00:02:30.160> eyes<00:02:30.569> just

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
is how the bulb looks to human eyes just

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.080 
is how the bulb looks to human eyes just
from<00:02:31.930> far<00:02:32.140> away<00:02:32.260> of<00:02:33.010> course<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.430> camera<00:02:33.790> can't

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
from far away of course the camera can't

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.240 
from far away of course the camera can't
really<00:02:34.390> it<00:02:35.140> can't<00:02:35.440> have<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.800> background

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
really it can't have the background

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.570 
really it can't have the background
light<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:36.819> that<00:02:37.390> dim<00:02:37.870> sum<00:02:38.800> how<00:02:38.920> our<00:02:39.100> eyes<00:02:39.280> are

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
light and that dim sum how our eyes are

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.920 
light and that dim sum how our eyes are
a<00:02:39.610> little<00:02:39.640> bit<00:02:39.880> better<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:40.269> that<00:02:40.300> so<00:02:40.570> it<00:02:40.690> can<00:02:40.810> do

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
a little bit better so that so it can do

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.130 
a little bit better so that so it can do
that<00:02:41.850> yeah<00:02:42.850> that's<00:02:43.120> how<00:02:43.239> the<00:02:43.300> bulb<00:02:43.540> looks<00:02:43.720> from

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
that yeah that's how the bulb looks from

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:45.810 
that yeah that's how the bulb looks from
far<00:02:44.380> away<00:02:44.650> which<00:02:45.130> is<00:02:45.220> pretty<00:02:45.370> interesting

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
far away which is pretty interesting

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.540 
far away which is pretty interesting
it's<00:02:46.000> it's<00:02:46.269> not<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:47.110> ball<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.769> glowing<00:02:48.070> like

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
it's it's not the ball of glowing like

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.520 
it's it's not the ball of glowing like
it<00:02:48.640> is<00:02:48.760> now<00:02:48.940> this<00:02:49.660> thing<00:02:49.900> puts<00:02:50.080> off<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.260> lot<00:02:50.500> of

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
it is now this thing puts off a lot of

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.490 
it is now this thing puts off a lot of
heat<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:51.459> can<00:02:51.550> feel<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:51.940> heat<00:02:52.120> right<00:02:52.360> now

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
heat you can feel the heat right now

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.840 
heat you can feel the heat right now
this<00:02:53.500> would<00:02:53.650> be<00:02:53.680> great<00:02:53.920> in<00:02:54.010> the<00:02:54.069> winter<00:02:54.190> I'll

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
this would be great in the winter I'll

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.870 
this would be great in the winter I'll
probably<00:02:55.000> put<00:02:55.180> it<00:02:55.330> right<00:02:55.540> here<00:02:55.600> and<00:02:56.580> I'll<00:02:57.580> have

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
probably put it right here and I'll have

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.770 
probably put it right here and I'll have
it<00:02:57.970> running<00:02:58.120> in<00:02:58.239> my<00:02:58.360> bedroom

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
it running in my bedroom

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.110 
it running in my bedroom
maybe<00:02:59.440> that<00:03:00.160> is<00:03:00.280> unless<00:03:00.519> I<00:03:00.670> find<00:03:00.850> a<00:03:00.940> more

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
maybe that is unless I find a more

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.479 
maybe that is unless I find a more
decorative<00:03:01.390> use<00:03:02.080> for<00:03:02.410> it<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:02.650> it<00:03:03.220> can<00:03:03.370> just

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
decorative use for it and it can just

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.509 
decorative use for it and it can just
help<00:03:03.910> heat<00:03:04.120> up<00:03:04.209> my<00:03:04.330> room<00:03:04.510> I'll<00:03:05.019> be<00:03:05.110> pretty<00:03:05.319> good

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
help heat up my room I'll be pretty good

yeah<00:03:06.519> I<00:03:06.550> like<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.910> quite<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.120> bit

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.110

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
it's not too hot looks like the heat was

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.550 
it's not too hot looks like the heat was
just<00:03:21.530> radiating<00:03:22.530> heat<00:03:22.740> not<00:03:22.950> actual<00:03:24.560> itself

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
just radiating heat not actual itself

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:35.119 
just radiating heat not actual itself
getting<00:03:25.800> too<00:03:26.040> hot

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.750 

do<00:03:36.129> I<00:03:36.159> think<00:03:36.280> it's<00:03:36.519> worth<00:03:36.579> $8<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.719> don't<00:03:38.349> know
