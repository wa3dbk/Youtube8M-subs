00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
wouldn't worry about it Dylan I think

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:58.990 
wouldn't worry about it Dylan I think
it'll<00:04:57.770> be<00:04:57.890> and<00:04:58.070> if<00:04:58.160> he<00:04:58.280> does<00:04:58.430> write<00:04:58.640> a<00:04:58.670> bee<00:04:58.820> book

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
it'll be and if he does write a bee book

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.340 
it'll be and if he does write a bee book
