00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.619
 USU Berro him by laser 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.129
 and Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.519
 two icons of wireless 10 11 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.949
 These four-wheel-monsters drive out clericals just as fast 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.129
 Gun licenses for cars are only allowed to racetracks veterans of these cars 

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:25.560
 move 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.349
 but defused slightly both vehicles are illegal at the dealer and 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.349
 their soul genes are going full throttle 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.340
 since 1992, the Mitsubishi leaves burnt rubber on all your ways 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.340
 his reputation more legendary 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.200
 the current version listens to the name Abo new and sprints in 5 point 7 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.260
 Seconds to 100 km almost unrivaled in the 40 thousand euros 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.560
 class 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.930
 It would not be the Subaru Impreza WRX Pechstein 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.480
 For over ten years he has been fighting for the crown of the driving machine with the subscription 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.800
 thanks to displacement increase to two and a half liters, his boxer engine has more power 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.820
 as the competitor 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.820
 the sprint to 100 he completed a blink of an eye faster 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.470
 The lust for battle in Grazer openly showed no false modesty 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.959
 in the way standing small car on the out through the huge air and 

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:28.959
 she spits out of the antique exhaust pipe again 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.420
 the control plant a pubs counter every detail embodied pure racing 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.960
 Dieter Boxermotor Schick currently has 280 hp on all four wheels 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.930
 lock differentials and an adjustable center differential 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.550
 guarantee razor-sharp handling 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.600
 the sports seats keep the driver in an iron grip 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.619
 the comfort remains on the track 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.919
 and the dashboard looks like a soulless plastic landscape 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.440
 this car only wants one 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.010
 be fast as well as his evil twins in Brasov or filth 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:17.919
 winding country roads, this vehicle is almost unbeatable 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:20.919
 Perfection is the secret recipe for the ride on the cannonball 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:25.759
 both driver and engineering do not meet the highest requirements 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:29.679
 Wonder of the effort behind the scenes is immense for what normal workshops 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.779
 Need a day done as a mechanic in 20 minutes 

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:44.239
 at least as important the development work every component 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.239
 Design engineers using special software on the computer 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.819
 The production vehicles benefit from this effort 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:05.109
 the road versions of Mitsubishi Evo and Subaru Impreza are so-called 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:06.849
 Homologation SMO dent 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.819
 The manufacturers have to build a certain number of pieces for consideration 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.099
 to be allowed to lie 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.520
 the series body serves as a basis 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.520
 but extreme reinforcements are mandatory 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.300
 even before installation, experts meticulously meet the technology 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.080
 The smallest loose contact costs the hard rally operation the victory mistake 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.970
 nobody can afford it here 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.030
 After months of work, the result is at least glimpses 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.030
 to a car 

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:46.509
 like 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:54.319
 the reward of effort for tremendous power and phenomenal traction 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:57.859
 the racing cars accelerate faster than all the roads Ferraris and 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.419
 though on every surface 

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:03.899
 no matter whether gravel mud or snow the sophisticated four-wheel system provide 

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:06.899
 the power on the ground 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:14.499
 pioneering in this area the Mitsubishi Evo be more intelligent 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:18.180
 All-wheel drive decelerates the inside wheel stronger than the brake when braking 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.989
 Outer and she the car in the desired direction 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.100
 Speed ​​up shower is the other way around 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.020
 then the greatest force is on the outer rear wheel 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.800
 within fractions of a second, means and ACS differentials distribute the power 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.289
 the best thing about it also the street versions have over 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.289
 this drive systems 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.810
 and on the martial optics air intakes where the eye looks and 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.319
 tremendous 

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:52.229
 For some, these cars are just embarrassing for the others the perfect ones 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:53.190
 driving machines 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.110
 is fixed 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.110
 beautiful is the Mitsubishi Evo not 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.900
 but where else can you push the 4WD system on gravel or snow 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.249
 Adapt asphalt 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:07.189
 for that you have to compromise comfort after a few hours in the 

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:10.789
 well contoured sitting makes you feel like sling in here as well 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.789
 of the washing machine 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.629
 and which one because the offshoot is the better one 

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:22.379
 Since 1992, the Mitsubishi Evo can all a tad better than its competitor 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:23.569
 from Suva calm 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:25.969
 and although Mitsubishi is now out of the World Rally Championship 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:29.969
 has withdrawn the subscription is still the measure of all things 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.880
 his four-wheel drive system gives him the decisive edge even if the 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.620
 Fuel consumption of up to 30 liters for one to several turbo engine one 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.620
 Speaker of the St 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.419
 the Subaru swallows just as much and is just as much fun 

00:05:50.089 --> 00:05:53.689
 the arrival of the powerful boxer engine shifts the facial features 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:56.689
 Curves and ends can also convince 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:06.379
 although in direct comparison, the Impreza has the disadvantage 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:10.270
 the Subaru is a Stone Age col equivalent to the Mitsubishi one 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:13.270
 Baseball bat and that just lies better in the hand 

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:19.179
 fascinating and unreasonable at the same time they are both not regular 

00:06:19.179 --> 00:06:22.860
 go to the racetrack or own a gas station needs this 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.879
 Not cars 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:27.069
 but who once drove her does not want to get out 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:28.849
 those in the monster are addictive
