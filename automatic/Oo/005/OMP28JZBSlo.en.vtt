conquered yeah just one more hit and the
earth<00:04:04.669> which<00:04:04.909> should<00:04:05.060> blow<00:04:05.209> up<00:04:05.359> at<00:04:05.480> any<00:04:05.510> second

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.169 
earth which should blow up at any second

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:10.599 
earth which should blow up at any second
I<00:04:07.930> think<00:04:08.930> spiral<00:04:09.799> he's<00:04:09.979> gonna<00:04:10.099> hit<00:04:10.250> it<00:04:10.370> first

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
I think spiral he's gonna hit it first

00:04:10.609 --> 00:05:22.279 
I think spiral he's gonna hit it first
no<00:04:10.819> the<00:04:10.970> asteroid<00:04:11.389> oh<00:04:12.819> okay
