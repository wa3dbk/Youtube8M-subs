00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.750
 hello everyone so I'm 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.940
 michel haag we are on the show of 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.610
 francfort and i will introduce you in 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.610
 first the acoustic novelties that 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.140
 we have to lead on this show 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.119
 we will start with a model that we did not 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.830
 never made until now shelagh 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.269
 except made-to-measure 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:27.339
 that is, guitars exclusively 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.789
 of classical philosophy 

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:35.230
 so we're in the culture of 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:37.690
 Spanish classical guitar so very 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.360
 light as a feather with 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.610
 materials completely adapted the series 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.129
 300 with a cedar table and in 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.500
 rosewood and the 400 series which is 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.079
 next door which is also a bet 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.640
 seems at a table a spruce some 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.769
 very particular thing about this 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.170
 guitar is we kept our 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.719
 rosacea our symbol and whose we 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.350
 called occitania in tribute to 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:04.000
 our beautiful south of france a 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.710
 technical particularity because it 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.200
 is she is very interesting is that 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.549
 we kept the sleeve width 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.460
 conventional 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.140
 so we have a comfortable width 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.450
 for someone who plays the guitar 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.540
 classic or bossa but we have 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.369
 received cult and the handle so 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.740
 that they are less because is much 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.430
 more pleasant contact with a form 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.909
 streamlined in that is very very 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.430
 flexible to play and we also 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.689
 integrated inside the handle which 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.450
 is not common in a guitar 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.250
 classic a bar of settings that is 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.470
 made in a very very light material 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.600
 that is, it does not affect the 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.030
 sound and the lightness of the guitar by 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.130
 against according to the temperatures and 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.409
 hygrometry the handle is adjustable 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.800
 and that's a little more than 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.690
 classical guitar on 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.360
 then we have something 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.230
 completely contradictory we are in 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.230
 another world 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.630
 this is called special edition 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.030
 it's a unique model that we have 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.610
 made for the for all gothic 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.790
 for all the metalic vices of the world 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.470
 and the trees it's a tramontane 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.140
 arch of bow encasement in mountain 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.620
 she is all black lacquered black with 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.430
 simply a rosette and a pretty head 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.080
 of death that adorns and so north there 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.900
 included on the back and on the neck 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:33.870
 so here we are really in the in 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.870
 the dark tramontane to the end
