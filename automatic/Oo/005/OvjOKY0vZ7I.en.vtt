00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
but like this guy let's go ahead and

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.550 
but like this guy let's go ahead and
give<00:04:14.379> him<00:04:14.440> some<00:04:14.650> different<00:04:15.010> hands<00:04:16.440> just<00:04:17.440> go

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
give him some different hands just go

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.290 
give him some different hands just go
ahead<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:17.919> dunk<00:04:18.160> now<00:04:22.440> so<00:04:23.440> we've<00:04:23.620> got

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
ahead and dunk now so we've got

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.120 
ahead and dunk now so we've got
basically<00:04:25.300> pointer<00:04:26.110> hands<00:04:26.500> and<00:04:27.449> then<00:04:29.130> holding

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
basically pointer hands and then holding

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.180 
basically pointer hands and then holding
hands<00:04:31.139> so<00:04:32.139> let's<00:04:32.440> go<00:04:32.620> ahead<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:32.889> make<00:04:33.010> him

hands so let's go ahead and make him

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:42.270 
hands so let's go ahead and make him
hold<00:04:33.460> the<00:04:33.520> coffee<00:04:35.760> pop<00:04:36.760> that<00:04:37.000> out<00:04:40.650> and<00:04:41.650> pop

hold the coffee pop that out and pop
that<00:04:42.610> in<00:04:42.880> and<00:04:43.060> I<00:04:43.120> believe<00:04:43.360> that<00:04:43.540> soon<00:04:43.720> all<00:04:43.810> the

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
that in and I believe that soon all the

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.280 
that in and I believe that soon all the
way<00:04:45.240> and<00:04:46.240> now<00:04:46.389> his<00:04:46.540> hands<00:04:46.750> all<00:04:46.930> backwards

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
way and now his hands all backwards

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.490 
way and now his hands all backwards
there<00:04:47.470> we<00:04:47.560> go<00:04:49.200> okay

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
there we go okay

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.420 
there we go okay
I<00:04:50.940> believe<00:04:51.940> this<00:04:52.060> is<00:04:52.210> more<00:04:52.389> for<00:04:52.660> the<00:04:53.340> for<00:04:54.340> the

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
I believe this is more for the for the

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:06.330 
I believe this is more for the for the
rod<00:04:54.700> but
