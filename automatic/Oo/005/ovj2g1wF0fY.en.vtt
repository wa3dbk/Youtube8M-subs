a couple times but if you're 27 you guys

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.320 
a couple times but if you're 27 you guys
are<00:01:55.950> 30<00:01:56.160> yet<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.730> it<00:01:56.850> looks<00:01:56.970> like<00:01:57.090> you're

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
are 30 yet and it looks like you're

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.330 
are 30 yet and it looks like you're
getting<00:01:57.450> better<00:01:57.780> every<00:01:58.500> training<00:01:58.770> camp<00:01:59.130> is

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
getting better every training camp is

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.000 
getting better every training camp is
that<00:01:59.520> true<00:01:59.640> yes<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.480> best<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.960> go<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.830> know<00:02:01.980> I

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
that true yes I best to go you know I

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.650 
that true yes I best to go you know I
think<00:02:02.400> that's<00:02:02.580> how<00:02:02.760> it's<00:02:02.940> supposed<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.360> be<00:02:03.510> I

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
think that's how it's supposed to be I

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.050 
think that's how it's supposed to be I
think<00:02:03.900> you<00:02:04.020> suppose<00:02:04.320> improve<00:02:04.740> not<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.820> same

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
think you suppose improve not the same

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.719 
think you suppose improve not the same
and<00:02:06.480> you<00:02:07.440> know<00:02:07.590> we<00:02:07.740> have<00:02:07.860> our<00:02:07.890> moments<00:02:08.460> I<00:02:08.580> have

and you know we have our moments I have

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.790 
and you know we have our moments I have
my<00:02:08.880> moments<00:02:09.060> where<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.810> know<00:02:09.960> things<00:02:10.590> aren't

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
my moments where you know things aren't

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.680 
my moments where you know things aren't
exactly<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.370> way<00:02:11.490> we<00:02:11.520> wanted<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.060> be<00:02:12.210> but<00:02:12.420> you

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
exactly the way we wanted to be but you

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.120 
exactly the way we wanted to be but you
know<00:02:12.840> that's<00:02:13.170> why<00:02:13.350> you<00:02:13.380> have<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.590> training<00:02:13.890> camp

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.510 
know that's why you have a training camp
and<00:02:14.610> that's<00:02:14.790> why<00:02:14.970> we<00:02:15.150> train<00:02:15.360> outside<00:02:15.630> of<00:02:16.140> a

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
and that's why we train outside of a

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.650 
and that's why we train outside of a
potential<00:02:17.520> fight<00:02:17.700> days<00:02:17.910> because<00:02:18.360> we<00:02:18.510> always

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
potential fight days because we always

a lot of time in you know for me it

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.360 
a lot of time in you know for me it
makes<00:02:39.480> sense<00:02:39.690> that<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:40.320> work<00:02:40.680> three<00:02:40.950> times<00:02:41.160> a

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
sessions a day this week other people

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.070 
sessions a day this week other people
will<00:02:45.120> look<00:02:45.209> at<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.390> and<00:02:45.510> your<00:02:45.690> eyebrows

ready especially we don't have to fight
date<00:02:47.760> but<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.180> think<00:02:48.660> that's<00:02:48.810> what<00:02:48.959> separates

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
date but I think that's what separates

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.350 
date but I think that's what separates
us<00:02:49.530> that's<00:02:50.280> what<00:02:50.430> separates<00:02:50.790> muttering<00:02:51.209> from

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
us that's what separates muttering from

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.990 
us that's what separates muttering from
everyone<00:02:51.690> else<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.340> obviously<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.700> know<00:02:53.880> I'm

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
everyone else and obviously you know I'm

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.330 
everyone else and obviously you know I'm
