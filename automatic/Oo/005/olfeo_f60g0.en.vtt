leggings<00:02:42.410> or<00:02:42.680> whatever<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.700> think<00:02:44.150> I'll<00:02:44.300> get<00:02:44.720> a

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
leggings or whatever I think I'll get a

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.039 
leggings or whatever I think I'll get a
lot<00:02:44.959> of<00:02:44.989> wear<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.470> it<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:46.040> be<00:02:46.160> honest<00:02:47.019> you<00:02:48.019> can't

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
lot of wear of it to be honest you can't

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.050 
lot of wear of it to be honest you can't
really<00:02:48.620> go<00:02:48.860> wrong<00:02:48.890> with<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.400> black<00:02:49.580> skirt<00:02:49.880> and

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
really go wrong with the black skirt and

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.949 
really go wrong with the black skirt and
I'm<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.390> big<00:02:50.660> girl<00:02:51.700> I'm<00:02:52.700> not<00:02:52.970> exactly<00:02:53.390> slim<00:02:53.690> and

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 
I'm a big girl I'm not exactly slim and

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:55.360 
I'm a big girl I'm not exactly slim and
skater<00:02:54.260> skirts<00:02:54.620> are<00:02:54.830> great<00:02:55.040> for<00:02:55.220> me<00:02:55.280> because

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
skater skirts are great for me because

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.430 
skater skirts are great for me because
they<00:02:55.880> enhance<00:02:56.269> the<00:02:56.510> waist<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:57.019> then<00:02:57.080> flare

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
they enhance the waist and then flare

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.940 
they enhance the waist and then flare
out<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:58.010> it's<00:02:58.160> my<00:02:58.310> hips<00:02:58.489> and<00:02:58.700> my<00:02:58.790> um<00:02:59.950> that's

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
out so it's my hips and my um that's

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.729 
out so it's my hips and my um that's
quite<00:03:01.340> large<00:03:01.819> so<00:03:02.600> I<00:03:02.630> know<00:03:03.049> I<00:03:03.230> was<00:03:03.410> gonna<00:03:03.530> wear

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
this like one so much and at the same

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.059 
this like one so much and at the same
time<00:03:05.390> I<00:03:05.810> bought<00:03:06.350> this<00:03:07.330> Alan<00:03:08.330> purpley<00:03:09.260> colored

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
time I bought this Alan purpley colored

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.770 
time I bought this Alan purpley colored
one<00:03:11.320> with<00:03:12.320> a<00:03:12.350> this<00:03:13.190> some<00:03:13.340> of<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.519> shiny<00:03:14.239> Peyton

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
one with a this some of the shiny Peyton

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:22.020 
one with a this some of the shiny Peyton
belt<00:03:15.019> now<00:03:17.049> again<00:03:18.049> it<00:03:18.530> has<00:03:18.680> this<00:03:18.950> waffle<00:03:19.489> e

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.550 

textured<00:03:23.030> finish<00:03:23.209> there<00:03:24.049> were<00:03:24.140> not<00:03:24.320> that<00:03:24.350> many

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
textured finish there were not that many

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.039 
textured finish there were not that many
of<00:03:25.040> this<00:03:25.190> color<00:03:25.549> left<00:03:25.910> and<00:03:26.299> so<00:03:26.570> I<00:03:26.600> ended<00:03:26.720> up

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
of this color left and so I ended up

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.870 
of this color left and so I ended up
getting<00:03:27.230> a<00:03:27.410> big<00:03:27.590> size<00:03:27.829> thinking<00:03:28.370> it's

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
getting a big size thinking it's

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.849 
getting a big size thinking it's
elasticated<00:03:29.450> waist<00:03:29.840> it<00:03:30.170> doesn't<00:03:30.470> matter<00:03:30.620> if

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
elasticated waist it doesn't matter if

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.150 
elasticated waist it doesn't matter if
it's<00:03:30.980> a<00:03:31.160> bit<00:03:31.310> big<00:03:31.549> but<00:03:32.480> it<00:03:33.470> does<00:03:33.650> matter<00:03:33.859> if

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
it's a bit big but it does matter if

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.610 
it's a bit big but it does matter if
it's<00:03:34.340> a<00:03:34.430> bit<00:03:34.549> big<00:03:34.790> because<00:03:35.570> it<00:03:35.989> actually<00:03:36.260> is

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
it's a bit big because it actually is

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.380 
it's a bit big because it actually is
less<00:03:36.859> flattering<00:03:37.160> than<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:37.970> black<00:03:38.150> one

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
less flattering than the black one

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.539 
less flattering than the black one
because<00:03:38.780> it's<00:03:39.440> kind<00:03:39.709> of<00:03:39.859> loose<00:03:40.100> around<00:03:40.400> the

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
because it's kind of loose around the

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.400 
because it's kind of loose around the
waist<00:03:40.700> but<00:03:40.910> then<00:03:41.090> I<00:03:41.299> actually<00:03:41.480> end<00:03:41.989> up<00:03:42.140> with

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
waist but then I actually end up with

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.699 
waist but then I actually end up with
having<00:03:42.769> to<00:03:43.840> my<00:03:44.840> fabric<00:03:45.320> looks<00:03:45.410> a<00:03:45.560> bit<00:03:45.650> like

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
having to my fabric looks a bit like

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.800 
having to my fabric looks a bit like
this<00:03:45.950> there's<00:03:46.220> too<00:03:46.370> much<00:03:46.519> fabric<00:03:46.790> so<00:03:47.600> I've<00:03:47.690> got

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
this there's too much fabric so I've got

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.110 
this there's too much fabric so I've got
extra<00:03:48.380> fabric<00:03:48.560> on<00:03:48.950> my<00:03:49.130> hips<00:03:49.280> or<00:03:49.459> areas<00:03:49.850> that<00:03:50.060> I

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
extra fabric on my hips or areas that I

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.300 
extra fabric on my hips or areas that I
would<00:03:50.239> prefer<00:03:50.420> it<00:03:50.690> not<00:03:50.720> to<00:03:50.989> be<00:03:51.140> it<00:03:51.859> looks<00:03:52.100> fine

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
would prefer it not to be it looks fine

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.740 
would prefer it not to be it looks fine
but<00:03:52.670> it<00:03:52.970> adds<00:03:53.209> extra<00:03:53.660> volume<00:03:54.620> in<00:03:55.579> an<00:03:56.390> area<00:03:56.569> that

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
but it adds extra volume in an area that

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.349 
but it adds extra volume in an area that
I<00:03:56.930> don't<00:03:57.140> really<00:03:57.230> want<00:03:57.440> to<00:03:57.500> so<00:03:58.069> don't<00:03:58.970> get<00:03:59.180> to

I don't really want to so don't get to
bigger<00:03:59.600> size<00:03:59.870> but<00:04:00.440> then<00:04:00.620> I<00:04:00.980> made<00:04:01.220> that<00:04:01.340> mistake

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
bigger size but then I made that mistake

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.000
