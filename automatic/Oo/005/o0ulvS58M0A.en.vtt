so<00:00:02.100> this<00:00:03.090> is<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.240> quad-core<00:00:03.480> so<00:00:04.020> this<00:00:04.260> is<00:00:04.380> the

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
so this is a quad-core so this is the

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.410 
so this is a quad-core so this is the
quad-core<00:00:04.710> version<00:00:05.460> which<00:00:06.029> is<00:00:06.180> like<00:00:06.390> a

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
quad-core version which is like a

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.710 
quad-core version which is like a
brother<00:00:06.840> for<00:00:07.319> example<00:00:07.380> this<00:00:08.309> one<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.720> thinner

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:09.720 
brother for example this one is thinner

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.320 
brother for example this one is thinner
with<00:00:10.410> seven<00:00:10.830> point<00:00:11.040> nine<00:00:11.130> millimeter<00:00:11.670> with<00:00:12.300> a

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
with seven point nine millimeter with a

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
with seven point nine millimeter with a
quad-core<00:00:12.690> 1.2<00:00:13.500> with<00:00:14.340> eight<00:00:14.820> megapixel<00:00:15.690> full

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
quad-core 1.2 with eight megapixel full

quad-core 1.2 with eight megapixel full
HD<00:00:16.710> camera<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.279> two<00:00:17.849> megapixel<00:00:18.480> front<00:00:18.929> camera

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:19.339 
HD camera and two megapixel front camera

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:23.630 
HD camera and two megapixel front camera
in<00:00:20.339> this<00:00:20.550> one<00:00:20.849> you<00:00:21.359> have<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.630> dual<00:00:21.869> courier<00:00:22.640> 42

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
in this one you have the dual courier 42

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.609 
in this one you have the dual courier 42
megabit<00:00:23.999> per<00:00:24.029> second<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.929> I'll<00:00:25.349> describe

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
megabit per second and I'll describe

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.470 
megabit per second and I'll describe
easy<00:00:26.009> the<00:00:26.249> one<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.400> showed<00:00:26.789> previously<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.329> was

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
easy the one I showed previously it was

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.970 
easy the one I showed previously it was
21<00:00:28.079> megabyte<00:00:28.409> per<00:00:28.679> second<00:00:30.230> no<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.470> can<00:00:31.739> show<00:00:31.769> you

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
21 megabyte per second no I can show you

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.270 
21 megabyte per second no I can show you
the<00:00:32.160> maximum<00:00:32.460> brightness<00:00:32.730> from<00:00:33.270> this<00:00:33.510> one

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
the maximum brightness from this one

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:43.460 
the maximum brightness from this one
display<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:36.260> then<00:00:37.260> brightness<00:00:41.270> like<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.480> so

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
display and then brightness like this so

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.110 
display and then brightness like this so
this<00:00:43.650> is<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.830> quad-core<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.970> is<00:00:45.090> a

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
this is a quad-core so this is a

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.840 
this is a quad-core so this is a
quad-core<00:00:45.420> with<00:00:46.020> 8<00:00:46.290> megapixel<00:00:46.830> camera<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
quad-core with 8 megapixel camera the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.440 
quad-core with 8 megapixel camera the
front<00:00:48.240> camera<00:00:48.390> it's<00:00:48.810> HD<00:00:49.670> 720p<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:51.030> have<00:00:51.150> still

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
front camera it's HD 720p we have still

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.960 
front camera it's HD 720p we have still
have<00:00:51.630> the<00:00:51.750> 4gb<00:00:52.200> inside<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.700> have<00:00:53.850> the

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
have the 4gb inside and you have the

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.940 
have the 4gb inside and you have the
option<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.510> dual<00:00:54.840> sim<00:00:55.080> dual<00:00:55.320> standby<00:00:55.440> on

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
option to have dual sim dual standby on

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.980 
option to have dual sim dual standby on
this<00:00:56.100> one<00:00:56.310> and<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:57.000> open<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.390> back<00:00:57.510> look

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:57.990 
this one and you open the back look

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:59.510 
this one and you open the back look
inside<00:00:58.290> no<00:00:58.680> we<00:00:58.830> cannot<00:00:59.010> open<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.370> back

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
inside no we cannot open the back

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.450 
inside no we cannot open the back
because<00:00:59.700> it's<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.260> unibody<00:01:01.260> anybody<00:01:02.220> so

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
because it's a unibody anybody so

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.210 
because it's a unibody anybody so
there's<00:01:02.640> anybody<00:01:03.000> battery<00:01:03.630> swap<00:01:04.019> know<00:01:04.409> that

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
there's anybody battery swap know that

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.090 
there's anybody battery swap know that
exchangeable<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.060> one<00:01:06.210> but<00:01:06.900> there<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.230> a<00:01:07.260> SIM

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
exchangeable this one but there is a SIM

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.800 
exchangeable this one but there is a SIM
card<00:01:08.130> slot<00:01:08.550> on<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.730> side<00:01:08.820> exactly<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:09.750> have

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
card slot on the side exactly you have

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.870 
card slot on the side exactly you have
the<00:01:09.990> SIM<00:01:10.170> card<00:01:10.200> slot<00:01:10.440> here<00:01:10.590> if<00:01:10.980> I<00:01:11.159> if<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.580> want<00:01:11.760> to

the SIM card slot here if I if I want to

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.430 
the SIM card slot here if I if I want to
open<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.210> for<00:01:12.420> example

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
open it for example

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.340 
open it for example
here<00:01:15.160> here<00:01:16.090> is<00:01:16.240> a<00:01:16.270> single-sim<00:01:16.870> version<00:01:16.900> you

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:17.350 
here here is a single-sim version you

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.770 
here here is a single-sim version you
can<00:01:17.470> see<00:01:17.650> that<00:01:18.010> this<00:01:18.190> scene<00:01:18.340> is<00:01:18.460> here<00:01:19.860> what<00:01:20.860> and
