the screen saver and the actual feel of
it<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.370> very<00:00:50.700> similar<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:52.050> original

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
flex blues greens sills in the case and

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.080 
flex blues greens sills in the case and
it's<00:02:01.350> not<00:02:01.469> really<00:02:01.740> showing<00:02:01.890> up<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.189> this<00:02:02.310> light

it's not really showing up in this light

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.840 
it's not really showing up in this light
but<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.840> has<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.530> really<00:02:05.070> high<00:02:05.189> quality<00:02:05.219> case

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
but it has is a really high quality case

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.669 
but it has is a really high quality case
will<00:02:06.090> actually<00:02:06.360> take<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.719> phone<00:02:06.960> and

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
will actually take the phone and

will actually take the phone and
so<00:02:08.679> I'm<00:02:08.739> going<00:02:08.920> to<00:02:08.950> make<00:02:09.069> sure<00:02:09.099> you<00:02:09.310> get<00:02:09.429> it<00:02:09.550> the

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
so I'm going to make sure you get it the

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.889 
so I'm going to make sure you get it the
right<00:02:09.759> way<00:02:09.970> because<00:02:10.119> it's<00:02:10.269> quite<00:02:10.599> once<00:02:10.810> you've

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
right way because it's quite once you've

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.449 
right way because it's quite once you've
got<00:02:11.019> it<00:02:11.110> and<00:02:11.230> it's<00:02:11.349> quite<00:02:11.560> difficult<00:02:12.099> to<00:02:12.340> get

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
got it and it's quite difficult to get

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.580 
got it and it's quite difficult to get
out<00:02:12.580> again<00:02:14.220> clips<00:02:15.220> in<00:02:15.370> like<00:02:15.519> so<00:02:16.290> you<00:02:17.290> can<00:02:17.440> see

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
out again clips in like so you can see

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.000 
out again clips in like so you can see
that<00:02:17.620> once<00:02:17.890> it's<00:02:18.099> actually<00:02:18.459> in<00:02:18.790> the<00:02:18.970> case

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
that once it's actually in the case

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.949 
that once it's actually in the case
quite<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.040> neat<00:02:21.310> design<00:02:21.700> you<00:02:22.599> can<00:02:22.720> see<00:02:22.840> the

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
quite a neat design you can see the

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.630 
quite a neat design you can see the
camera<00:02:23.200> now<00:02:23.500> fits<00:02:23.830> flush<00:02:24.069> so<00:02:24.250> if<00:02:24.310> I<00:02:24.400> put<00:02:24.549> it

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
camera now fits flush so if I put it

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.000 
camera now fits flush so if I put it
down<00:02:24.790> on<00:02:24.819> a<00:02:25.230> surface<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.590> camera<00:02:26.860> is<00:02:26.920> not

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
down on a surface the camera is not

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.210 
down on a surface the camera is not
going<00:02:27.099> to<00:02:27.160> catch<00:02:28.170> I'll<00:02:29.170> any<00:02:29.530> thickness<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.190> the

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
going to catch I'll any thickness to the

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.900 
going to catch I'll any thickness to the
phone<00:02:30.870> really<00:02:31.870> really<00:02:32.019> slim<00:02:32.430> gives<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.580> quite
