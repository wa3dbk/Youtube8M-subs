 We pray and sing and go to church, but indeed we are God's 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:19.119
 Are you doing day three? 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:25.000
 This world is so convenient and livable, well furnished and well built 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:30.130
 I lay long at home and spread my feet like the Jews, eating Passover, 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.439
 Seriously indulge in comfort, without waiting for the Lord's coming is the world ex-wife. 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.439
 Do not you live like that 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:43.410

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.480
 Another era of Wu Gang was corrupting the spirit of the people in many different ways 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.640
 There is 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:59.180
 How are we going to look for the benefits that are visible to our precious 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:03.590
 Does it have gone sucked all of the time and singing 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:08.930
 Are not we wasting time and money to get in the way? 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:10.880
 One thought is that while singing Jerusalem, the heart that has lost Jerusalem 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.740
 Like a Jew 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:18.880
 He lived as a permanent follow President lost the home country of the mind of God 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.880
 It will disappear. 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:28.490
 One day, when I saw the vision of this Macedonian , the apostle Paul crossed over to Greece 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:32.000
 I went on an evangelistic trip 1 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:36.649
 Philippi Thessalonica . 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.850
 So now I think quite Corinth to go aboard to take off about a week 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.409
 It was hard. 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:46.500
 I was very well- equipped. I can ride this bus. 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:51.060
 Paul makes the star enough to walk about 20,000 km 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:55.850
 Only one copy of the key, because the degree of distance and from Korea to the United States off the New American 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.850
 It is the same as the Korean language again, and the gospel is preached there 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:05.500
 There is a move where Dawn touched the feet of Paul now ride the bus for their cars 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.500
 I came up in the car of these lyrics in. 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.459
 That's what happened to the Lord alone . 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.890
 All the water and blood flowed, and the road was me. 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.640
 I'm the only one who leads you . 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.590
 I'm done. 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:30.000
 Dying at beorigil me for them 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:35.359
 Father, send me. I will be resilient. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.359
 I will not spare my life. Let me go. 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:45.930
 Well, Lord Jesus , the call to come 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:48.070
 Like the Jewish form of this next year, rather than a public offering of prayers in Jerusalem 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:53.620
 I really like to 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:57.050

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.420
 Live again 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:12.010
 But what it means to live together 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:15.159
 You're talking through experience. 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:17.190
