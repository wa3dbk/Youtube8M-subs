welcome to another battlefield 3
showdown<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.849> today<00:00:12.090> we<00:00:12.240> are<00:00:12.360> taking<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.780> look

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
showdown and today we are taking a look

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.020 
showdown and today we are taking a look
at<00:00:13.170> two<00:00:13.290> LMGs<00:00:13.950> and<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.280> was<00:00:14.400> requested<00:00:14.759> by

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
at two LMGs and this was requested by

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.140 
at two LMGs and this was requested by
Pasque<00:00:15.890> 0:04<00:00:16.949> and<00:00:17.220> he<00:00:17.550> wanted<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.820> see<00:00:18.000> the

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
Pasque 0:04 and he wanted to see the

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.470 
Pasque 0:04 and he wanted to see the
l86a2<00:00:18.960> versus<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.590> m27<00:00:20.130> IAR<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.300> i<00:00:21.359> thought

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
l86a2 versus the m27 IAR and i thought

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.640 
l86a2 versus the m27 IAR and i thought
that<00:00:21.539> would<00:00:21.689> be<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.869> really<00:00:22.109> good<00:00:22.289> showdown

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
that would be a really good showdown

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.439 
that would be a really good showdown
because<00:00:22.920> they<00:00:23.039> are<00:00:23.189> very<00:00:23.490> very<00:00:23.789> similar<00:00:24.180> in

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
because they are very very similar in

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.839 
because they are very very similar in
the<00:00:24.840> way<00:00:24.869> they<00:00:25.140> behave<00:00:25.289> but<00:00:26.099> last<00:00:26.310> week<00:00:26.519> we<00:00:26.670> did

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
the way they behave but last week we did

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.790 
the way they behave but last week we did
the<00:00:26.880> USS<00:00:27.330> 12<00:00:27.660> versus<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.019> MK<00:00:28.289> 3<00:00:28.439> 8:1

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
the USS 12 versus the MK 3 8:1

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.529 
the USS 12 versus the MK 3 8:1
jackhammer<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.699> can<00:00:29.880> clearly<00:00:30.119> see<00:00:30.300> that

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
jackhammer and you can clearly see that

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.290 
jackhammer and you can clearly see that
the<00:00:30.869> jackhammer<00:00:31.470> jacked<00:00:32.009> up<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.460> USS<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
the jackhammer jacked up the USS in the

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.600 
the jackhammer jacked up the USS in the

your comments cuz I always grab some for
the<00:00:47.250> next<00:00:47.550> episode<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.450> these<00:00:48.600> two<00:00:48.750> LMGs<00:00:49.230> are

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
the next episode but these two LMGs are

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.020 
the next episode but these two LMGs are
very<00:00:49.710> similar<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.370> let's<00:00:50.520> take<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.730> look<00:00:50.969> at

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
very similar so let's take a look at

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.729 
very similar so let's take a look at
some<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> stats<00:00:51.629> here<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.020> we<00:00:52.140> can<00:00:52.289> kind<00:00:52.649> of

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
some of the stats here so we can kind of

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.170 
some of the stats here so we can kind of
highlight<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.309> differences<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:53.969> see

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
highlight the differences you can see

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.430 
highlight the differences you can see
they<00:00:54.300> both<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:54.780> same<00:00:54.960> rate<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.170> fire<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
they both have the same rate of fire and

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.069 
they both have the same rate of fire and
damage<00:00:55.949> but<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.760> l86<00:00:57.270> reloads<00:00:57.660> almost<00:00:57.960> a

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
damage but the l86 reloads almost a

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.470 
damage but the l86 reloads almost a
second<00:00:58.469> slower<00:00:58.649> than<00:00:58.800> m27<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.850> has<00:01:00.059> but<00:01:00.390> it

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
second slower than m27 and has but it

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.540 
second slower than m27 and has but it
has<00:01:00.660> lower<00:01:00.899> recoil<00:01:01.230> and<00:01:01.680> that's<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.129> big<00:01:02.340> deal

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
has lower recoil and that's a big deal

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.189 
has lower recoil and that's a big deal
and<00:01:02.820> we'll<00:01:03.000> talk<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> little<00:01:03.390> bit<00:01:03.539> about<00:01:03.809> why<00:01:04.140> it

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
and we'll talk a little bit about why it

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.109 
and we'll talk a little bit about why it
has<00:01:04.470> lower<00:01:04.739> recoil<00:01:05.010> but<00:01:05.369> they<00:01:05.489> both<00:01:05.640> reload

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
has lower recoil but they both reload

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.750 
has lower recoil but they both reload
fairly<00:01:06.540> quick<00:01:06.780> for<00:01:06.960> LMGs<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.470> mean<00:01:07.760> considering

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
fairly quick for LMGs I mean considering

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.250 
fairly quick for LMGs I mean considering
that<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.970> do<00:01:09.150> have<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> lot<00:01:09.570> more<00:01:09.600> ammo<00:01:09.960> in

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
that you do have a lot more ammo in

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.780 
that you do have a lot more ammo in
these<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.619> know<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.860> default<00:01:11.250> magazine<00:01:11.670> is

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
these you know the default magazine is

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.060 
these you know the default magazine is
45<00:01:12.240> plus<00:01:12.479> one<00:01:12.840> with<00:01:13.080> extended<00:01:13.590> mags<00:01:13.799> which

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
45 plus one with extended mags which

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.830 
45 plus one with extended mags which
both<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.310> these<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.760> have<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.450> go<00:01:15.570> up<00:01:15.720> to

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
both of these can have you go up to

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.230 
both of these can have you go up to
sixty<00:01:16.259> plus<00:01:16.409> one<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.040> really<00:01:17.549> if<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.880> look<00:01:18.090> at

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
sixty plus one so really if you look at

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.670 
sixty plus one so really if you look at
these<00:01:18.360> there's<00:01:18.630> not<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:19.080> many<00:01:19.229> differences

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
these there's not that many differences

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.620 
these there's not that many differences
the<00:01:19.950> recoil<00:01:20.369> patterns<00:01:20.729> are<00:01:20.850> almost<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.450> same

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
the recoil patterns are almost the same

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.050 
the recoil patterns are almost the same
you<00:01:21.689> know<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.320> m27<00:01:22.890> has<00:01:23.130> really<00:01:23.400> low<00:01:23.520> recoil<00:01:23.759> I

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
you know the m27 has really low recoil I

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.249 
you know the m27 has really low recoil I
think<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.360> difference<00:01:24.689> is<00:01:24.780> between<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.229> two

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
think the difference is between the two

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.070 
think the difference is between the two
it<00:01:25.590> are<00:01:25.740> really<00:01:26.070> just<00:01:26.400> fractions<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.810> a

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
it are really just fractions of a of a

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.679 
it are really just fractions of a of a
point<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.890> recoil<00:01:29.340> charts<00:01:29.700> but<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.450> big

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
point on the recoil charts but the big

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.660 
point on the recoil charts but the big
difference<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> m27<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.130> reason<00:01:32.400> why<00:01:32.520> it

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
difference on the m27 the reason why it

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.090 
difference on the m27 the reason why it
feels<00:01:32.880> like<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.299> has<00:01:33.479> more<00:01:33.810> recoil<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
feels like it has more recoil is the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.399 
feels like it has more recoil is the
fact<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.640> has<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> higher<00:01:36.210> initial<00:01:36.780> recoil

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
fact that it has a higher initial recoil

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.399 
fact that it has a higher initial recoil
multiplier<00:01:37.560> at<00:01:38.070> 2.2<00:01:38.700> versus<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.509> l86<00:01:40.140> only

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
multiplier at 2.2 versus the l86 only

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.080 
multiplier at 2.2 versus the l86 only
has<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.740> two<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:41.220> that's<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.460> big<00:01:41.640> deal<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.000> know

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
has a two so that's a big deal you know

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.580 
has a two so that's a big deal you know
that<00:01:42.240> first<00:01:42.509> shot<00:01:42.750> is<00:01:42.899> going<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.170> be<00:01:43.320> really

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
that first shot is going to be really

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.830 
that first shot is going to be really
really<00:01:43.799> tricky<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.399> get<00:01:44.610> because<00:01:45.360> your<00:01:45.570> your

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
really tricky to get because your your

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.330 
really tricky to get because your your
guns<00:01:46.049> gonna<00:01:46.200> bounce<00:01:46.530> up<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.829> lot<00:01:47.070> higher<00:01:47.280> than

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
guns gonna bounce up a lot higher than

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.359 
guns gonna bounce up a lot higher than
the<00:01:47.759> l86<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.720> that's<00:01:49.560> one<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.860> reasons<00:01:50.189> why

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
the l86 so that's one of the reasons why

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.580 
the l86 so that's one of the reasons why
I<00:01:50.399> think<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.820> l86<00:01:51.360> works<00:01:51.600> better<00:01:51.899> as<00:01:52.170> a

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
I think the l86 works better as a

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.350 
I think the l86 works better as a
close-quarters<00:01:53.040> weapon<00:01:53.220> why<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.090> works

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
close-quarters weapon why it works

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.520 
close-quarters weapon why it works
better<00:01:54.600> at<00:01:54.810> playing<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.079> little<00:01:55.259> bit<00:01:55.380> more

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
better at playing a little bit more

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.050 
better at playing a little bit more
aggressive<00:01:55.979> what<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.280> see<00:01:56.460> me<00:01:56.579> using<00:01:56.759> here

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
aggressive what you see me using here

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.539 
aggressive what you see me using here
now<00:01:57.240> is<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.689> bipod<00:01:58.229> with<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:59.009> laser<00:01:59.219> sight<00:01:59.490> I

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
now is the bipod with the laser sight I

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.550 
now is the bipod with the laser sight I
think<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.000> is<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> ultimate<00:02:00.930> candidate<00:02:01.320> for

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
think this is a ultimate candidate for

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.620 
think this is a ultimate candidate for
using<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:01.979> laser<00:02:02.159> sight<00:02:02.310> because<00:02:02.850> one<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.479> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
using the laser sight because one of the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.590 
using the laser sight because one of the
advantages<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.320> l86<00:02:05.040> also<00:02:05.430> has<00:02:05.670> over<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.090> m27

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
advantages the l86 also has over the m27

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.510 
advantages the l86 also has over the m27
is<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:07.079> has<00:02:07.200> better<00:02:07.439> hipfire<00:02:07.920> because<00:02:08.250> it<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.489> a

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
is it has better hipfire because it is a

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.790 
is it has better hipfire because it is a
bullpup<00:02:09.149> design<00:02:09.209> which<00:02:10.170> means<00:02:10.349> that<00:02:10.560> while

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
bullpup design which means that while

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.350 
bullpup design which means that while
you're<00:02:10.979> moving<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.610> hip<00:02:11.819> firing<00:02:12.209> you're

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
you're moving and hip firing you're

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.790 
you're moving and hip firing you're
going<00:02:12.569> to

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
going to

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.710 
going to
a<00:02:12.830> multiplier<00:02:13.610> much<00:02:13.910> higher<00:02:14.150> than<00:02:14.390> if<00:02:14.540> you're

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
a multiplier much higher than if you're

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.820 
a multiplier much higher than if you're
using<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.110> m27

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
using the m27

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.160 
using the m27
now<00:02:16.340> for<00:02:16.640> LMGs<00:02:17.090> they<00:02:17.240> both<00:02:17.480> have<00:02:17.690> really<00:02:17.720> good

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
now for LMGs they both have really good

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.930 
now for LMGs they both have really good
hipfire<00:02:18.560> there's<00:02:18.800> no<00:02:18.980> doubt<00:02:19.280> about<00:02:19.460> that<00:02:19.910> but

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
hipfire there's no doubt about that but

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.060 
hipfire there's no doubt about that but
the<00:02:20.300> l86<00:02:20.840> definitely<00:02:21.290> takes<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.590> cake<00:02:21.860> in

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
the l86 definitely takes the cake in

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.740 
the l86 definitely takes the cake in
that<00:02:22.220> department<00:02:22.790> but<00:02:22.940> you<00:02:23.300> clear<00:02:23.630> is

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
that department but you clear is

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.320 
that department but you clear is
currently<00:02:24.380> clearly<00:02:25.070> see<00:02:25.340> by<00:02:25.610> this<00:02:25.670> clip<00:02:26.090> that

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
currently clearly see by this clip that

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.930 
currently clearly see by this clip that
the<00:02:27.320> hip<00:02:27.500> fire<00:02:27.650> on<00:02:27.800> the<00:02:27.890> m27<00:02:28.370> is<00:02:28.610> nothing

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
the hip fire on the m27 is nothing

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.670 
the hip fire on the m27 is nothing
nothing<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.450> bulk<00:02:29.690> about<00:02:29.960> you<00:02:30.080> can<00:02:30.230> still<00:02:30.470> get

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
nothing the bulk about you can still get

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.760 
nothing the bulk about you can still get
the<00:02:30.830> job<00:02:31.040> done<00:02:31.280> with<00:02:31.520> a<00:02:31.550> laser<00:02:31.880> sight<00:02:32.270> now<00:02:33.020> one

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
the job done with a laser sight now one

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.500 
the job done with a laser sight now one
cool<00:02:34.100> thing<00:02:34.130> about<00:02:34.490> these<00:02:34.700> is<00:02:34.760> they<00:02:35.030> both<00:02:35.270> can

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
cool thing about these is they both can

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.000 
cool thing about these is they both can
have<00:02:35.660> heavy<00:02:35.870> barrel<00:02:36.230> now<00:02:36.380> since<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.830> patch

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
have heavy barrel now since the patch

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.040 
have heavy barrel now since the patch
they've<00:02:37.400> given<00:02:38.300> you<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.510> option<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.900> put

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
they've given you the option to put

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.360 
they've given you the option to put
heavy<00:02:39.260> barrel<00:02:39.590> on<00:02:39.650> these<00:02:39.830> and<00:02:39.980> it<00:02:40.070> really

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
heavy barrel on these and it really

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.670 
heavy barrel on these and it really
really<00:02:40.550> helps<00:02:40.850> if<00:02:41.780> you're<00:02:41.930> going<00:02:42.080> to<00:02:42.260> buy<00:02:42.410> pot

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
really helps if you're going to buy pot

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.440 
really helps if you're going to buy pot
up<00:02:42.890> I<00:02:43.070> would<00:02:43.220> always<00:02:43.430> suggest<00:02:43.760> using<00:02:44.210> the

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
up I would always suggest using the

isn't<00:02:47.180> going<00:02:47.360> to<00:02:47.420> help<00:02:47.540> you<00:02:47.690> that<00:02:47.870> much<00:02:47.900> if

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
isn't going to help you that much if

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
isn't going to help you that much if
you're<00:02:48.320> by<00:02:48.470> padding<00:02:48.800> up<00:02:48.920> because<00:02:49.130> these

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
you're by padding up because these

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.060 
you're by padding up because these
things<00:02:49.490> reload<00:02:49.880> so<00:02:50.330> quickly<00:02:51.080> at<00:02:51.590> least<00:02:51.830> for<00:02:52.010> an

things reload so quickly at least for an

things reload so quickly at least for an
LMG<00:02:52.460> that<00:02:52.760> you<00:02:53.000> don't<00:02:53.240> really<00:02:53.390> need<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:53.630> worry

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
LMG that you don't really need to worry

LMG that you don't really need to worry
a<00:02:53.990> ton<00:02:54.320> about<00:02:54.710> extended<00:02:55.190> magazine<00:02:55.550> I<00:02:55.670> never

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
a ton about extended magazine I never

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
a ton about extended magazine I never
thought<00:02:56.060> I<00:02:56.120> would<00:02:56.330> say<00:02:56.480> that<00:02:56.690> but<00:02:56.840> I<00:02:56.870> really

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
thought I would say that but I really

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.020 
thought I would say that but I really
learned<00:02:57.410> how<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.620> use<00:02:57.950> these<00:02:58.130> weapons<00:02:58.430> a<00:02:58.820> lot

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
learned how to use these weapons a lot

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.360 
learned how to use these weapons a lot
more<00:02:59.570> effectively<00:03:00.260> than<00:03:00.560> in<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:00.800> past<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.250> I

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
more effectively than in the past and I

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.820 
more effectively than in the past and I
think<00:03:01.580> that<00:03:01.820> with<00:03:02.120> extended<00:03:02.900> mags<00:03:03.080> is<00:03:03.290> you

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
think that with extended mags is you

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.740 
think that with extended mags is you
know<00:03:03.950> it's<00:03:04.190> it's<00:03:04.580> kind<00:03:04.790> of<00:03:04.850> unneeded<00:03:05.120> I<00:03:05.360> mean

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
know it's it's kind of unneeded I mean

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.690 
know it's it's kind of unneeded I mean
it'll<00:03:06.320> save<00:03:06.560> you<00:03:06.710> in<00:03:06.830> some<00:03:07.010> situations<00:03:07.580> but

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
it'll save you in some situations but

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.820 
it'll save you in some situations but
for<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:07.940> most<00:03:08.150> part<00:03:08.420> it's<00:03:08.930> more<00:03:09.200> of<00:03:09.350> a<00:03:09.500> you

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
for the most part it's more of a you

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.040 
for the most part it's more of a you
know<00:03:09.950> a<00:03:10.190> gift<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.390> have<00:03:11.510> you<00:03:11.720> know<00:03:11.810> it's<00:03:11.960> like

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
know a gift to have you know it's like

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:13.540 
know a gift to have you know it's like
okay<00:03:12.380> I<00:03:12.410> had<00:03:12.620> a<00:03:12.650> couple<00:03:12.950> more<00:03:13.070> rounds<00:03:13.310> to

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
okay I had a couple more rounds to

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.850 
okay I had a couple more rounds to
finish<00:03:13.790> that<00:03:13.970> guy<00:03:14.120> off<00:03:14.330> whereas<00:03:14.750> you<00:03:15.590> can<00:03:15.710> play

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
finish that guy off whereas you can play

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.910 
finish that guy off whereas you can play
really<00:03:16.100> aggressive<00:03:16.670> with<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.770> with<00:03:18.770> the

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
really aggressive with the with the

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.949 
really aggressive with the with the
heavy<00:03:19.100> barrel<00:03:19.280> with<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.120> laser<00:03:20.450> sight<00:03:20.720> those

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
heavy barrel with the laser sight those

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.810 
heavy barrel with the laser sight those
are<00:03:21.080> both<00:03:21.230> options<00:03:21.860> you<00:03:21.980> have<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.340> give<00:03:22.489> up<00:03:22.670> if

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
are both options you have to give up if

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.220 
are both options you have to give up if
you<00:03:22.940> want<00:03:22.970> extended<00:03:23.570> mags<00:03:23.720> on<00:03:23.870> it<00:03:23.989> so<00:03:24.110> that's

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
you want extended mags on it so that's

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.570 
you want extended mags on it so that's
something<00:03:24.470> to<00:03:24.590> consider<00:03:24.890> when<00:03:25.130> picking<00:03:25.520> a

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
something to consider when picking a

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.390 
something to consider when picking a
weapon<00:03:25.910> now<00:03:26.480> I<00:03:26.510> personally<00:03:26.900> like<00:03:27.620> the<00:03:27.770> l86

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
weapon now I personally like the l86

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.760 
weapon now I personally like the l86
just<00:03:28.610> a<00:03:28.700> tad<00:03:28.970> bit<00:03:29.000> better<00:03:29.510> than<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.050> m27<00:03:30.560> the

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
just a tad bit better than the m27 the

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.460 
just a tad bit better than the m27 the
m27<00:03:31.250> does<00:03:31.580> have<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:31.910> faster<00:03:32.330> reload<00:03:32.570> but<00:03:33.290> the

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
m27 does have a faster reload but the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.770 
m27 does have a faster reload but the
spread<00:03:33.860> on<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:34.250> l86<00:03:34.790> is<00:03:34.940> much<00:03:35.180> more<00:03:35.420> compact

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
spread on the l86 is much more compact

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.420 
spread on the l86 is much more compact
at<00:03:36.050> least<00:03:36.200> in<00:03:36.320> my<00:03:36.500> experiences<00:03:37.100> and<00:03:37.250> if<00:03:37.340> you

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
at least in my experiences and if you

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.160 
at least in my experiences and if you
look<00:03:37.580> at<00:03:37.670> the<00:03:37.760> spread<00:03:38.030> charts<00:03:38.420> which<00:03:38.989> I'll

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
look at the spread charts which I'll

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.990 
look at the spread charts which I'll
link<00:03:39.650> in<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:39.890> description<00:03:40.400> you<00:03:40.550> can<00:03:40.760> clearly

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
link in the description you can clearly

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.960 
link in the description you can clearly
see<00:03:41.270> that<00:03:41.300> the<00:03:41.480> l86<00:03:41.989> has<00:03:42.170> superior<00:03:42.970> spread

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
see that the l86 has superior spread

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.640 
see that the l86 has superior spread
when<00:03:44.209> bipod<00:03:44.690> it<00:03:44.810> up<00:03:44.930> with<00:03:45.110> the<00:03:45.260> heavy<00:03:45.440> barrel

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
when bipod it up with the heavy barrel

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.949 
when bipod it up with the heavy barrel
so<00:03:45.950> that<00:03:45.980> is<00:03:46.340> one<00:03:46.550> of<00:03:46.580> my<00:03:46.760> favorite<00:03:47.209> classes<00:03:47.630> in

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
so that is one of my favorite classes in

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.260 
so that is one of my favorite classes in
the<00:03:48.050> game<00:03:48.260> but<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:49.160> l86<00:03:49.640> also<00:03:49.940> works<00:03:50.180> really

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
the game but the l86 also works really

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.910 
the game but the l86 also works really
really<00:03:50.570> well<00:03:50.780> with<00:03:50.959> this<00:03:51.140> laser<00:03:51.410> sight<00:03:51.680> so

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
really well with this laser sight so

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.770 
really well with this laser sight so
that's<00:03:52.640> one<00:03:52.790> of<00:03:52.850> the<00:03:52.940> reasons<00:03:53.209> why<00:03:53.330> I<00:03:53.360> do<00:03:53.510> enjoy

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
that's one of the reasons why I do enjoy

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.360 
that's one of the reasons why I do enjoy
using<00:03:54.230> it<00:03:54.320> you<00:03:54.410> know<00:03:54.500> I<00:03:54.530> feel<00:03:54.739> like<00:03:54.890> I<00:03:55.010> can<00:03:55.160> run

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:55.370 
using it you know I feel like I can run

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.920 
using it you know I feel like I can run
around<00:03:55.489> in<00:03:55.760> close<00:03:55.970> quarters<00:03:56.360> and<00:03:56.510> have<00:03:56.690> the

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
around in close quarters and have the

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:58.420 
around in close quarters and have the
ammo<00:03:57.260> edge<00:03:57.470> over<00:03:57.800> some<00:03:57.980> of<00:03:58.070> the<00:03:58.130> assault

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
ammo edge over some of the assault

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.610 
ammo edge over some of the assault
rifles<00:03:58.820> and<00:03:58.940> it<00:03:59.030> helps<00:03:59.330> that<00:03:59.390> these<00:04:00.020> two<00:04:00.200> these

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
rifles and it helps that these two these

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.860 
rifles and it helps that these two these
two<00:04:00.680> LMGs<00:04:01.280> have<00:04:01.489> a<00:04:01.520> really<00:04:02.000> high<00:04:02.209> rate<00:04:02.480> of<00:04:02.540> fire

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
two LMGs have a really high rate of fire

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.160 
two LMGs have a really high rate of fire
in<00:04:03.200> terms<00:04:03.800> of<00:04:04.070> you<00:04:04.370> know<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:05.180> other<00:04:05.360> LMG<00:04:06.020> is<00:04:06.080> in

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
in terms of you know the other LMG is in

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:07.900 
in terms of you know the other LMG is in
the<00:04:06.260> game<00:04:06.380> I<00:04:06.410> mean<00:04:06.500> 750<00:04:07.310> I<00:04:07.340> think<00:04:07.580> that's<00:04:07.730> only

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
the game I mean 750 I think that's only

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.170 
the game I mean 750 I think that's only
topped<00:04:08.300> by<00:04:08.480> the<00:04:08.540> m249<00:04:09.280> so<00:04:10.280> you<00:04:10.400> can<00:04:10.700> win<00:04:10.970> some

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
topped by the m249 so you can win some

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.910 
topped by the m249 so you can win some
battles<00:04:11.360> against<00:04:11.840> some<00:04:12.019> of<00:04:12.050> the<00:04:12.200> slower<00:04:12.530> fire

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
battles against some of the slower fire

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.410 
battles against some of the slower fire
rate<00:04:12.950> assault<00:04:13.489> rifles<00:04:13.880> and<00:04:14.000> if<00:04:14.120> you're<00:04:14.269> on

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
rate assault rifles and if you're on

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.360 
rate assault rifles and if you're on
target<00:04:14.660> first<00:04:15.019> you<00:04:15.290> can<00:04:15.530> compete<00:04:15.980> with<00:04:16.040> the

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
target first you can compete with the

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.180 
target first you can compete with the
m16<00:04:17.090> you<00:04:17.330> know<00:04:17.450> the<00:04:17.600> m416<00:04:18.560> and<00:04:18.919> all<00:04:19.010> those

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
m16 you know the m416 and all those

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.490 
m16 you know the m416 and all those
weapons<00:04:19.640> that<00:04:19.730> fire<00:04:19.970> around<00:04:20.450> 700<00:04:21.200> to<00:04:21.229> 800

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
weapons that fire around 700 to 800

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.320 
weapons that fire around 700 to 800
rounds<00:04:22.070> per<00:04:22.190> minute<00:04:22.310> and<00:04:22.640> that's<00:04:23.060> one<00:04:23.180> of<00:04:23.210> the

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
rounds per minute and that's one of the

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.450 
rounds per minute and that's one of the
reasons<00:04:23.630> why<00:04:23.720> I<00:04:23.780> like<00:04:24.020> these<00:04:24.200> two<00:04:24.500> they<00:04:25.280> both

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
reasons why I like these two they both

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:26.680 
reasons why I like these two they both
behave<00:04:25.789> very<00:04:25.970> similar<00:04:26.300> though

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
behave very similar though

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.390 
behave very similar though
like<00:04:26.780> I<00:04:26.810> said<00:04:27.140> the<00:04:27.290> initial<00:04:27.770> recall<00:04:28.130> on<00:04:28.280> the

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
like I said the initial recall on the

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.430 
like I said the initial recall on the
m27<00:04:28.940> is<00:04:29.150> much<00:04:29.390> higher<00:04:29.630> I<00:04:29.660> think<00:04:30.020> that's<00:04:30.170> why<00:04:30.380> it

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
m27 is much higher I think that's why it

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.920 
m27 is much higher I think that's why it
kind<00:04:30.830> of<00:04:30.890> nerfs<00:04:31.190> it<00:04:31.430> in<00:04:31.550> close<00:04:31.760> quarters<00:04:32.210> they

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
kind of nerfs it in close quarters they

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.390 
kind of nerfs it in close quarters they
can<00:04:33.050> still<00:04:33.260> get<00:04:33.410> the<00:04:33.530> job<00:04:33.560> done<00:04:34.010> but<00:04:34.250> I<00:04:34.310> think

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
can still get the job done but I think

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.300 
can still get the job done but I think
four<00:04:34.940> is<00:04:35.120> an<00:04:35.270> all-purpose<00:04:35.830> LMG<00:04:36.830> I<00:04:36.860> think<00:04:37.190> the

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
four is an all-purpose LMG I think the

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.790 
four is an all-purpose LMG I think the
l86<00:04:37.910> really<00:04:38.330> just<00:04:38.540> blows<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.960> m27<00:04:39.440> out<00:04:39.680> of<00:04:39.740> the

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
l86 really just blows the m27 out of the

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.710 
l86 really just blows the m27 out of the
water<00:04:40.010> now<00:04:40.250> if<00:04:40.730> you<00:04:40.850> wanted<00:04:41.210> an<00:04:41.270> assault<00:04:41.570> a

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
water now if you wanted an assault a

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.720 
water now if you wanted an assault a
glorified<00:04:42.170> assault<00:04:42.530> rifle<00:04:42.920> I<00:04:43.100> think<00:04:43.640> you're

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
glorified assault rifle I think you're

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.460 
glorified assault rifle I think you're
gonna<00:04:43.820> have<00:04:44.030> to<00:04:44.120> go<00:04:44.240> with<00:04:44.420> the<00:04:44.540> m27<00:04:45.050> because

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
gonna have to go with the m27 because

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:47.680 
gonna have to go with the m27 because
you<00:04:45.590> know<00:04:45.680> it<00:04:45.800> does<00:04:45.950> have<00:04:46.130> a<00:04:46.730> faster<00:04:47.510> reload

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
you know it does have a faster reload

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:49.180 
you know it does have a faster reload
and<00:04:48.020> I<00:04:48.080> think<00:04:48.380> that<00:04:48.530> some<00:04:48.710> people<00:04:49.010> if<00:04:49.100> you

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
and I think that some people if you

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.530 
and I think that some people if you
consider<00:04:49.520> yourself<00:04:49.820> accurate<00:04:50.210> if<00:04:50.300> you're<00:04:50.420> not

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
consider yourself accurate if you're not

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.270 
consider yourself accurate if you're not
going<00:04:50.720> to<00:04:50.840> hip<00:04:51.050> fire<00:04:51.290> a<00:04:51.320> lot<00:04:51.620> that<00:04:51.920> faster

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
going to hip fire a lot that faster

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.040 
going to hip fire a lot that faster
reload<00:04:52.610> could<00:04:52.850> be<00:04:53.000> really<00:04:53.330> important<00:04:53.810> I<00:04:53.900> mean

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
reload could be really important I mean

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.360 
reload could be really important I mean
if<00:04:54.140> you<00:04:54.230> have<00:04:54.380> extended<00:04:54.740> mags<00:04:55.010> on<00:04:55.220> you're

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:55.370 
if you have extended mags on you're

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.250 
if you have extended mags on you're
almost<00:04:55.550> never<00:04:56.000> going<00:04:56.330> to<00:04:56.360> not<00:04:56.600> have<00:04:56.810> ammo<00:04:57.140> on

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
almost never going to not have ammo on

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.140 
almost never going to not have ammo on
your<00:04:57.380> gun<00:04:57.590> and<00:04:57.830> for<00:04:58.430> some<00:04:58.610> people<00:04:58.730> that's<00:04:59.000> a

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
your gun and for some people that's a

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.910 
your gun and for some people that's a
big<00:04:59.300> advantage<00:04:59.450> so<00:04:59.990> a<00:05:00.140> lot<00:05:00.560> of<00:05:00.620> things<00:05:00.800> to

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:00.920 
big advantage so a lot of things to

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.710 
big advantage so a lot of things to
consider<00:05:01.250> here<00:05:01.310> do<00:05:01.580> you<00:05:01.670> want<00:05:01.880> a<00:05:02.000> good<00:05:02.210> hipfire

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.720 
consider here do you want a good hipfire

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.510 
consider here do you want a good hipfire
you<00:05:02.960> know<00:05:03.080> more<00:05:03.260> aggressive<00:05:03.860> assault<00:05:04.100> rifle

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
you know more aggressive assault rifle

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.980 
you know more aggressive assault rifle
or<00:05:04.970> you<00:05:05.090> don't<00:05:05.180> really<00:05:05.330> have<00:05:05.570> to<00:05:05.660> worry<00:05:05.840> about

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
or you don't really have to worry about

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.320 
or you don't really have to worry about
extended<00:05:06.410> mags<00:05:06.590> or<00:05:06.860> do<00:05:07.250> you<00:05:07.310> want<00:05:07.520> a<00:05:07.730> a<00:05:08.000> good

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
extended mags or do you want a a good

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.620 
extended mags or do you want a a good
bipod<00:05:08.870> LMG<00:05:09.320> which<00:05:09.530> I<00:05:09.680> think<00:05:09.890> the<00:05:10.070> the<00:05:10.670> l86<00:05:11.510> is

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
bipod LMG which I think the the l86 is

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.330 
bipod LMG which I think the the l86 is
definitely<00:05:12.050> a<00:05:12.110> better<00:05:12.350> bipod<00:05:12.890> at<00:05:13.010> LMG

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
definitely a better bipod at LMG

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.650 
definitely a better bipod at LMG
especially<00:05:13.790> with<00:05:13.910> heavy<00:05:14.090> barrel<00:05:14.390> that<00:05:14.450> thing

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
especially with heavy barrel that thing

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.480 
especially with heavy barrel that thing
is<00:05:14.780> so<00:05:15.170> accurate<00:05:15.710> it's<00:05:15.830> just<00:05:15.980> like<00:05:16.100> a<00:05:16.130> laser

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
is so accurate it's just like a laser

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:17.830 
is so accurate it's just like a laser
beam<00:05:16.700> you<00:05:16.850> just<00:05:17.000> point<00:05:17.270> and<00:05:17.480> shoot

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
beam you just point and shoot

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.290 
beam you just point and shoot
whereas<00:05:18.440> what<00:05:18.560> the<00:05:18.650> m27<00:05:19.190> it's<00:05:19.460> not<00:05:19.700> so<00:05:19.940> good

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
whereas what the m27 it's not so good

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.320 
whereas what the m27 it's not so good
with<00:05:20.980> with<00:05:21.980> being<00:05:22.190> a<00:05:22.280> bipod<00:05:22.640> at<00:05:22.760> weapon<00:05:23.060> but<00:05:23.180> it

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
with with being a bipod at weapon but it

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.360 
with with being a bipod at weapon but it
