puts more emphasis on a good medic and
not<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.119> point<00:01:37.049> whoring<00:01:37.500> rambo<00:01:37.950> vif<00:01:38.340> guy<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.990> as

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
not a point whoring rambo vif guy and as

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.510 
not a point whoring rambo vif guy and as
we're<00:01:40.259> already<00:01:40.470> talking<00:01:40.799> about<00:01:41.009> ramble

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
we're already talking about ramble

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.340 
we're already talking about ramble
revives<00:01:41.970> they<00:01:42.210> also<00:01:42.360> did<00:01:42.600> something<00:01:42.960> against

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
revives they also did something against

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.120 
revives they also did something against
that<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:44.030> i<00:01:45.030> think<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.899> kind<00:01:46.170> of<00:01:46.229> well

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
that and i think that the kind of well

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.520 
that and i think that the kind of well
the<00:01:47.280> thing<00:01:47.490> that's<00:01:47.840> closest<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.140> would<00:01:49.350> be

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
the thing that's closest to it would be

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.160 
the thing that's closest to it would be
the<00:01:49.770> vehicle<00:01:50.460> mo<00:01:50.759> i<00:01:50.790> guess<00:01:51.090> because<00:01:51.840> now<00:01:52.110> you

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
the vehicle mo i guess because now you

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.539 
the vehicle mo i guess because now you
will<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.770> will<00:01:52.799> also<00:01:53.040> see<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.399> a

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
will and you will also see it in a

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.399 
will and you will also see it in a
couple<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.820> seconds<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.210> slow<00:01:54.570> down<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.110> we

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
couple of seconds I slow down it and we

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.020 
couple of seconds I slow down it and we
will<00:01:55.590> have<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> little<00:01:56.250> time<00:01:56.430> running<00:01:56.759> with<00:01:56.880> it

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
will have a little time running with it

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.990 
will have a little time running with it
you<00:01:57.719> have<00:01:57.840> actually<00:01:58.200> three<00:01:58.649> revives<00:01:59.579> with

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
you have actually three revives with

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.240 
you have actually three revives with
your<00:02:00.180> pedals<00:02:00.540> with<00:02:00.960> your<00:02:00.990> death<00:02:01.290> lips<00:02:01.469> so

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
your pedals with your death lips so

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.649 
your pedals with your death lips so
right<00:02:02.460> after<00:02:02.579> knifing<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.090> guy<00:02:03.240> you'll<00:02:03.450> see

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
right after knifing that guy you'll see

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.590 
right after knifing that guy you'll see
them<00:02:04.320> right<00:02:04.799> there<00:02:04.860> all<00:02:05.100> teammates<00:02:05.399> died<00:02:05.670> he's

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
them right there all teammates died he's

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.839 
them right there all teammates died he's
going<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.899> put<00:02:07.049> other<00:02:07.170> pedals<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.890> see<00:02:08.099> one

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
going to put other pedals you see one

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.089 
going to put other pedals you see one
now<00:02:09.539> we<00:02:09.720> have<00:02:09.869> two<00:02:09.989> left<00:02:10.200> he<00:02:10.590> missed<00:02:10.800> that<00:02:10.860> one

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
now we have two left he missed that one

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.830 
now we have two left he missed that one
so<00:02:11.280> also<00:02:11.610> missed<00:02:11.879> three<00:02:12.750> wives<00:02:12.959> will<00:02:13.230> count

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
so also missed three wives will count

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.440 
so also missed three wives will count
a<00:02:13.900> three<00:02:14.590> in<00:02:14.650> total<00:02:14.769> he<00:02:15.099> wasted<00:02:15.430> two<00:02:15.610> and<00:02:15.819> then

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
a three in total he wasted two and then

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.390 
a three in total he wasted two and then
we'll<00:02:16.660> take<00:02:16.870> some<00:02:17.080> time<00:02:17.410> for<00:02:17.440> them<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:17.860> rechart

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
we'll take some time for them to rechart

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.070 
we'll take some time for them to rechart
up<00:02:18.580> this<00:02:19.030> means<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:19.390> can't<00:02:19.599> just<00:02:19.750> go<00:02:19.900> and

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
up this means you can't just go and

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.540 
up this means you can't just go and
ramble<00:02:20.470> real<00:02:20.560> life<00:02:20.709> everything<00:02:21.220> that<00:02:21.370> there's

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
ramble real life everything that there's

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.000 
ramble real life everything that there's
so<00:02:22.420> you<00:02:22.599> can<00:02:22.840> see<00:02:23.019> he's<00:02:23.470> pulling<00:02:23.769> them<00:02:23.920> out

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
so you can see he's pulling them out

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.369 
so you can see he's pulling them out
again<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:24.760> after<00:02:24.849> approximately<00:02:25.720> 10<00:02:25.959> seconds

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
again and after approximately 10 seconds

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.650 
again and after approximately 10 seconds
you<00:02:26.470> will<00:02:26.739> have<00:02:26.950> your<00:02:27.190> whole<00:02:27.550> and<00:02:27.940> your<00:02:28.480> whole

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
you will have your whole and your whole

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.630 
you will have your whole and your whole
charges<00:02:29.110> again<00:02:29.349> and<00:02:30.069> I<00:02:30.190> think<00:02:30.220> this<00:02:30.519> is<00:02:30.610> a

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
charges again and I think this is a

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.250 
charges again and I think this is a
pretty<00:02:30.910> cool<00:02:31.060> mechanic<00:02:31.330> I<00:02:31.599> mean<00:02:31.750> it's<00:02:31.930> just<00:02:32.019> a

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
pretty cool mechanic I mean it's just a

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.780 
pretty cool mechanic I mean it's just a
little<00:02:32.500> small<00:02:32.769> feature<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.310> probably<00:02:33.640> most

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
little small feature and probably most

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.759 
little small feature and probably most
people<00:02:34.000> won't<00:02:34.330> notice<00:02:34.599> it<00:02:34.810> at<00:02:34.930> all<00:02:35.019> but<00:02:35.530> again

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
people won't notice it at all but again

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.729 
people won't notice it at all but again
the<00:02:35.920> point<00:02:36.220> hunt<00:02:37.209> hungry<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.110> point<00:02:38.349> whoring

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
the point hunt hungry and point whoring

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.759 
the point hunt hungry and point whoring
not<00:02:39.099> medic<00:02:39.430> only<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:40.269> pouring<00:02:41.049> point<00:02:41.410> whoring

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
not medic only you pouring point whoring

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.430 
not medic only you pouring point whoring
people<00:02:42.569> won't<00:02:43.569> be<00:02:43.690> able<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.930> remember<00:02:44.049> revive

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
people won't be able to remember revive

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.020 
people won't be able to remember revive
anymore<00:02:44.860> or<00:02:44.980> crossfire<00:02:45.220> wife<00:02:45.640> that<00:02:45.849> much

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
anymore or crossfire wife that much

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.780

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
because you now have to think before you

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:49.920 
because you now have to think before you
