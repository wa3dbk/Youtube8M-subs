00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
wow wow you can you can frame hit the

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.910 
wow wow you can you can frame hit the
hand<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.780> will<00:02:12.959> jump<00:02:13.230> off

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
hand it will jump off

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.120 
hand it will jump off
it<00:02:14.370> oh<00:02:14.700> now<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.390> disappeared<00:02:16.170> okay<00:02:16.620> that's

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
it oh now it disappeared okay that's

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.400 
it oh now it disappeared okay that's
cool<00:02:17.550> I<00:02:17.760> really<00:02:17.790> like<00:02:18.239> that<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.720> changes<00:02:19.200> from

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
cool I really like that and changes from

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.850 
cool I really like that and changes from
the<00:02:19.560> update<00:02:19.950> and<00:02:20.720> I<00:02:21.720> think<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.110> can<00:02:22.410> cause<00:02:22.830> a

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
the update and I think it can cause a

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.960 
the update and I think it can cause a
bit<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.520> lag<00:02:24.620> because<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.950> game<00:02:26.130> is<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.700> bit

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
bit of lag because the game is a bit

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.449 
bit of lag because the game is a bit
laggy<00:02:27.180> er<00:02:27.390> for<00:02:27.720> me<00:02:27.810> in<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.959> last<00:02:28.140> few<00:02:28.319> days<00:02:28.500> I'm

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
laggy er for me in the last few days I'm

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.729 
laggy er for me in the last few days I'm
not<00:02:29.640> sure<00:02:29.790> if<00:02:30.030> it's<00:02:30.330> because<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.750> that<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.290> think

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
not sure if it's because of that I think

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.820 
not sure if it's because of that I think
it's<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:32.670> one<00:02:32.970> of<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.270> things<00:02:33.620> that<00:02:34.620> makes

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
it's it's one of the things that makes

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.490 
it's it's one of the things that makes
the<00:02:35.430> game<00:02:35.580> lag<00:02:35.850> year<00:02:36.150> or<00:02:36.690> more<00:02:36.930> lag<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.350> better

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
the game lag year or more lag you better

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.930 
the game lag year or more lag you better
say<00:02:37.770> because<00:02:38.640> because<00:02:39.480> simple<00:02:39.840> thing<00:02:40.700> if<00:02:41.700> a

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
say because because simple thing if a

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.940 
say because because simple thing if a
lot<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.090> hats<00:02:42.390> are<00:02:42.750> dropping<00:02:43.260> then<00:02:43.410> it's<00:02:43.709> like

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
lot of hats are dropping then it's like

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.240 
lot of hats are dropping then it's like
a<00:02:43.980> particle<00:02:44.849> and<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.200> can<00:02:46.200> cause<00:02:46.470> lags<00:02:46.890> you

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
a particle and that can cause lags you

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.120 
a particle and that can cause lags you
know<00:02:47.400> a<00:02:47.930> but<00:02:48.930> looks<00:02:49.140> really<00:02:49.260> fancy<00:02:49.769> I'm<00:02:49.980> not

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
know a but looks really fancy I'm not

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.650 
know a but looks really fancy I'm not
even<00:02:50.400> sure<00:02:50.519> perhaps<00:02:50.850> you<00:02:50.940> can<00:02:51.090> turn<00:02:51.300> it<00:02:51.480> off

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
even sure perhaps you can turn it off

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.050 
even sure perhaps you can turn it off
that<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:51.989> doesn't<00:02:52.350> lag<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.530> much<00:02:53.040> but<00:02:53.940> I

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
that it doesn't lag that much but I

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.850 
that it doesn't lag that much but I
really<00:02:54.269> like<00:02:54.450> it<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:54.810> like<00:02:55.019> to<00:02:55.080> see<00:02:55.530> all<00:02:55.680> the

gear buses on the ground and that

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.280 
gear buses on the ground and that
