piece<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:23.100> fondant<00:02:23.550> position<00:02:24.180> it<00:02:24.270> in<00:02:24.360> the

piece of fondant position it in the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:25.910 
piece of fondant position it in the
middle<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.870> I<00:02:24.960> position<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:25.440> in<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.650> middle

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
middle and I position it in the middle

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.470 
middle and I position it in the middle
first<00:02:26.160> because<00:02:26.550> then<00:02:26.730> if<00:02:26.850> it's<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.090> little<00:02:27.360> bit

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
first because then if it's a little bit

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.630 
first because then if it's a little bit
short<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.870> can<00:02:28.140> just<00:02:28.320> pull<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.650> a<00:02:28.920> fraction<00:02:29.490> so

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
short you can just pull it a fraction so

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.330 
short you can just pull it a fraction so
that<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.180> meets<00:02:30.300> up<00:02:30.570> with<00:02:30.600> either<00:02:31.110> end<00:02:31.470> be

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
that it meets up with either end be

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.710 
that it meets up with either end be
