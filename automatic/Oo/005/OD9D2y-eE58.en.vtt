another<00:01:01.829> way<00:01:01.980> if<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:03.239> could<00:01:03.449> do<00:01:03.570> an<00:01:03.660> extra<00:01:03.930> rep

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
another way if I could do an extra rep

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.770 
another way if I could do an extra rep
at<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.979> same<00:01:05.339> weight<00:01:05.700> above<00:01:06.060> eighty<00:01:06.360> percent

at the same weight above eighty percent

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.190 
at the same weight above eighty percent
let's<00:01:06.960> say<00:01:07.049> it's<00:01:07.170> like<00:01:07.400> 85%<00:01:08.400> or<00:01:08.549> 90%<00:01:09.200> that

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
let's say it's like 85% or 90% that

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.289 
let's say it's like 85% or 90% that
indicates<00:01:10.920> I've<00:01:11.130> been<00:01:11.400> making<00:01:11.760> progress<00:01:12.000> so

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
indicates I've been making progress so

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.109 
indicates I've been making progress so
it<00:01:12.360> might<00:01:12.479> seem<00:01:12.930> slow<00:01:13.439> but<00:01:14.250> progress<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.760> slow

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
it might seem slow but progress is slow

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.270 
it might seem slow but progress is slow
as<00:01:15.240> long<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.570> it's<00:01:15.750> slow<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.470> steady<00:01:16.799> that's

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
as long as it's slow and steady that's

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.359 
as long as it's slow and steady that's
all<00:01:17.549> we<00:01:17.700> care<00:01:17.939> about<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.270> right<00:01:18.420> here<00:01:18.600> for<00:01:19.320> 25<00:01:19.950> a

everyday I did I love the results I
increased<00:01:33.509> my<00:01:33.570> swap<00:01:33.869> over<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.290> 4050<00:01:34.860> pounds

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
increased my swap over like 4050 pounds

increased my swap over like 4050 pounds
and<00:01:35.400> I<00:01:35.700> think<00:01:35.939> 12<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.450> 16<00:01:36.810> weeks<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:38.130> I'm<00:01:38.189> back

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
so being a little more preventative and

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.460 
so being a little more preventative and
that<00:03:25.450> means<00:03:25.660> we're<00:03:25.870> in<00:03:25.900> wrist<00:03:26.139> wraps<00:03:26.349> I

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
that means we're in wrist wraps I

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.080 
that means we're in wrist wraps I
certainly<00:03:26.889> find<00:03:27.099> my<00:03:27.340> right<00:03:27.519> shoulder<00:03:27.730> used<00:03:28.000> to
