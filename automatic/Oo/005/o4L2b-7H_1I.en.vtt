just going through and checking to make

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.770 
just going through and checking to make
sure<00:00:43.710> that's<00:00:44.070> working<00:00:44.579> with<00:00:44.789> sort<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.480> my

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
sure that's working with sort of my

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.600 
sure that's working with sort of my
furniture<00:00:46.079> layout<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:47.129> still<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> little

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
furniture layout it's still a little

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.400 
furniture layout it's still a little
sketchy<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.239> my<00:00:48.390> mind<00:00:48.690> but<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.020> mean<00:00:49.230> there's

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
sketchy in my mind but I mean there's

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.200 
sketchy in my mind but I mean there's
some<00:00:49.620> things<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:49.860> are<00:00:49.980> pretty<00:00:50.190> logical<00:00:50.850> for

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
some things that are pretty logical for

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.639 
some things that are pretty logical for
instance<00:00:51.390> here's<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.809> master<00:00:51.960> bedroom<00:00:52.530> you

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
instance here's the master bedroom you

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.889 
instance here's the master bedroom you
come<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.010> with<00:00:53.039> flip<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.550> switch<00:00:53.879> here<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
come in with flip on the switch here the

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.420 
come in with flip on the switch here the
bed<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.590> go<00:00:55.739> over<00:00:55.770> here<00:00:56.129> because

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
bed is going to go over here because

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.939 
bed is going to go over here because
that's<00:00:56.610> our<00:00:56.699> largest<00:00:57.030> wall<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:58.020> I'm<00:00:58.260> already

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
that's our largest wall and I'm already

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.580 
that's our largest wall and I'm already
seeing<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.579> problem<00:01:00.120> because<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:01.140> have<00:01:01.320> a

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
seeing a problem because we have a

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.250 
seeing a problem because we have a
receptacle<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.059> what<00:01:03.690> I'm<00:01:03.780> thinking<00:01:04.140> if

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
receptacle here and what I'm thinking if

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.980 
receptacle here and what I'm thinking if
the<00:01:04.409> bed<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:06.390> have<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.570> pair<00:01:06.900> of

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
the bed is here and we have a pair of

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.679 
the bed is here and we have a pair of
night<00:01:07.200> stands<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:08.130> really<00:01:08.729> don't<00:01:08.939> like<00:01:09.030> seeing

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
night stands I really don't like seeing

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.719 
night stands I really don't like seeing
when<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.080> walk<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.590> room<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:11.100> receptacle

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
when you walk in a room a receptacle

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.870 
when you walk in a room a receptacle
with<00:01:12.450> wires<00:01:12.960> sticking<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.860> okay<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.700> you're

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
with wires sticking in it okay so you're

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.940 
with wires sticking in it okay so you're
coming<00:01:15.180> through<00:01:15.390> here<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:15.900> store<00:01:16.140> maybe<00:01:16.350> open

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
coming through here the store maybe open

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.340 
coming through here the store maybe open
guests<00:01:17.759> come<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:17.970> you're<00:01:18.659> going<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.869> see<00:01:19.080> this

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
guests come in you're going to see this

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.980 
guests come in you're going to see this
so<00:01:20.040> what<00:01:20.520> I'd<00:01:20.640> rather<00:01:20.880> do<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.299> maybe<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.780> this

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
so what I'd rather do is maybe have this

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.260 
so what I'd rather do is maybe have this
pool<00:01:22.290> back<00:01:22.619> somewhere<00:01:23.220> where<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.060> would<00:01:24.150> be

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
pool back somewhere where it would be

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.679 
pool back somewhere where it would be
behind<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> bed<00:01:24.900> or<00:01:25.200> behind<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.830> bed<00:01:26.400> stand<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
behind the bed or behind a bed stand the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.690 
behind the bed or behind a bed stand the
other<00:01:27.840> thing<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.950> want<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.340> point<00:01:29.400> out

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
other thing that I want to point out

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.280 
other thing that I want to point out
which<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:29.880> good<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.689> we've<00:01:30.840> got<00:01:31.049> one

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
which is good is that we've got one

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.499 
which is good is that we've got one
centered<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.860> this<00:01:32.009> wall<00:01:32.310> over<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:32.670> because

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
centered on this wall over here because

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.179 
centered on this wall over here because
if<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> bed<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.020> here<00:01:34.439> there's<00:01:34.619> likely<00:01:34.890> to<00:01:35.070> be
