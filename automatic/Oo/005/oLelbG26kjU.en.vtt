00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:10.049
 It is time to do the second 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.049
 craftsmanship and martín us goes martín martín 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.320
 Rumor reaches the book that speaks 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:19.029
 that the book after book of the first 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.529
 edition is not book that for sure what 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.380
 he read when he was in elementary school but 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:26.990
 we can do it now 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:30.000
 so lady needs a book that 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.980
 he has to be more or less a professor 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.870
 not necessarily hard paste no 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.940
 necessarily hard paste but a 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.960
 little bit thick then what are we going to 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:48.050
 do is 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:50.890
 we lack the materials because for the 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.550
 secret book we will need a brush 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:58.150
 white glue heavy object rule and 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.150
 an unusable 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.170
 and other 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.140
 is that you really face these things 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.510
 and what we are going to do is hide 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:29.340
 a secret hiding place is created very well what 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:29.340
 let's define with the rule 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:36.060
 and here we select leaving a little 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.250
 about 34 centimeters to make it what 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.030
 thick enough and can stick with 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.030
 the resistol after 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.170
 and we exert pressure the truth is that 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.000
 let's go as if loosening a little in 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.870
 little because you can not wet the 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.870
 complete piece 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.360
 that her husband gave her the expense and not 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.390
 wants children to steal it seems 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.410
 dandy data because the games well 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.710
 abusive 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:06.090
 what you want to do a guardadito for 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.970
 buy at the end of the year something nice 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.890
 lady but the truth is that having in 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.450
 line is a temptation we do not have near 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.010
 in the bag and so on we do not want 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.010
 spend we are masters 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:32.710
 so here we take everything out 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:35.800
 left over that would be secret super hideaway 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.830
 ultra dark and recontra I am right 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.390
 spy and good what we're going to do here 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.820
 part of the going down as well as 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.300
 flojitas and all that because it mobilized 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.640
 to break is that with resistance the white knows 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.900
 that something is clear that here I am the 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.210
 ex but everything that I have my 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.820
 I already told my mother that 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.470
 better is very saver I would say yes no 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.690
 more than saver problem to deserve 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.700
 everything is not worse then 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.560
 and we started to put the fund depends on 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.580
 the optics here clear of the glass with which 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.850
 look more inverted plus a wave 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.520
 understanding then that son you are 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.380
 well saver then we started to 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.330
 put on the resistol and that's going to make 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.490
 be harder 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.380
 and also not just put it between 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:23.420
 leaves and leaves but also put it to 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.060
 tone with the corners as by the 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.920
 corners all the edge around the perimeter 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.130
 the book is important to be well 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.480
 covered and use the white glue 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.810
 simply with white glue this 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:38.120
 again we repeat they are not there 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.770
 doing no extra expense is some book 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.110
 then it happens to me sometimes 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.970
 we keep this and you will remember me 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:47.810
 I submit times but the sections 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:51.830
 these yellows are white that's good 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:04:02.240
 let's do all we can save the 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:04:04.560
 treasure plus this can not be 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:09.240
 As you remember and your life I'm already 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:12.750
 ending as what I am going to give you 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:15.510
 here is half two a little bit very 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.610
 thick and to try more among the 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.380
 leaves and all this faster 

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:21.030
 you can not discount with a little bit of 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.770
 Water 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.560
 you know that I can also make the 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.570
 I keep it as a paste type with flour 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.360
 can do that works well with him like 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.340
 we use it for him with papier mache a 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.620
 I love to use paste, it's also 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.389
 something hears that this craft we have 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.490
 aluminum song they love making paper 

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:41.580
 I mache those left him by then 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.860
 we can have a piñata also good 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.810
 Well, here you have already seen how it was 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.110
 on this side are the super plays 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.810
 stuck 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.560
 he taught them about glued cloth 2 as 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.560
 it should not be left 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.540
 then as you dry pressure by saying 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.420
 I here that I bring my mineral that the 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.900
 about it to pay the fortnight 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:09.180
 sas and that no footballers and in all 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:13.460
 tour and here we close 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:19.490
 and it becomes the treasure of knowledge 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:19.490
 living here 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:36.570
 original true this type of hashish 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.190
 simple and good so fast that what 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.710
 we finish that we are ready for the 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.260
 third craft 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:45.360
 by way of elaboration select a 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.210
 book that is not too small and that 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.260
 is completely in disuse 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.480
 we will separate the first and last 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.210
 pages to give it a more 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.070
 This is because we will hit from 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:58.020
 inside and we will prevent it from being noticed in the 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:00.750
 outside we are in front of a book 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.910
 false with the help of the cutter trims a 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:05.370
 rectangle at the center of each sheet up 

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.950
 achieve the required fund thus achieving 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.840
 a box of greater perfection once 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:12.150
 culminated we began to apply the 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.190
 white glue from inside uniting 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.510
 the folds and maintaining the morphology 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.280
 from the book 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.010
 then we paste the bottom 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.380
 to one or two end sheets allowing 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.450
 that our book opens and does not present 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.600
 at a glance the secret that hides 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.600
 inside
