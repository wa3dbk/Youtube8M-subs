guards<00:00:22.140> were<00:00:22.580> quite<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.699> challenge<00:00:24.180> to<00:00:24.359> build

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
guards were quite a challenge to build

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.540 
guards were quite a challenge to build
but<00:00:24.960> they<00:00:25.140> sure<00:00:25.740> give<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.070> some<00:00:26.310> great

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
but they sure give you some great

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.179 
but they sure give you some great
coverage<00:00:27.029> as<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:28.170> where<00:00:28.380> when<00:00:28.890> they<00:00:28.980> come

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
coverage as to where when they come

stock<00:00:29.609> from<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.000> factory<00:00:30.420> there's<00:00:30.630> nothing

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
stock from the factory there's nothing

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.020 
stock from the factory there's nothing
there<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.830> nothing<00:00:32.660> so<00:00:34.040> we<00:00:35.040> just<00:00:35.610> want<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:35.910> go

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
there is nothing so we just want to go

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.000 
there is nothing so we just want to go
through<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.540> show<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.140> install<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.770> this

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
through and show you the install on this

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.470 
through and show you the install on this
it's<00:00:38.340> it's<00:00:38.820> probably<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.270> little<00:00:39.360> more

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
it's it's probably a little more

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.840 
it's it's probably a little more
complicated<00:00:39.960> than<00:00:40.290> some<00:00:40.680> of<00:00:40.829> our<00:00:40.950> installs<00:00:41.399> so

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
complicated than some of our installs so

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.760 
complicated than some of our installs so
just<00:00:42.629> wanted<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.960> kind<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.170> walk<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.530> through

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
it what we're going to do is we're going

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.240 
it what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:00:45.000> walk<00:00:45.210> you<00:00:45.390> through<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:46.680> right<00:00:46.890> side

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
to walk you through the the right side

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.330 
to walk you through the the right side
of<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.489> machine<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.180> rear<00:00:48.390> here<00:00:48.690> first

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
of the machine on the rear here first

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.970 
of the machine on the rear here first
the<00:00:50.340> left<00:00:50.640> side<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.780> pretty<00:00:52.260> much<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.739> same

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
the left side is is pretty much the same

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.569 
the left side is is pretty much the same
other<00:00:53.850> than<00:00:54.199> we<00:00:55.199> r<00:00:55.230> minus<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.920> brake<00:00:56.190> line<00:00:57.230> and

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
other than we r minus a brake line and

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:00.860 
other than we r minus a brake line and
then<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.850> guards<00:01:00.270> are<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.510> little<00:01:00.660> different

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
then the guards are a little different

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.260 
then the guards are a little different
and<00:01:01.350> if<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.160> purchase<00:01:02.550> these<00:01:02.730> you'll<00:01:03.030> see

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
and if you purchase these you'll see

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.029 
and if you purchase these you'll see
that<00:01:03.449> when<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.809> get<00:01:03.960> them<00:01:04.140> there's

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:05.039 
that when you get them there's

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:08.469 
that when you get them there's
definitely<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.580> noticeable<00:01:06.090> difference<00:01:06.150> but

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
definitely a noticeable difference but

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.660 
definitely a noticeable difference but
they<00:01:09.479> work<00:01:09.689> great<00:01:09.900> but<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.890> rear<00:01:11.100> ends<00:01:11.430> kind

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
they work great but the rear ends kind

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.950 
they work great but the rear ends kind
of<00:01:11.760> off<00:01:11.880> shifted<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:12.990> it's<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.810> arms<00:01:15.810> are

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
of off shifted so it's it's a arms are

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.660 
of off shifted so it's it's a arms are
set<00:01:16.229> up<00:01:16.380> different<00:01:16.830> i<00:01:16.920> guess<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.189> framework

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
set up different i guess the framework

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.090 
set up different i guess the framework
underneath<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:19.080> kind<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.530> set<00:01:19.710> up<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.890> little

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
underneath is is kind of set up a little

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.219 
underneath is is kind of set up a little
differently<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:20.670> anyway<00:01:21.450> we'll<00:01:21.689> start<00:01:21.990> by

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
differently but anyway we'll start by

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.179 
differently but anyway we'll start by
removing<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> stabilizers<00:01:24.409> you<00:01:25.409> want<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.009> do

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
removing the stabilizers you want to do

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.480 
removing the stabilizers you want to do
that<00:01:26.400> on<00:01:26.640> both<00:01:26.670> sides<00:01:27.650> to<00:01:28.650> turn<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.040> rear<00:01:29.310> end

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
that on both sides to turn that rear end

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.810 
that on both sides to turn that rear end
loose<00:01:30.320> or<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.560> arm<00:01:31.890> loose<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:35.640> just

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
loose or the a arm loose and you just

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.590 
loose or the a arm loose and you just
swing<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.420> up<00:01:36.689> like<00:01:37.439> he's<00:01:37.619> done<00:01:37.829> there<00:01:38.600> so

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
swing that up like he's done there so

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.630 
swing that up like he's done there so
it's<00:01:39.750> out<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.200> way<00:01:40.229> get<00:01:41.100> both<00:01:41.369> sides

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
it's out of the way get both sides

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.810 
it's out of the way get both sides
undone<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.570> just<00:01:42.900> swing<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.200> up<00:01:43.520> then<00:01:44.520> you've

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
undone and just swing it up then you've

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.120 
undone and just swing it up then you've
got<00:01:45.060> your<00:01:45.090> shock<00:01:45.689> here<00:01:46.049> it's<00:01:46.259> easiest<00:01:46.979> to

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
got your shock here it's easiest to

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.030 
got your shock here it's easiest to
remove<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.640> shock<00:01:48.200> all<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.649> of

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
remove the shock all of this is of

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.539 
remove the shock all of this is of
course<00:01:50.070> after<00:01:50.729> you've<00:01:50.850> taken<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.329> tire<00:01:51.570> off

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
course after you've taken the tire off

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.100 
course after you've taken the tire off
it'll<00:01:53.549> make<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.939> install<00:01:54.420> go<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.689> whole<00:01:55.079> lot

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
it'll make the install go a whole lot

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.160 
it'll make the install go a whole lot
easier<00:01:55.590> if<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.880> do<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:57.990> way<00:01:59.869> we'll<00:02:00.869> go<00:02:01.020> in

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
easier if you do it this way we'll go in

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.139 
easier if you do it this way we'll go in

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.440 
that we wouldn't have to worry about
rubbing<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.360> lines<00:02:20.600> at<00:02:21.230> all<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:23.950> brake<00:02:24.950> line

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
rubbing the lines at all the brake line

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.440 
rubbing the lines at all the brake line
needs<00:02:26.450> to<00:02:26.720> be<00:02:28.030> loosened<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.210> then<00:02:30.050> rotated<00:02:31.450> to

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
needs to be loosened and then rotated to

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.680 
needs to be loosened and then rotated to
where<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:33.190> points<00:02:35.020> straight<00:02:36.020> forward<00:02:37.690> towards

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
where it points straight forward towards

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.860 
where it points straight forward towards
the<00:02:38.780> front<00:02:38.900> of<00:02:39.200> the<00:02:39.320> machine<00:02:43.360> you<00:02:44.360> can<00:02:44.600> see

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
the front of the machine you can see

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.780 
the front of the machine you can see
that<00:02:44.900> it<00:02:45.410> just<00:02:45.620> points<00:02:45.950> directly<00:02:46.310> forward

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
that it just points directly forward

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.570 
that it just points directly forward
what<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.330> does<00:02:47.630> is<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:47.960> it<00:02:48.620> gets<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:49.430> out<00:02:49.520> of

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
what that does is it it gets it out of

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.000 
what that does is it it gets it out of
the<00:02:49.790> way<00:02:49.940> of<00:02:50.240> the<00:02:50.480> boot<00:02:50.840> yards<00:02:51.350> so<00:02:51.560> that<00:02:51.800> it's

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
the way of the boot yards so that it's

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.140 
the way of the boot yards so that it's
not<00:02:52.280> rubbing<00:02:52.880> or<00:02:53.090> or<00:02:53.540> hitting<00:02:53.930> in<00:02:54.140> any<00:02:54.290> way

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
not rubbing or or hitting in any way

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.630 
not rubbing or or hitting in any way
okay<00:02:56.150> now<00:02:56.600> we're<00:02:56.840> going<00:02:57.050> to<00:02:57.430> slide<00:02:58.430> in<00:02:58.580> the

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
okay now we're going to slide in the

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.370 
okay now we're going to slide in the
boot<00:02:58.790> guard<00:02:59.090> on<00:02:59.270> you<00:03:01.360> have<00:03:02.360> to<00:03:02.570> lift<00:03:02.840> up<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.350> a

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
boot guard on you have to lift up the a

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.160 
boot guard on you have to lift up the a
arm<00:03:03.880> in<00:03:04.880> order<00:03:05.210> to<00:03:05.330> get<00:03:05.480> it<00:03:05.600> into<00:03:05.780> a<00:03:05.960> position

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
arm in order to get it into a position

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:16.510 
arm in order to get it into a position
to<00:03:06.620> where<00:03:06.740> it<00:03:06.920> will<00:03:07.070> slide<00:03:07.580> on<00:03:07.820> easily<00:03:15.520> once

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
to where it will slide on easily once

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.280 
to where it will slide on easily once
you<00:03:16.670> get<00:03:16.820> it<00:03:16.910> over<00:03:17.210> in<00:03:17.330> place<00:03:17.570> you<00:03:17.840> can<00:03:17.870> let<00:03:18.140> the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
you get it over in place you can let the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.520 
you get it over in place you can let the
a<00:03:18.320> arm<00:03:18.620> back<00:03:18.890> down<00:03:19.130> a<00:03:19.160> little<00:03:19.400> bit<00:03:20.170> I'd<00:03:21.170> like<00:03:21.380> to

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
a arm back down a little bit I'd like to

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.690 
a arm back down a little bit I'd like to
show<00:03:21.709> you<00:03:21.770> these<00:03:22.070> clamps<00:03:22.459> that<00:03:22.910> we<00:03:23.540> do<00:03:24.700> what

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700

we've<00:03:25.850> done<00:03:26.060> is<00:03:26.420> we've<00:03:27.320> made<00:03:27.560> a<00:03:27.590> clamp<00:03:27.950> here<00:03:28.250> or

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
we've done is we've made a clamp here or

another<00:04:02.970> thing<00:04:03.240> is<00:04:03.390> you<00:04:03.510> don't<00:04:03.630> want<00:04:03.840> to

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
another thing is you don't want to

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.110 
another thing is you don't want to
tighten<00:04:04.230> them<00:04:04.350> clamps<00:04:04.740> down<00:04:04.820> all<00:04:05.820> the<00:04:06.030> way

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
tighten them clamps down all the way

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.360 
tighten them clamps down all the way
tight<00:04:06.450> wait<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:07.080> get<00:04:07.230> all<00:04:07.440> four<00:04:07.470> started

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
tight wait to get all four started

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:17.090 
tight wait to get all four started
before<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.390> tighten<00:04:09.690> them<00:04:09.990> down<00:04:15.320> we're<00:04:16.320> going

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
before you tighten them down we're going

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.000 
before you tighten them down we're going
to<00:04:17.250> be<00:04:17.430> doing<00:04:17.640> a<00:04:20.900> 2-inch<00:04:21.900> receiver<00:04:22.410> hitch<00:04:22.740> for

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
to be doing a 2-inch receiver hitch for

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.230 
to be doing a 2-inch receiver hitch for
this<00:04:23.160> machine<00:04:23.400> as<00:04:23.850> well<00:04:25.340> we<00:04:26.340> haven't<00:04:26.760> got<00:04:27.000> it

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
this machine as well we haven't got it

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.210 
this machine as well we haven't got it
we've<00:04:27.540> got<00:04:27.720> some<00:04:27.930> ideas<00:04:28.410> on<00:04:28.650> it<00:04:28.890> but<00:04:29.100> we

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
we've got some ideas on it but we

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.790 
we've got some ideas on it but we
haven't<00:04:29.460> got<00:04:29.760> it<00:04:30.770> to<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:31.890> drawing<00:04:32.190> board<00:04:32.340> yet

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
haven't got it to the drawing board yet

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.530 
haven't got it to the drawing board yet
we'll<00:04:34.800> be<00:04:34.920> doing<00:04:35.070> that<00:04:35.400> and<00:04:35.700> doing<00:04:36.150> an

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
we'll be doing that and doing an

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.720 
we'll be doing that and doing an
installation<00:04:36.870> video<00:04:37.560> on<00:04:37.800> it<00:04:38.070> to<00:04:38.250> kind<00:04:38.400> of<00:04:38.520> show

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
installation video on it to kind of show

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.850 
installation video on it to kind of show
you<00:04:38.790> how<00:04:39.390> that<00:04:39.420> works<00:04:42.530> claris<00:04:43.530> really

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
you how that works claris really

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.850 
you how that works claris really
challenged<00:04:44.370> us<00:04:44.520> on<00:04:44.730> this<00:04:44.940> one<00:04:45.180> as<00:04:45.390> far<00:04:45.600> as<00:04:45.810> a

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
challenged us on this one as far as a

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.940 
challenged us on this one as far as a
way<00:04:46.860> to<00:04:46.940> to<00:04:47.940> build<00:04:48.210> ECG<00:04:48.780> new<00:04:48.960> guards<00:04:49.440> so<00:04:49.680> that

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
way to to build ECG new guards so that

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.760 
way to to build ECG new guards so that
you'd<00:04:50.760> get<00:04:51.060> adequate<00:04:51.720> protection<00:04:52.440> for<00:04:52.740> your

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
you'd get adequate protection for your

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.360 
you'd get adequate protection for your
boots<00:04:53.130> and<00:04:53.610> and<00:04:54.770> still<00:04:55.770> have<00:04:56.010> the<00:04:56.160> mobility

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
boots and and still have the mobility

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.250 
boots and and still have the mobility
and<00:04:56.970> movement<00:04:57.000> without<00:04:57.600> it<00:04:58.550> hitting<00:04:59.550> anything

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
and movement without it hitting anything

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.450 
and movement without it hitting anything
but<00:05:01.260> I<00:05:01.320> think<00:05:01.500> we've<00:05:01.620> done<00:05:01.740> a<00:05:01.800> good<00:05:01.980> job<00:05:02.040> I

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
but I think we've done a good job I

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.400 
but I think we've done a good job I
think<00:05:02.670> that<00:05:02.820> they<00:05:03.000> they'll<00:05:03.780> work<00:05:04.020> really<00:05:04.290> well

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
think that they they'll work really well

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.220 
think that they they'll work really well
and<00:05:04.860> and<00:05:05.600> provide<00:05:06.600> a<00:05:06.630> great<00:05:06.990> deal<00:05:07.200> of

shock we we made the opening a little
larger<00:06:33.980> on<00:06:34.220> the<00:06:34.250> rear<00:06:34.550> of<00:06:34.580> the<00:06:34.730> a<00:06:34.820> arm<00:06:35.210> here<00:06:35.540> to

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:35.720 
larger on the rear of the a arm here to

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.620 
larger on the rear of the a arm here to
make<00:06:35.900> it<00:06:36.140> the<00:06:36.980> bolt<00:06:38.350> more<00:06:39.350> accessible<00:06:40.130> and

easier<00:06:41.630> to<00:06:42.080> slide<00:06:43.040> in<00:06:43.280> there<00:06:43.310> so<00:06:43.850> that<00:06:45.460> you

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
easier to slide in there so that you

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:49.270 
easier to slide in there so that you
would<00:06:46.700> have<00:06:46.970> to<00:06:47.150> fight<00:06:47.420> that<00:06:47.830> but<00:06:48.830> it<00:06:48.950> didn't

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 
would have to fight that but it didn't

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.700 
would have to fight that but it didn't
take<00:06:49.850> away<00:06:50.150> from<00:06:50.450> any<00:06:50.630> of<00:06:50.720> the<00:06:50.930> protection<00:06:51.590> of

arms up so that you don't have problems

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.390 
arms up so that you don't have problems
fighting<00:07:05.660> the<00:07:05.720> other<00:07:05.870> side<00:07:06.200> and<00:07:06.560> you'll<00:07:07.220> want

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:07.400

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:09.410 
to go to the other side and basically do

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.670 
to go to the other side and basically do
the<00:07:09.440> same<00:07:10.130> install<00:07:11.170> you<00:07:12.170> only<00:07:12.290> have<00:07:12.560> the

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.680 
the same install you only have the

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.350 
the same install you only have the
brakes<00:07:12.920> on<00:07:13.160> the<00:07:13.280> one<00:07:13.430> side<00:07:13.460> so<00:07:13.970> you<00:07:14.060> don't<00:07:14.210> have

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 
brakes on the one side so you don't have

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.030 
brakes on the one side so you don't have
to<00:07:14.510> worry<00:07:14.690> about<00:07:14.810> any<00:07:15.110> of<00:07:15.290> that<00:07:15.320> stuff<00:07:15.620> and

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:16.040 
to worry about any of that stuff and

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.940 
to worry about any of that stuff and
everything<00:07:16.670> else<00:07:16.850> is<00:07:17.150> is<00:07:17.450> the<00:07:17.810> same<00:07:18.050> like<00:07:18.800> I

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:18.950 
everything else is is the same like I

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.740 
everything else is is the same like I
said<00:07:19.010> you'll<00:07:19.430> notice<00:07:19.820> that<00:07:19.850> the<00:07:20.120> boot<00:07:20.330> guards

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:20.750 
said you'll notice that the boot guards

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.640 
said you'll notice that the boot guards
are<00:07:21.280> different<00:07:22.280> and<00:07:22.720> I<00:07:24.250> don't<00:07:25.250> know<00:07:25.310> if

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:25.650 
are different and I don't know if

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.360 
are different and I don't know if
can<00:07:26.270> seal<00:07:27.270> you'll<00:07:27.570> see<00:07:27.840> it<00:07:28.020> when<00:07:28.169> you<00:07:28.229> when<00:07:29.190> you

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:29.370 
can seal you'll see it when you when you

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:31.400 
can seal you'll see it when you when you
get<00:07:30.120> your<00:07:30.180> machine<00:07:30.660> up<00:07:30.840> there<00:07:30.870> and<00:07:31.169> start

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:31.410 
get your machine up there and start

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.999 
get your machine up there and start
working<00:07:31.590> on<00:07:31.979> it<00:07:32.570> how<00:07:33.570> that<00:07:33.870> frame<00:07:34.259> comes<00:07:34.650> back

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:35.009 
working on it how that frame comes back

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:37.490 
working on it how that frame comes back
and<00:07:35.400> it's<00:07:36.000> it's<00:07:36.300> kind<00:07:36.630> of<00:07:36.720> off<00:07:36.930> to<00:07:37.259> one<00:07:37.470> side

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:37.500 
and it's it's kind of off to one side

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:43.510 
and it's it's kind of off to one side
from<00:07:38.280> the<00:07:40.520> center<00:07:41.520> of<00:07:41.550> the<00:07:41.699> machine<00:07:42.150> and<00:07:42.419> it

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 
from the center of the machine and it
