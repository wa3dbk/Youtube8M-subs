00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.940
 There were many decisions 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.490
 recognized government 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.869
 as we knew perfectly well common 

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:12.869
 when we decided to attack him 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:15.799
 and press it 2 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.419
 the sectors that speak a bit of a party 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.629
 according to g1 we could have advantages because that's how it was 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.120
 the awarded what you imagine what if it will do everything that everything we do 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.119
 we studied from Mexico went out perfectly 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.550
 We knew how incredible Mexico was 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.240
 the iii and we knew 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.240
 they completely passed that it could not be another game 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.840
 also national added saying mancuso 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.140
 and that's it 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.859
 and every day forward Kyle 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.870
 burn that Ciudad Juárez has not lost intensity of white a little 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.530
 to say it better production 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.950
 but no, but it did not work because because we 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.460
 we have very fast players in front of the court without gravity 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.990
 from three quarters of court to forward 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:06.330
 what is needed is to say and although it was seen 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.140
 that's why it seems good 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.140
 He even came to any proposal that he heard tv 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.760
 I put the bass and the sprint I knew that he likes 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
 to break so the quality of players who had 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.100
 I do not think the forcefulness was what I did 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.330
 he allowed them 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.220
 handle the match 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.830
 we all knew 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.140
 the possible mistakes goal 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.420
 the middle of the Mexico court and and back 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.420
 yes they were and we were affected, we took advantage 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.380
 what I did not like or the waste 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.850
 the real avilés both the ball half the second time when one 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.370
 when one has that we have 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.560
 if we 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.350
 and not only the proxies of the ball would surely have been heard 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.690
 We did not have any surprises but if it had been 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.220
 a game much more much more bearable much quieter 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.670
 and we could have even increased 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.159
 the score 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:10.229
 percent 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.039
 putting yourself in the place is a type heater sometimes 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.899
 chaves putting yourself in the place of the bass and 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:23.169
 if it had passed the first goal regardless of what after 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:26.169
 Argentina passed it up to Mexico 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.029
 the minimum of meaning 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:32.259
 when 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:33.819
 Messi is not allowed to play 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.289
 and the terrible prian kick and the referee says absolutely nothing 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:40.859
 because if today to tornado 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.400
 this one but the pp showed red was totally normal 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.149
 and yet oil 

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:52.399
 the figure of the court was next to extension I do not know what number of my 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:55.599
 warning 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.429
 maybe say 

00:02:57.429 --> 00:03:00.829
 that many less unfavorable and I in my own flesh this boy 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.739
 we come back from poetry in chile 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.299
 what elm 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.449
 bella and others 

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:13.029
 I decided that it would be quick for me to dig the truth in briga aprestaban to the 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:15.869
 leg 

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:21.099
 as a clear base we're going to let which one go to the soccer that messi is 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.029
 scandalous 

00:03:23.029 --> 00:03:26.589
 messi grabs the ball and viii will prop up the left zone or the 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:27.719
 right 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:29.409
 the union and the ball 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.409
 then that is important but good 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:36.319
 today I say that the 9th day a terra 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:39.319
 and that in the territory of others and is not sympathetic 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:42.949
 but it seems they would have split so the match opened 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:46.809
 and we had an inventory out there with germany 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.359
 and good is wrong 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.369
 but the bank does not have 

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:56.829
 1 I do not understand or be in all an achievement 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.030
 I'm telling you 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.159
 I propose much more than what they hurt Messi 

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:07.289
 that out there according to a line is wrong in a mazar what you most 

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:08.849
 liked living with the team 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:09.690
 and if there was 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.030
 the government thinks they have to focus a lot thinking that although 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.759
 Germany 

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:18.249
 I do not think that forcefulness was what 

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:19.989
 initially 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:21.870
 handle the match 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.490
 we all knew 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.789
 the possible mistakes goal 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.110
 the middle of the Mexico court and and back 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.110
 yes they were and we did not succeed in taking advantage 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:37.040
 what I did not like or the waste 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.520
 the real avilés both the ball half the second time when one 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.229
 when you have the pri that we have if we 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:49.020
 and not only the proxies of the ball would surely have been heard 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:53.349
 we did not go through a shock but if it had been 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:56.879
 a game much more much more bearable much quieter 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.330
 and we could have even increased 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.330
 the score 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.379
 there are those who take 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:09.449
 amen to do 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.689
 the aircraft one of it 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:15.279
 at the time of January this year 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:17.509
 something similar to marijuana 

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:20.509
 until now 

00:05:22.349 --> 00:05:25.460
 the shark 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.620
 cabal in the last great area 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.830
 the employer 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.779
 they insured
