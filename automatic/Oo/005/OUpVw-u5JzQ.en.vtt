 because that is what we are going to assemble 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:33.819
 to this and we're going to start letting 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:40.270

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:43.020

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:15.770
 of totalitarian in the cappuccino results 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:18.590
 which is a in a drink that is born in 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.810
 italy and takes its name those of the 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.090
 Capuchin monks is nothing 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.650
 complicated but it turns out there's a lot 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.230
 people who say it's cappuccino by the 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.810
 hood that they put on and do what is my 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.280
 friend marcelino bread and wine now in 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.590
 Holy week was spent in all 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.810
 channels gave us dhabi four times like this 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.640
 short walking there is no nice pretty the 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.100
 movie but good tastes more than linen bread 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.019
 and came and go monks who are 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.080
 just these capuchin monks who 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.989
 they bring a hood like a garment 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.750
 coffee and his belt is sometimes white 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.480
 with huaraches and this I do not know if it 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.750
 remember the ball they have here 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.440
 They have like in the hair 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.930
 I do not like a 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.680
 what will be called the torito has a hole 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:09.580
 there from bald to a cat with na hair in the 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:13.350
 in the hair I do not know what is going this hole 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.750
 that are shaved but I do know that the 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.940
 Capuchin comes not from the hood but 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.880
 from the hole that the friars had 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.550
 cappuccinos then still be 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.920
 does that I read them maybe it's 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:31.290
 they shave their hair if they just do not 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:36.020
 does it have any meaning to have some 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:39.470
 meaning as the skullcap will be 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.540
 that will be good but that's where it comes from 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.160
 really for the hair hole and not 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.590
 so much for the nasturtium that good 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.000
 cappuccino finally if it is at a 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.840
 etymology 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.010
 means hood not cap 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:57.330
 from the Latin well let's add it here 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.120
 the dust 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:05.330
 of cappuccinos 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.330
 we are also going to put the soluble coffee 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:14.560

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.120
 decor 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.550

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.240
 cherries 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.410
 how to explain 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.410

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.180
 with the xerez whenever you add it 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.820
 alcohol to the creams begin to 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.710
 strike out 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:50.120
 then you have to add it little by little 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.120
 so they do not lose their fluffiness ay 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:59.449

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.840
 When you have alcohol, you have to 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.650
 try to leave then after it is 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:13.340
