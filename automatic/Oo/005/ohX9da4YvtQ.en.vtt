00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
fairly common knowledge but there's a

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.340 
fairly common knowledge but there's a
lot<00:00:31.830> more<00:00:31.859> you<00:00:32.099> can<00:00:32.219> add<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.910> this<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:34.110> let's

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
lot more you can add to this so let's

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.750 
lot more you can add to this so let's
start<00:00:34.649> off<00:00:34.800> with<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.010> little<00:00:35.190> bit<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.430> theory

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
have shown you some Theory you've

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.100 
have shown you some Theory you've
probably<00:00:43.530> studied<00:00:44.070> intervals<00:00:44.840> well<00:00:45.840> let's

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
probably studied intervals well let's

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.750 
probably studied intervals well let's
talk<00:00:46.230> about<00:00:46.289> dominant<00:00:46.890> chords<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.460> minute

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
talk about dominant chords for a minute

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.389 
talk about dominant chords for a minute
one<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.870> most<00:00:49.050> definitive<00:00:49.440> intervals<00:00:50.250> in

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
one of the most definitive intervals in

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.130 
one of the most definitive intervals in
a<00:00:50.489> dominant<00:00:50.670> chord<00:00:51.180> actually<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.960> most

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
a dominant chord actually the most

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.869 
a dominant chord actually the most
definitive<00:00:52.500> interval<00:00:53.280> in<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.520> dominant

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
definitive interval in the dominant

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.069 
definitive interval in the dominant
chord<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.690> tritone<00:00:55.230> or<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.530> flat<00:00:56.280> five

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
chord is the tritone or a flat five

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.470 
chord is the tritone or a flat five
interval<00:00:58.280> the<00:00:59.280> flat<00:00:59.460> five<00:00:59.699> interval<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.420> a

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
interval the flat five interval in a

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.900 
interval the flat five interval in a
dominant<00:01:00.629> chord<00:01:01.020> actually<00:01:01.350> defines<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.670> very

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
dominant chord actually defines the very

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.359 
dominant chord actually defines the very
cord<00:01:03.239> itself<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:04.530> let's<00:01:04.739> say<00:01:04.890> we're<00:01:05.040> talking

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
cord itself so let's say we're talking

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.609 
cord itself so let's say we're talking
about<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.549> sea<00:01:05.760> dominant<00:01:06.240> seventh<00:01:06.600> chord<00:01:06.869> well

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
about a sea dominant seventh chord well

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.760 
about a sea dominant seventh chord well
the<00:01:07.740> 22<00:01:08.580> notes<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.090> comprise<00:01:10.080> that<00:01:10.320> tritone

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
the 22 notes that comprise that tritone

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.289 
the 22 notes that comprise that tritone
are<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.250> third<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.760> seventh<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
are the third and the seventh of the

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.330 
are the third and the seventh of the
court<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.409> case<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.860> third<00:01:14.130> would<00:01:14.310> be

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
court so in this case the third would be

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.539 
court so in this case the third would be
e<00:01:14.540> and<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:16.049> flat<00:01:16.530> seventh<00:01:17.100> because<00:01:17.369> it's

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
e and the flat seventh because it's

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.330 
e and the flat seventh because it's
dominik<00:01:17.970> or<00:01:18.150> go<00:01:18.240> be<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.390> b-flat<00:01:18.920> so<00:01:19.920> these<00:01:20.070> two

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
dominik or go be a b-flat so these two

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.730 
dominik or go be a b-flat so these two
notes<00:01:20.960> absolutely<00:01:21.960> say<00:01:22.200> c7<00:01:23.100> okay<00:01:24.560> so<00:01:25.560> there's

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
notes absolutely say c7 okay so there's

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.890 
notes absolutely say c7 okay so there's

be<00:01:59.409> the<00:01:59.500> same<00:01:59.680> shape<00:01:59.920> again<00:02:00.540> that's<00:02:01.540> g7<00:02:02.440> but

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
be the same shape again that's g7 but

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.430 
be the same shape again that's g7 but
it's<00:02:03.220> up<00:02:03.340> one<00:02:03.580> fret<00:02:03.790> so<00:02:04.540> our<00:02:04.690> one<00:02:04.960> chord<00:02:05.259> is

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
it's up one fret so our one chord is

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.120 
it's up one fret so our one chord is
here<00:02:05.729> are<00:02:06.729> four<00:02:07.060> cores<00:02:07.360> here<00:02:07.659> are<00:02:08.619> five<00:02:08.890> core

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
here are four cores here are five core

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.150 
here are four cores here are five core
is<00:02:09.250> here<00:02:09.539> okay<00:02:10.539> now<00:02:11.140> why<00:02:11.440> this<00:02:11.500> finger<00:02:12.069> ring

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
is here okay now why this finger ring

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.640 
is here okay now why this finger ring
because<00:02:12.580> it<00:02:12.970> frees<00:02:13.300> up<00:02:13.540> these<00:02:13.750> two<00:02:14.050> fingers<00:02:14.290> to

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
because it frees up these two fingers to

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.550 
because it frees up these two fingers to
play<00:02:14.890> melodic<00:02:15.459> lines<00:02:15.730> okay<00:02:16.630> so<00:02:17.140> this<00:02:17.350> is<00:02:17.500> a

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
play melodic lines okay so this is a

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.290 
play melodic lines okay so this is a
blues<00:02:17.830> let's<00:02:18.100> think<00:02:18.310> pentatonic<00:02:18.910> here<00:02:19.120> I

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
blues let's think pentatonic here I

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.540 
blues let's think pentatonic here I
could<00:02:19.810> play<00:02:20.080> with<00:02:20.319> these<00:02:20.440> two<00:02:20.650> fingers<00:02:20.860> a<00:02:21.220> seed

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
could play with these two fingers a seed

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.060 
could play with these two fingers a seed
pentatonic<00:02:22.120> scale<00:02:24.900> okay<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.440> one<00:02:26.860> good<00:02:27.040> thing

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
pentatonic scale okay so one good thing

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.210 
pentatonic scale okay so one good thing
to<00:02:27.280> practice<00:02:27.310> would<00:02:27.790> just<00:02:28.000> be<00:02:28.830> at<00:02:29.830> the<00:02:29.890> core

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
to practice would just be at the core

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.259 
to practice would just be at the core
drink<00:02:32.100> just<00:02:33.100> to<00:02:33.220> get<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.580> get<00:02:33.880> used<00:02:34.060> to<00:02:34.180> the

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
drink just to get the get used to the

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.470 
drink just to get the get used to the
idea<00:02:34.300> of<00:02:35.230> two<00:02:35.650> fingers<00:02:35.980> things<00:02:36.340> fail<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:37.330> two

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
idea of two fingers things fail and two

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.330 
idea of two fingers things fail and two
fingers<00:02:37.810> moving<00:02:38.200> with<00:02:39.010> lines<00:02:41.190> once<00:02:42.190> that

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
fingers moving with lines once that

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.860 
fingers moving with lines once that
starts<00:02:42.550> feeling<00:02:42.850> comfortable<00:02:43.330> then<00:02:43.840> you

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
starts feeling comfortable then you

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.030 
starts feeling comfortable then you
might<00:02:44.140> want<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.410> mess<00:02:44.530> around<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.830> blues<00:02:45.010> a

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
might want to mess around the blues a

00:02:45.040 --> 00:03:29.440 
might want to mess around the blues a
little<00:02:45.370> bit

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.420 

and<00:03:30.450> on<00:03:30.750> or<00:03:30.870> not<00:03:30.989> you<00:03:31.290> could<00:03:31.440> play<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:32.340> know

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
and on or not you could play you know

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.740 
and on or not you could play you know
blues<00:03:32.640> like<00:03:32.819> that<00:03:32.970> for<00:03:33.120> a<00:03:33.180> lot<00:03:33.300> of<00:03:33.360> hours

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
blues like that for a lot of hours

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.990 
blues like that for a lot of hours
there's<00:03:33.959> a<00:03:34.019> lot<00:03:34.290> of<00:03:34.319> combinations<00:03:34.739> there<00:03:35.550> so

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
there's a lot of combinations there so

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.369 
there's a lot of combinations there so
it<00:03:36.120> does<00:03:36.300> take<00:03:36.330> some<00:03:36.660> trial<00:03:36.959> and<00:03:37.080> error<00:03:37.230> and

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
it does take some trial and error and

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.369 
it does take some trial and error and
some<00:03:37.739> experimentation<00:03:38.569> now<00:03:39.569> we<00:03:40.140> know<00:03:40.349> that

00:03:40.369 --> 00:03:40.379 
some experimentation now we know that

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.410 
some experimentation now we know that
dominant<00:03:41.280> chords<00:03:41.519> aren't<00:03:41.730> only<00:03:41.910> used<00:03:42.209> for

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
dominant chords aren't only used for

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.050 
dominant chords aren't only used for
blues<00:03:42.660> they're<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.200> five<00:03:43.440> chords<00:03:44.010> in<00:03:44.459> 251

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
blues they're the five chords in 251

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.030 
blues they're the five chords in 251
progressions<00:03:45.900> which<00:03:46.200> are<00:03:46.319> so<00:03:46.470> prevalent<00:03:46.709> in

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
progressions which are so prevalent in

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.449 
progressions which are so prevalent in
jazz<00:03:47.340> ok<00:03:48.150> so<00:03:48.720> I'm<00:03:48.900> playing<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.260> c7<00:03:49.950> that's<00:03:50.280> the

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
jazz ok so I'm playing the c7 that's the

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.089 
jazz ok so I'm playing the c7 that's the
5<00:03:50.640> chord<00:03:50.940> in<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.150> key<00:03:51.239> of<00:03:51.420> F<00:03:51.810> so<00:03:52.500> our<00:03:52.590> two<00:03:52.769> chord

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
5 chord in the key of F so our two chord

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.820 
5 chord in the key of F so our two chord
is<00:03:53.250> going<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.459> be<00:03:53.519> a<00:03:53.549> G<00:03:53.879> minor<00:03:54.120> 7<00:03:54.629> ok<00:03:55.379> any

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
is going to be a G minor 7 ok any

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.280 
is going to be a G minor 7 ok any
voicing<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:56.849> our<00:03:57.360> 5<00:03:57.599> chord<00:03:57.900> we're<00:03:58.110> going<00:03:58.230> to

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
voicing and our 5 chord we're going to

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.490 
voicing and our 5 chord we're going to
use<00:03:58.379> this<00:03:58.590> now<00:03:59.190> as<00:03:59.430> our<00:03:59.579> c7<00:03:59.819> and<00:04:00.390> then<00:04:01.170> we<00:04:01.349> have

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
use this now as our c7 and then we have

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.710 
use this now as our c7 and then we have
some<00:04:01.739> sort<00:04:01.950> of<00:04:02.069> F<00:04:02.220> major<00:04:02.430> 7<00:04:02.760> chord<00:04:02.970> to<00:04:03.360> resolve

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
some sort of F major 7 chord to resolve

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.130 
some sort of F major 7 chord to resolve
to<00:04:04.019> ok<00:04:04.769> so<00:04:05.400> you<00:04:05.459> could<00:04:05.670> play<00:04:05.700> ideas<00:04:06.420> over<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.930> G

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
to ok so you could play ideas over the G

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.949 
to ok so you could play ideas over the G
minor<00:04:07.349> 7<00:04:08.840> and<00:04:10.459> then<00:04:11.459> go<00:04:11.640> into<00:04:11.819> your<00:04:12.180> c7<00:04:12.840> and

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
minor 7 and then go into your c7 and

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:20.029 
minor 7 and then go into your c7 and
play<00:04:13.890> like<00:04:14.069> a<00:04:14.129> mixolydian<00:04:14.700> scale<00:04:18.919> and<00:04:19.919> then

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
play like a mixolydian scale and then

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:38.540 
play like a mixolydian scale and then
resolves<00:04:20.519> to<00:04:20.579> the<00:04:20.729> one

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.969 

okay<00:04:39.550> now<00:04:40.270> we<00:04:40.330> also<00:04:40.599> use<00:04:41.199> dominant<00:04:41.740> chords

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
okay now we also use dominant chords

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.100 
okay now we also use dominant chords
that<00:04:42.069> are<00:04:42.130> highly<00:04:42.490> altered<00:04:42.970> in<00:04:43.240> 251

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
that are highly altered in 251

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.080 
that are highly altered in 251
progressions<00:04:44.830> and<00:04:44.979> so<00:04:45.400> the<00:04:45.520> mixolydian<00:04:45.849> mode

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
progressions and so the mixolydian mode

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.879 
progressions and so the mixolydian mode
doesn't<00:04:46.449> work<00:04:46.690> that<00:04:46.900> great<00:04:47.199> over<00:04:47.560> altered

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
doesn't work that great over altered

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.730 
doesn't work that great over altered
chords<00:04:48.340> so<00:04:48.729> let's<00:04:48.910> try<00:04:49.180> something<00:04:49.630> like<00:04:49.660> a<00:04:49.810> C

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
chords so let's try something like a C

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.320 
chords so let's try something like a C
sharp<00:04:51.009> diminished<00:04:51.250> scale<00:04:51.880> this<00:04:52.060> would<00:04:52.210> be<00:04:52.300> a

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
sharp diminished scale this would be a

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.559 
sharp diminished scale this would be a
c-sharp<00:04:52.870> a<00:04:53.639> whole<00:04:54.639> half<00:04:54.880> diminished<00:04:55.360> scale

00:04:55.559 --> 00:04:55.569 
c-sharp a whole half diminished scale

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.629 
c-sharp a whole half diminished scale
which<00:04:55.720> works<00:04:55.960> very<00:04:56.080> well<00:04:56.349> so<00:04:57.099> now<00:04:57.340> I'm<00:04:57.490> holding

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
which works very well so now I'm holding

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.850 
which works very well so now I'm holding
down<00:04:57.910> the<00:04:58.090> c7<00:04:58.750> I'm<00:04:59.139> going<00:04:59.319> to<00:04:59.410> look<00:04:59.500> for<00:04:59.710> my

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
down the c7 I'm going to look for my

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.520 
down the c7 I'm going to look for my
diminished<00:05:00.370> scale<00:05:00.610> notes<00:05:00.910> and<00:05:01.120> here<00:05:01.270> they<00:05:01.419> are

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530
