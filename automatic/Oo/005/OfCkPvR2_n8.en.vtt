00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.320
 hi welcome everyone on the 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.850
 nonsense schnell today I you 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.490
 proposes to discover a recipe 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.110
 Asian is the chicken stir-fry 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.550
 cashew nuts you will see that this is 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.290
 not complicated it certainly needs 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.820
 irradiating specific but we find them 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:26.770
 very easily you will see all 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.660
 the steps in video we start the 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.039
 recipe by preparing sweet peppers 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.300
 wanted to go under the clear wanted 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.280
 cut in half you remove the seeds 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.379
 and you're going to make big straps 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.230
 who have followed the re-cut again 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.120
 to make pieces of 2.3 cm to little 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.339
 close then we take the onion you 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.110
 cut in half and the same thing makes you 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.500
 big pieces to really cut you 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.120
 Roughly you book all that 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.190
 then we'll take care of the chicken so 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.120
 I took some chicken cutlets 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.350
 farmer 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.940
 you can take white of 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.320
 yellow in front of what you want you 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.890
 can even use if you want some 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.979
 thigh highs 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.500
 finally another piece of chicken so 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:04.629
 you cut it up into pieces of 3 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.790
 cm like that its coordinates with the 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.460
 peppers you cut it out so you the 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.960
 book then you will take a 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.700
 large frying pan or large skillet and 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.619
 on a medium-high heat you add 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.390
 vegetable oil and there you go to do 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.920
 brown your cashews for two 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.820
 three minutes so be careful about that 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.890
 go very very fast 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.719
 so I specify the brand added nature 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.439
 so no toast and pass east is 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:25.689
 really important 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.729
 so when they are ready randall 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.710
 are gilded you will remove them from the 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.570
 jumping possibly you add to 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.950
 again a little bit of vegetable oil and 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.140
 there you will add the onion 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.789
 you're going to cook the onion us on 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.299
 a medium-high heat for two to three 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.789
 minutes 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.200
 then we will add the pieces 2 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:43.450
 peppers that were prepared just now 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.549
 give you a good change of the preparation 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.890
 and there you go down fire at 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.749
 minimum you cover and you go 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.640
 cook for 15 20 minutes 

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:53.170
 the peppers have to be really 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.450
 very tender so you watch from 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.549
 occasionally cooking after 20 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.319
 minutes of which by close we remove the 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.210
 peppers and onions wanted to book 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.310
 in a bowl and then we will take care 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.719
 of cooking chicken so always 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.700
 in the same pan 

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:09.190
 you add the chicken we will add 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.810
 then soy sauce so I specify 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.270
 that this is the soy sauce room and 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.790
 it's not sugar and so soy sauce 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.860
 then you 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.349
 add the fish sauce so we 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.079
 more often known as nuke 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.879
 then I want to add the sauce 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.219
 of oyster then his three jumps that 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.019
 wanted to find very easily in the 

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:30.359
 Chinese neighborhoods of course but also 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:31.680
 in the supermarkets I saw under 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.430
 different brands so it's very 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.930
 easy to find 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.409
 you will also be able to do this 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.329
 recipe so then we add a small 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.189
 little water we mix well the preparation 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.900
 with the chicken and then we will add 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.269
 of garlic so either do you reduce in 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.920
 more pop with the speaker either you 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.940
 cut into small pieces and puts you 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.370
 changing 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.650
 we're mixing a little bit so it all 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.080
 on a medium fire then we will add 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.270
 so the peppers with the onions we 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.310
 cooked just before we go there 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.830
 add the cashew nuts that we made 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.320
 toast in vegetable oil 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.810
 change your dish again and there 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.380
 you will cover for about five 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.390
 minutes but on a very soft fire 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.160
 so to accompany this sauteed chicken 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.440
 our cage or of course we serve with 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.270
 rice so if you can if you have 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.610
 the device so the famous rice cooker 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.590
 like that it makes you a cooked rice a 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.660
 little bit sticky as in the 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.070
 chinese restaurants 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.690
 and that's so it gives you a 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:29.880
 rice a little different and it makes its 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.560
 indeed it's super good in any case that's it 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.420
 so recipes really really easy there 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.220
 there are not a lot of ingredients like 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.920
 as in recipes I already have 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.920
 do we use the oyster sauce the 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.180
 yachtman or the salty soy sauce but a 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.320
 Once you have these sauces, here you are 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.270
 can really make lots of recipes 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.220
 with and in addition it is kept cool 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.130
 for several months so there is no 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.690
 of excuses until then I wish you 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.550

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.900
