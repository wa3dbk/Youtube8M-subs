impaired by that kind of emotional
interference<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.560> when<00:01:44.250> we<00:01:44.430> talk<00:01:44.640> about

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
interference so when we talk about

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.090 
interference so when we talk about
healthy<00:01:45.780> development<00:01:46.409> in<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.619> early<00:01:46.950> years

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.770 
healthy development in the early years
and<00:01:47.369> particularly<00:01:47.850> when<00:01:48.180> we<00:01:48.329> talk<00:01:48.360> about

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
and particularly when we talk about

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.050 
and particularly when we talk about
preparing<00:01:49.649> children<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.369> succeed<00:01:50.579> in<00:01:50.970> school

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
preparing children to succeed in school

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.330 
preparing children to succeed in school
cannot<00:01:52.450> separate<00:01:53.049> cognitive<00:01:53.830> development

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
cannot separate cognitive development

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.940 
cannot separate cognitive development
from<00:01:54.909> social-emotional<00:01:55.810> development<00:01:55.950> you

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
from social-emotional development you

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.740 
from social-emotional development you
can't<00:01:57.250> have<00:01:57.460> one<00:01:57.700> without<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.119> other

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
can't have one without the other

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.289 
can't have one without the other
so<00:01:59.229> when<00:01:59.590> children<00:01:59.830> experience<00:02:00.299> stable

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:01.299 
so when children experience stable

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.100 
so when children experience stable
nurturing<00:02:01.900> relationships<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:03.520> fosters<00:02:04.479> the

nurturing relationships it fosters the

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.140 
nurturing relationships it fosters the
development<00:02:05.770> of<00:02:05.920> healthy<00:02:06.369> circuitry<00:02:06.909> and

development of healthy circuitry and

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.719

when<00:02:07.810> children<00:02:08.050> experience<00:02:08.610> uncertainty<00:02:09.610> or

because<00:02:52.540> as<00:02:52.959> we<00:02:53.230> often<00:02:53.560> say<00:02:53.950> when<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:54.670> comes<00:02:54.880> to
