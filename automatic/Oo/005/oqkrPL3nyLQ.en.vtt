00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.709 
neste set facing Direction 290 it's very
important<00:00:46.430> it's<00:00:47.430> facing<00:00:47.610> direction<00:00:48.030> now<00:00:48.149> the

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
important it's facing direction now the

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.200 
important it's facing direction now the
variable<00:00:49.110> HP<00:00:49.590> that's<00:00:50.070> health<00:00:50.809> to<00:00:51.809> 100<00:00:52.800> and

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
then step yes to do if HP is zero equal

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:07.280 
then step yes to do if HP is zero equal
to<00:01:00.079> then<00:01:01.640> destroy<00:01:02.640> self<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:04.400> set<00:01:05.400> alarm<00:01:05.700> 0<00:01:06.540> to

over here

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.270 
over here
no<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:15.000> step<00:01:15.479> transform<00:01:15.960> sprite<00:01:16.259> this<00:01:16.799> way<00:01:17.009> he

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
no and step transform sprite this way he

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.090 
no and step transform sprite this way he
will<00:01:17.430> turn<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.119> stuff<00:01:18.500> so<00:01:19.500> all<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.890> have<00:01:19.950> to

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
will turn and stuff so all you have to

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.620 
will turn and stuff so all you have to
do<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:21.290> this<00:01:22.290> facing<00:01:23.009> Direction<00:01:24.000> angle<00:01:24.450> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
do is this facing Direction angle and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.359 
do is this facing Direction angle and
then<00:01:24.960> I'm<00:01:25.170> nothing<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:25.979> don't<00:01:26.159> have<00:01:26.280> to

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
then I'm nothing and you don't have to

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.429 
then I'm nothing and you don't have to
change<00:01:26.549> anything<00:01:26.820> else

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
change anything else

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.560 
change anything else
so<00:01:28.439> collision<00:01:28.829> with<00:01:28.950> bullet<00:01:29.520> -<00:01:29.759> that's<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
so collision with bullet - that's the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.380 
so collision with bullet - that's the
boat<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.750> playing<00:01:31.140> -<00:01:31.290> shoots<00:01:32.000> destroy<00:01:33.000> other

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
boat that playing - shoots destroy other

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.780 
boat that playing - shoots destroy other
that<00:01:33.990> way<00:01:34.110> he<00:01:34.229> doesn't<00:01:34.380> keep<00:01:34.799> hurting<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.520> and

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
that way he doesn't keep hurting you and

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.929 
that way he doesn't keep hurting you and
that<00:01:36.360> variable<00:01:36.750> HP<00:01:37.850> 2-5<00:01:39.950> then<00:01:40.950> now<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.460> turn

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
that variable HP 2-5 then now to turn

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.270 
that variable HP 2-5 then now to turn
when<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.899> turn<00:01:43.110> left<00:01:43.820> set<00:01:44.820> facing<00:01:45.420> direction

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
when you turn left set facing direction

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.840 
when you turn left set facing direction
to<00:01:47.280> 5<00:01:48.020> that<00:01:49.020> way<00:01:49.170> he<00:01:49.439> will<00:01:49.619> rotate<00:01:49.860> left

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.840 

you<00:01:54.850> know<00:01:55.060> you<00:01:55.120> want<00:01:55.360> him<00:01:55.450> to<00:01:55.540> go<00:01:55.659> forward<00:01:56.850> said

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
you know you want him to go forward said

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.790 
you know you want him to go forward said
facing<00:01:58.330> direction<00:01:59.100> to<00:02:00.100> speed<00:02:00.729> six<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.740> that

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
facing direction to speed six so that

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.250 
facing direction to speed six so that
way<00:02:03.010> he'll<00:02:03.280> will<00:02:03.520> be<00:02:03.700> going<00:02:04.210> in<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.170> direction

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
way he'll will be going in the direction

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.050 
way he'll will be going in the direction
of<00:02:05.560> facing<00:02:05.890> direction<00:02:06.220> and<00:02:06.400> he<00:02:06.760> will<00:02:06.880> be<00:02:06.970> going

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
of facing direction and he will be going

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.730 
of facing direction and he will be going
at<00:02:07.540> speed<00:02:07.869> of<00:02:07.960> six<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:10.149> then<00:02:10.300> right<00:02:10.620> it's<00:02:11.620> at

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
at speed of six so then right it's at

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.710 
at speed of six so then right it's at
variable<00:02:12.130> facing<00:02:12.459> direction<00:02:12.820> to<00:02:13.030> minus<00:02:13.510> five

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
variable facing direction to minus five

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.900 
variable facing direction to minus five
of<00:02:13.959> course<00:02:14.200> same<00:02:14.800> as<00:02:14.890> before<00:02:15.010> but<00:02:15.220> if

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
of course same as before but if

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.290 
of course same as before but if
expression<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:16.600> true<00:02:16.840> facing<00:02:17.770> direction

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
expression is true facing direction

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.860 
expression is true facing direction
smaller<00:02:19.300> than<00:02:19.600> zero<00:02:21.390> you're<00:02:22.390> going<00:02:22.600> to<00:02:22.660> want

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
smaller than zero you're going to want

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.870 
smaller than zero you're going to want
to<00:02:22.959> set<00:02:23.230> facing<00:02:23.590> direction<00:02:23.950> back<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.459> 360<00:02:26.880> okay

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
to set facing direction back to 360 okay

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.770 
to set facing direction back to 360 okay
so<00:02:28.390> if<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:28.989> release<00:02:29.530> up<00:02:30.390> then<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:31.510> want<00:02:31.660> to<00:02:31.690> be

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
so if you release up then you want to be

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.090 
so if you release up then you want to be
able<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:31.930> stop<00:02:32.230> so<00:02:33.190> you<00:02:33.280> stop<00:02:34.800> okay<00:02:35.800> so<00:02:35.860> when

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
able to stop so you stop okay so when

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.729 
able to stop so you stop okay so when
you're<00:02:36.190> outside<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.550> room<00:02:37.230> then<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.500> want<00:02:38.680> to

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
you're outside the room then you want to

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.680 
you're outside the room then you want to
wrap<00:02:38.920> in<00:02:39.160> both<00:02:39.310> directions<00:02:39.670> meaning<00:02:40.239> that<00:02:40.540> you

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
wrap in both directions meaning that you

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.540 
wrap in both directions meaning that you
will<00:02:41.010> appear<00:02:42.010> on<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.160> other<00:02:42.280> side<00:02:42.430> of<00:02:42.489> the

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
will appear on the other side of the

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.240 
will appear on the other side of the
screen<00:02:42.989> so<00:02:43.989> now<00:02:44.020> when<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:44.320> shoot<00:02:44.620> press<00:02:45.100> it

screen so now when you shoot press it

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.030 
screen so now when you shoot press it
down<00:02:45.300> pretty<00:02:46.300> easy<00:02:46.570> you<00:02:46.840> just<00:02:46.870> create<00:02:47.380> object

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
down pretty easy you just create object

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.479 
down pretty easy you just create object
be<00:02:48.700> one<00:02:49.120> bullet<00:02:49.690> one<00:02:50.700> relative<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:53.489> then

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
be one bullet one relative and then

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.630 
be one bullet one relative and then
plane<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.209> is<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.480> exact<00:02:55.780> same<00:02:56.019> and<00:02:56.519> then<00:02:57.519> the

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
plane to is the exact same and then the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.610 
plane to is the exact same and then the
bullets<00:02:59.400> okay<00:03:00.400> this<00:03:00.549> is<00:03:00.640> kind<00:03:00.850> of<00:03:00.880> important

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
bullets okay this is kind of important

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.170 
bullets okay this is kind of important
you<00:03:02.620> have<00:03:02.739> to<00:03:02.799> set<00:03:03.160> facing<00:03:03.610> direction<00:03:03.970> this

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
you have to set facing direction this

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.449 
you have to set facing direction this
this<00:03:04.600> guy's<00:03:04.840> facing<00:03:05.200> direction<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.980> same<00:03:06.280> as

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
this guy's facing direction the same as

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.750 
this guy's facing direction the same as
plane<00:03:07.090> one<00:03:07.510> dot<00:03:08.350> facing<00:03:08.799> direction<00:03:09.220> that<00:03:09.549> way

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
plane one dot facing direction that way

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.430 
plane one dot facing direction that way
it'll<00:03:10.030> be<00:03:10.120> facing<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.600> same<00:03:10.660> direction<00:03:11.019> as

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
it'll be facing the same direction as

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.750 
it'll be facing the same direction as
the<00:03:11.829> plane<00:03:12.040> is<00:03:13.739> so<00:03:14.739> then<00:03:14.890> of<00:03:14.980> course<00:03:15.220> you<00:03:15.579> want

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
the plane is so then of course you want

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.449 
the plane is so then of course you want
to<00:03:15.820> be<00:03:15.910> able<00:03:16.000> to<00:03:16.150> moving<00:03:16.959> forward<00:03:17.410> so<00:03:17.680> move

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
to be able to moving forward so move

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.350 
to be able to moving forward so move
forward<00:03:18.760> at<00:03:18.850> speed<00:03:19.269> eight<00:03:19.590> facing<00:03:20.590> direction

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
forward at speed eight facing direction

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.030 
forward at speed eight facing direction
then<00:03:22.360> transform<00:03:22.870> spray<00:03:23.110> same<00:03:23.440> things<00:03:23.680> facing

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
then transform spray same things facing

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.310 
then transform spray same things facing
direction<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:24.730> then<00:03:25.600> bought<00:03:25.840> choose<00:03:26.079> the

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
direction and then bought choose the

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.199 
direction and then bought choose the
exact<00:03:26.560> same<00:03:26.739> now<00:03:27.670> for<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:27.940> health<00:03:28.180> bar<00:03:30.209> alarm

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
exact same now for the health bar alarm

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.020 
exact same now for the health bar alarm
zero<00:03:31.540> which<00:03:32.079> is<00:03:32.260> what<00:03:32.440> happens<00:03:32.799> when<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:34.000> just

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
zero which is what happens when you just

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.630 
zero which is what happens when you just
throw<00:03:34.480> on<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.750> planes<00:03:35.100> transitions<00:03:36.100> fade<00:03:36.400> in

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
throw on the planes transitions fade in

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.250 
throw on the planes transitions fade in
and<00:03:36.760> out<00:03:36.910> everywhere<00:03:37.840> restart<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.530> room<00:03:39.239> draw

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
and out everywhere restart the room draw

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.289 
and out everywhere restart the room draw
so<00:03:41.260> here's<00:03:41.470> the<00:03:41.590> health<00:03:41.739> bar<00:03:41.950> thing<00:03:42.180> set<00:03:43.180> the

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
so here's the health bar thing set the

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.830 
so here's the health bar thing set the
color<00:03:43.540> to<00:03:43.660> red<00:03:44.070> and<00:03:45.070> then<00:03:45.519> draw<00:03:45.910> a<00:03:46.120> rectangle

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
color to red and then draw a rectangle

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.449 
color to red and then draw a rectangle
for<00:03:47.709> plane<00:03:48.100> one<00:03:49.500> so<00:03:50.500> this<00:03:50.650> is<00:03:50.799> the<00:03:50.980> size<00:03:51.250> and

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
for plane one so this is the size and

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.250 
for plane one so this is the size and
shape<00:03:51.640> of<00:03:51.760> your<00:03:51.820> health<00:03:52.090> bar<00:03:52.829> -<00:03:53.829> 50<00:03:54.250> -<00:03:55.180> 40<00:03:55.480> -<00:03:55.630> all

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
shape of your health bar - 50 - 40 - all

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.190 
shape of your health bar - 50 - 40 - all
that<00:03:56.610> just<00:03:57.610> thinking<00:03:58.120> this<00:03:58.239> shape<00:03:58.450> and<00:03:58.660> then

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
that just thinking this shape and then

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.979 
that just thinking this shape and then
this<00:03:59.380> is<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.650> same<00:03:59.910> now<00:04:00.910> set<00:04:01.570> the<00:04:01.660> color<00:04:01.840> to

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
this is the same now set the color to

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.600 
this is the same now set the color to
green

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
green

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.330 
green
and<00:04:03.730> then<00:04:04.720> you<00:04:05.200> have<00:04:05.350> to<00:04:05.470> make<00:04:05.650> sure<00:04:05.680> that<00:04:05.920> the

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
and then you have to make sure that the

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.900 
and then you have to make sure that the
health<00:04:06.520> bar<00:04:06.700> can<00:04:07.030> move<00:04:07.240> around<00:04:07.560> so<00:04:08.640> you<00:04:09.640> same

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
health bar can move around so you same

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.780 
health bar can move around so you same
as<00:04:09.940> everything<00:04:10.450> except<00:04:10.900> for<00:04:11.400> this<00:04:12.400> has<00:04:12.610> to<00:04:12.700> be

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
as everything except for this has to be

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:19.520 
as everything except for this has to be
minus<00:04:13.090> 50<00:04:13.390> plus<00:04:14.100> plain<00:04:15.100> dot<00:04:15.989> HT<00:04:16.989> HP<00:04:18.090> that<00:04:19.090> way

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
minus 50 plus plain dot HT HP that way

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.330 
minus 50 plus plain dot HT HP that way
it<00:04:20.530> will<00:04:20.950> be<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.519> size<00:04:21.790> of<00:04:22.290> help<00:04:23.290> that<00:04:24.160> way<00:04:24.250> you

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
it will be the size of help that way you

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.890 
it will be the size of help that way you
can<00:04:24.460> move<00:04:24.640> around<00:04:24.730> itself<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.420> of<00:04:25.720> course

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
can move around itself and of course

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.130 
can move around itself and of course
this<00:04:26.020> is<00:04:26.170> the<00:04:26.200> same<00:04:27.570> that's<00:04:28.570> about<00:04:28.780> it<00:04:28.930> so<00:04:29.020> then

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
this is the same that's about it so then

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.230 
this is the same that's about it so then
you<00:04:29.170> stick<00:04:29.410> them<00:04:29.470> all<00:04:29.620> in<00:04:29.740> your<00:04:29.860> room<00:04:30.240> right

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
you stick them all in your room right

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.050 
you stick them all in your room right
here<00:04:32.220> okay<00:04:33.220> so<00:04:33.280> now<00:04:33.520> I<00:04:33.550> have<00:04:33.730> to<00:04:33.850> go<00:04:34.000> to

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
here okay so now I have to go to

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
here okay so now I have to go to
settings<00:04:34.720> and<00:04:36.450> make<00:04:37.450> it<00:04:37.540> whatever<00:04:37.660> size<00:04:37.810> you

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
settings and make it whatever size you

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.250 
settings and make it whatever size you
want<00:04:38.110> okay<00:04:39.040> not<00:04:39.220> views<00:04:39.669> need<00:04:40.660> three<00:04:40.960> views

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
want okay not views need three views

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.640 
want okay not views need three views
here

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
here

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.230 
here
well<00:04:41.860> you<00:04:42.070> don't<00:04:42.190> need<00:04:42.370> three<00:04:42.610> but<00:04:42.880> I<00:04:42.970> added

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
well you don't need three but I added

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.000 
well you don't need three but I added
three<00:04:43.419> so<00:04:44.140> view<00:04:44.560> one<00:04:45.000> zero<00:04:46.470> it's<00:04:47.470> going<00:04:47.890> to

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
three so view one zero it's going to

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.270 
three so view one zero it's going to
follow<00:04:48.270> object<00:04:49.270> plane<00:04:49.650> I'm<00:04:50.650> gonna<00:04:50.890> make<00:04:51.100> it

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
follow object plane I'm gonna make it

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.420 
follow object plane I'm gonna make it
the<00:04:51.430> size<00:04:51.669> of<00:04:52.500> four<00:04:53.500> hundred<00:04:53.680> four<00:04:54.400> hundred

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
the size of four hundred four hundred

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.010 
the size of four hundred four hundred
and<00:04:55.350> then<00:04:56.350> it's<00:04:57.190> also<00:04:57.400> in<00:04:57.820> the<00:04:58.030> screen<00:04:58.419> the<00:04:58.930> way

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
and then it's also in the screen the way

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.670 
and then it's also in the screen the way
I'm<00:04:59.169> doing<00:04:59.320> it<00:04:59.500> is<00:04:59.650> also<00:04:59.890> 400<00:05:00.130> 400<00:05:01.230> and<00:05:02.230> this<00:05:02.470> is

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
I'm doing it is also 400 400 and this is

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.870 
I'm doing it is also 400 400 and this is
how<00:05:02.800> it's<00:05:02.980> gonna<00:05:03.100> follow<00:05:03.460> it<00:05:03.700> is<00:05:03.900> 185<00:05:04.900> 185

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
how it's gonna follow it is 185 185

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.390 
how it's gonna follow it is 185 185
pixels<00:05:06.880> that's<00:05:07.450> kind<00:05:07.720> of<00:05:07.750> complicated<00:05:08.290> but<00:05:08.650> if

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
pixels that's kind of complicated but if

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.810 
pixels that's kind of complicated but if
you<00:05:09.550> know<00:05:09.700> that<00:05:09.850> that<00:05:09.970> it's<00:05:10.120> fine<00:05:10.950> view<00:05:11.950> one

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
you know that that it's fine view one

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.360 
you know that that it's fine view one
this<00:05:13.660> is<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:13.990> next<00:05:14.260> field<00:05:14.530> it's<00:05:15.010> going<00:05:15.220> to<00:05:15.310> be

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
this is the next field it's going to be

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.640 
this is the next field it's going to be
the<00:05:15.520> exact<00:05:15.820> same<00:05:15.850> thing<00:05:16.120> and<00:05:16.660> follow<00:05:17.229> plane

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
the exact same thing and follow plane

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.659 
the exact same thing and follow plane
too<00:05:18.190> except<00:05:19.090> for<00:05:19.270> with<00:05:19.390> one<00:05:19.630> exception<00:05:20.669> port

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:21.669

on<00:05:21.820> screen<00:05:22.270> has<00:05:23.050> to<00:05:23.080> be<00:05:23.410> over<00:05:23.890> that<00:05:24.130> way

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
on screen has to be over that way

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.650 
on screen has to be over that way
they're<00:05:24.460> not<00:05:24.490> right<00:05:24.760> on<00:05:24.850> top<00:05:25.060> of<00:05:25.090> each<00:05:25.300> other

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
they're not right on top of each other

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.450 
they're not right on top of each other
and<00:05:25.780> you<00:05:26.229> don't<00:05:26.410> want<00:05:26.530> them<00:05:26.620> right<00:05:26.770> up<00:05:26.890> against

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
and you don't want them right up against

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.130 
and you don't want them right up against
each<00:05:27.520> other<00:05:27.700> so<00:05:27.940> I'm<00:05:28.030> I'm<00:05:28.270> gonna<00:05:28.419> want<00:05:28.690> it<00:05:28.780> 10

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
each other so I'm I'm gonna want it 10

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.820 
each other so I'm I'm gonna want it 10
pixel<00:05:29.530> gap<00:05:29.710> so<00:05:30.610> it's<00:05:30.729> gonna<00:05:30.820> be<00:05:30.970> for<00:05:31.300> 10<00:05:32.169> port

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830 
pixel gap so it's gonna be for 10 port

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:35.040 
pixel gap so it's gonna be for 10 port

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
on screen is going to be view from 4/10

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.719 
on screen is going to be view from 4/10
over<00:05:36.000> that<00:05:37.000> way<00:05:37.150> it'll<00:05:37.360> be<00:05:37.419> exactly<00:05:37.720> like<00:05:38.140> now

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
over that way it'll be exactly like now

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.780 
over that way it'll be exactly like now
view<00:05:39.729> to<00:05:40.560> this<00:05:41.560> gets<00:05:42.160> a<00:05:42.220> little<00:05:42.490> bit<00:05:42.669> more

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
view to this gets a little bit more

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.030 
view to this gets a little bit more
complicated<00:05:43.090> I'm<00:05:43.720> gonna<00:05:44.530> want<00:05:44.740> to<00:05:44.800> view<00:05:44.919> the

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:45.040 
complicated I'm gonna want to view the

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.820 
complicated I'm gonna want to view the
whole<00:05:45.220> room<00:05:45.520> so<00:05:46.060> this<00:05:46.180> is<00:05:46.360> the<00:05:46.479> size<00:05:46.750> of<00:05:47.260> my

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
whole room so this is the size of my

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.060 
whole room so this is the size of my
room<00:05:48.130> and<00:05:48.510> then<00:05:49.510> this<00:05:49.750> is<00:05:50.020> what<00:05:50.260> I<00:05:50.290> is<00:05:50.680> the<00:05:50.890> size

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
room and then this is what I is the size

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.420 
room and then this is what I is the size
I<00:05:51.250> want<00:05:51.520> it<00:05:51.580> to<00:05:51.700> be<00:05:51.940> when<00:05:52.540> I<00:05:52.570> look<00:05:52.840> at<00:05:52.990> it<00:05:53.430> so

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:54.430 
I want it to be when I look at it so

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.590 
I want it to be when I look at it so
this<00:05:54.640> so<00:05:55.540> so<00:05:56.440> I<00:05:56.470> don't<00:05:57.160> method<00:05:57.790> I<00:05:58.090> mean<00:05:58.330> the

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
this so so I don't method I mean the

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.000 
this so so I don't method I mean the
exact<00:05:58.900> size<00:05:59.080> I<00:05:59.200> wanted<00:05:59.440> it<00:05:59.560> to<00:05:59.620> be<00:05:59.710> and<00:05:59.890> then<00:05:59.950> I

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
exact size I wanted it to be and then I

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.750 
exact size I wanted it to be and then I
wanted<00:06:00.250> it<00:06:00.400> to<00:06:00.520> place<00:06:00.880> it<00:06:01.120> so<00:06:01.810> then<00:06:01.990> I<00:06:02.760> placed

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
wanted it to place it so then I placed

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.900 
wanted it to place it so then I placed
it<00:06:03.970> if<00:06:04.419> this<00:06:04.630> number<00:06:04.900> right<00:06:04.990> here<00:06:05.100> and<00:06:06.100> then<00:06:06.370> so

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
it if this number right here and then so

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.370 
it if this number right here and then so
then<00:06:07.060> that's<00:06:07.360> all<00:06:07.690> I<00:06:07.780> needed<00:06:08.050> it<00:06:08.140> doesn't

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
then that's all I needed it doesn't

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.230 
then that's all I needed it doesn't
follow<00:06:08.680> any<00:06:08.890> object<00:06:09.370> it's<00:06:09.490> a<00:06:09.580> fixed<00:06:09.880> thing<00:06:10.060> and

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
follow any object it's a fixed thing and

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.870 
follow any object it's a fixed thing and
it's<00:06:10.360> article<00:06:10.890> so<00:06:11.890> now<00:06:12.010> that<00:06:12.070> you've<00:06:12.310> seen<00:06:12.700> how

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
it's article so now that you've seen how

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.170 
it's article so now that you've seen how
I<00:06:12.910> did<00:06:13.150> everything<00:06:13.539> now<00:06:13.690> you<00:06:13.720> can<00:06:14.020> see

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
I did everything now you can see

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:25.260 
I did everything now you can see
the<00:06:15.240> final<00:06:15.690> result

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:25.270 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:28.600 

this<00:06:26.270> is<00:06:26.449> the<00:06:26.539> final<00:06:26.840> result<00:06:26.990> as<00:06:27.319> you<00:06:28.039> can<00:06:28.340> see

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
this is the final result as you can see

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:32.260 
this is the final result as you can see
there<00:06:28.999> is<00:06:29.240> an<00:06:30.020> extra<00:06:30.379> port<00:06:30.680> here<00:06:31.159> where<00:06:32.150> you

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:32.270 
there is an extra port here where you

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.029 
there is an extra port here where you
can<00:06:32.419> see<00:06:32.569> both<00:06:32.779> planes<00:06:33.110> not<00:06:33.349> very<00:06:33.560> well<00:06:33.770> but

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:34.039 
can see both planes not very well but

00:06:34.039 --> 00:06:36.159 
can see both planes not very well but
that's<00:06:34.310> because<00:06:34.520> of<00:06:34.759> shunk<00:06:35.029> so<00:06:35.749> now<00:06:35.900> I'm<00:06:35.990> going

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:36.169 
that's because of shunk so now I'm going

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:40.899 
that's because of shunk so now I'm going
to<00:06:36.229> control<00:06:36.650> one<00:06:36.889> plane<00:06:37.870> here<00:06:38.870> as<00:06:39.490> you<00:06:40.490> can<00:06:40.610> see

00:06:40.899 --> 00:06:40.909 
to control one plane here as you can see

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:42.760 
to control one plane here as you can see
he<00:06:41.060> flies<00:06:41.330> around<00:06:41.509> and<00:06:41.840> then<00:06:41.990> sometimes<00:06:42.680> you

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:42.770 
he flies around and then sometimes you

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.589 
he flies around and then sometimes you
can<00:06:42.919> see<00:06:43.099> them<00:06:43.189> in<00:06:43.249> the<00:06:43.340> other<00:06:43.520> port<00:06:43.819> and<00:06:44.479> when

00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:44.599 
can see them in the other port and when

00:06:44.599 --> 00:06:48.249 
can see them in the other port and when
I<00:06:44.659> press<00:06:44.870> down<00:06:44.900> I<00:06:45.439> can<00:06:45.889> shoot<00:06:47.080> shoot<00:06:48.080> bullets

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:48.259 
I press down I can shoot shoot bullets

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:50.769 
I press down I can shoot shoot bullets
now<00:06:48.650> the<00:06:48.710> other<00:06:48.979> guy<00:06:49.159> is<00:06:49.490> the<00:06:49.729> exact<00:06:49.999> same<00:06:50.210> he

00:06:50.769 --> 00:06:50.779 
now the other guy is the exact same he

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:53.350 
now the other guy is the exact same he
can<00:06:50.960> fly<00:06:51.199> around<00:06:51.259> I<00:06:51.590> give<00:06:51.740> that<00:06:51.889> stuff<00:06:52.099> to<00:06:52.360> so

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
can fly around I give that stuff to so

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.040 
can fly around I give that stuff to so
then<00:06:53.599> when<00:06:54.169> they<00:06:54.319> shoot<00:06:54.379> each<00:06:54.680> other<00:06:56.050> then

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:57.050 
then when they shoot each other then

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:00.969 
then when they shoot each other then
house<00:06:57.620> power<00:06:57.889> goes<00:06:58.099> down<00:06:59.529> which<00:07:00.529> is<00:07:00.620> exactly

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:00.979 
house power goes down which is exactly

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:03.790 
house power goes down which is exactly
what<00:07:01.159> we<00:07:01.250> want<00:07:02.050> so<00:07:03.050> right<00:07:03.259> now<00:07:03.379> I'm<00:07:03.560> just<00:07:03.590> gonna

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:03.800 
what we want so right now I'm just gonna

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.909 
what we want so right now I'm just gonna
kill<00:07:04.099> this<00:07:04.219> guy<00:07:05.620> for<00:07:06.620> no<00:07:06.770> apparent<00:07:06.979> reason<00:07:07.750> and

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:08.919 
kill this guy for no apparent reason and

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:12.670 
kill this guy for no apparent reason and
then<00:07:09.919> when<00:07:10.069> I<00:07:10.099> do<00:07:10.840> it's<00:07:11.840> going<00:07:12.050> to<00:07:12.199> restart<00:07:12.500> the

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.680 
then when I do it's going to restart the

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:18.129 
then when I do it's going to restart the
room<00:07:14.439> there<00:07:15.439> we<00:07:15.500> go<00:07:16.120> now<00:07:17.120> it's<00:07:17.270> fading<00:07:17.599> in<00:07:17.779> now

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:18.139 
room there we go now it's fading in now

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:19.779
