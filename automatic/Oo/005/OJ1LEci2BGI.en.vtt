00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.520 
like I think it's up there but that's
not<00:02:56.280> really<00:02:56.669> the<00:02:56.700> spot<00:02:57.150> where<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:57.959> spawns<00:02:58.260> and

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
it and like I said this is where the end

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:03.979 
it and like I said this is where the end
of<00:04:02.669> your<00:04:02.790> circle<00:04:03.180> pretty<00:04:03.359> much<00:04:03.540> comes<00:04:03.780> around

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
of your circle pretty much comes around

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.479 
of your circle pretty much comes around
then<00:04:04.109> you<00:04:04.199> start<00:04:04.439> headed<00:04:04.739> back<00:04:04.919> to<00:04:05.129> where<00:04:05.280> we

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
then you start headed back to where we

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.250 
then you start headed back to where we
started<00:04:05.519> from

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
started from

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.659 
started from
