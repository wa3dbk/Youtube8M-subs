00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.430 
taking a quick look here at the Reebok
6k<00:00:10.460> hockey<00:00:10.940> shaft<00:00:11.240> this<00:00:11.930> is<00:00:12.020> a<00:00:12.080> nice<00:00:12.260> looking

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
6k hockey shaft this is a nice looking

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.770 
6k hockey shaft this is a nice looking
hockey<00:00:12.770> shaft<00:00:13.100> from<00:00:13.280> Reebok<00:00:13.639> the<00:00:14.270> shaft<00:00:14.510> is

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
hockey shaft from Reebok the shaft is

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.750 
hockey shaft from Reebok the shaft is
designed<00:00:15.289> to<00:00:15.500> fit<00:00:15.680> traditional<00:00:16.250> replacement

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
designed to fit traditional replacement

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.550 
designed to fit traditional replacement
blades<00:00:16.970> so<00:00:17.690> that's<00:00:17.869> not<00:00:18.050> going<00:00:18.230> to<00:00:18.320> be<00:00:18.350> the

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
blades so that's not going to be the

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.710 
blades so that's not going to be the
short<00:00:18.860> hazell<00:00:19.220> replacement<00:00:19.760> baits<00:00:19.940> and<00:00:20.179> so

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
short hazell replacement baits and so

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:21.970 
short hazell replacement baits and so
it's<00:00:20.869> good<00:00:21.019> to<00:00:21.050> keep<00:00:21.320> in<00:00:21.470> mind<00:00:21.529> when<00:00:21.830> looking

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
it's good to keep in mind when looking

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.339 
it's good to keep in mind when looking
at<00:00:22.189> this<00:00:22.339> stick<00:00:22.670> also<00:00:23.630> cool<00:00:23.839> thing<00:00:23.990> about<00:00:24.109> this

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
at this stick also cool thing about this

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:25.960 
at this stick also cool thing about this
stick<00:00:24.560> that<00:00:24.740> they've<00:00:24.890> done<00:00:25.070> is<00:00:25.310> as<00:00:25.699> you<00:00:25.820> can

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
stick that they've done is as you can

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.970 
stick that they've done is as you can
see<00:00:26.150> here<00:00:26.390> it<00:00:26.480> is<00:00:26.509> the<00:00:26.779> sick<00:00:27.050> kick<00:00:27.289> technology

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
see here it is the sick kick technology

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.679 
see here it is the sick kick technology
so<00:00:28.580> that's<00:00:28.699> going<00:00:28.789> to<00:00:28.880> be<00:00:28.939> lowering<00:00:29.300> the<00:00:29.480> kick

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
so that's going to be lowering the kick

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.300 
so that's going to be lowering the kick
point<00:00:29.929> on<00:00:30.140> the<00:00:30.259> shaft<00:00:30.439> giving<00:00:30.769> a<00:00:30.829> nice<00:00:31.009> quick

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
point on the shaft giving a nice quick

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.130 
point on the shaft giving a nice quick
shot<00:00:31.640> release<00:00:31.999> and<00:00:32.390> this<00:00:32.630> is<00:00:32.780> not<00:00:32.900> going<00:00:32.990> to<00:00:33.050> be

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
shot release and this is not going to be

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.530 
shot release and this is not going to be
quite<00:00:33.410> as<00:00:33.650> low<00:00:33.890> as<00:00:33.950> say<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:34.370> 8k<00:00:34.880> stick<00:00:35.240> being

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
quite as low as say the 8k stick being

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.650 
quite as low as say the 8k stick being
that<00:00:35.660> it<00:00:35.750> doesn't<00:00:36.110> have<00:00:36.320> that<00:00:37.000> tapered<00:00:38.000> hazell

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
that it doesn't have that tapered hazell

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.869 
that it doesn't have that tapered hazell
down<00:00:38.780> here<00:00:39.190> but<00:00:40.190> it<00:00:40.309> is<00:00:40.340> going<00:00:40.550> to<00:00:40.610> offer<00:00:40.670> a

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
down here but it is going to offer a

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:42.400 
down here but it is going to offer a
lower<00:00:41.059> kick<00:00:41.300> point<00:00:41.539> than<00:00:41.660> some<00:00:41.899> traditional

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
lower kick point than some traditional

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.619 
lower kick point than some traditional
shafts<00:00:42.800> so<00:00:43.730> it's<00:00:43.850> kind<00:00:44.000> of<00:00:44.030> a<00:00:44.149> mid<00:00:44.359> to<00:00:44.480> low

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
shafts so it's kind of a mid to low

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.209 
shafts so it's kind of a mid to low
shaft<00:00:44.930> and<00:00:45.170> so<00:00:45.620> it's<00:00:45.739> going<00:00:45.829> to<00:00:45.890> be<00:00:45.949> good<00:00:46.070> for

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
shaft and so it's going to be good for

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:47.740 
shaft and so it's going to be good for
slop<00:00:46.430> shots<00:00:46.670> one-timers<00:00:47.300> but<00:00:47.480> it's<00:00:47.570> also

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
slop shots one-timers but it's also

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.750 
slop shots one-timers but it's also
going<00:00:48.020> to<00:00:48.079> have<00:00:48.260> that<00:00:48.410> nice<00:00:48.680> a<00:00:48.710> quick<00:00:49.519> release

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
going to have that nice a quick release

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.060 
going to have that nice a quick release
for<00:00:50.180> those<00:00:50.780> wrists<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:51.230> snapshots<00:00:51.769> that's

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
for those wrists and snapshots that's

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.430 
for those wrists and snapshots that's
nice<00:00:52.250> to<00:00:52.460> see<00:00:52.670> as<00:00:53.449> far<00:00:53.629> as<00:00:53.660> construction<00:00:53.989> goes

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
nice to see as far as construction goes

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.319 
nice to see as far as construction goes
on<00:00:54.620> the<00:00:54.769> shaft<00:00:55.039> they've<00:00:55.879> used<00:00:56.030> a<00:00:56.149> combination

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
on the shaft they've used a combination

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.990 
on the shaft they've used a combination
material<00:00:57.050> so<00:00:57.170> it's<00:00:57.289> a<00:00:57.320> composite<00:00:57.890> shaft<00:00:58.100> so

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
material so it's a composite shaft so

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.220 
material so it's a composite shaft so
you<00:00:59.090> have<00:00:59.239> a<00:00:59.269> graphite<00:00:59.780> as<00:00:59.960> well<00:01:00.140> as

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
you have a graphite as well as

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.709 
you have a graphite as well as
fiberglass<00:01:00.769> in<00:01:01.010> it<00:01:01.100> the<00:01:01.760> fiberglass<00:01:02.300> is<00:01:02.539> going

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
fiberglass in it the fiberglass is going

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:04.390 
fiberglass in it the fiberglass is going
to<00:01:02.780> make<00:01:02.929> this<00:01:03.050> shaft<00:01:03.379> really<00:01:03.920> durable<00:01:04.190> so

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
to make this shaft really durable so

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.520 
to make this shaft really durable so
that's<00:01:04.519> nice<00:01:04.670> to<00:01:04.879> see<00:01:05.059> on<00:01:05.210> it<00:01:05.420> it's<00:01:06.140> not<00:01:06.260> the

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
that's nice to see on it it's not the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:07.900 
that's nice to see on it it's not the
lightest<00:01:06.920> shaft<00:01:07.130> on<00:01:07.310> the<00:01:07.370> market<00:01:07.670> but<00:01:07.790> it's

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
lightest shaft on the market but it's

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.190 
lightest shaft on the market but it's
going<00:01:08.000> to<00:01:08.060> be<00:01:08.180> able<00:01:08.240> to<00:01:08.360> hold<00:01:08.450> up<00:01:08.660> to<00:01:08.780> a<00:01:08.810> beating

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
going to be able to hold up to a beating

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.620 
going to be able to hold up to a beating
so<00:01:09.680> that's<00:01:09.800> nice<00:01:10.010> that<00:01:10.640> they've<00:01:11.060> done<00:01:11.270> and

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
so that's nice that they've done and

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.330 
so that's nice that they've done and
then<00:01:11.810> also<00:01:11.990> another<00:01:12.260> thing<00:01:12.410> about<00:01:12.710> it<00:01:13.040> as<00:01:13.160> far

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
then also another thing about it as far

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.730 
then also another thing about it as far
as<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:13.700> shaft<00:01:14.390> dimensions<00:01:14.900> to<00:01:15.080> it<00:01:15.110> it's<00:01:15.620> a

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
as the shaft dimensions to it it's a

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.140 
as the shaft dimensions to it it's a
fairly<00:01:15.950> traditional<00:01:16.220> shaft<00:01:16.700> dimensions

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
fairly traditional shaft dimensions

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.270 
fairly traditional shaft dimensions
where<00:01:17.300> you<00:01:17.360> have<00:01:17.450> straight<00:01:18.050> side<00:01:18.350> walls<00:01:18.650> and<00:01:18.920> a

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
where you have straight side walls and a

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.160 
where you have straight side walls and a
slightly<00:01:19.520> rounded<00:01:19.940> corners<00:01:20.330> so<00:01:20.900> it<00:01:20.990> has<00:01:21.140> a

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
slightly rounded corners so it has a

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.530 
slightly rounded corners so it has a
traditional<00:01:21.770> feel<00:01:22.040> of<00:01:22.730> a<00:01:22.850> hockey<00:01:23.180> stick<00:01:23.390> in

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
traditional feel of a hockey stick in

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.450 
traditional feel of a hockey stick in
your<00:01:23.570> hands<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.080> then<00:01:24.140> they've<00:01:24.710> also<00:01:24.920> put<00:01:25.100> on

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
your hands and then they've also put on

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.490 
your hands and then they've also put on
what<00:01:25.640> they<00:01:25.730> call<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.180> sharkskin<00:01:26.840> grip

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
what they call the sharkskin grip

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.290 
what they call the sharkskin grip
coating<00:01:27.890> this<00:01:28.550> is<00:01:28.670> going<00:01:28.790> to<00:01:28.850> be<00:01:28.910> a<00:01:28.940> little<00:01:29.090> bit

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
coating this is going to be a little bit

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.940 
coating this is going to be a little bit
of<00:01:29.330> a<00:01:29.420> different<00:01:29.450> grip<00:01:30.080> coating<00:01:30.410> than<00:01:30.530> most<00:01:30.770> on

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
of a different grip coating than most on
