 that to the extreme in the second row 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.989
 we find formisano melon and musella allo 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.239
 start of race 1 the poleman d'andrea has 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.009
 a problem and is paraded from group a 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.140
 take the command and paduano followed a 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:08.880
 science wheel melon formisano e 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.009
 musella try instead to mend the 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.840
 detachment but between these and the number 21 the 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.790
 more on the ball that leads to the lead in the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.530
 course of the third round of the game e 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.180
 also chosen that soon after jumps to 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.310
 command but watch out for the great ascent 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.050
 of emilio d'andrea the team's standard bearer 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.729
 vat and author of a race to say the least 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.890
 aggressive and when it reaches mid-race 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.170
 takes command of operations but i 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.789
 first 5 continue to be compact and 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.160
 only in the final part of the race on 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.050
 little train shells slightly to play 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.729
 the victory only of andrea and melon with 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:37.830
 the latter passing by two 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.840
 lapses from the term by andrea is not there e 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.850
 he tries to get to the end though, though 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.830
 in a slip a few turns from the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.050
 checkered flag melon wins so 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.800
 race a joke made the ranking 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.229
 of the regions 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.819
 formisano and third paduano fourth at the start 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.950
 of the second round from Andrea does not have 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.630
 trouble and keep the head of the race 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.580
 behind him they immediately chose 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.470
 and melon this time there is less brawl 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.750
 for the podium also because the tread 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.550
 imposes a frenetic pace to the race 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.349
 only melons seems capable of 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.270
 keep the pace behind them 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:08.009
 we find instead always chosen the 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.050
 best of the regions ranking with 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.150
 paduano carlucci fighting musella 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.830
 tightened for a placement in the beats 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.959
 finals from andrea consolidates leadership 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.599
 of the race and goes on to win deservedly 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.520
 race 2 while apple tree protects it up to 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.709

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.370
 state 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.380
 beautiful weekend quite hard 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.540
 because that's where the level got up 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.110
 so much and we shot with times 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.930
 really scary and I'm very happy 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.690
 thank my ps team gave me 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.180
 a scooter or perfect and I had to 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.250
 redeem you from the drift made in Modena 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.750
 so let's say there may be 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.940
 we are satisfied it went well 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.620
 to know the ranking of the 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.390
 matic scooters and regions must 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.220
 instead wait for the results of the two 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.900
 group b heats in this second 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.490
 deployment we find in the front row 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.500
 vacchiano lanzillotti and santoriello 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.630
 while milito and avallone clipped 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.610
 they snap immediately behind it turns off the 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.900
 race 1 traffic light and the poleman part 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.120
 well keeping the first square 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.200
 already stretching on the pursuers in the 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.970
 first lap 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.680
 behind him there is a beautiful one 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.260
 fight for the two steps of the podium a 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.360
 chopped up arrangement avallone lanzilotti 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.070
 and santoriello are one in the drain 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.170
 of the other and throughout the central phase 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.000
 of competition they exchange of continuos the 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.690
 positions the brawl is at its maximum 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.670
 levels 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.470
 avallone in an attempt to climb the 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.660
 ranking touches the rear dylan 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.820
 zilocchi and ends up on the ground retreating 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.750
 the group loses a piece but not the 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.280
 want to fight 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.049
 and while vacchiano continues without 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.940
 problems his ride to the 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.040
 santoriello e 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.810
 lanzillotti if they harm you 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.459
 under the checkered flag stain a 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.709
 he makes his race 1 while the podium is 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.500
 completed by santoriello and clipped with 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.269
 the anti-lot 4 the second way is marked 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.980
 from the problem of santoriello that remains 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.019
 practically planted on the grid of 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.850
 front start again vacchiano a 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.519
 take the command followed by wheel from 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.680
 lanzillotti avallone and flour the heat 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.269
 it looks like the photocopy of the previous col 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.950
 number 46 running away 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.570
 while behind him a small group of 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.130
 pilots play on the podium 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.620
 some time passed instead here 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.320
 emerge number 18 and that number 18 and 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.510
 own santoriello transited last to 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.760
 first lap after the unlucky start 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.620
 the ar racing bishop after having 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.390
 past borrelli tarp flours 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.490
 lanzilotti finds in its viewfinder 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:24.710
 vacchiano in the head since the first curve 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.290
 in a few laps he reaches it for later 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.460
 pass it with a disarming ease 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:30.830
 Vacchiano however does not give up his grip but 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.110
 santoriello resists with trade up to 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.830
 finishing line making a spectacular one 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.390
 race 2 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.190
 in the sum of the two batteries la 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.510

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.960
 and this part we succeeded 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.700

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:16.280
 cue and turns on the head at the first corner 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.230
 galbiati, however, immediately puts it on 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.210
 hairpin while behind them 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.190

 piazza the train remains compact 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:25.670
 during the first kilometers but 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.340
 positions change before the turning point 

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:29.960

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.090
 detached galbiati meanwhile has 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:36.920
 increased his margin on 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.900
 trackers that don't seem able to 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.880
 catch him like this when the comes 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.830

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.690
 for a couple of seconds on the u since 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.940
 in turn, a rule of a few for a few 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:49.130
 thousandths of a second French per quarter 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.200
 the second run sees the excellent start 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.150

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.950
 problems the lead her 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.630
 however, opponents seem to be more aggressive 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:57.380
 compared to the morning and do not leave it 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.150
 to run away 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.010
