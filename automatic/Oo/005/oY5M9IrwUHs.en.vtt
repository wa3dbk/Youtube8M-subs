flam's<00:00:07.140> are<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:08.069> next<00:00:08.309> rudiment<00:00:08.700> we're<00:00:08.820> going

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
flam's are the next rudiment we're going

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.709 
flam's are the next rudiment we're going
to<00:00:09.059> discuss<00:00:09.980> now<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.250> flam<00:00:11.700> is<00:00:11.910> designed<00:00:12.480> to

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
to discuss now a flam is designed to

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.530 
to discuss now a flam is designed to
give<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:13.110> thicker<00:00:13.469> sounding<00:00:14.370> note<00:00:14.580> because<00:00:15.330> if

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
give a thicker sounding note because if

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.590 
give a thicker sounding note because if
you<00:00:15.690> have<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> single<00:00:16.320> note<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.800> get<00:00:16.980> this<00:00:17.600> but

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
you have a single note you get this but

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.630 
you have a single note you get this but
then<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:18.900> put<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.199> flam<00:00:19.560> just<00:00:20.070> ahead<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.520> it

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
then you put the flam just ahead of it

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.790 
then you put the flam just ahead of it
you<00:00:21.180> get<00:00:21.330> this<00:00:23.960> makes<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.109> note<00:00:25.289> thicker<00:00:27.800> and

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
you get this makes the note thicker and

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.450 
you get this makes the note thicker and
you<00:00:28.920> can<00:00:29.039> see<00:00:29.250> when<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.460> do<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:30.710> one<00:00:31.710> stick<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.219> a

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
you can see when I do it one stick is a

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.729 
you can see when I do it one stick is a
lot<00:00:32.790> higher<00:00:33.090> than<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.630> other<00:00:33.809> because<00:00:34.500> that

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
lot higher than the other because that

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.500 
lot higher than the other because that
one<00:00:34.950> stick<00:00:35.250> needs<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.550> come<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:35.880> just<00:00:36.210> before

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
one stick needs to come in just before

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.040 
one stick needs to come in just before
the<00:00:36.840> other<00:00:37.309> giving<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.460> thicker<00:00:39.149> sounding

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
the other giving that thicker sounding

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.290 
the other giving that thicker sounding
note<00:00:40.430> you<00:00:41.430> don't<00:00:41.610> want<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.820> start<00:00:42.030> off<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
note you don't want to start off the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.430 
note you don't want to start off the
same<00:00:42.510> stick<00:00:42.840> height<00:00:42.989> because<00:00:43.200> then<00:00:43.320> they're

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
same stick height because then they're

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.440 
same stick height because then they're
going<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.590> be<00:00:43.649> racing<00:00:44.070> down<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.520> get<00:00:45.300> there

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
going to be racing down to get there

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.650 
going to be racing down to get there
first<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:45.930> just<00:00:46.739> start<00:00:47.100> one<00:00:47.489> higher<00:00:48.360> than<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
first so just start one higher than the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.840 
first so just start one higher than the
other<00:00:48.750> if<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:49.440> just<00:00:49.620> drop<00:00:49.890> your<00:00:50.129> sticks<00:00:50.460> it

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
other if you just drop your sticks it

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.090 
other if you just drop your sticks it
will<00:00:51.030> naturally<00:00:51.210> happen<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.930> way<00:00:52.020> I'm<00:00:52.949> going

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
will naturally happen that way I'm going

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.950 
will naturally happen that way I'm going
to<00:00:53.160> avoid<00:00:53.430> them<00:00:53.670> dropping<00:00:54.149> at<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.329> same<00:00:54.629> time

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
to avoid them dropping at the same time

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.830 
to avoid them dropping at the same time
and<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.039> will<00:00:56.160> make<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.460> have<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> flat<00:00:57.510> flam

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
and that will make you have a flat flam

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.310 
and that will make you have a flat flam
sounds<00:00:58.350> like<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.640> kind<00:00:59.640> of<00:00:59.670> just<00:00:59.820> chokes

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
sounds like this kind of just chokes

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.429 
sounds like this kind of just chokes
we're<00:01:01.320> all<00:01:01.500> set<00:01:01.820> let's<00:01:02.820> bit<00:01:03.090> thicker<00:01:03.439> remember

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
we're all set let's bit thicker remember

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.140 
we're all set let's bit thicker remember
the<00:01:04.559> sequence<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.400> want<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.000> in

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the sequence to you want to have it in

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.380 
the sequence to you want to have it in
order<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.500> go<00:01:07.799> like<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.610> really<00:01:09.060> wide

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
order you can go like that really wide

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.170 
order you can go like that really wide
it's<00:01:10.320> not<00:01:10.439> really<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.740> flam<00:01:11.010> but<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.790> getting

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
it's not really a flam but just getting

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.880 
it's not really a flam but just getting
the<00:01:12.270> feel<00:01:12.689> for<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.229> then<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.619> start

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
the feel for it and then just start

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.710 
the feel for it and then just start
bringing<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.369> tighter<00:01:15.470> to<00:01:16.470> get<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.830> one

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
bringing it tighter to get that one

00:01:17.720 --> 00:03:51.880 
bringing it tighter to get that one
thicker<00:01:18.720> note

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.950
