00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
three balloons for the wizard tower and

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.740 
three balloons for the wizard tower and
three<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.180> archer<00:00:57.420> tower

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
three for the archer tower

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.959 
three for the archer tower
same<00:00:58.530> thing<00:00:58.710> here<00:00:58.980> I'm<00:00:59.430> going<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.670> drop<00:00:59.760> about

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
same thing here I'm going to drop about

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.880 
same thing here I'm going to drop about
two<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.480> each<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:00.930> these<00:01:00.989> archer<00:01:01.289> towers<00:01:01.649> and

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
two on each of these archer towers and

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.460 
two on each of these archer towers and
then<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> top<00:01:03.180> same<00:01:03.600> thing<00:01:03.840> drop<00:01:04.320> some

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
then on the top same thing drop some

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.039 
then on the top same thing drop some
Giants<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.369> do<00:01:05.489> three<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:05.790> each<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
Giants and then do three on each of the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.230 
Giants and then do three on each of the
towers<00:01:07.409> so<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.580> even<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.850> little<00:01:08.880> bit<00:01:09.090> of

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
towers so this is even a little bit of

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.890 
towers so this is even a little bit of
an<00:01:09.330> overkill<00:01:09.689> at<00:01:09.930> four<00:01:10.640> at<00:01:11.720> level<00:01:12.720> four

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
an overkill at four at level four

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.230 
an overkill at four at level four
balloons<00:01:13.200> but<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.040> thought<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.400> was<00:01:14.490> pretty

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
balloons but I thought it was pretty

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.730 
balloons but I thought it was pretty
effective<00:01:15.360> plus<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.170> get<00:01:16.320> four<00:01:16.710> hundred

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
effective plus you get four hundred

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.230 
effective plus you get four hundred
thousand<00:01:17.280> gold<00:01:17.430> four<00:01:17.700> hundred<00:01:17.970> thousand

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
thousand gold four hundred thousand

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.450 
thousand gold four hundred thousand
elixir<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.740> may<00:01:19.920> work<00:01:20.100> if<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.369> have

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
elixir so this may work if you have

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.370 
elixir so this may work if you have
level<00:01:20.640> 3<00:01:20.729> balloons<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.570> get<00:01:21.960> definitely

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
level 3 balloons you can get definitely

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.920 
level 3 balloons you can get definitely
give<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.619> try<00:01:23.180> but<00:01:24.180> as<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.420> can<00:01:24.509> see<00:01:24.720> you

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
give it a try but as you can see you

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.960 
give it a try but as you can see you
will<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.080> Tesla<00:01:25.590> spawn<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.159> with<00:01:26.850> these

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
will have Tesla spawn and with these

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.190 
will have Tesla spawn and with these
Tesla's<00:01:27.420> they're<00:01:27.659> going<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.840> start<00:01:27.990> shooting

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
Tesla's they're going to start shooting

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.530 
Tesla's they're going to start shooting
at<00:01:28.380> your<00:01:28.439> balloons<00:01:28.790> but<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:30.240> should<00:01:30.420> have

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
at your balloons but you should have

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.630 
at your balloons but you should have
enough<00:01:30.750> balloons<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.259> do<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.530> if<00:01:31.799> not<00:01:32.130> you

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640
