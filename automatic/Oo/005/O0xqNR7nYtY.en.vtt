00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
was I took the the rail off the top gym

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.319 
was I took the the rail off the top gym

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
see the hose that I go here you go mount

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.460 
see the hose that I go here you go mount
it<00:02:49.750> here<00:02:50.079> and<00:02:50.409> in<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.519> front<00:02:52.019> but<00:02:53.019> I<00:02:53.079> took<00:02:53.200> it

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
it here and in the front but I took it

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.229 
it here and in the front but I took it
off<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:53.769> I<00:02:53.859> put<00:02:53.889> it<00:02:54.220> here<00:02:54.430> on<00:02:54.519> the<00:02:54.670> side<00:02:54.849> and<00:02:54.909> I

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
off and I put it here on the side and I

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.229 
off and I put it here on the side and I
made<00:02:55.450> it<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.659> longer<00:02:55.900> rail<00:02:56.670> so<00:02:57.670> that<00:02:57.700> I<00:02:57.849> can<00:02:58.060> get

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
made it a longer rail so that I can get

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.009 
made it a longer rail so that I can get
my<00:02:58.450> hand<00:02:59.049> a<00:03:00.180> little<00:03:01.180> bit<00:03:01.329> further<00:03:01.629> back

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
my hand a little bit further back

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.740 
my hand a little bit further back
because<00:03:02.829> they<00:03:03.069> if<00:03:03.220> he<00:03:03.430> doesn't<00:03:04.000> go<00:03:04.090> further<00:03:04.480> it

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
because they if he doesn't go further it

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.140 
because they if he doesn't go further it
doesn't<00:03:05.049> go<00:03:05.109> any<00:03:05.260> much<00:03:05.439> back<00:03:05.799> does<00:03:06.670> it<00:03:06.700> go<00:03:06.819> back

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
doesn't go any much back does it go back

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.050 
doesn't go any much back does it go back
anymore<00:03:07.829> that's<00:03:08.829> as<00:03:09.010> far<00:03:09.220> forward<00:03:09.489> as<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:09.849> can

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
anymore that's as far forward as I can

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.289 
anymore that's as far forward as I can
get<00:03:10.209> that<00:03:10.359> AFG<00:03:10.920> so<00:03:11.920> I<00:03:12.250> really<00:03:12.670> needed<00:03:12.970> to<00:03:13.090> get

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
get that AFG so I really needed to get

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.649 
get that AFG so I really needed to get
my<00:03:13.450> thumb<00:03:14.549> and<00:03:15.549> he<00:03:15.700> didn't<00:03:16.030> have<00:03:16.090> my<00:03:16.239> hand<00:03:16.450> here

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:16.659 
my thumb and he didn't have my hand here

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:18.210 
my thumb and he didn't have my hand here
and<00:03:16.810> then<00:03:16.959> had<00:03:17.290> my<00:03:17.439> thumb<00:03:17.709> a<00:03:17.739> little<00:03:17.889> bit

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
and then had my thumb a little bit

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.330 
and then had my thumb a little bit
further<00:03:18.459> up<00:03:18.549> and<00:03:19.470> this<00:03:20.470> was<00:03:20.650> easier<00:03:21.010> for<00:03:21.099> me

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
further up and this was easier for me

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.349 
further up and this was easier for me
and<00:03:21.639> so<00:03:22.209> I<00:03:22.239> had<00:03:22.510> to<00:03:22.660> add<00:03:22.810> this<00:03:23.049> rail<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:24.459> it

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
and so I had to add this rail and it

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.680 
and so I had to add this rail and it
just<00:03:25.599> you<00:03:25.870> know<00:03:25.900> it<00:03:26.109> bolts<00:03:26.379> on<00:03:26.530> here<00:03:27.690> with

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
just you know it bolts on here with

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.589 
just you know it bolts on here with
these<00:03:28.840> two<00:03:29.049> bolts<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:30.730> has<00:03:30.879> two<00:03:31.180> bolts<00:03:31.480> here

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:31.599 
these two bolts it has two bolts here

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:34.830 
these two bolts it has two bolts here
one<00:03:31.840> here<00:03:32.109> one<00:03:32.290> here<00:03:32.319> and<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.909> actually<00:03:34.060> pivots

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
one here one here and it actually pivots

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.000 
one here one here and it actually pivots
out<00:03:34.959> a<00:03:34.989> little<00:03:35.199> bit<00:03:35.379> you<00:03:35.440> can<00:03:35.590> see<00:03:35.620> it's<00:03:35.859> got<00:03:35.980> a

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
out a little bit you can see it's got a

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.089 
out a little bit you can see it's got a
little<00:03:36.069> bit<00:03:36.340> of<00:03:36.430> a<00:03:36.489> taper<00:03:37.109> and<00:03:38.109> it<00:03:38.680> just<00:03:38.889> gives

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:39.099 
little bit of a taper and it just gives

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.339 
little bit of a taper and it just gives
me<00:03:39.190> that<00:03:39.400> little<00:03:39.790> extension<00:03:40.480> I<00:03:40.569> need<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:41.199> get
