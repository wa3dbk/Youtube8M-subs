crazy with these pallets I got all four
pallets<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.890> reason<00:00:17.220> why<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.340> picked

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
pallets and the reason why I picked

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.760 
pallets and the reason why I picked
these<00:00:17.730> up<00:00:17.789> was<00:00:18.180> because<00:00:18.439> they<00:00:19.439> really

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
these up was because they really

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.679 
these up was because they really
reminded<00:00:20.250> me<00:00:20.279> kind<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.640> like<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> rocker<00:00:21.270> chic

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.029 
look so the quality is very very good
and<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.359> almost<00:00:24.600> reminds<00:00:25.170> me<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.859> liberal

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
little bit messy but I tend to just

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.039
