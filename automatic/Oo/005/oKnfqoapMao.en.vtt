do<00:00:07.049> a<00:00:07.259> fairly<00:00:07.859> basic<00:00:08.069> bike<00:00:08.550> fit<00:00:08.820> but<00:00:09.090> we<00:00:09.269> know

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
do a fairly basic bike fit but we know

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:10.669 
do a fairly basic bike fit but we know
that<00:00:09.420> a<00:00:09.570> lot<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.840> you're<00:00:10.050> just<00:00:10.080> getting<00:00:10.530> into

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
so how do you know what size frame to

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.109 
so how do you know what size frame to
buy<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.650> in<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.890> first<00:00:17.130> place<00:00:17.340> we're<00:00:17.910> back

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
foot 2 what size frame should I get but

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:32.450 
foot 2 what size frame should I get but
is<00:00:31.320> it<00:00:31.439> as<00:00:31.529> simple<00:00:31.800> as<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:32.009> how<00:00:32.189> do<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.340> go

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
is it as simple as that how do you go

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.490 
is it as simple as that how do you go
about<00:00:32.579> choosing<00:00:32.940> your<00:00:33.149> first<00:00:33.420> frame<00:00:33.750> size<00:00:34.050> yes

about choosing your first frame size yes

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.750 
about choosing your first frame size yes
obviously<00:00:34.649> buying<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.219> first<00:00:35.430> kind<00:00:35.700> of

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
obviously buying that first kind of

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.340 
obviously buying that first kind of
serious<00:00:36.149> road<00:00:36.360> bike<00:00:36.570> can<00:00:36.899> be<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> daunting

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
serious road bike can be a daunting

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.440 
serious road bike can be a daunting
prospect<00:00:37.860> and<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.430> think<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.730> scares<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.149> lot<00:00:39.239> of

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
prospect and I think it scares a lot of

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.709 
prospect and I think it scares a lot of
people<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.520> not<00:00:41.790> as<00:00:41.969> simple<00:00:42.180> as<00:00:42.600> a

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
people and it's not as simple as a

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.830 
people and it's not as simple as a
certain<00:00:43.230> size<00:00:43.530> equals<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.430> height<00:00:44.879> because<00:00:45.809> a

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
certain size equals in height because a

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.380 
certain size equals in height because a
certain<00:00:46.260> frame<00:00:46.770> size<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.579> wish<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.239> was<00:00:48.360> that

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
certain frame size I wish it was that

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.150 
certain frame size I wish it was that
simple<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.989> will<00:00:49.170> be<00:00:49.320> an<00:00:49.440> easier<00:00:49.710> place<00:00:49.980> in

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
simple and will be an easier place in

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.350 
simple and will be an easier place in
it'd<00:00:50.250> be<00:00:50.340> easier<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.700> just<00:00:50.879> buy<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.329> sell

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
it'd be easier to just buy and sell

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.209 
it'd be easier to just buy and sell
bikes<00:00:51.719> but<00:00:52.050> unfortunately<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> lot<00:00:53.039> of

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
bikes but unfortunately a lot of

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.160 
bikes but unfortunately a lot of
variables<00:00:53.610> involved<00:00:54.059> but<00:00:54.780> we<00:00:54.899> could<00:00:55.050> talk

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
variables involved but we could talk

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.720 
variables involved but we could talk
about<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.410> few<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.620> those<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.010> try<00:00:56.190> make<00:00:56.370> easier

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
about a few of those and try make easier

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.549 
about a few of those and try make easier
for<00:00:57.210> people<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.480> buy<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.870> bike<00:00:58.050> so

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
for people to buy that bike so

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.110 
for people to buy that bike so
presumably<00:00:59.010> because<00:00:59.250> some<00:00:59.550> people<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
presumably because some people that the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.490 
presumably because some people that the
same<00:01:00.300> height<00:01:00.570> I've<00:01:00.719> got<00:01:00.870> different<00:01:01.289> lengths

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
same height I've got different lengths

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.290 
same height I've got different lengths
of<00:01:01.770> legs<00:01:02.430> or<00:01:02.640> different<00:01:02.910> lengths<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
of legs or different lengths of the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.850 
of legs or different lengths of the
torso<00:01:03.510> so<00:01:03.870> what's<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> most<00:01:04.260> important

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
torso so what's the most important

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.530 
torso so what's the most important
aspect<00:01:04.949> of<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.460> bike<00:01:05.670> when<00:01:06.090> you're<00:01:06.180> trying<00:01:06.420> to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
aspect of the bike when you're trying to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.270 
aspect of the bike when you're trying to
choose<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.930> frame<00:01:07.080> size<00:01:07.380> yes<00:01:07.860> obviously<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
choose the frame size yes obviously the

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.580 
choose the frame size yes obviously the
free<00:01:08.909> main<00:01:09.210> measurements<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.229> effect<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
free main measurements that effect the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.170 
free main measurements that effect the
frame<00:01:10.830> size<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.400> bike<00:01:11.580> you've<00:01:11.760> got<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> seat

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
frame size of a bike you've got the seat

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.469 
frame size of a bike you've got the seat
you<00:01:12.710> the<00:01:13.710> top<00:01:13.890> tube<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.610> head<00:01:14.760> tube<00:01:15.000> okay

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
you the top tube and the head tube okay

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.969 
you the top tube and the head tube okay
and<00:01:15.570> they<00:01:15.659> kind<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.930> combine<00:01:16.409> together<00:01:16.619> to

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
and they kind of combine together to

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.890 
and they kind of combine together to
produce<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.460> frame<00:01:17.759> size<00:01:18.150> okay<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.659> you've

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
produce that frame size okay so you've

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.649 
produce that frame size okay so you've
got<00:01:18.930> your<00:01:19.049> seat<00:01:19.350> height<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.740> then<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.950> reach

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
got your seat height and then you reach

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.760 
got your seat height and then you reach
so<00:01:21.659> when<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.869> sit<00:01:22.049> on<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.170> bike<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:22.590> it's

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
so when you sit on that bike and it's

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.649 
so when you sit on that bike and it's
that<00:01:22.920> reach<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.970> actually<00:01:24.330> is<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.479> most

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
that reach that actually is the most

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.960 
that reach that actually is the most
important<00:01:25.320> measurement<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.159> my<00:01:26.250> book<00:01:26.490> so

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
important measurement in my book so

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.039 
important measurement in my book so
actually<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.330> top<00:01:27.540> tube

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
actually the top tube

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.630 
actually the top tube
so<00:01:28.470> effectively<00:01:29.070> you've<00:01:29.220> only<00:01:29.340> got<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> few

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
so effectively you've only got a few

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.370 
so effectively you've only got a few
centimeters<00:01:30.360> really<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:30.930> make<00:01:31.110> a

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
centimeters really that you can make a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.020 
centimeters really that you can make a
difference<00:01:31.979> in<00:01:32.070> terms<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.369> how<00:01:32.430> far<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.000> are

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
difference in terms of how far you are

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.060 
difference in terms of how far you are
because<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.600> stem<00:01:33.840> size<00:01:34.110> but<00:01:34.470> they<00:01:34.890> said

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
because of the stem size but they said

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.429 
because of the stem size but they said
the<00:01:35.159> saddle<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.549> go<00:01:35.670> up<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.090> down<00:01:36.270> a<00:01:36.540> fair<00:01:37.170> bit

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
the saddle can go up and down a fair bit

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.899 
the saddle can go up and down a fair bit
so<00:01:37.650> but<00:01:37.950> presumably<00:01:38.159> depth<00:01:38.520> on<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.670> settle

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
so but presumably depth on the settle

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.390 
so but presumably depth on the settle
right<00:01:38.970> down<00:01:39.450> at<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.630> bottom<00:01:39.869> or<00:01:40.200> or<00:01:40.409> -<00:01:40.650> now<00:01:40.860> you

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
right down at the bottom or or - now you

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.280 
right down at the bottom or or - now you
want<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.640> get<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.030> ballpark<00:01:42.450> with<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> frame

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
want to get in the ballpark with a frame

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.270 
want to get in the ballpark with a frame
bit<00:01:43.409> like<00:01:43.560> say<00:01:43.680> you've<00:01:43.799> got<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> lot<00:01:44.159> of

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
bit like say you've got a lot of

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.950 
bit like say you've got a lot of
adjustment<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.360> seat<00:01:45.570> post

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
adjustment in the seat post

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.319 
adjustment in the seat post
okay<00:01:46.649> bit<00:01:46.829> like<00:01:46.979> say<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.189> can<00:01:47.369> move<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.729> up<00:01:47.850> 2

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
okay bit like say you can move that up 2

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.899 
okay bit like say you can move that up 2
or<00:01:48.479> 3<00:01:48.689> inches<00:01:49.049> either<00:01:49.229> way<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:50.520> especially<00:01:50.880> a

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
or 3 inches either way and especially a

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.020 
or 3 inches either way and especially a
compact<00:01:51.409> frames<00:01:52.409> these<00:01:52.590> days<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.790> sloping

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
compact frames these days so the sloping

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.550 
compact frames these days so the sloping
top<00:01:54.390> she<00:01:54.570> was<00:01:54.689> even<00:01:54.899> more<00:01:55.020> adjustment

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
top she was even more adjustment

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.410 
top she was even more adjustment
available<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.610> let's<00:01:56.759> say<00:01:56.880> what<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.180> can't

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
available but let's say what you can't

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.170 
available but let's say what you can't
change<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.869> lot<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.890> stem<00:01:59.130> length<00:01:59.340> okay<00:02:00.119> so

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
change a lot is the stem length okay so

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.359 
change a lot is the stem length okay so
you<00:02:00.420> can<00:02:00.810> adjust<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.229> stem<00:02:01.469> for<00:02:01.950> example<00:02:02.310> on

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
you can adjust the stem for example on

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.130 
you can adjust the stem for example on
this<00:02:02.460> medium/large<00:02:02.969> I've<00:02:03.210> got<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.420> an<00:02:03.719> 11

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
this medium/large I've got a an 11

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.080 
this medium/large I've got a an 11
centimeter<00:02:04.560> stem<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.430> could<00:02:05.579> go<00:02:05.700> up<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.939> maybe

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
centimeter stem you could go up to maybe

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.650 
centimeter stem you could go up to maybe
a<00:02:06.210> 1213<00:02:07.170> push<00:02:07.879> before<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.119> handling<00:02:09.450> really

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
a 1213 push before the handling really

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.900 
a 1213 push before the handling really
starts<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:10.020> slow<00:02:10.200> down<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:11.129> in<00:02:11.340> terms<00:02:11.550> of<00:02:11.760> you

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
starts to slow down so in terms of you

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.790 
starts to slow down so in terms of you
know<00:02:11.970> how<00:02:12.450> do<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.750> know<00:02:12.900> that<00:02:12.930> it's<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.290> right

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
know how do you know that it's the right

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.710 
know how do you know that it's the right
top<00:02:14.490> two<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.030> right<00:02:15.240> reached<00:02:15.540> view

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
top two of you in the right reached view

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.570 
top two of you in the right reached view
is<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:15.900> just<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.170> case<00:02:16.380> of<00:02:16.860> sitting<00:02:17.070> on<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.310> bike

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
is it just a case of sitting on the bike

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.650 
is it just a case of sitting on the bike
and<00:02:17.850> getting<00:02:17.970> to<00:02:18.060> settle<00:02:18.270> in<00:02:18.330> roughly<00:02:18.570> the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
and getting to settle in roughly the

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.960 
and getting to settle in roughly the
right<00:02:18.840> position<00:02:19.260> yeah<00:02:19.470> feel<00:02:19.920> best<00:02:20.490> way<00:02:20.670> is<00:02:20.820> to

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
right position yeah feel best way is to

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.300 
right position yeah feel best way is to
go<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.390> sit<00:02:21.810> on<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.170> bikes<00:02:22.380> try<00:02:22.980> different

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
go and sit on the bikes try different

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.580 
go and sit on the bikes try different
bikes<00:02:23.520> look<00:02:24.240> at<00:02:24.390> different<00:02:24.690> options<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.290> and

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
bikes look at different options and and

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.890 
bikes look at different options and and
get<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:25.800> feeling<00:02:26.280> first<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.700> all<00:02:26.820> within<00:02:27.480> one

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
get a feeling first of all within one

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.920 
get a feeling first of all within one
shop<00:02:28.140> or<00:02:28.350> a<00:02:28.380> variety<00:02:28.950> of<00:02:28.980> shops<00:02:29.310> for<00:02:30.120> what<00:02:30.900> a

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
shop or a variety of shops for what a

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.390 
shop or a variety of shops for what a
road<00:02:31.140> bike<00:02:31.320> feels<00:02:31.590> like<00:02:31.800> if<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.040> only<00:02:32.070> go<00:02:32.340> and

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
road bike feels like if you only go and

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.770 
road bike feels like if you only go and
sit<00:02:32.580> on<00:02:32.640> one<00:02:32.820> bike<00:02:33.030> for<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.270> first<00:02:33.450> period<00:02:33.660> of

sit on one bike for the first period of

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.030 
sit on one bike for the first period of
time<00:02:33.930> how<00:02:34.290> do<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:34.530> really<00:02:34.710> know<00:02:34.800> if<00:02:34.860> that's

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
time how do you really know if that's

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.520 
time how do you really know if that's
right<00:02:35.190> or<00:02:35.250> wrong<00:02:35.490> sit<00:02:35.760> on<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.880> variety<00:02:36.530> maybe

it's different shops all different
brands<00:02:38.880> within<00:02:39.210> a<00:02:39.270> shop<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:40.350> you<00:02:40.380> actually<00:02:40.560> get

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
brands within a shop so you actually get

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:41.990 
brands within a shop so you actually get
a<00:02:40.830> bit<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.070> a<00:02:41.100> feeling<00:02:41.340> a<00:02:41.520> bit<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.730> knowledge

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
a bit of a feeling a bit of knowledge

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.240 
a bit of a feeling a bit of knowledge
for<00:02:42.180> what<00:02:42.360> you're<00:02:42.540> looking<00:02:43.260> for<00:02:43.530> so

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
for what you're looking for so

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.100 
for what you're looking for so
particular<00:02:44.700> is<00:02:44.760> two<00:02:45.000> ways<00:02:45.270> of<00:02:45.480> defining<00:02:45.660> the

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
particular is two ways of defining the

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.690 
particular is two ways of defining the
reach<00:02:46.320> and<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.620> bike<00:02:46.830> because<00:02:47.130> of<00:02:47.490> course

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
reach and the bike because of course

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.400 
reach and the bike because of course
it's<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:47.940> how<00:02:48.090> far<00:02:48.330> forward<00:02:48.540> Java<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.020> also<00:02:49.290> how

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
it's a how far forward Java is also how

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.500 
it's a how far forward Java is also how
low<00:02:49.710> or<00:02:50.190> how<00:02:50.340> high<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.640> are<00:02:50.820> up<00:02:51.060> on<00:02:51.210> the<00:02:51.300> buy<00:02:51.450> so

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
low or how high you are up on the buy so

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.880 
low or how high you are up on the buy so
how<00:02:51.720> do<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:51.870> decide<00:02:52.170> what's<00:02:52.710> the<00:02:52.800> best

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
how do you decide what's the best

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.470 
how do you decide what's the best
position<00:02:53.520> for<00:02:53.550> you<00:02:53.730> in<00:02:53.850> terms<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.240> height

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
position for you in terms of the height

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.630 
position for you in terms of the height
of<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.690> stem<00:02:55.020> yes<00:02:55.920> you're<00:02:56.100> spot-on<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.490> two

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
of the stem yes you're spot-on the two

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.700 
of the stem yes you're spot-on the two
work<00:02:57.120> together<00:02:57.270> to<00:02:57.690> produce<00:02:57.810> that<00:02:58.170> reach<00:02:58.440> what

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
work together to produce that reach what

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.860 
work together to produce that reach what
we're<00:02:58.830> trying<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.040> do<00:02:59.130> is<00:02:59.250> combine<00:02:59.460> both<00:02:59.970> so

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
we're trying to do is combine both so

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.930 
we're trying to do is combine both so
that<00:03:00.900> when<00:03:01.740> you're<00:03:01.920> leaning<00:03:02.130> forward<00:03:02.310> and

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
that when you're leaning forward and

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.140 
that when you're leaning forward and
you're<00:03:03.210> on<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:04.290> brake<00:03:04.890> levers<00:03:05.250> gear<00:03:05.820> shifters

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
you're on the brake levers gear shifters

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.490 
you're on the brake levers gear shifters
have<00:03:06.270> such<00:03:06.450> a<00:03:06.480> kind<00:03:06.750> of<00:03:06.780> default<00:03:07.110> position

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
have such a kind of default position

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.140 
have such a kind of default position
you're<00:03:07.860> trying<00:03:08.070> to<00:03:08.160> combine<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.790> replace<00:03:09.030> a

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
you're trying to combine the replace a

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.260 
you're trying to combine the replace a
to<00:03:09.210> reach<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:10.620> drop<00:03:10.860> of<00:03:11.070> a<00:03:11.250> handlebar<00:03:11.580> so

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
to reach and the drop of a handlebar so

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.350 
to reach and the drop of a handlebar so
that<00:03:12.540> that's<00:03:12.870> within<00:03:13.080> your<00:03:13.260> comfort<00:03:13.530> zone<00:03:13.890> and

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
that that's within your comfort zone and

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.090 
that that's within your comfort zone and
that's<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.570> really<00:03:15.750> important<00:03:16.290> determinant<00:03:17.040> of

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
that's a really important determinant of

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.970 
that's a really important determinant of
your<00:03:17.250> frame<00:03:17.520> size<00:03:17.940> okay<00:03:18.570> so<00:03:18.800> and<00:03:19.800> that's

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
your frame size okay so and that's

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:21.140 
your frame size okay so and that's
actually<00:03:20.130> been<00:03:20.280> reflected<00:03:20.730> in<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.850> lot<00:03:20.940> of<00:03:20.970> bike

very<00:03:38.880> basic<00:03:39.480> but<00:03:39.630> it<00:03:39.720> can<00:03:39.840> get<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:40.050> in<00:03:40.140> the

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
very basic but it can get you in the

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.930 
very basic but it can get you in the
ballpark<00:03:40.350> if<00:03:40.830> you're<00:03:41.160> unable<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.400> touch<00:03:41.760> your

you're<00:03:43.320> probably<00:03:43.680> more<00:03:43.830> suited<00:03:44.100> towards<00:03:44.730> a

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
you're probably more suited towards a

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.420 
you're probably more suited towards a
sporty<00:03:45.360> frame<00:03:45.720> so<00:03:46.620> it's<00:03:46.800> a<00:03:46.890> slightly<00:03:47.160> higher

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
sporty frame so it's a slightly higher

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.220 
sporty frame so it's a slightly higher
and<00:03:47.670> closer<00:03:48.030> towards<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.600> into<00:03:48.810> handlebar

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
and closer towards you into handlebar

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.780 
and closer towards you into handlebar
and<00:03:49.709> that's<00:03:49.860> like<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.130> be<00:03:50.220> more<00:03:50.400> comfortable

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
and that's like to be more comfortable

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.910 
and that's like to be more comfortable
and<00:03:51.030> better<00:03:51.150> suited<00:03:51.570> so<00:03:52.230> presumably<00:03:52.470> most

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
and better suited so presumably most

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.230 
and better suited so presumably most
professionals<00:03:53.610> are<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.700> little<00:03:53.820> bit<00:03:54.000> more

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
professionals are a little bit more

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.030 
professionals are a little bit more
flexible<00:03:55.080> that's<00:03:55.290> what<00:03:55.380> allows<00:03:55.590> them<00:03:55.740> to<00:03:55.890> get

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
flexible that's what allows them to get

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.350 
flexible that's what allows them to get
low<00:03:56.250> at<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.459> front<00:03:56.700> end<00:03:56.880> and<00:03:57.000> be<00:03:57.150> more

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
low at the front end and be more

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.690 
low at the front end and be more
aerodynamic<00:03:57.510> but<00:03:58.020> many<00:03:58.560> amateurs<00:03:59.010> are<00:03:59.160> less

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
aerodynamic but many amateurs are less

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.980 
aerodynamic but many amateurs are less
flexible<00:04:00.150> ones<00:04:00.300> I<00:04:00.360> need<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.600> have<00:04:00.720> just<00:04:00.900> a

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
flexible ones I need to have just a

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.230 
flexible ones I need to have just a
slightly<00:04:01.260> higher<00:04:01.670> front<00:04:02.670> end<00:04:02.880> just<00:04:02.970> for<00:04:03.120> the

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:03.240 
slightly higher front end just for the

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.090 
slightly higher front end just for the
comfort<00:04:03.480> is<00:04:03.720> it<00:04:03.810> mean<00:04:03.959> yeah<00:04:04.500> so<00:04:04.680> it's<00:04:04.860> it's

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
comfort is it mean yeah so it's it's

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.310 
comfort is it mean yeah so it's it's
that<00:04:05.310> flexibility<00:04:05.970> of<00:04:06.300> the<00:04:06.720> hamstrings

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
that flexibility of the hamstrings

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.380 
that flexibility of the hamstrings
glutes<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:07.890> back<00:04:08.070> so<00:04:08.520> the<00:04:08.880> guys<00:04:09.060> have<00:04:09.090> been

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
glutes and back so the guys have been

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.030 
glutes and back so the guys have been
riding<00:04:09.600> and<00:04:09.810> also<00:04:10.110> it's<00:04:10.380> how<00:04:10.739> long<00:04:10.920> you've

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
riding and also it's how long you've

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.920 
riding and also it's how long you've
been<00:04:11.070> doing<00:04:11.250> it<00:04:11.580> for<00:04:11.610> so<00:04:12.000> over<00:04:12.270> a<00:04:12.330> long<00:04:12.570> period

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
been doing it for so over a long period

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.570 
been doing it for so over a long period
of<00:04:12.959> time<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.260> body<00:04:13.470> adapts<00:04:13.830> and<00:04:14.130> presumably

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
of time the body adapts and presumably

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.130 
of time the body adapts and presumably
also<00:04:14.730> having<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.180> higher<00:04:15.390> front<00:04:15.720> end<00:04:15.900> does<00:04:16.049> it

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
also having a higher front end does it

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.650 
also having a higher front end does it
make<00:04:16.290> so<00:04:16.440> much<00:04:16.530> difference<00:04:16.590> in<00:04:17.190> terms<00:04:17.400> of

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
make so much difference in terms of

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.030 
make so much difference in terms of
aerodynamics<00:04:18.660> really<00:04:18.840> when<00:04:18.930> you're<00:04:19.049> doing<00:04:19.290> 25

these guys in the Tour de France are

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.400 
these guys in the Tour de France are
doing<00:04:23.340> the<00:04:23.580> thing<00:04:23.970> is<00:04:24.090> you<00:04:24.270> can<00:04:24.479> always<00:04:25.020> make

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
doing the thing is you can always make

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.640 
doing the thing is you can always make
yourself<00:04:25.620> lower

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
yourself lower

you<00:04:26.919> can<00:04:27.100> literally<00:04:27.340> just<00:04:27.610> you<00:04:28.240> can<00:04:28.360> be<00:04:28.449> in

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
you can literally just you can be in
