the<00:00:19.230> answer<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.830> least<00:00:20.100> mature<00:00:20.310> question

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
the answer to the least mature question

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.420 
the answer to the least mature question
to<00:00:21.000> be<00:00:21.090> asked<00:00:21.390> in<00:00:21.480> 2011<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.350> what's<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.100> m5

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
to be asked in 2011 is what's the m5

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.609 
to be asked in 2011 is what's the m5
like<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.790> drift

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.010 

so<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.710> new<00:00:31.859> m5<00:00:32.189> has<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.550> answer<00:00:32.700> four<00:00:33.510> key

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
so the new m5 has to answer four key

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.130 
so the new m5 has to answer four key

two reasons first there wasn't an

8-speed automatic around at the time the

8-speed automatic around at the time the

of<00:02:23.100> all<00:02:23.250> high<00:02:24.030> reving<00:02:24.450> nature<00:02:24.750> of<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:24.930> engine

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
of all high reving nature of this engine

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.380 
of all high reving nature of this engine
meant<00:02:25.470> that<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.860> kind<00:02:26.100> of<00:02:26.220> needed<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:27.150> have

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
meant that it kind of needed to have

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.120 
meant that it kind of needed to have
that<00:02:27.420> manual<00:02:28.050> based<00:02:28.230> transmission<00:02:28.800> again<00:02:29.010> it

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
that manual based transmission again it

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.250 
that manual based transmission again it
was<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.250> problem<00:02:29.610> for<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.790> automatic<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.510> think

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
was a problem for the automatic I think

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.050 
was a problem for the automatic I think
it<00:02:31.440> worked<00:02:31.680> brilliantly

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
it worked brilliantly

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.970 
it worked brilliantly
I<00:02:33.090> think<00:02:33.600> it's<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.870> equal<00:02:34.260> best<00:02:34.530> double

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
I think it's the equal best double

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.680 
I think it's the equal best double
clutch<00:02:35.160> I've<00:02:35.340> driven<00:02:35.580> with<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.060> GTR<00:02:36.390> in

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
clutch I've driven with the GTR in

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.170 
clutch I've driven with the GTR in
earnest<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.140> so<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.070> f10<00:02:38.340> m5<00:02:38.459> is<00:02:38.850> car<00:02:39.060> that

every single category I've listed one

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.979 
every single category I've listed one
two<00:02:43.830> three<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.250> four<00:02:44.489> it<00:02:45.000> sorts<00:02:45.480> things<00:02:45.690> out

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
two three and four it sorts things out

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.050 
two three and four it sorts things out
it<00:02:46.200> is<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.320> much<00:02:46.650> much<00:02:47.040> better<00:02:47.340> car<00:02:47.730> to<00:02:47.880> live

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
it is a much much better car to live

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.750 
it is a much much better car to live
with<00:02:48.239> but<00:02:48.720> is<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.080> still<00:02:49.380> a<00:02:49.650> real<00:02:50.100> em<00:02:50.250> guys<00:02:50.459> it's

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
with but is it still a real em guys it's

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.690 
with but is it still a real em guys it's
still<00:02:50.940> an<00:02:51.120> exciting<00:02:51.690> color<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:55.920> doesn't<00:02:56.370> feel

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
still an exciting color it doesn't feel

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.360 
still an exciting color it doesn't feel
like<00:02:57.000> a<00:02:57.060> natural<00:02:57.330> extension<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.680> 5<00:02:58.920> Series

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
like a natural extension of the 5 Series

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.009 
like a natural extension of the 5 Series
again<00:02:59.730> some<00:02:59.940> what<00:03:00.060> I'm<00:03:00.150> saying<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:00.570> feels<00:03:00.810> like

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
again some what I'm saying it feels like

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.140 
again some what I'm saying it feels like
a<00:03:01.049> separate<00:03:01.620> water<00:03:01.890> line<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.370> feels<00:03:02.549> like<00:03:02.760> the

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
a separate water line it feels like the

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.020 
a separate water line it feels like the
m5<00:03:03.330> is<00:03:03.780> own<00:03:04.049> range<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.620> cars<00:03:04.860> the<00:03:05.700> difference

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
m5 is own range of cars the difference

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.940 
m5 is own range of cars the difference
is<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.180> subtle<00:03:06.600> but<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:07.200> add<00:03:07.320> in<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:07.500> different

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
is a subtle but you add in the different

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.199 
is a subtle but you add in the different
seats<00:03:08.220> the<00:03:08.370> different<00:03:08.730> steering<00:03:08.940> wheel

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
seats the different steering wheel

seats the different steering wheel
different<00:03:09.660> noises<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:10.140> different<00:03:10.500> looks

different noises the different looks

different noises the different looks
different

he paddles all of it combines to give me

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:15.990 
he paddles all of it combines to give me
this<00:03:14.689> feeling<00:03:15.019> that<00:03:15.049> you're<00:03:15.260> in<00:03:15.290> a<00:03:15.409> car<00:03:15.469> that's

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
this feeling that you're in a car that's

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.979 
this feeling that you're in a car that's
fundamentally<00:03:17.000> different<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.420> a<00:03:17.450> 5<00:03:17.719> Series

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
fundamentally different to a 5 Series

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.509 
fundamentally different to a 5 Series
and<00:03:18.500> has<00:03:18.620> a<00:03:18.650> completely<00:03:19.010> different<00:03:19.189> character

and has a completely different character

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.670 
and has a completely different character
maybe<00:03:20.209> the<00:03:20.359> noise<00:03:20.510> builds<00:03:20.959> on<00:03:21.049> that<00:03:21.170> as<00:03:21.290> well<00:03:21.439> I

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
maybe the noise builds on that as well I

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.520 
maybe the noise builds on that as well I
like<00:03:22.159> that<00:03:22.459> and<00:03:22.849> this<00:03:23.000> car<00:03:23.329> totally<00:03:24.049> succeeds

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
like that and this car totally succeeds

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.629 
like that and this car totally succeeds
in<00:03:24.709> achieving<00:03:25.129> it

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:27.639 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:31.240 

that's<00:03:28.639> BMW<00:03:29.239> nailed<00:03:29.480> it<00:03:29.629> with<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.840> new<00:03:29.959> m5<00:03:30.319> I'd

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
that's BMW nailed it with the new m5 I'd

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.579 
that's BMW nailed it with the new m5 I'd
