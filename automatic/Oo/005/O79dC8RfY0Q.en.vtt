00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.690
 people have a tradition of every end of 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.240
 week to join to eat chat 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.220

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.020
 week on Saturday on Sunday no one wants 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.150
 have a lot of work but everyone wants 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.029
 eat super well then I have the solution 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.910
 1 August mixed is an Italian dish that is 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.160
 simply a mixture of roasts is 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.349
 very easy to do and you can 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.320
 to feed a large group of people and 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.270
 well, what you need is some 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.820
 chicken hoofs you can choose 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.850
 another part of the chicken you prefer and 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.570
 Roast with sausage potatoes a lot of 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.460
 things 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.140
 I'll start with the sauce I left it 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.280
 everything super special 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.440
 first the garlic will just take the part of 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.719
 top 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.789
 I need some aluminum foil and 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.780
 in your kitchen you really need 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:07.380
 quality then requires the royal bacca 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:10.950
 Let's get a sheet to rip 2 on the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:16.050
 center put my head of garlic one 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.480
 touch of olive oil save 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:27.960
 and a touch of ground black pepper in the 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:31.620
 time to close and take to medium oven 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.050
 180 degrees around 40 minutes and looks 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.650
 only what happens 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.050
 he thinks it stays but if slightly sweet 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.880
 and it looks incredible in a sauce we go 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.340
 get those teeth and put them 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.370
 inside the blender hurries recipe 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.490
 I'll use a head of garlic inside the 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.920
 blender 4 tbsp 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.640
 mustard this very simple yellow that 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.710
 you find everywhere and like me 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.810
 I'm crazy about pepper, she really is. 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.180
 essential in all my income only 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.020
 who today decides to use the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.880
 pouting 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.880
 I'll put a good amount 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:16.200
 a touch of olive oil is essential in 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.660
 any good salt sauce 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.210
 In fact he has tempered our chicken 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.980
 then we can not forget it the 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:26.070
 aroma of this recipe we will go 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.290
 get with parsley and to give a 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.350
 a little more liquidity in this 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.200
 recipe we will use white wine only 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.090
 a touch a kind a cup is already going 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.520
 make all the difference is very 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.290
 tasty and even if it is for children not 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:44.270
 worry because he's going to leave 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.270
 lose the alcohol then only the taste stays 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.270
 sauce ready 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.790
 I love it when the machines do all the 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.100
 I work and as a weekend I do not 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.710
 I want to be washing dishes at the end then 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.480
 have perfect solution to the river park comes 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.280
 with all those little flags that are 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.470
 perfect to bake your things in the 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.270
 oven is best if you go in the house 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.310
 Someone you do not even have to worry about 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:17.360
 bring tray back even with the var 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:20.360
 I love nothing at all. 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.170
 supersimples the chicken here I am 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.170
 using the coxinhas 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.780
 here I have 12 little coxinhas so give 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.090
 willingness for six people to eat super 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.730
 good 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:40.280
 some raw pink potatoes contains general 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:49.489
 one person and we'll cut there every half 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:51.440
 in 3 in my past me this also goes 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.680
 come in from the martins that I'm going to cut 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.549
 just like the potatoes they baked 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.549
 they look awesome too 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:05.000
 I'll also put the tongue in saints. 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:09.550
 here I have the traditional and the calabresa 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.550
 I'll cut into slices 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.590
 now we have a challenge we need 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.280
 fit it all here inside the 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.579
 tray 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.579

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:33.919
 Look what a beautiful thing, imagine yourself. 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:37.190
 then roast and golden we 're good too 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:40.130
 but to improve we will still put 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.440
 some whole teeth from there you do not 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.540
 need to worry about peeling and 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.250
 then take this slowly will stay 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.660
 that even those teeth that 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.210
 got into the eye 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:53.030
 some purple olives also only 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.910
 fit them here in the middle 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.980
 delicious now only missing the sauce that goes 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.090

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.210
 aluminum

 now just take it to the preheated oven 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.800
 180 degrees around an hour and a half 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:28.750
 being the last 20 minutes you 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.850
