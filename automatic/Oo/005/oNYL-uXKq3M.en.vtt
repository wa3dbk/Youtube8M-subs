 Also based on that 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.430

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:48.829

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.880
 Also first two of the sound This is a time of major 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:02.650
 Learn your position 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:05.760
 15 fret of the first down 5're playing in the first one 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.220
 Index finger this 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.840
 What 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.470
 After this decrease with the finger shaking 18 and sound 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.470
 Up to half 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.820
 Next 4 cases in entering 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.820
 17 frets 2 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.730
 3 17 frets 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:32.159
 The 16th Fret 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.450
 Look at 15 islands 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.490
 Hmm 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.490
 It looks like 20 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.830
 ana 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.850
 This is the first one 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.850
 a second one 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.120
 First of all 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.960
 Hmm 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.600
 So 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.600
 I'm getting down when I follow my lick 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.920
 The second position of the second effect is from the 15th fret of the word from tomorrow and 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.540
 4 reviews of 13 fruit and middle finger 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.400
 Oh 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.400
 Index finger on 3 12 frets 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.200
 2 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:27.599
 Perry with 13 frets 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.599
 Look at the 11th fret for your index finger 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.630
 It is 15 fret little finger 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:38.459
 Who now of the reverse of the movement because it was the principal and interest Clark 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.620
 ana 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.250
 Hmm 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:54.510
 First of all, let's learn these two positions 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:58.940
 But I was remember how that form is a major ask to see the first the previous video in major 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:04.290
 Learn the shape of sweep major triad sweep 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:09.659
 At a, what is useful if you remember it? 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:15.340
 For example, this time is c, so c is in front, so it looks like the same third place 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:20.290
 We do this three cities only. Flat Dormy so is not using 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:26.069
 Esakki was used in a major of thought it was a story Date sickness 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:30.689
 I will talk in a for commentary a little 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:35.230
 It is the sound of this dee that this lard 3 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:38.240
 Wonder if the place of your story of another power cord 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:46.080
 I'm talking a little bit 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:49.940
 It is the third sound of Te wind because Rasheed of Rashidoremi say this Pan and 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.770
 There is strictly a little variety and say that Oh is the third sound of 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:57.140
 ua 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:59.660
 The third sound is the sound determines the major or minor 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:05.430
 It will be a decisive factor 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:07.930
 For the time being rather dark pumice that's it 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:12.860
 nan 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:16.790
 If you firmly remember this form this form 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:18.470
 The third sound counting from Luton, in this case 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.010
 a 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.010
 Eh. 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:29.940
 Though it is sound hall # of sound of this time 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:32.330
 a This is lowered to 1 fret branch company which is disgusting---- 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:36.230
 am 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:41.620
 It is the completion of minor to it alone 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.620
 So repeatedly go helpful to first from major 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.500
 March minor dan 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.080
 Ah ah ah 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.080
 I think you see that the position of the left has not changed much 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:03.190
 Lou It is natural 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.190
 I since only lowered a semitone a third of de sound of Te wind the third sound of La 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.780
 re na 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:13.490
 A'N 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:17.430
 I think it is very easy to get into shape when you have this kind of awareness 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:25.690
 Also ban 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:28.750
 There This position is also out of nothing counted third of next road Neun GokozoPPai this 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:33.270
 N This locker I'd 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:33.270
 It has been reacted 

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:37.150
 nan 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.860
 N Day 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:45.889
 Minor perfection 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.849
 Well, I think it's like I'm in the lever head when I think of linking major and minor 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:49.680
 I think it is easy 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:53.820
 Blindly it than the king-like 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.370
 Yeah technical thing is exactly the same as a major 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.350
 eh 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:02.040
 When using fingers across multiple lines 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:04.129
 A little wrist so the sound is to separate this 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.220
 It is an image that I will relate to 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:10.300
 Ringing sound to pieces and go 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.300
 You will hear cool 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:16.740
 Rare 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:21.360
 Practical and a real ne No Tteyuu 3 Parupejio 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:24.129
 Because it can be used in various situations, by all means at this opportunity 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:28.169
 Let's remember and use more and more 

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:28.169
 a car Thank you in it dating
