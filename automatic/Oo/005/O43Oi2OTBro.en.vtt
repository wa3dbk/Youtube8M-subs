so<00:01:17.790> let's<00:01:18.000> begin<00:01:18.119> this<00:01:18.450> by<00:01:18.509> priming<00:01:19.049> our<00:01:19.140> face

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
so let's begin this by priming our face

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.280 
so let's begin this by priming our face
I'm<00:01:19.680> going<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:20.310> using<00:01:20.729> my<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.210> smooth<00:01:21.600> skin

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
I'm going to be using my so smooth skin

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.200 
I'm going to be using my so smooth skin
primer<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.009> I'm<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.640> going<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.880> apply<00:01:24.150> this

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
primer and I'm just going to apply this

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.719 
primer and I'm just going to apply this
over<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.930> face<00:01:25.200> if<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.770> have<00:01:25.979> all<00:01:26.250> this<00:01:26.369> skin

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.660 
over the face if you have all this skin
this<00:01:27.030> step<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.600> very<00:01:27.659> very<00:01:28.380> important<00:01:29.040> only

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
this step is very very important only

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.789 
this step is very very important only
because<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.420> don't<00:01:30.690> want<00:01:31.080> to<00:01:31.259> be<00:01:31.409> your<00:01:31.560> only

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
mess by the end of the day so make sure

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.170

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
face that I feel like mica stiller that

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.580 
face that I feel like mica stiller that
includes<00:01:50.100> under<00:01:50.429> my<00:01:50.580> eyes<00:01:51.080> breakout<00:01:52.080> marks

I'm<00:01:55.710> going<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.009> be<00:01:56.190> doing<00:01:56.340> here<00:01:56.729> this<00:01:57.179> step<00:01:57.539> is

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
I'm going to be doing here this step is

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.779 
I'm going to be doing here this step is
actually<00:01:57.990> a<00:01:58.200> step<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.679> I<00:01:58.770> used<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.250> use<00:01:59.280> a

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
actually a step that I used to use a

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.460

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.740 
and I don't know exactly why I stopped
doing<00:02:08.100> it<00:02:08.220> this<00:02:08.369> way<00:02:08.429> but<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.970> find<00:02:09.299> that<00:02:09.509> this

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
doing it this way but I find that this

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.690 
doing it this way but I find that this
actually<00:02:10.440> works<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.860> base<00:02:11.220> for<00:02:11.549> your

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
actually works as a base for your

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.850 
actually works as a base for your
foundation<00:02:11.880> so<00:02:12.750> if<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.930> have<00:02:13.140> any<00:02:13.410> scarring

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
foundation so if you have any scarring

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.430 
foundation so if you have any scarring
or<00:02:14.130> any<00:02:14.280> bad<00:02:14.780> anything<00:02:15.780> going<00:02:15.989> on<00:02:16.049> your<00:02:16.230> face

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
or any bad anything going on your face

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.229 
or any bad anything going on your face
this<00:02:16.650> will<00:02:16.890> help<00:02:17.070> give<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.400> extra<00:02:17.820> coverage

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
this will help give you extra coverage

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:27.050 
this will help give you extra coverage

in<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.750> summer<00:02:28.049> because<00:02:28.290> it<00:02:28.829> puts<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.519> makeup

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
in the summer because it puts the makeup

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.910 
in the summer because it puts the makeup
exactly<00:02:30.540> where<00:02:30.690> I<00:02:30.720> wanted<00:02:31.290> and<00:02:31.560> not<00:02:31.769> to

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
exactly where I wanted and not to

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.849 
exactly where I wanted and not to
mention<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:32.310> it's<00:02:33.180> wet<00:02:33.570> so<00:02:33.989> applying<00:02:34.560> my

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
mention that it's wet so applying my

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.729 
mention that it's wet so applying my
makeup<00:02:35.040> with<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.579> wet<00:02:35.880> sponge<00:02:36.290> it's<00:02:37.290> just<00:02:37.530> so

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
makeup with a wet sponge it's just so

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:39.530 
makeup with a wet sponge it's just so
much<00:02:37.920> better<00:02:38.190> than<00:02:38.549> a<00:02:38.579> brush<00:02:38.940> because<00:02:39.090> I<00:02:39.269> don't

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
much better than a brush because I don't

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.720 
much better than a brush because I don't
pile<00:02:39.780> it<00:02:39.959> on<00:02:40.140> so<00:02:40.920> I'm<00:02:40.980> gonna<00:02:41.100> let<00:02:41.190> that<00:02:41.400> settle

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
pile it on so I'm gonna let that settle

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.880 
pile it on so I'm gonna let that settle
in<00:02:42.030> after<00:02:42.329> that<00:02:42.720> I'm<00:02:42.870> going<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.350> be<00:02:43.470> using<00:02:43.620> my

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
this will be better for me in the winter

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.150 
this will be better for me in the winter
when<00:05:56.190> it's<00:05:56.340> cooler<00:05:56.669> rather<00:05:57.540> than<00:05:57.930> in<00:05:58.380> the

00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 
when it's cooler rather than in the

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.640 
when it's cooler rather than in the
summer<00:05:59.460> where<00:05:59.760> I'm<00:05:59.970> out<00:06:00.330> in<00:06:00.540> 100-degree<00:06:01.110> heat

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
but overall is absolutely gorgeous so

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.280 
but overall is absolutely gorgeous so
now<00:06:05.669> this<00:06:05.910> step<00:06:06.150> is<00:06:06.330> optional<00:06:06.570> because<00:06:06.990> I'm

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
now this step is optional because I'm
