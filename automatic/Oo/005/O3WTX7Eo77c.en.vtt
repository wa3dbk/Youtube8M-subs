Rome<00:00:34.989> stirs<00:00:35.260> calm<00:00:35.739> and<00:00:36.129> so<00:00:36.339> what<00:00:36.489> I<00:00:36.519> know<00:00:36.640> that

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
Rome stirs calm and so what I know that

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.270 
Rome stirs calm and so what I know that
a<00:00:37.000> lot<00:00:37.059> of<00:00:37.360> people<00:00:37.750> do<00:00:37.930> is<00:00:38.290> they<00:00:38.320> will<00:00:38.890> go<00:00:39.220> to

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
a lot of people do is they will go to

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.860 
a lot of people do is they will go to
the<00:00:39.430> address<00:00:39.760> bar<00:00:39.970> and<00:00:40.120> they<00:00:40.299> will<00:00:40.479> type<00:00:40.720> in

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
the address bar and they will type in

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.950 
the address bar and they will type in
the<00:00:40.930> first<00:00:41.199> letter<00:00:41.440> of<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:42.420> URL<00:00:43.420> and<00:00:43.750> then

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
the first letter of the URL and then

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.410 
the first letter of the URL and then
they'll<00:00:44.140> probably<00:00:44.320> scroll<00:00:44.769> down<00:00:44.949> and<00:00:45.519> so<00:00:46.390> I

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:46.420 
they'll probably scroll down and so I

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.960 
they'll probably scroll down and so I
see<00:00:46.839> basically<00:00:47.559> I<00:00:47.650> see<00:00:47.949> Rome<00:00:48.190> stirs<00:00:48.430> calm<00:00:48.820> but

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
see basically I see Rome stirs calm but

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.939 
see basically I see Rome stirs calm but
that<00:00:49.089> doesn't<00:00:49.390> exactly<00:00:49.659> take<00:00:49.989> me<00:00:50.199> to<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.500> to

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
that doesn't exactly take me to the to

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.939 
that doesn't exactly take me to the to
the<00:00:51.040> right<00:00:51.190> post<00:00:51.460> page<00:00:51.699> I<00:00:52.290> see<00:00:53.290> the<00:00:53.409> a<00:00:53.440> store<00:00:53.920> I

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
the right post page I see the a store I

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.920 
the right post page I see the a store I
see<00:00:54.400> categories<00:00:55.089> and<00:00:55.299> stuff<00:00:55.479> like<00:00:55.659> that<00:00:55.900> so

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
see categories and stuff like that so

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.950 
see categories and stuff like that so
that's<00:00:56.379> that<00:00:57.159> doesn't<00:00:57.519> exactly<00:00:57.790> work<00:00:58.000> I<00:00:58.420> could

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
that's that doesn't exactly work I could

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.359 
that's that doesn't exactly work I could
also<00:00:59.140> just<00:00:59.379> type<00:00:59.920> in<00:01:00.220> the<00:01:00.820> domain<00:01:01.030> name<00:01:01.540> and

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.550 
so for instance if I want to put in an
image<00:01:58.719> into<00:01:59.590> this<00:01:59.950> post<00:02:01.170> normally<00:02:02.170> what<00:02:02.439> you

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
image into this post normally what you

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.200 
image into this post normally what you
would<00:02:02.590> do<00:02:02.859> is<00:02:03.130> you<00:02:03.340> would<00:02:03.369> do<00:02:03.609> this<00:02:03.819> and<00:02:04.090> then

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
would do is you would do this and then

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.669 
would do is you would do this and then
you<00:02:04.270> would<00:02:04.389> type<00:02:04.600> in<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:04.869> address<00:02:05.079> of<00:02:05.530> the

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
you would type in the address of the

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.430 
you would type in the address of the
image<00:02:06.100> but<00:02:06.729> I<00:02:07.060> don't<00:02:07.329> like<00:02:07.450> to<00:02:07.600> do<00:02:07.719> that<00:02:07.899> so

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
image but I don't like to do that so

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.030 
image but I don't like to do that so
what<00:02:08.800> i<00:02:08.830> do<00:02:08.979> is<00:02:09.369> i<00:02:09.520> type<00:02:09.729> in<00:02:09.940> RM<00:02:10.360> i<00:02:10.539> and<00:02:11.379> it<00:02:11.799> gives

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
what i do is i type in RM i and it gives

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.010 
what i do is i type in RM i and it gives
me<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.400> basics

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
me the basics

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.400 
me the basics
the<00:02:14.650> basic<00:02:15.340> code<00:02:15.490> for<00:02:15.730> an<00:02:15.790> image<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.480> in<00:02:17.260> this

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
the basic code for an image and in this

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.210 
the basic code for an image and in this
case<00:02:17.770> I<00:02:18.100> want<00:02:18.520> to<00:02:18.610> use<00:02:19.500> an<00:02:20.500> image<00:02:20.740> called<00:02:21.040> the

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
case I want to use an image called the

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.410 
case I want to use an image called the
safe<00:02:21.520> JPEG<00:02:22.030> because<00:02:22.240> I'm<00:02:22.390> doing<00:02:22.570> a<00:02:22.930> post<00:02:23.740> about

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
safe JPEG because I'm doing a post about

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.200 
safe JPEG because I'm doing a post about
safes<00:02:25.420> and<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:27.310> let's<00:02:27.550> just<00:02:27.790> look<00:02:27.940> at<00:02:28.090> the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
safes and so let's just look at the

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.760 
safes and so let's just look at the
preview<00:02:28.690> in<00:02:28.900> a<00:02:28.990> new<00:02:29.140> tab<00:02:29.590> and<00:02:31.590> there<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:32.680> is

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
preview in a new tab and there it is

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.820 
preview in a new tab and there it is
there's<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.430> picture<00:02:33.610> of<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.450> safe<00:02:34.830> the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
there's the picture of the safe the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.140 
there's the picture of the safe the
other<00:02:35.950> thing<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:36.220> I've<00:02:36.430> plugged<00:02:36.730> into<00:02:36.910> this

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
other thing that I've plugged into this

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.200 
other thing that I've plugged into this
software<00:02:37.540> is<00:02:37.960> the<00:02:38.650> ability<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:39.070> do<00:02:40.060> an

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
software is the ability to do an

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.080 
software is the ability to do an
unordered<00:02:40.780> and<00:02:41.050> ordered<00:02:41.260> lists<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.400> ok<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:42.760> if

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
unordered and ordered lists and ok so if

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.660 
unordered and ordered lists and ok so if
you're<00:02:43.240> if<00:02:43.450> you're<00:02:43.480> used<00:02:44.410> to<00:02:44.500> blogging<00:02:44.770> what

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
you're if you're used to blogging what

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.030 
you're if you're used to blogging what
you<00:02:45.790> would<00:02:46.210> normally<00:02:46.360> do<00:02:46.750> is<00:02:47.170> you<00:02:47.440> would<00:02:47.560> hit

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
you would normally do is you would hit

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.590 
you would normally do is you would hit
that<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.630> ok<00:02:49.630> let<00:02:49.780> me<00:02:49.810> try<00:02:50.020> that<00:02:50.080> again<00:02:51.600> you

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
that and ok let me try that again you

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.620 
that and ok let me try that again you
would<00:02:52.750> hit<00:02:53.070> list<00:02:54.070> and<00:02:54.550> you<00:02:54.790> would<00:02:54.940> type<00:02:55.150> in<00:02:55.390> the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
would hit list and you would type in the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.230 
would hit list and you would type in the
list<00:02:56.110> title<00:02:56.410> so<00:02:56.800> this<00:02:57.010> is<00:02:57.220> like<00:02:57.640> number<00:02:57.850> one

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
list title so this is like number one

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.690 
list title so this is like number one
and<00:02:58.690> then<00:02:59.080> you<00:02:59.200> would<00:02:59.350> close<00:02:59.709> the<00:03:00.100> close<00:03:00.670> the

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
and then you would close the close the

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.020 
and then you would close the close the
code<00:03:01.530> on<00:03:02.530> the<00:03:02.590> other<00:03:02.800> hand<00:03:03.250> if<00:03:03.580> you're<00:03:03.760> using

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
code on the other hand if you're using

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.880 
code on the other hand if you're using
the<00:03:04.300> software<00:03:04.750> my<00:03:04.990> all-time<00:03:05.200> favorite

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
the software my all-time favorite

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.830 
the software my all-time favorite
software<00:03:06.370> you<00:03:06.580> could<00:03:06.760> plug<00:03:06.970> in<00:03:07.180> as<00:03:07.420> something

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
software you could plug in as something

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.830 
software you could plug in as something
like<00:03:09.270> this

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
like this

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.260 
like this
and<00:03:10.930> have<00:03:11.709> all<00:03:12.070> the<00:03:12.250> code<00:03:12.430> that<00:03:12.459> you<00:03:12.670> need<00:03:12.700> to

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
and have all the code that you need to

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.600 
and have all the code that you need to
build<00:03:13.420> an<00:03:13.600> ordered<00:03:13.870> list<00:03:13.950> see<00:03:14.950> this<00:03:15.130> ordered

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
build an ordered list see this ordered

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.900 
build an ordered list see this ordered
list<00:03:15.880> I<00:03:16.300> can<00:03:16.750> also<00:03:17.020> do<00:03:17.500> an<00:03:17.800> unordered<00:03:18.250> list<00:03:18.310> if

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
list I can also do an unordered list if

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.750 
list I can also do an unordered list if
I<00:03:19.060> do<00:03:20.400> this

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
I do this

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.410 
I do this
so<00:03:22.030> there's<00:03:22.269> your<00:03:22.450> unordered<00:03:22.989> list<00:03:23.730> so<00:03:24.730> that's

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
so there's your unordered list so that's

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.080 
so there's your unordered list so that's
that's<00:03:25.930> the<00:03:26.350> you<00:03:27.190> know<00:03:27.310> some<00:03:27.580> basic<00:03:28.060> things

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
that's the you know some basic things

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.300 
that's the you know some basic things
but<00:03:28.420> I<00:03:28.780> actually<00:03:29.080> like<00:03:29.440> it<00:03:29.650> because<00:03:29.920> I<00:03:30.040> can<00:03:30.190> do

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
but I actually like it because I can do

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.920 
but I actually like it because I can do
a<00:03:30.340> whole<00:03:30.550> lot<00:03:30.790> of<00:03:30.820> typing<00:03:31.180> in<00:03:31.300> a<00:03:31.390> very<00:03:31.690> short

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
a whole lot of typing in a very short

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.180 
a whole lot of typing in a very short
period<00:03:32.050> of<00:03:32.320> time<00:03:32.380> and<00:03:32.709> one<00:03:32.830> of<00:03:32.920> the<00:03:32.980> things

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
period of time and one of the things

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.740 
period of time and one of the things
that<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:33.400> do<00:03:33.489> here<00:03:33.850> I've<00:03:33.940> just<00:03:33.970> got<00:03:34.269> moved<00:03:34.450> over

let's<00:04:11.590> take<00:04:12.130> a<00:04:12.430> look<00:04:12.760> at<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.209> software<00:04:13.600> itself

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
let's take a look at the software itself

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:16.440 
let's take a look at the software itself
it<00:04:14.380> is<00:04:14.440> called<00:04:14.830> perfect<00:04:15.100> keyword<00:04:15.370> keep<00:04:15.850> board

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
it is called perfect keyword keep board

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.930 
it is called perfect keyword keep board
pro<00:04:17.019> and<00:04:17.500> like<00:04:18.100> I<00:04:18.190> said<00:04:18.370> I've<00:04:18.459> been<00:04:18.580> using<00:04:18.729> it

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
pro and like I said I've been using it

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.670 
pro and like I said I've been using it
for<00:04:18.970> years<00:04:19.299> and<00:04:19.479> what's<00:04:19.900> really<00:04:20.080> cool<00:04:20.350> is<00:04:20.410> that

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
for years and what's really cool is that

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.159 
for years and what's really cool is that
it's<00:04:21.010> so<00:04:21.430> easy<00:04:21.459> to

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
it's so easy to

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.709 
it's so easy to
to<00:04:23.710> add<00:04:23.860> a<00:04:23.889> macro<00:04:24.550> and<00:04:24.819> that's<00:04:25.330> what<00:04:25.479> all<00:04:25.599> those

00:04:25.709 --> 00:04:25.719 
to add a macro and that's what all those

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:28.320 
to add a macro and that's what all those
things<00:04:25.930> are<00:04:26.080> called<00:04:26.259> or<00:04:26.500> macros<00:04:27.330> actually

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
things are called or macros actually

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.140

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
this in the macro definition box this is

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.379 
this in the macro definition box this is
you<00:04:56.199> just<00:04:56.409> type<00:04:56.830> this<00:04:57.009> in<00:04:57.279> to<00:04:57.550> get<00:04:57.669> the<00:04:57.879> the

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
say the address bar is called the

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.909 
say the address bar is called the
trigger<00:05:05.889> so<00:05:06.370> in<00:05:06.639> my<00:05:06.819> case<00:05:06.879> I<00:05:07.330> use<00:05:07.599> slash<00:05:08.379> RM

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
trigger so in my case I use slash RM

post to get to that page and the macro

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.399 
post to get to that page and the macro
itself<00:05:11.830> is<00:05:12.129> the<00:05:12.370> URL<00:05:12.819> of<00:05:12.969> that<00:05:13.150> page<00:05:13.419> and<00:05:13.810> you

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
I've built a list of different macros

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.760 
I've built a list of different macros
and<00:05:20.219> it<00:05:21.219> just<00:05:21.629> seriously<00:05:22.629> it<00:05:22.810> just<00:05:22.840> makes<00:05:23.349> my
