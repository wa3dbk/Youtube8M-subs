 responsible for a child of my or end by 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.530
 please let me know leave comments 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.240
 here below and therefore equal and can be 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.810
 bad candidates perfect for a son 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.810
 It's ok 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.729
 although firstly it is very important 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.789
 that when we get up the first thing 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.890
 let's go wash our face myself 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.860
 I recommend you use a soap 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.929
 oats right now I personally am 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.030
 using another soap but I've been 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.490
 using oatmeal soap all 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:49.130
 mornings for 10 years and it has 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.130
 worked very well is super good 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.610
 although the second step would be first 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.670
 before going out to expose yourself to the sun is 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.310
 necessary to apply a sunscreen on 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.399
 this case that I use this from elisabeth 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.039
 arden is very good is the factor 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:11.050
 sun protection 30 ok 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.630
 well the girls sometimes usually 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.110
 does not use a sunscreen because they say 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:21.400
 that your makeup attracts a solar factor 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.410
 of 10 or of 15 good what does 10 mean 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.050
 or 15 strings and I bring a diaz 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.650
 it means that you are protecting yourself 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.650
 6 minutes if it says 15 is protecting 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.610
 by 150 in this case that I use as 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.230
 is this sun protection factor of 30 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.420
 it means that it is protecting me 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:45.040
 for 300 minutes which I think 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.690
 It is more convenient because our 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.080
 activities usually when leaving 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.600
 house are not of one or two hours with 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.900
 regular let's go to work we perform to 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.210
 the 6 8 hours then I think it would be 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.490
 much better at least have a 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.120
 sunscreen that covers them a little 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.120
 more than time 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.480
 that the next step is once for the 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.200
 week I recommend you expose yourself in 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.380
 his skin on his face I use this 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.110
 exfoliating santay I have fallen very 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.720
 well in my face and the truth has 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:24.670
 helped a lot to reduce the size the 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.640
 appearance of my pores have 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.370
 minimized enough and I'm going to 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.500
 recommend something this what I do is 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.900
 when after I'm at the 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.140
 exfoliation let the product work 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.110
 about three minutes and now to remove it 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.200
 the skin is very soft it is also not 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:46.480
 very expensive this costs less than 100 pesos 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.430
 in the super 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.780
 and it's great I recommend them 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.790
 I have used it extensively for years 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.940
 then it is important that when 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.980
 Exfoliate your skin as you will open the 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.190
 pores because you're taking out all the 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:06.370
 impurities is very important that you are 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.590
 a facial lotion to close again 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.129
 the pores in this case I'm going to 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.530
 show this arrangement because in fact it is 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.590
 the one that I use can also be 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.350
 very rich and leave the texture of the skin 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.810
 the really beautiful truth in this case I 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.060
 I'm using this for my kind of 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:28.330
 skin my skin type is usually 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.949
 mixed but obviously to this this 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.720
 same facial installation product 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.060
 you just have to look for it depending 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.660
 the needs of your skin in this case 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.660
 your skin type 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:43.620
 also one more beloved the afternoon is going 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:46.199
 to fall very well to your face is also 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.969
 you can apply it once a week and 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:49.830
 good what you can do is if you already 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:52.080
 use this is today your 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.400
 exfoliation equal and can be a day 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.289
 later I am going to show you the 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.780
 hydrating mask that I use is 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:03.260
 the exam late 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.550
 that is great it feels like 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.620
 cool as if you were putting 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:09.750
 increases in the face and when the 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.450
 Rinse up the lines of expression 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.630
 they begin to blur and you feel 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:18.240
 intense super soft skin in this case 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.490

 and this the truth would not know to be is 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:28.800
 exactly the price I calculate that 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.630
 must be between 300 350 pesos of 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.970
 fact is the American version of 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:36.560

 before exposing ourselves to the sun is very 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:20.760
