00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:55.419 
going for perfection that looks pretty

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:57.149 
going for perfection that looks pretty
good<00:02:55.540> I'm<00:02:56.109> going<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:56.319> let<00:02:56.469> this<00:02:56.620> dry<00:02:56.889> fully

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
good I'm going to let this dry fully

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.009 
good I'm going to let this dry fully
it's<00:02:57.400> usually<00:02:57.669> about<00:02:57.760> 10<00:02:58.030> or<00:02:58.209> 15<00:02:58.299> minutes<00:02:58.719> and

it's usually about 10 or 15 minutes and

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.390 
it's usually about 10 or 15 minutes and
once<00:02:59.199> it's<00:02:59.349> fully<00:02:59.560> dry<00:02:59.799> then<00:03:00.040> you<00:03:00.129> can<00:03:00.250> figure

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
once it's fully dry then you can figure

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.339 
once it's fully dry then you can figure

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
into a container that has water in it we

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:40.750 
into a container that has water in it we
want<00:04:39.320> this<00:04:39.440> to<00:04:39.620> be<00:04:39.770> milky<00:04:40.190> because<00:04:40.639> we're

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
want this to be milky because we're

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.719 
want this to be milky because we're
going<00:04:40.880> to<00:04:40.940> rely<00:04:41.210> on<00:04:41.510> that<00:04:41.810> water<00:04:42.199> oil<00:04:42.729> duality

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
going to rely on that water oil duality

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:46.210 
going to rely on that water oil duality
to<00:04:44.270> create<00:04:44.570> our<00:04:44.720> effect<00:04:45.110> and<00:04:45.500> this<00:04:46.010> doesn't

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.220 
to create our effect and this doesn't

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.439 
to create our effect and this doesn't
have<00:04:46.370> to<00:04:46.430> be<00:04:46.520> perfect<00:04:46.940> you<00:04:47.000> can<00:04:47.150> add<00:04:47.270> more

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
have to be perfect you can add more

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.570 
have to be perfect you can add more
water<00:04:47.630> or<00:04:47.810> more<00:04:48.169> paint<00:04:48.410> as<00:04:48.560> you<00:04:48.770> go<00:04:48.919> just<00:04:49.490> like

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
water or more paint as you go just like

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.920 
water or more paint as you go just like
we<00:04:49.729> did<00:04:49.790> before<00:04:49.940> you're<00:04:50.330> going<00:04:50.449> to<00:04:50.510> loosely

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
we did before you're going to loosely

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.730 
we did before you're going to loosely
brush<00:04:51.880> this<00:04:52.880> over<00:04:53.240> the<00:04:53.360> entire<00:04:53.720> crate<00:04:54.410> and

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
brush this over the entire crate and

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.650 
brush this over the entire crate and
you'll<00:04:55.400> see<00:04:55.610> because<00:04:55.820> what<00:04:56.210> we're<00:04:56.330> putting<00:04:56.479> on

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
you'll see because what we're putting on

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.659 
you'll see because what we're putting on
top<00:04:56.900> of<00:04:57.080> the<00:04:57.199> oil<00:04:57.380> is<00:04:57.770> water-based<00:04:58.190> that<00:04:58.580> it

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
top of the oil is water-based that it

00:04:58.669 --> 00:04:59.980 
top of the oil is water-based that it
will<00:04:58.790> start<00:04:59.000> to<00:04:59.090> bead<00:04:59.419> and<00:04:59.630> create<00:04:59.870> this

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
will start to bead and create this

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.940 
will start to bead and create this
really<00:05:00.260> cool<00:05:01.240> rustic<00:05:02.240> salty<00:05:03.020> texture<00:05:03.500> this

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
really cool rustic salty texture this

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.379 
really cool rustic salty texture this
last<00:05:04.250> code<00:05:04.550> is<00:05:04.669> actually<00:05:04.790> going<00:05:05.030> to<00:05:05.150> take<00:05:05.270> the

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:05.389 
last code is actually going to take the

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:06.820 
last code is actually going to take the
longest<00:05:05.780> to<00:05:05.960> dry<00:05:06.139> and<00:05:06.200> will<00:05:06.440> probably<00:05:06.710> take

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
longest to dry and will probably take

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.400 
longest to dry and will probably take
about<00:05:06.979> 15<00:05:07.520> or<00:05:07.700> 20<00:05:07.820> minutes<00:05:08.000> to<00:05:08.389> set<00:05:08.600> up<00:05:08.630> you

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
about 15 or 20 minutes to set up you

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.140 
about 15 or 20 minutes to set up you
don't<00:05:09.560> have<00:05:09.710> to<00:05:09.860> be<00:05:09.979> completely<00:05:10.490> dry<00:05:10.790> to<00:05:10.850> go<00:05:11.030> on

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
don't have to be completely dry to go on

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.570 
don't have to be completely dry to go on
to<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.360> next<00:05:11.389> step<00:05:11.780> however<00:05:12.130> the<00:05:13.130> water-based

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
to the next step however the water-based

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.090 
to the next step however the water-based
paint<00:05:14.240> is<00:05:14.389> going<00:05:14.690> to<00:05:14.930> light<00:05:15.260> in<00:05:15.500> slightly<00:05:15.830> as

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
paint is going to light in slightly as

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.070 
paint is going to light in slightly as
it<00:05:16.250> dries<00:05:16.460> and<00:05:16.669> so<00:05:16.790> you<00:05:16.880> may<00:05:17.090> want<00:05:17.300> to<00:05:17.389> add<00:05:17.510> more

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
it dries and so you may want to add more

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.960 
it dries and so you may want to add more
in<00:05:18.380> a<00:05:18.470> second<00:05:18.860> coat<00:05:19.039> before<00:05:19.310> you<00:05:19.580> peel<00:05:19.760> off<00:05:19.789> the

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
in a second coat before you peel off the

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:21.700 
in a second coat before you peel off the
letters<00:05:20.270> I'm<00:05:20.840> happy<00:05:21.200> with<00:05:21.410> the<00:05:21.530> way<00:05:21.590> this

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
letters I'm happy with the way this

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:22.659 
letters I'm happy with the way this
looks<00:05:21.770> so<00:05:22.039> I'm<00:05:22.100> going<00:05:22.220> to<00:05:22.280> peel<00:05:22.400> off<00:05:22.490> my

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
looks so I'm going to peel off my

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:25.360 
looks so I'm going to peel off my
letters<00:05:22.940> you<00:05:23.720> can<00:05:23.870> see<00:05:24.139> as<00:05:24.350> we<00:05:24.500> peel<00:05:24.770> these

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
letters you can see as we peel these

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.460 
letters you can see as we peel these
away<00:05:25.699> that<00:05:26.150> we<00:05:26.240> have<00:05:26.449> a<00:05:26.479> little<00:05:26.900> bit<00:05:27.110> of<00:05:27.139> the

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
away that we have a little bit of the

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.200 
away that we have a little bit of the
gray<00:05:27.680> paint<00:05:27.979> which<00:05:28.130> was<00:05:28.310> our<00:05:28.430> oil<00:05:28.669> base<00:05:28.940> layer

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
gray paint which was our oil base layer

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.600 
gray paint which was our oil base layer
that<00:05:29.840> seeped<00:05:30.229> underneath<00:05:30.410> and<00:05:30.950> that's<00:05:31.070> normal

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
that seeped underneath and that's normal

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:32.950 
that seeped underneath and that's normal
because<00:05:31.880> we're<00:05:32.120> working<00:05:32.389> with<00:05:32.479> unfinished

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
because we're working with unfinished

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.110 
because we're working with unfinished
wood<00:05:33.350> and<00:05:33.710> because<00:05:34.220> it's<00:05:34.400> an<00:05:34.520> oil-based<00:05:34.880> stain

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
wood and because it's an oil-based stain

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.480 
wood and because it's an oil-based stain
it's<00:05:35.539> sort<00:05:35.750> of<00:05:35.840> meant<00:05:36.050> to<00:05:36.200> do<00:05:36.320> that<00:05:36.350> so<00:05:37.250> our

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
it's sort of meant to do that so our

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.190 
it's sort of meant to do that so our
final<00:05:37.669> layer<00:05:37.970> is<00:05:38.150> going<00:05:38.360> to<00:05:38.450> be<00:05:38.570> to<00:05:38.870> touch<00:05:39.020> up

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
final layer is going to be to touch up

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.740 
final layer is going to be to touch up
our<00:05:39.350> letters<00:05:39.850> you<00:05:40.850> may<00:05:40.970> be<00:05:41.030> totally<00:05:41.450> fine<00:05:41.690> with

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
our letters you may be totally fine with

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.200 
our letters you may be totally fine with
these<00:05:42.200> really<00:05:42.620> distressed<00:05:43.160> letters<00:05:43.610> as<00:05:43.820> is

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
a bit so they're a little crisper on the

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.420 
a bit so they're a little crisper on the
edge<00:05:47.630> going<00:05:48.289> back<00:05:48.590> to<00:05:48.740> my<00:05:48.860> original<00:05:48.950> paint

sleep<00:06:13.700> swim<00:06:13.780> repeat<00:06:14.780> which<00:06:15.050> i<00:06:15.139> think<00:06:15.200> is<00:06:15.380> very

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
sleep swim repeat which i think is very

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:17.589 
sleep swim repeat which i think is very
appropriate<00:06:15.830> for<00:06:16.099> a<00:06:16.340> summer<00:06:16.700> house<00:06:16.970> or<00:06:17.360> just<00:06:17.389> a

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 
appropriate for a summer house or just a

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:19.390 
appropriate for a summer house or just a
beach<00:06:17.780> cottage<00:06:18.229> you<00:06:18.710> can<00:06:18.830> see<00:06:18.979> this<00:06:19.099> has<00:06:19.160> the

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
beach cottage you can see this has the

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.969 
beach cottage you can see this has the
same<00:06:19.639> technique<00:06:20.180> but<00:06:20.660> just<00:06:20.930> depending<00:06:21.380> on<00:06:21.560> how

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:21.979 
same technique but just depending on how

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:23.589 
same technique but just depending on how
much<00:06:22.190> white<00:06:22.610> you<00:06:22.789> do<00:06:22.970> at<00:06:23.090> the<00:06:23.180> end<00:06:23.210> you<00:06:23.510> get

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 
much white you do at the end you get

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.029 
much white you do at the end you get
kind<00:06:23.840> of<00:06:23.900> different<00:06:24.320> effects<00:06:24.590> so<00:06:24.770> something

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 
kind of different effects so something

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:26.560 
kind of different effects so something
that<00:06:25.160> you<00:06:25.250> can<00:06:25.400> really<00:06:25.520> play<00:06:25.789> with<00:06:25.940> you<00:06:26.450> could

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:26.570 
that you can really play with you could

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.150 
that you can really play with you could
also<00:06:26.690> do<00:06:26.870> this<00:06:26.960> in<00:06:27.020> a<00:06:27.200> dark<00:06:27.410> green<00:06:27.740> but<00:06:28.130> I

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
also do this in a dark green but I

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.740 
also do this in a dark green but I
wanted<00:06:28.430> to<00:06:28.610> kind<00:06:28.729> of<00:06:28.849> evoke<00:06:29.120> those<00:06:29.419> lake

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
wanted to kind of evoke those lake

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:31.810 
wanted to kind of evoke those lake
colors<00:06:30.229> or<00:06:30.500> watercolors<00:06:31.130> so<00:06:31.400> I<00:06:31.430> stuck<00:06:31.639> with

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:31.820 
colors or watercolors so I stuck with

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.719 
colors or watercolors so I stuck with
the<00:06:31.910> dark<00:06:32.150> blue<00:06:32.470> for<00:06:33.470> an<00:06:33.530> easier<00:06:34.099> version<00:06:34.190> of

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:34.729 
the dark blue for an easier version of

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:36.730 
the dark blue for an easier version of
this<00:06:34.849> you<00:06:35.060> could<00:06:35.180> just<00:06:35.360> take<00:06:35.599> a<00:06:35.630> canvas<00:06:36.409> and

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
this you could just take a canvas and

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.050 
this you could just take a canvas and
this<00:06:37.159> one<00:06:37.310> happens<00:06:37.520> to<00:06:37.789> be

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
this one happens to be

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.330 
this one happens to be
denim<00:06:38.419> so<00:06:38.660> my<00:06:38.810> dark<00:06:39.050> color<00:06:39.290> is<00:06:39.650> already<00:06:40.190> on

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
denim so my dark color is already on

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.000 
denim so my dark color is already on
there<00:06:40.639> I<00:06:40.910> placed<00:06:41.419> my<00:06:41.810> adhesive<00:06:42.139> vinyl<00:06:42.740> letters

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:43.010 
there I placed my adhesive vinyl letters

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:45.129 
there I placed my adhesive vinyl letters
just<00:06:43.190> like<00:06:43.370> we<00:06:43.460> did<00:06:43.550> on<00:06:43.610> the<00:06:43.880> crate<00:06:44.480> and<00:06:44.780> then<00:06:45.020> I

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139 
just like we did on the crate and then I

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.620 
just like we did on the crate and then I
just<00:06:45.290> simply<00:06:45.560> brushed<00:06:46.460> white<00:06:46.850> paint<00:06:47.180> on<00:06:47.330> top

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:47.630 
just simply brushed white paint on top

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.510 
just simply brushed white paint on top
so<00:06:47.840> that's<00:06:48.020> only<00:06:48.230> one<00:06:48.620> single<00:06:49.100> layer<00:06:49.280> and

00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:49.520 
so that's only one single layer and

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.040 
so that's only one single layer and
you're<00:06:49.639> not<00:06:49.760> dealing<00:06:49.970> with<00:06:50.210> the<00:06:50.360> oil<00:06:50.510> paint<00:06:50.900> at

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.050 
you're not dealing with the oil paint at

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.440 
you're not dealing with the oil paint at
all<00:06:51.260> and<00:06:51.650> you<00:06:52.460> can<00:06:52.610> use<00:06:52.730> a<00:06:52.760> ruler<00:06:53.030> if<00:06:53.300> you're

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:53.450 
all and you can use a ruler if you're

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.330 
all and you can use a ruler if you're
worried<00:06:53.750> about<00:06:53.870> lining<00:06:54.440> these<00:06:54.530> up<00:06:54.590> exactly

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340 
worried about lining these up exactly

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:56.800 
worried about lining these up exactly
but<00:06:55.550> the<00:06:55.610> canvas<00:06:55.970> is<00:06:56.120> another<00:06:56.389> great<00:06:56.630> option

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
but the canvas is another great option

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:07.170 
but the canvas is another great option
for<00:06:57.080> doing<00:06:57.440> type<00:06:57.770> based<00:06:58.100> seasonal<00:06:58.580> wall<00:06:58.730> decor

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.180 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.240 

you
