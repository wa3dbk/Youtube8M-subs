00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.480
 responsible status of the site is well 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:24.190
 aisle of the grading garment I 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.890
 look at the quality of the finishes of the 

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.360
 clothing that is important 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.590
 interesting because at least we see 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.059
 the whole record of a block I won in 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.420
 efficiency because I receive 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:40.739
 things are more consistent before and 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.739
 it's already wonderful 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:59.170
 the decision all the same he has some 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.079
 trifles for example all the time and 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.869
 dirt marc gini the aspo an enemy to 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.880
 every race before we had 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.250
 not this synthetic visibility we had 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.950
 a great improvement has been built 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.490
 our production price throughout the 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.590
 development 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.600
 I have time to act where I am in 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.369
 time to act to correct for 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.080
 achieve either goal for 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:21.490
 production we won 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.140
 at least two or three weeks this is 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.880
 also something very good 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.650
 selling helene we feel good that at the 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.450
 internal level it allows a flow 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.770
 information that clarifies relationships 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.190
 with suppliers who have a record 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.260
 which should allow them to start the 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.240
 production without returning emails from 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.070
 questions as we have the same elements 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.530
 at the same time for my all the follow up of the 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.950
 product from birth to 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.690
 production 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.950
 previously this ode to e-mails had 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.950
 unstuck stops 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.040
 today we can more as 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.940
 product manager spend a day without 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.320
 open full 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.450
 it allows us to be kept informed 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.340
 deadlines that allow us to 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.230
 to know better our priorities is more 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.460
 easy for management teams to 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.460
 see where there is a concern
