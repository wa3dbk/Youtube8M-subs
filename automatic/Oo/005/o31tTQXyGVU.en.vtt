00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.480
 franky a win over the owl how 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:12.120
 have you experienced the market? 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.680
 yes positive and that means that we are 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.520
 yes it is a club with one with the 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.020
 history we are also not in the 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.910
 so best position when you come here 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.260
 it is a piece with uncertainty you 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.550
 are curious 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.859
 I had the impression that we got it from us 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.970
 shake off route start signal first 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.470
 quarter 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.630
 that two and if we can still score 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.449
 for peace without also a big one 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.870
 problems come then yes then then does 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:38.309
 this good and maybe have temple true 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.110
 no longer give up tight 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.479
 held in the 2nd half it becomes them 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.739
 designs or what better in the competition 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:45.299
 came 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.059
 but to the end how can we 

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:50.970
 we on new yes the from the ball or 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.710
 what more opportunities we create or score 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.610
 fourth goal so we hang out with giant 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.799
 a 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.690
 feeling at the foot gives confidence 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:01.860
 so much for the competition 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.269
 naturally different things it was 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.430
 of course important that here that here 

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:06.810
 today to start a watch bad 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.079
 have in the league as those 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.149
 today also on design then it is 

00:01:10.079 --> 00:01:13.890
 not good but we have a good one 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.259
 give a signal on charleroi but that me 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.180
 believe that we are well back in with ten people 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.350
 the margin have come if you are today 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.030
 can win 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.729
 do you have a better feel and I 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.770
 think that we must then take it 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.109
 the continuation of the competition 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.929
 try to finish well coach 0 2 after 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:34.530
 fifteen minutes then it becomes more difficult 

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:38.640
 yes quarter had been quite a lot 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.689
 overwhelmed by the team and me 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.229
 have to say they had no where 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.820
 thought 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.530
 we thought we were a little more busy 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.789
 come forward , but we left that 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:51.359
 to to we get almost two 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:53.100
 identical kools at values true 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:55.109
 actually where it is actually not possible 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.909
 with us by ashes so yes we are concerned 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:58.740
 that was not good in you see also the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.829
 Cleverness of first class teams 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.859
 from our second class team 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.810
 but okay well you have to go beyond is 208 

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:08.500
 there then still gets the chance actually with 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.240
 on two he with a ruffle 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.160
 and yes if it goes in it yes you can 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.020
 know yourself can do it I can do one too 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.040
 very different feeling and the team coming 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.360
 on the other hand, it immediately becomes 3 0 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.510
 yes then you actually know the be 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.280
 a difficult story and yes then you go 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.840
 take a rest and of course try something 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.420
 change it and try some waste 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.790
 start playing and even more pressure for it 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.280
 exercise on the opponent well that 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.270
 is reasonably successful and we get it 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.220
 it possibilities 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.959
 I must say yes you see 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.180
 in the completion that the difference 1st and 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.040
 2nd class is such and that 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.459
 it is to our disadvantage of course there 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.410
 and that with their yes but I cancel one 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.239
 the two is a cabbage and with us it is 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.520
 just another women 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.590
 yes i have to say it's thing right 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.770
 that we are empty-handed here and that 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:02.560
 she must go on waregem 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:04.780
 so congratulations man okay ask 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.420
 rudy shame you think a cup that 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:12.160
 I thought it would be a shame because I had 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.290
 hoped in advance and even thought we 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.820
 could offer more resistance 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.330
 to salty 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.320
 unfortunately we did not succeed but okay we 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.750
 must now continue 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.200
 and now the competition is coming back 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.840
 And yes, I am really looking forward to it 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.100
 to bite my teeth again but yes me 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.959
 would have liked for the club of course 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.790
 that we went one round further but it 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.260
 Unfortunately, that did not become what we thought of 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.370
 hoped no had no system with 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.409
 two places and then that works 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.970
 but it works in the sense that we are 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:46.840
 solutions searching for that 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:49.239
 blind that we we today 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.519
 15th place and we 're not going 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.650
 well off the starting blocks and we 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.930
 of course a bit behind 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.040
 we try to find their solutions 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.450
 and that of course it was 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.730
 stories right in my past year 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.250
 if you tap the sixteenth finals 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.900
 last year we could be repeat 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.959
 but allow us to 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.010
 yes a lot of basic players not to be 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.299
 set 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.950
 okay maybe machine at the end 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.810
 need the habibou or comes a lot 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.950
 set today but could now we're in 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.389
 a situation that we cannot do that 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.889
 So that's why we actually 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.299
 with the 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.979
 have the strongest team they have 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.330
 played and that we 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.070
 yes we might be a bit one 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.710
 to have brought a little variety to 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.240
 our system because I think we will 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.010
 need that we can quickly 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.240
 switch to the 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.770
 yes you were nothing but us 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.669
 For example, a certain feel better 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.600
 margin 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.220
 this intention to work extremely 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.979
 system is not sacred to me 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.750
 wanting this is is more fun and players must 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.760
 a must give substance to the way 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.710
 of playing football or did not do that with 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.479
 2 strikers one more striker or three strikers 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.130
 do n't make much out of you for all of me 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.530
 you wanted as a coach and your team environment 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.180
 want to win and that is it for me 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.849
 most importantly asked a boy like tony 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:02.129
 because we want to run away his beloved 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:02.129
 the p cremation of that always welcomed 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.689
 peter mothers and 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:08.239
 what do you mean now that was better 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:10.819
 don't lose you look at 

00:05:08.239 --> 00:05:13.069
 another team that did not look at 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:14.479
 other things we are busy we know what 

00:05:13.069 --> 00:05:16.969
 that we have what we have to do we have 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.649
 just some delay and if you like 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:21.619
 fifteenth is the af much and the 

00:05:18.649 --> 00:05:23.989
 crime not nice but i have this week 

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:25.879
 once again viewed everything before it is still 

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:27.919
 all very close together 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:29.659
 We shouldn't panic I think the 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.189
 we clip the last two years 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:33.769
 has drawn a vision that we 

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:35.809
 have to download and it will not always 

00:05:33.769 --> 00:05:37.490
 are like last two years 

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:40.519
 but it's all within the 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.889
 club a challenge to return this club or 

00:05:40.519 --> 00:05:44.599
 to place this team on the rails and 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:46.189
 should not look at baker hmmm me 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:47.539
 I think if the knowledgeable wine 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:51.709
 next cup much 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:53.869
 only in December so that means we 

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:55.669
 still completely October have a November 

00:05:53.869 --> 00:05:57.800
 without finally another metric 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.839
 wedge so we must not be ready 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.119
 professionally we were looking forward to the 

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:03.949
 match because if you had to go week after week 

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:07.129
 play that is 5 or 10 have lost 

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:08.689
 not nice give me but in addition wa 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:10.759
 macho that we come to the rhythm and that we 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:13.070
 winners also become a reacher 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:15.950
 then you say target points 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.600
 very long i have a very good gertjan 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.330
 seen martens 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.640
 stijn the boy who steps marx party 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.710
 every week again and I found the illegal 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.510
 waste you making santos very reasonable 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.930
 play 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:31.640
 and yes the play together like vegetables 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.210
 from acts that are now back 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.350
 gets 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.000
 and i found jan or pebbles one 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.040
 reasonable laws play but there are also 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.740
 with players who are somewhat below level 

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:41.000
 the played and yes if you are that one is the 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.440
 class must play and you 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.870
 julia it not with them all that level the 

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.690
 then to be weld woman but i have 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.910
 seen some bright spots and please 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.350
 heavy is the comes or you have to climb all your 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:53.720
 can 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.490
 or just not me out actually 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.190
 not stijn because the teach those boys who 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.570
 yes we knew 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.450
 first class you will find it difficult 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:04.970
 and I had said before 

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:08.420
 we don't need we don't have to think so 

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:10.820
 that will be the courage and yes we are now 

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:13.340
 disabled and a pity for that 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:15.140
 us but yes we all know that we are now 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.600
 we have to go further and that we just have to 

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:19.840
 go back into competition and then we go 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.840
 also for
