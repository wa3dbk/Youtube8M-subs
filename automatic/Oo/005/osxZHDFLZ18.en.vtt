LSU<00:00:54.600> game<00:00:54.870> which<00:00:55.079> was<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.379> course<00:00:55.500> huge

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949

nationally<00:00:56.760> televised<00:00:57.270> great<00:00:57.660> atmosphere

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
nationally televised great atmosphere

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.549

and<00:00:58.350> at<00:00:59.070> LSU<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.300> think<00:01:00.690> both<00:01:00.870> prospects

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
and at LSU and I think both prospects

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.529 
and at LSU and I think both prospects
right<00:01:02.070> now<00:01:02.250> probably<00:01:02.579> not<00:01:03.090> looking<00:01:03.510> so

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
right now probably not looking so

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.509 
right now probably not looking so
closely<00:01:04.049> at<00:01:04.320> LSU<00:01:04.650> even<00:01:04.920> though<00:01:05.040> they<00:01:05.369> had<00:01:05.489> a

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
closely at LSU even though they had a

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.550 
closely at LSU even though they had a
good<00:01:05.700> trip<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.210> think<00:01:06.930> Florida<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.470> better
