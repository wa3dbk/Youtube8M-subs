insides<00:00:25.910> see-through<00:00:27.320> um<00:00:28.939> yeah<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.380> I'm<00:00:31.380> going

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
insides see-through um yeah so I'm going

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.240 
insides see-through um yeah so I'm going
to<00:00:31.619> show<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:32.059> the<00:00:33.059> differences<00:00:33.510> between<00:00:34.250> this

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
to show you the differences between this

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.490 
to show you the differences between this
which<00:00:35.790> I've<00:00:35.940> already<00:00:36.180> reviewed<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.750> this

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
which I've already reviewed and this

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.940 
which I've already reviewed and this
this<00:00:38.460> came<00:00:38.670> out<00:00:38.820> about<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.450> think<00:00:39.989> judging<00:00:40.829> by

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
this came out about I think judging by

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.700 
this came out about I think judging by
the<00:00:41.010> copyrights<00:00:42.620> like<00:00:45.320> seven<00:00:46.320> years<00:00:46.500> later

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
the copyrights like seven years later

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.069 
the copyrights like seven years later
but<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.489> seems<00:00:47.760> kind<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.030> look<00:00:48.180> but<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.570> I'm

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
but that seems kind of look but I I'm

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:58.840 
but that seems kind of look but I I'm
not<00:00:49.260> really<00:00:49.379> sure<00:00:51.500> look<00:00:52.500> at

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.550 

it's<00:00:59.360> shorter<00:01:00.040> skinnier<00:01:01.040> lighter<00:01:01.960> it's<00:01:02.960> way

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
it's shorter skinnier lighter it's way
