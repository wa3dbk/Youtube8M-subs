 for my mother to put me in the law with three years 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.730

 before you make me understand the registration 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.110
 I started to dance I never stopped I started in classical ballet method 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.580

 after the contemporary Gaddafi clan 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.560
 if contemporary kadafi 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.160
 In a way 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.590
 unusual expected this to happen 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.590
 and I lived in a city and I came to São José 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.590
 I arrived in Sao Jose in 1990 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.140
 very young came in that he adapts to the city accompanied ronaldo 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.220
 a newspaper of great circulation 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.800
 I liked the newspaper 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.230
 the interested stakeholder is 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.290
 nobody knew that this happens in the city truck 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.590
 every seven packs beyond the fields are so interested in knowing your 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.880
 story 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.230
 I picked up a major circulation newspaper and how the laws 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.170
 and a ticket advertisement 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.250
 who drew a lot of attention 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.680
 the omission for dancers and dancers 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.340
 finally had the audition dancers and dancers and a limit of debt said 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.720
 and that's it 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.650
 Claudia Calorio if the internal rate of the house are inscribed to make opposition 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.070
 I was the one who knows what I want because it was not written and it will be contemporary if 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.640
 blow but I went to do 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.150
 I'm in this hearing 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.350
 He is very young and I made the pass 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.090
 the country first 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.000
 and it was an obsession 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 in the first dance group of the cassiano ricardo cultural foundation 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.580
 and it was there that I learned in this contemporary dance 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.160
 It was a shock for me. 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.649
 My whole life was in Bahrain. 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.379
 we draw from 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.399
 put your foot on the floor 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:16.979
 mosaic year percentage 

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:18.809
 and loose arms 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:21.079
 This has changed my mind a lot. 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.009
 was in the brutal transformation 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:24.739
 What happened inside of me? 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.679
 Henrique 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.629
 What I say, my life. 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.529
 because not only to the movement 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:33.249
 but I went to study 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:37.769
 choreographers' day thought and I went to study or double the 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:38.409
 year 

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:39.539
 I went to study 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:41.869
 the tour 

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:46.699
 kazuo ohno the communicated to the organ within the club did not know that existed 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.829
 I discovered that Baosteel knew that there were 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.639
 because the body is in play 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.459
 and a multitude of other groups 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.759
 It's clear why I went through moments 

00:02:58.759 --> 00:03:01.729
 I already thought about stopping dancing. 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:04.649
 I already thought the area should stop dancing 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:06.699
 in the area of ​​networks 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:09.699
 little inspired by lack of support 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:14.969
 then we really think about spending more 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:19.310
 When I spoke to reflect, I preferred that she is a ballet dancer. 

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:21.309
 how to stop 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:24.029
 it was a few years ago I met her 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:26.919
 English 

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.529
 by truck 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:30.540
 she 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.540
 over 90 years dancing 

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:36.749
 it's possible 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:38.759
 she got 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:40.389
 and I think 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.969
 in 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:45.969
 This is what I want for myself 

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:48.479
 I want to arrive 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.839
 inside his house 

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:53.789
 a certain end 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:57.509
 dancing well in a great scandal honestly 

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:59.629
 dancing 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:01.239
 with art 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:02.339
 demonstrating 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:05.269
 on the one hand since I was little 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.269
 dancing mainly to me this way 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.709
 like my body 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.119
 playing 

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:17.769
 without wasting time 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.809
 now 

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:21.999
 the president of the art 

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:24.120
 I think more 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.699
 than 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.870
 lira 32 pirouettes 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.870
 not detracting from the source of the experiment 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.400
 I speak for my case. 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.490
 to dance honestly sheridan stay 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.850
 has a presence 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.110
 in the art 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.340
 I have to learn to play. 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.219
 it's something else 

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:48.189
 quiet that moment 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:50.259
 artistic 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:52.419
 very fast very precious 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.349
 hard to achieve 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.210
 but it's the artistic moment 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.040
 in which a dancer 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.120
 feinstein 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.069
 that art 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:03.639
 cinnamon 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.240
 and the audience aware that it is targeted 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.539
 it's happening on stage 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.860
 amy and efficient and the ballerina feeling art my brother-in-law 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.759
 and the public continues 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.370
 We do not feel this is a very precious moment for me. 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.479
 what a moment 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.659
 that the audience the artist 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:24.800
 has involved the 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.319
 piana art 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:29.569
 I believe it is not simply 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:30.809
 a ballerina 

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:32.349
 and if most 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.110
 this is too little 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.770
 people who are doing it say that it is so 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.770
 that in the neighborhood of the embaré of injury before dancers and dancers are artists 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.040
 so beyond 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.199
 of the exercises 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.449
 the dancers and dancers have to interpret 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:51.949
 and has that artists interpreted 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:53.379
 one of the characters 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:57.219
 and make the headline happen at a show 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.330
 clean it up 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.710
 n is an artistic career 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:09.580
 It's an artistic career so it's not that I knew just the steps is beyond 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.569
 of this 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:12.229
 to join 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:14.330
 changed everything of bear 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.110
 art professionals 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.759
 and it's a career 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:22.099
 What do you have to assume in Brazil? 

00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:24.319
 however with what happens 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:26.529
 like the whole career of a 

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:28.020
 of an art professional 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.999
 In Brazil before 

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:33.279
 little boy ersar 

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:35.610
 It's good when you have this market. 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.169
 keegan 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:38.759
 the dance professionals 

00:06:38.759 --> 00:06:40.650
 now 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.939
 He is a dance student. 

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:47.339
 but young jorginho already has a certainty 

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.800
 that there is something inside 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.619
 talk about what? 

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:55.619
 feminine and feminine are really activists 

00:06:56.559 --> 00:06:58.090
 want to raise the girl 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:59.449
 since yesterday 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:02.520
 I already realized that she is an artist dancer. 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.080
 inevitable will not be able to 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.480
 I understand the secretary. 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.569
 do not reflect a nurse will not succeed 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:12.979
 with as much intensity as any other profession 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:14.699
 because do not have 

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:17.719
 how to get away from it 

00:07:17.719 --> 00:07:20.819
 the more mature artists 

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:24.210
 agree with me that there is no way to escape 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:27.410
 we can do more that is not lacking is what I say 

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.149
 several other actors 

00:07:29.149 --> 00:07:31.319
 theater drama 

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:33.639
 of television dancer 

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:35.089
 comments 

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:38.129
 what was the assessed value 

00:07:38.129 --> 00:07:40.729
 some people may have run away 

00:07:40.729 --> 00:07:43.449
 but it was inevitable 

00:07:43.449 --> 00:07:46.449
 we come back 

00:07:47.539 --> 00:07:49.369
 and that's it 

00:07:49.369 --> 00:07:51.309
 I have to meet 

00:07:51.309 --> 00:07:53.779
 He knows himself, does he know who he is? 

00:07:53.779 --> 00:07:54.379
 and how far is it going
