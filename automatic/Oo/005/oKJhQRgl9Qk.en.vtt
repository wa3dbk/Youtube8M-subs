2<00:00:19.430> 8<00:00:19.670> I<00:00:21.700> really<00:00:22.700> really<00:00:22.940> like<00:00:23.150> to<00:00:23.180> do<00:00:23.510> STV<00:00:24.020> on

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
2 8 I really really like to do STV on

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.100 
2 8 I really really like to do STV on
this<00:00:24.320> one<00:00:24.529> so<00:00:24.890> what<00:00:25.040> I<00:00:25.100> did<00:00:25.250> is<00:00:25.700> I<00:00:25.730> modified<00:00:26.450> the

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
this one so what I did is I modified the

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.770 
this one so what I did is I modified the
brain<00:00:27.380> by<00:00:27.590> changing<00:00:28.130> the<00:00:28.220> motor<00:00:28.460> to<00:00:28.970> a<00:00:29.000> 4<00:00:29.600> s

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:29.780 
brain by changing the motor to a 4 s

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.210 
brain by changing the motor to a 4 s
capable<00:00:30.350> motor<00:00:30.640> propeller<00:00:31.640> to<00:00:32.180> nine-inch

capable motor propeller to nine-inch

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:38.020 
capable motor propeller to nine-inch
sorry<00:00:34.220> 8<00:00:34.400> inch<00:00:34.670> and<00:00:36.370> so<00:00:37.370> now<00:00:37.520> I<00:00:37.550> will<00:00:37.670> be<00:00:37.760> flying

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
sorry 8 inch and so now I will be flying

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.180 
sorry 8 inch and so now I will be flying
with<00:00:38.330> the<00:00:38.420> Prius<00:00:38.780> battery<00:00:39.199> but<00:00:39.860> the<00:00:39.920> thing

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
with the Prius battery but the thing

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.210 
with the Prius battery but the thing
that<00:00:40.370> you<00:00:40.520> want<00:00:40.730> to<00:00:40.879> see<00:00:41.150> is<00:00:41.390> right<00:00:41.750> here<00:00:42.220> as

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
that you want to see is right here as

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.770 
that you want to see is right here as
you<00:00:43.370> can<00:00:43.489> see<00:00:43.730> now<00:00:43.910> we<00:00:43.970> have<00:00:44.120> a<00:00:44.270> little<00:00:44.510> GPS

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
you can see now we have a little GPS

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.430 
you can see now we have a little GPS
here<00:00:45.350> and<00:00:45.520> then<00:00:46.520> look<00:00:47.329> at<00:00:47.540> the<00:00:47.690> size<00:00:48.020> of<00:00:48.260> this

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
here and then look at the size of this

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.180 
here and then look at the size of this
flight<00:00:48.770> controller<00:00:49.570> so<00:00:50.570> this<00:00:51.200> is<00:00:51.350> my<00:00:51.559> Futaba

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190

receiver and this is the size of the
flight<00:00:54.320> controller<00:00:54.710> I<00:00:54.829> just<00:00:55.130> stuck<00:00:55.579> it<00:00:55.760> with<00:00:55.790> a

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:55.940 
flight controller I just stuck it with a

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.410 
flight controller I just stuck it with a
double<00:00:56.300> sided<00:00:56.570> velcro<00:00:56.720> and<00:00:57.760> it<00:00:58.760> says<00:00:59.030> be

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
double sided velcro and it says be

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.900

they<00:01:07.759> wanted<00:01:08.030> to<00:01:08.119> say<00:01:08.300> fly<00:01:08.570> higher<00:01:08.840> now<00:01:09.590> if<00:01:09.890> we

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160 
they wanted to say fly higher now if we

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.310 
they wanted to say fly higher now if we
look<00:01:10.430> at<00:01:10.640> this<00:01:10.789> flight<00:01:11.090> controller<00:01:11.630> from<00:01:12.050> far

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
look at this flight controller from far

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.290 
look at this flight controller from far
assuming<00:01:12.860> you<00:01:12.979> can<00:01:13.190> see<00:01:13.430> we<00:01:13.670> have<00:01:13.820> lr<00:01:14.180> own

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
assuming you can see we have lr own

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.070 
assuming you can see we have lr own
elevator<00:01:15.009> l1<00:01:16.009> and<00:01:16.190> elevator<00:01:16.550> gains<00:01:16.909> then<00:01:17.900> we

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
elevator l1 and elevator gains then we

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.760 
elevator l1 and elevator gains then we
have<00:01:18.320> two<00:01:18.590> switches<00:01:18.799> that<00:01:19.310> can<00:01:19.580> set<00:01:19.970> from

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
have two switches that can set from

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.250 
have two switches that can set from
normal<00:01:21.770> plane<00:01:22.010> to<00:01:22.340> flying<00:01:22.670> wing<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:23.119> Delta<00:01:23.540> we

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
normal plane to flying wing to Delta we

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.469 
normal plane to flying wing to Delta we
tail<00:01:25.070> something<00:01:25.460> something<00:01:25.670> like<00:01:25.700> that<00:01:25.940> then

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
tail something something like that then

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.359 
tail something something like that then
you<00:01:26.600> have<00:01:26.630> a<00:01:26.780> rudder<00:01:26.990> out<00:01:27.260> elevator<00:01:27.860> out<00:01:27.950> and

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
you have a rudder out elevator out and

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.179 
you have a rudder out elevator out and
lol<00:01:28.790> out<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.479> of<00:01:29.840> course<00:01:30.080> elevator<00:01:30.920> and

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
lol out and of course elevator and

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.730 
lol out and of course elevator and
aileron<00:01:31.580> ins<00:01:31.850> with<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.810> rudder<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:33.110> a<00:01:33.350> switch

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
aileron ins with the rudder and a switch

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.130 
aileron ins with the rudder and a switch
for<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.189> flight<00:01:34.430> mode<00:01:34.700> so<00:01:35.360> using<00:01:35.750> this<00:01:35.900> little

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
for the flight mode so using this little

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.310 
for the flight mode so using this little
flight<00:01:36.409> controller<00:01:36.830> you<00:01:37.130> have<00:01:38.080> manual<00:01:39.080> mode

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
flight controller you have manual mode

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.230 
flight controller you have manual mode
then<00:01:39.770> you<00:01:39.890> have<00:01:40.100> an<00:01:40.189> auto<00:01:40.400> stabilization

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
then you have an auto stabilization

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.060 
then you have an auto stabilization
where<00:01:41.450> your<00:01:41.570> plane<00:01:41.780> will<00:01:41.960> be<00:01:41.990> stabilized<00:01:42.680> and

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
where your plane will be stabilized and

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.010 
where your plane will be stabilized and
even<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.729> beginners<00:01:44.150> can<00:01:44.299> fly<00:01:44.570> it<00:01:44.630> very<00:01:44.869> well

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
even the beginners can fly it very well

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.649 
even the beginners can fly it very well
all<00:01:45.290> for<00:01:45.560> fpv<00:01:46.009> it<00:01:46.460> from<00:01:46.700> fly<00:01:46.909> very<00:01:47.060> stabilized

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
all for fpv it from fly very stabilized

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.920 
all for fpv it from fly very stabilized
and<00:01:47.930> or<00:01:48.680> using<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.189> GPS<00:01:49.670> you<00:01:50.150> can<00:01:50.330> set<00:01:50.600> a<00:01:50.630> home

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
and or using the GPS you can set a home

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.289 
and or using the GPS you can set a home
point<00:01:51.229> before<00:01:51.590> taking<00:01:51.890> off<00:01:52.040> and<00:01:52.310> your<00:01:53.060> plane

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
point before taking off and your plane

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.569 
point before taking off and your plane
will<00:01:53.509> auto<00:01:53.750> return<00:01:54.140> to<00:01:54.259> home<00:01:54.439> when<00:01:54.740> if<00:01:54.950> you<00:01:55.340> set

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
will auto return to home when if you set

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.160 
will auto return to home when if you set
the<00:01:55.700> failsafe<00:01:55.939> right<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.689> it<00:01:56.810> goes<00:01:56.930> out<00:01:57.140> of

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
the failsafe right and it goes out of

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.920 
the failsafe right and it goes out of
range<00:01:57.380> or<00:01:57.680> you<00:01:57.880> activate<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.060> art<00:01:59.240> yet<00:01:59.540> so

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
range or you activate the art yet so

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.270 
range or you activate the art yet so
look<00:02:00.259> at<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.500> size<00:02:00.710> of<00:02:00.950> this<00:02:01.070> flight

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
look at the size of this flight

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.280 
look at the size of this flight
controller<00:02:01.759> let's<00:02:02.420> give<00:02:02.689> it<00:02:02.720> a<00:02:02.840> flight<00:02:03.079> and

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
controller let's give it a flight and

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.370 
controller let's give it a flight and
see<00:02:03.710> how<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:03.950> point<00:02:04.250> behaves<00:02:04.610> in<00:02:04.790> the<00:02:04.880> air

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
see how the point behaves in the air

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.949 
see how the point behaves in the air
yes<00:02:06.380> satellites<00:02:06.829> so<00:02:07.640> I'll<00:02:08.209> take<00:02:08.630> off<00:02:08.780> in

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
yes satellites so I'll take off in

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.780 
yes satellites so I'll take off in
manual<00:02:09.320> mode<00:02:09.350> and<00:02:09.649> turn<00:02:10.399> off<00:02:10.579> the

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
manual mode and turn off the

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.110 
manual mode and turn off the
stabilization<00:02:11.480> mode<00:02:11.660> and<00:02:12.019> after<00:02:12.530> that<00:02:12.680> I<00:02:13.280> will

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
stabilization mode and after that I will

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:33.030 
stabilization mode and after that I will
fly<00:02:14.630> and<00:02:14.870> check<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.709> rth

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.940 

manual<00:02:34.040> mode<00:02:34.069> so<00:02:35.030> I<00:02:35.060> can<00:02:35.420> do

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.830 

all<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:39.790> aerobatics<00:02:40.450> okay<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:43.270> turn<00:02:43.630> on

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
all the aerobatics okay and I turn on

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.670 
all the aerobatics okay and I turn on
the<00:02:44.940> stabilization<00:02:45.940> mode<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:47.140> you<00:02:47.230> can<00:02:47.410> see<00:02:47.650> I

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
the stabilization mode and you can see I

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.809 
the stabilization mode and you can see I
can<00:02:48.069> leave<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.459> radio<00:02:49.230> sticks<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:50.530> it's<00:02:51.459> very

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
can leave the radio sticks and it's very

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.020 
can leave the radio sticks and it's very
very<00:02:52.000> stabilized<00:02:52.569> if<00:02:52.780> I<00:02:52.930> keep<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:54.030> throttle

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
very stabilized if I keep the throttle

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.250 
very stabilized if I keep the throttle
on<00:02:55.860> it's<00:02:56.860> basically<00:02:57.610> flying<00:02:58.300> really<00:02:58.600> nice<00:02:58.900> I

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
on it's basically flying really nice I

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.290 
on it's basically flying really nice I
don't<00:02:59.560> think<00:03:00.130> it<00:03:00.220> has<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.400> barometer<00:03:01.060> or

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
don't think it has a barometer or

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.180 
don't think it has a barometer or
altitude<00:03:02.260> hold<00:03:03.000> but<00:03:04.000> men<00:03:04.500> if<00:03:05.500> I<00:03:05.739> leave<00:03:05.980> the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
altitude hold but men if I leave the

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.150 
altitude hold but men if I leave the
sticks<00:03:06.610> you<00:03:06.880> see<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:08.050> plan<00:03:08.410> is<00:03:08.620> actually

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
sticks you see the plan is actually

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:19.110 
sticks you see the plan is actually
maintaining<00:03:09.790> real<00:03:10.270> nice<00:03:17.370> time<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.670> test<00:03:18.910> the

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
maintaining real nice time to test the

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:28.070 
maintaining real nice time to test the
rth

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.880 

now<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.710> turn<00:03:28.920> on<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.370> rth<00:03:30.170> radios<00:03:31.170> in<00:03:31.350> my<00:03:31.500> hands

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
now I turn on the rth radios in my hands

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.640 
now I turn on the rth radios in my hands
and<00:03:33.020> plan<00:03:34.020> is<00:03:34.200> coming<00:03:34.530> back<00:03:34.770> you<00:03:35.130> can<00:03:35.310> see<00:03:36.650> just

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
and plan is coming back you can see just

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.200 
and plan is coming back you can see just
arrived<00:03:38.040> back<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.550> will<00:03:38.700> make<00:03:38.850> a<00:03:38.880> right<00:03:39.180> turn

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.210 
arrived back it will make a right turn

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.320 
arrived back it will make a right turn
now<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:40.100> go<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.370> building<00:03:41.760> so<00:03:42.030> I<00:03:42.060> will

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
now and go to the building so I will

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.790 
now and go to the building so I will
control<00:03:42.720> it<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:44.930> this<00:03:45.930> time<00:03:45.990> I'll<00:03:46.350> get<00:03:46.560> some

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
control it and this time I'll get some

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.860 
control it and this time I'll get some
altitude<00:03:47.010> so<00:03:47.580> we<00:03:47.700> can<00:03:47.850> see<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.300> circling

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
altitude so we can see the circling

00:03:48.870 --> 00:04:04.120 
altitude so we can see the circling
feature<00:03:57.110> alright<00:03:58.850> hope<00:03:59.850> you<00:04:00.030> can<00:04:00.240> see<00:04:01.520> rth<00:04:02.520> on

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
feature alright hope you can see rth on

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.290 
feature alright hope you can see rth on
throttle<00:04:05.130> to<00:04:05.610> the<00:04:05.640> middle<00:04:07.280> and<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:09.060> plane

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
throttle to the middle and the plane

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.300 
throttle to the middle and the plane
coming<00:04:09.600> back<00:04:10.340> over<00:04:11.340> there<00:04:12.680> it<00:04:13.680> should<00:04:14.040> make<00:04:14.280> a

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
coming back over there it should make a

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.420 
coming back over there it should make a
left<00:04:14.700> turn<00:04:14.820> now<00:04:15.210> or<00:04:15.540> right<00:04:15.840> turn<00:04:16.080> I'm<00:04:16.260> not<00:04:16.290> sure

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.730 

going<00:04:20.430> to<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:20.700> buildings<00:04:21.150> nope<00:04:22.140> it<00:04:22.380> cleared

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
going to the buildings nope it cleared

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:31.040 
going to the buildings nope it cleared
out<00:04:22.890> and<00:04:23.250> start<00:04:23.940> circling<00:04:24.240> you<00:04:24.600> can<00:04:24.750> see<00:04:30.050> now

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
out and start circling you can see now

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.240 
out and start circling you can see now
it<00:04:31.110> should<00:04:31.500> make<00:04:31.740> a<00:04:31.920> right<00:04:32.250> turn<00:04:33.919> now<00:04:34.919> it's

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
it should make a right turn now it's

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.700 
it should make a right turn now it's
just<00:04:35.460> circling<00:04:36.000> around<00:04:36.150> which<00:04:36.780> is<00:04:37.020> really

so<00:04:57.960> to<00:04:58.800> lose<00:04:58.980> the<00:04:59.220> altitude<00:04:59.760> we<00:05:00.090> need<00:05:00.270> manual

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
so to lose the altitude we need manual

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:27.580 
so to lose the altitude we need manual
mode<00:05:01.110> ah

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.000
