00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.849 
now symfon dell is just a two-year-old
and<00:00:18.350> he's<00:00:19.350> had<00:00:19.590> very<00:00:19.859> little<00:00:20.100> training

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
and he's had very little training

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:28.820 
and he's had very little training
he's<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:24.109> greeny<00:00:25.789> Zinfandel<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:27.529> just<00:00:28.529> learning

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
he's a greeny Zinfandel is just learning

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.229 
he's a greeny Zinfandel is just learning
how<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.970> get<00:00:30.269> along<00:00:30.510> with<00:00:30.720> people<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.820> in<00:00:32.820> fact

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
how to get along with people and in fact

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.930 
how to get along with people and in fact
he's<00:00:34.140> just<00:00:34.170> learning<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.070> lot<00:00:35.219> about<00:00:35.280> leading

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
he's just learning a lot about leading

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.260 
he's just learning a lot about leading
and<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.739> early<00:00:37.739> rudiments<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.489> being<00:00:39.149> a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
and the early rudiments of being a

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.819 
and the early rudiments of being a
trained<00:00:39.570> horse<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.850> I<00:00:41.850> guess<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.480> could<00:00:42.719> say

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
trained horse and I guess you could say

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.090 
trained horse and I guess you could say
he's<00:00:43.829> broke<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.340> lead<00:00:45.020> probably<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.230> so<00:00:46.260> if<00:00:46.950> I

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
he's broke to lead probably and so if I

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.819 
he's broke to lead probably and so if I
walk<00:00:47.399> away<00:00:47.430> from<00:00:48.030> him<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.329> I<00:00:48.450> just<00:00:48.750> sort<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.680> am

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
walk away from him and I just sort of am

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.330 
walk away from him and I just sort of am
very<00:00:50.129> careful<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:50.850> way<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.500> can<00:00:52.500> lead<00:00:52.710> symfon

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
very careful this way I can lead symfon

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.970 
very careful this way I can lead symfon
Dell<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:54.379> he<00:00:55.379> walks<00:00:55.680> along<00:00:56.039> with<00:00:56.340> me<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:56.879> I

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
Dell and he walks along with me so I

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.700 
Dell and he walks along with me so I
suppose<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.219> would<00:00:59.370> say<00:00:59.399> then<00:01:00.199> he's<00:01:01.199> broke<00:01:01.500> to

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
suppose you would say then he's broke to

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.570 
suppose you would say then he's broke to
lead<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:03.000> think<00:01:03.570> most<00:01:03.899> horsemen<00:01:04.580> would

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
lead and I think most horsemen would

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.550 
lead and I think most horsemen would
agree<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.780> if<00:01:07.500> he<00:01:07.950> leads<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:09.150> well<00:01:09.560> then

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
agree that if he leads that well then

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.490 
agree that if he leads that well then
he's<00:01:10.740> broke<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.159> lead<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:13.640> that's<00:01:14.640> not<00:01:14.939> me

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
he's broke to lead and that's not me

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.800 
he's broke to lead and that's not me
that's<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:16.860> my<00:01:17.040> position<00:01:17.250> at<00:01:17.700> all<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.119> don't

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
that's not my position at all I don't

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.690 
that's not my position at all I don't
yet<00:01:19.020> know<00:01:19.080> whether<00:01:19.710> he's<00:01:20.009> really<00:01:20.189> broke<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
yet know whether he's really broke to

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.140 
yet know whether he's really broke to
lead<00:01:20.850> or<00:01:21.000> not<00:01:21.080> but<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.110> know<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.680> that<00:01:22.979> if<00:01:23.670> I

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
lead or not but I know this that if I

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.630 
lead or not but I know this that if I
turn<00:01:24.420> him<00:01:24.570> around<00:01:24.750> here<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:26.070> really<00:01:26.460> take

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
turn him around here and I really take

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.109 
turn him around here and I really take
off<00:01:26.850> across<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.509> pen<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.610> I<00:01:29.610> want<00:01:29.880> him<00:01:30.000> to

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
after that explanation to see that

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:58.500 
after that explanation to see that
zinfandel<00:01:53.659> leads<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:55.640> sorts

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
little guy and then you know I suppose

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.460 
little guy and then you know I suppose
you<00:02:05.330> could<00:02:05.540> say<00:02:05.750> ah<00:02:06.190> that's<00:02:07.190> good<00:02:07.490> enough<00:02:08.470> he

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
you could say ah that's good enough he

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.490 
you could say ah that's good enough he
knows<00:02:09.650> how<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:09.860> lead<00:02:10.160> so<00:02:10.490> leave<00:02:10.790> it<00:02:10.820> alone<00:02:11.500> but

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
knows how to lead so leave it alone but

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.830 
knows how to lead so leave it alone but
it's<00:02:12.710> not<00:02:13.010> good<00:02:13.340> enough<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.820> the<00:02:14.630> horse

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
it's not good enough and the horse

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.690 
it's not good enough and the horse
should<00:02:15.110> be<00:02:15.290> willing<00:02:15.710> to<00:02:15.890> lead<00:02:16.160> at<00:02:16.430> whatever
