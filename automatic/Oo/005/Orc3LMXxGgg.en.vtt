00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:20.160
 Mary is everything and that is what we are doing 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.650
 So now with my new karin 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:32.910
 I'm just general on the subject of auto 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:35.040
 say and that car the topic okay it 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.440
 is a very controversial thing for 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.579
 some a very important thing that is 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.260
 for you one at the car on 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.360
 importantly, most importantly 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.450
 The most important thing is that it is not 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.920
 not checked off that's natural 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.989
 a pretty cool argument now that 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.910
 not that is the most important thing 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.829
 I want to come from a to b and there 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.440
 not on the car cards yes but how 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.789
 Just go out of the case 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.289
 the car just can not off yes 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.480
 then it's right 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.000
 So now it is important to me personally 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.130
 So that's a really dull one 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.240
 but that's a lot of ps that's mine 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.240
 personally very important now 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.400
 the sexy one needs a car 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.970
 because you want to get it answered 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.970
 I'm not interested 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.530
 probably pretty cool or mine 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.210
 mother something against you because mine 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.090
 mother is a member of greenpeace 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.230
 I flows donate the thing is shut 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.940
 donate time for greenpeace and 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.920
 polluted the environment have the monte 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.630
 that kind of a mutual but somehow 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:41.350
 you know that many people donate 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:42.940
 to calm her conscience but what 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.550
 I want to get a lot of car now and 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.560
 especially what are the points for yes 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.910
 me are important so I have to too 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.130
 to admit I am already such a 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.440
 a little car fan so I like those 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.210
 sports cars such as here for example at 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.250
 the motto I want to get me is 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.180
 definitely sportiness he is definitely 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.759
 points but I want something very clear 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.450
 I want to say something to the squad 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:11.020
 never fetch me to say anything 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:13.390
 hey looks at me what do I want something for 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.850
 a horny pike I can with this 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.620
 and this car pull very differently 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.420
 Ralf of make it goes with me 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.580
 course really primarily about the 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.280
 factor 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.440
 specify a second factor and third 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.550
 it impress me the hater 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.200
 actually, something has to hate 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.800
 compensate somewhere with that 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.360
 small penis 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:46.390
 he is a colossal anne now at 12 cm 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:48.700
 highly determined I satisfied it up 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.700
 important there he is so I find it clear 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.810
 I'm such a sports car cool for me 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.790
 I find it cool if you still have that 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.410
 I can not afford anything for me 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.209
 makes sense is when you go 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.800
 At some point aggressive cart pulls the 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.250
 you can not buy yes 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:05.250
 or say that I can not afford 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.140
 all money together all in exactly 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.780
 principle lives and for his car find that 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.459
 I'm so blunt so something like that 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.630
 not at all so I color now 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.340
 just nothing to my 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.610
 car what will be what direction it 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.000
 going 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:21.830
 surely only the red comes good comes the 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
 red comes quickly stuck on instagram 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.769
 I do not want anything more specific 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.390
 now then say not for long 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.000
 the mature and I will travel there 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.890
 and pick this clear pick up 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.299
 I am still the same and leaves 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.380
 Just have something you have 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.180
 maybe top I need it 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.920
 anyway a car and if it is 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.120
 enough then is a nice beautiful 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.690
 Nebenaspekt that you can afford it 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.280
 can 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.870
 but you should not care 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.630
 Imagining is an important one for me 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.910
 thing so down to earth and says 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.250
 Hey, even if I'm like that right now 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.890
 a lot of money is nice though 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.829
 Nevertheless I can say hey I can 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.829
 still as an equal person opposite 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:04:00.329
 see because many happening so the 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.950
 I have nothing to do with the cart 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:03.630
 think something equal or not 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.280
 it depends more on it 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.600
 as he deals with it as you do yourself 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.639
 Of course , I have to say 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.889
 which is more difficult for me personally 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.540
 with people the quasi the standard system 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:13.200
 I have fallen for the people too 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.299
 to chat 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.660
 So we go to a hardcore I pull myself 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.810
 the ass as a student and then 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.680
 a kind of schlecker position in one 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.090
 to make a big business where I am 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.280
 have to do any nice to any people 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.009
 And this is the principle 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.810
 entrained 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:32.999
 But in that case, it's about business 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.210
 That's why his work is so important 

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:36.990
 now on a personal level, I have to 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.819
 to say honestly 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.310
 Well, there are certainly people 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.900
 just stupid would prefer in the head 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.129
 Of course I do not have mothers with any 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.930
 person understand but I mean up 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:48.150
 personal level that you with yours 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.919
 person can talk normally about you 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.979
 it can be normal things entertained 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.509
 Business is clear as she sees 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:56.909
 I am and in us in the entrepreneur 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:05:01.219
 position very clearly in the in the 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:01.219
 better position because the company 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.639
 but so on a personal level 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.379
 Private conversations and that's how I find one 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.029
 should not hang out now 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:11.099
 Leave as if you are a superhuman now 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:12.180
 who just still one 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:14.039
 its normal person 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.509
 who in the end what with the video 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.490
 I say will become longer, it also 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:19.560
 has yes I thought I find 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.089
 down-to-earth importance should be one 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.069
 not with the help of a car 

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:27.300
 somehow profiling and saying hey me 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:29.009
 So that's why I'm up for it 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.659
 fibo i have time for every fan 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.129

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:34.229
 individual types who have been waiting 

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:36.449

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:38.520

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:38.789

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.229
 Thing 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:43.319
