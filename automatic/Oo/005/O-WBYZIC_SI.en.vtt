00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
yes let's do that man we're starting

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.249 
yes let's do that man we're starting
over<00:01:27.390> by<00:01:27.659> my<00:01:27.840> portal<00:01:29.390> yeah<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.750> long<00:01:30.990> ways

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
over by my portal yeah it's a long ways

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.920 
over by my portal yeah it's a long ways
out<00:01:31.530> but<00:01:32.490> then<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.880> mostly<00:01:33.330> looks<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.810> way

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
out but then it mostly looks that way

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.440 
out but then it mostly looks that way
because<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.320> freaking<00:01:35.009> dark<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:37.610> can't<00:01:38.610> see
