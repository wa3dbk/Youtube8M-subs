00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.020
 Who can tell us one? 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.469
 a little about quail 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.210
 the criteria that have to be 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:14.309
 observed is the alessandro that 10 years ago 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.560
 is dedicated to the creation of quails 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.020
 alessandro you're the only one here 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.740
 victory, because you started working 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.320
 with quail the why of good quail eh 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.689
 I've actually started to develop this 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.109
 project went to college 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.660
 a friend of mine is my boy went to the area 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.790
 because you did not want the pain to see if 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.809
 there is not always a market if you did not give me some 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.270
 tips 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.190
 I looked and I saw that it really was a 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.989
 business is how the structure 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.120
 need I do not need an area 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.140
 very big we are seeing that we do not 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.860
 they look at the elbow there are you behave several 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.670
 animals in a small area and you 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:01.250
 Here you can find 6 7th birds in a 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.250
 area of ​​30 square meters 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.820
 I'll talk a little bit about the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.850
 I drive how is your day to day life here 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.979
 good in my system of creation the 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:19.680
 here is a defect of three to 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.060
 four times a day is water at will 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.830
 are for pacifiers 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.789
 the eggs are collected every day 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.509
 in the morning and the cleaning part is done 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.509
 every two days 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.770
 now we are following here the 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.200
 alessandro's day-to-day and we're done 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.200
 to see him do the cleaning is now 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.110
 here is a byproduct that you also have 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.080
 a good use is one of the profits 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.750
 is here, for example, I get caught and if this 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.420
 I'm going to make his compost product. 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.569
 and I will take you garden papaya planting 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.369
 of pineapple all those products that the 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.970
 leads to the paintings school lunch 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.970
 of caves 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.800
 we visited alessandro's farm in 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.310
 a very important moment within the 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.940
 codex as next month 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.180
 he will renew his squad what he must 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.940
 be done yearly respecting the life 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.180
 production which owns and will also be 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.220
 always made general of his farm 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.160
 handling those conducted in four 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.490
 four years and fundamental to eliminate 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.030
 resistant bacteria and fungi that can 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.240
 completely compromise the creation of 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.240
 quail 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.569
 and again according to alessandro 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.890
 several factors can decrease and 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:55.489
 to hinder production 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.940
 one of them is stress a result of 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:01.519
 stress here had an egg that was not 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.470
 completely is not complete for 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.810
 be released then agreed to suffer a 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:14.360
 I do not know what kind of stress 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:16.579
 succeeded in generating his shell from outside 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.840
 quail market is not much 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.940
 favorable 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:23.000
 for more than 10 years the price is 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:26.329
 frozen with the average of 25 reais 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.569
 the box of 60 dozen according to alessandro 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:32.180
 with this value can maintain the production 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.609
 without much profit but has means of 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.170
 circumvent the situation 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:39.980
 is a way to solve this problem 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:43.970
 and you benefit the biguá donna you come 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.579
 his direct is ready restaurants or 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.019
 you make a direct sale to 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.160
 supermarket is to try to cut the 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:53.200
 middleman 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.200
 Then you can improve that price. 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.050
 alessandro the main objective of 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:06.250
 quail is the posture of the video now but 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:09.040

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:11.530

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.660
 're hoping to get right in football 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.209
