00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.600
 hello guys welcome to this second 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.880
 tutorial of the phantom world in this 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:14.690
 tutorial we will explain how to put 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:17.090
 cee station to the fcc that I love 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.600
 say with this good from the station of 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.580
 series comes prepared for the community 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.900
 European economy and we are going to 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.210
 to do is to put it as if it were the 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.480
 American we got with this 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.000
 We got to have more power the 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.039
 station is valid and with that to be able to arrive more 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.989
 far as you would do even though the 

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:38.469
 procedure would have to continue for 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.510
 to access that, well, we have 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:43.489
 four screws are worth these four 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.609
 women that we have here is worth 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.769
 we would remove the screws worth this 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:50.510
 also once we remove the 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:53.690
 screws 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.230
 what are we going to be able to update our 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.909
 our radio station through rc so are 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.909
 from the page of de j 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.820
 and well, this would be the station 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.460
 we would remove here careful with the antenna 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.250
 because I tell you it 's a little 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.930
 Fucked up once we've got it 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.930
 open as you see 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.500
 tell you that we have 22 potentiometers 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.750
 solar would be these two that we have 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.460
 here it's worth this top would be 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.620
 associated with the til when we have a gamer 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.740
 with a cemus worth what he would do would be 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.890
 that the movement of the camera towards 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.810
 up and down with this you could 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.310
 correct we could put it 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.580
 here height that we see that focuses on 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.740
 our camera and this one that we have 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.990
 here down here 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.240
 this other yellow would be to change 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.130
 that frequency that is being said 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.120
 normally by default it is rotated to the 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.860
 left 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.390
 we would take our 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.030
 Screwdriver screwdriver that comes 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:08.810
 with our phantom we would give 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:12.660
 we would put the flat tip worth and 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:16.250
 we would take with the screwdriver over 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.500
 the potentiometer and turn it and masters 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.540
 to the right once we have already rotated 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.460
 on the right, the first 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:28.880
 part of this change to the European because 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:31.540
 I tell you this because apart from 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:36.500
 this for how much I have researched 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.100
 once we rip the rc 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.200
 for 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.450
 to calibrate our station or 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.620
 update our software I realized 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.330
 that still changing here via soft as 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.300
 they were changing it and let's say that 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.190
 I was still in the European then 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.290
 once done this we would have to 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.129
 connect 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.430
 in the usb port you have it here 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:09.329
 we would take an usb and connect it in 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.819
 the usb output is in this part 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.690
 so much does it serve you as for 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:18.700
 to update 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:21.560
 df to fcc for the issue of coverage of 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.659
 the station to change to give it more 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.180
 power and also consultative that for the 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:28.430
 Updates theme is worth once 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:32.300
 done this now I'm going to pass another 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:35.180
 video where I'm going to 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.210
 and explain how to update the software and 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:42.080
 at last and finish changing him 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:44.500
 but the system in the soft of c 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.500
 fcc
