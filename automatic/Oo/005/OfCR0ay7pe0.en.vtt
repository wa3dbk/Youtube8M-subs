00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:13.860
 At the University of Graz, rich in tradition, there are the molecular ones 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.039
 the science 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:16.980
 successful focus day 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.199
 the researchers Falcon one of the most modern research centers 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.199
 Austria's vulnerability conditions 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.789
 new refugee waves are deco regulators the perfect outfit that 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:34.940
 international environment at the institute and the close connection of the teaching with the 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.000
 Top-level research creates the best conditions for dedicated ones 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.860
 student 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.530
 afternoon is a unique cooperation in Austria 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.530
 at the University of Graz and the Technical University 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.600
 Special attention is paid to the road for professional training 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.110
 the platoon leader the hilton group 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.590
 I think TU is far too important the lab is space for 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.590
 communication 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.010
 internationally recognized research team are right in the molecular 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.900
 mechanisms 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.870
 which lead to the development of various diseases 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.570
 These findings may in future be the basis for the development of 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.800
 Medicines and the improved diagnosis of diseases represent 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.420
 Lipid metabolism disorders and related diseases such as 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.560
 obesity 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.329
 Type 2 diabetes or heart attack are spreading like an epidemic 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.450
 with great international success too 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.939
 several workgroups at 17 after previously unknown missing metabolism 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.289
 profile and explore their tasks and regulations in the organism 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.479
 Under stress, cells develop special survival strategies that makes them to 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.479
 Example against a variety of active ingredient existent 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.350
 while in some districts, Henkel would have been suicidal on this point 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.390
 are a better chance to survive 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.750
 These mechanisms are being researched at the age of 14 and help diseases like 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.960
 Parkinson's to understand Alzheimer's or cancer 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:18.719
 Bacteria possess mechanisms of Hungarian detachment or Catherine 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.500
 appointed bacterial animal or plant to pass on 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.970
 this leads to the "Spice is not harmless Brad Pitt of 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.310
 Anticonvulsant resistance can cause serious infections 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.670
 Research work of the institute has already succeeded important aspects of this 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.959
 Transmission route is drowning 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.609
 the correct hopefully nothing is passier they take the

 Regional history nations indispensable 

00:02:43.559 --> 00:02:45.510
 in structural biology 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.189
 with the three-dimensional construction of protel them, among other things, by means 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:52.019
 Crystal structure analyzes determined 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.170
 this helps to understand the functioning of enzymes and humbly the 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:59.169
 later development of drugs 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.130
 the multitude of sensational articles worldwide 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.319
 the users and other dogs cats and 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.239
 both national and international awards and science awards 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.219
 they are the excellence of the institute, we have the sciences 

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:25.289
