you<00:03:59.430> if<00:03:59.819> you<00:03:59.879> would<00:04:00.299> like<00:04:00.329> to<00:04:00.629> do<00:04:00.750> this<00:04:00.900> there

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
might be a lot more minerals and I think

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.039

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
there is so like you could make like a

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.009 
there is so like you could make like a
square<00:04:10.859> thing<00:04:11.189> and<00:04:11.629> straight<00:04:12.629> mine<00:04:12.810> if<00:04:12.989> you

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019
