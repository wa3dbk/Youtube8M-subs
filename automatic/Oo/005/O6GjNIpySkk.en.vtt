not<00:03:24.480> sure<00:03:24.540> how<00:03:24.810> they<00:03:24.959> did<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.170> since<00:03:25.769> babies

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
not sure how they did it since babies

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.190 
not sure how they did it since babies
come<00:03:26.580> foo<00:03:26.850> she<00:03:27.090> is<00:03:27.209> all<00:03:27.360> over<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.720> place<00:03:27.750> and

come foo she is all over the place and

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.320 
come foo she is all over the place and
i'm<00:03:28.920> not<00:03:29.100> sure<00:03:29.220> how<00:03:29.340> they've<00:03:29.519> done<00:03:29.670> it<00:03:29.790> but<00:03:30.000> i

thought that volume has leaked if it

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.640 
thought that volume has leaked if it
gives<00:03:32.700> that<00:03:32.880> money<00:03:33.090> mostly<00:03:34.080> funnier<00:03:34.470> things
