yeah it's a great brands I guess in the
past<00:01:51.400> and<00:01:51.610> we've<00:01:51.700> looked<00:01:51.820> at<00:01:51.970> extensions<00:01:52.540> and

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
past and we've looked at extensions and

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:54.780 
past and we've looked at extensions and

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
specifically we've had to utilize

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.310 
specifically we've had to utilize
multiple<00:01:57.460> pieces<00:01:57.910> to<00:01:58.570> get<00:01:58.780> a<00:01:58.810> very<00:01:59.170> dramatic

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
multiple pieces to get a very dramatic

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:01.770 
multiple pieces to get a very dramatic
look<00:01:59.770> you'd<00:02:00.369> have<00:02:00.490> to<00:02:00.550> use<00:02:00.790> 30<00:02:01.150> 40<00:02:01.570> 50

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
look you'd have to use 30 40 50

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.540 
look you'd have to use 30 40 50
individual<00:02:02.410> pieces<00:02:02.619> to<00:02:02.950> get<00:02:03.040> a<00:02:03.070> very<00:02:03.250> full

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
individual pieces to get a very full

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.880 
individual pieces to get a very full
dramatic<00:02:03.940> effect<00:02:04.260> we're<00:02:05.260> here<00:02:05.440> do<00:02:05.560> difference

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
dramatic effect we're here do difference

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.440 
dramatic effect we're here do difference
is<00:02:05.979> actually<00:02:06.250> a<00:02:06.280> one<00:02:06.490> piece<00:02:06.729> multi<00:02:07.240> layered

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
is actually a one piece multi layered

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.779 
is actually a one piece multi layered
system<00:02:07.720> that's<00:02:08.590> equivalent<00:02:08.920> to<00:02:09.220> a<00:02:09.340> full<00:02:09.580> head

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
system that's equivalent to a full head

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.150 
system that's equivalent to a full head
of<00:02:09.820> extensions<00:02:10.360> in<00:02:10.720> one<00:02:11.290> piece<00:02:11.530> takes<00:02:12.070> about

shows how the scholars can actually
utilize<00:02:38.730> it<00:02:39.150> as<00:02:39.270> very<00:02:39.390> much<00:02:39.600> as<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.870> blank

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
utilize it as very much as a blank

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.950 
utilize it as very much as a blank
canvas<00:02:40.490> where<00:02:41.490> they<00:02:41.580> can<00:02:41.730> then<00:02:41.850> cut<00:02:42.150> color<00:02:42.570> and

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
canvas where they can then cut color and

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.590 
canvas where they can then cut color and
style<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:44.310> again<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:44.670> shows<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.090> very<00:02:45.300> much<00:02:45.420> as

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:45.600 
style so again it shows it very much as

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
designer and I guess why were your line

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.140 
designer and I guess why were your line
with<00:03:02.439> our<00:03:02.560> er<00:03:03.159> as<00:03:03.430> opposed<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:03.939> any<00:03:04.120> other

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
with our er as opposed to any other

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.910 
with our er as opposed to any other
designer<00:03:04.629> was<00:03:04.870> more<00:03:05.049> the<00:03:05.200> fact<00:03:05.230> that<00:03:05.439> Kim<00:03:05.769> is

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
designer was more the fact that Kim is

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.640 
designer was more the fact that Kim is
very<00:03:06.280> very<00:03:06.790> fashion-forward<00:03:07.269> very<00:03:07.989> edgy<00:03:08.409> and

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
very very fashion-forward very edgy and

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.050 
very very fashion-forward very edgy and
she's<00:03:08.920> young<00:03:09.129> and<00:03:09.159> up-and-coming<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:10.000> I

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
she's young and up-and-coming and I

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.699 
she's young and up-and-coming and I
guess<00:03:10.239> that's<00:03:10.480> how<00:03:10.690> we<00:03:10.750> see<00:03:11.079> our<00:03:11.230> company<00:03:11.620> as

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
guess that's how we see our company as

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.319 
guess that's how we see our company as
well<00:03:11.920> we<00:03:12.099> are<00:03:12.250> only<00:03:12.400> 18<00:03:12.670> months<00:03:12.940> old<00:03:13.120> when

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329 
well we are only 18 months old when

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.050 
well we are only 18 months old when
Brandis<00:03:13.780> only<00:03:14.019> 18<00:03:14.260> months<00:03:14.530> were<00:03:14.650> old<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.060> to

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
Brandis only 18 months were old and to

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.430 
Brandis only 18 months were old and to
me<00:03:16.180> it<00:03:16.299> made<00:03:16.480> total<00:03:16.659> sense<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:17.109> align

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
me it made total sense to align
