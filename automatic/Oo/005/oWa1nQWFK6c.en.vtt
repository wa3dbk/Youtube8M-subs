 We started a different video today. 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.149
 I put a game trailer for you 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.580

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.470
 that no one is really iron then 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.240

 I put it on translating if you liked it 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.289
 and in the comments it did not like and 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.780
 go with the news well black sheep o 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:45.979
 black sheep project this game it a 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:49.190
 action mm rpg based on a world of 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.800
 mixture between is western and eastern 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.289
 as we could also see this not 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.599
 Saibam Souza online a milestone in peace that 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.360
 It's a game from the same company. 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:01.429
 the isi ring then she had a material in 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.080
 paris or knowing only here is a 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.810
 blush when the things we can 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.599
 waiting on the blush for sure is 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.399
 graphically because online students 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.250
 when it was released in Korea at the time 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.810
 had grace no other mm then blush 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.459
 sure dot com is going to have 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.810
 graphics that no one else will ever have when 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.660
 the things you 're watching the gameplay 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.610
 exact moment is an action game RPG to be 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.640
 quoted forever play with the system 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.310
 action is very similar to 169 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.099
 life with classes with one 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.860
 touch more oriental then you will have 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:37.160
 to the south where the guy with the gangs 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.420
 they are seeing the kind of magician and class 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.319
 a little populated nearby 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.239
 but only with the story a little 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.150
 western what is the history of states 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:50.120
 united simple everybody your co 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.340
 the true God that all powerful 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.079
 it's not what he was doing and he 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.800
 arrived and caused destruction because 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:56.300
 I do not like anyone 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.670
 basically are a little more 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.070
 invented for me of course and well 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.590
 to fight against this younger god 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.840
 who is building everything is destroying 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.620
 everything everything comes from an organization 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:12.170
 called blush that blue chips are 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.170
 warriors going to fight are you by 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.420
 is it a special group and the recruits 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.980
 they wanted the time the game got together if already 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.890
 a blue chip and work for the church 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.750
 is fighting a god and a new 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.420
 It looks like it's going to be something 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.670
 middle age only so that people 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.810
 sees in the graphics a much more 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.970
 between that European architecture 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.850
 and Eastern because of the 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.640
 The classic 77 game is very similar to 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.860
 any other square x 77 rpg 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.510
 with some changes that do not change 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.300
 are so changes but never come others 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.310
 games such as, for example, will have 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.920
 realism of the graphics will also have a 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:56.810
 thing called urn and mix means that 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:04:00.440
 weather rain at night this will change 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:03.890
 the intensity of light elements on the maps 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.560
 and letting the game become more realistic 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.870
 this dynamic change in the world in 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.660
 and will also have other elements 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.600
 Dynamic as dynamic quest 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.669
 I believe you look like war 2 I 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.370
 I do not think I think this is a thing. 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:22.040
 well - put like a mustache is not a 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:25.640
 Such a thing more than for example the rain 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:29.120
 makes a lake grow or you have 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.400
 a moment of fog and rain seila 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:33.740
 open a cave he was 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.240
 hidden or in the place it rains a lot when 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.860
 stops raining and opens a camera or 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.090
 something like this I believe that 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.650
 That's more or less so for you. 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.380
 get some cuts and even 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.210
 catch something holding because the 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.280
 game has a system that 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.080
 practically all game objects are 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.180
 that is, they move with their 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.060
 blows in seven that has a 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.220
 physics implemented in the very good game that 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.950
 can lead to many things when 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.590
 question is game exploration 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.110
 the game is in creation what you have seen 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.960
 now it was a training in an initial plan 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.889
 projection of how the game will be 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.560
 far from being released was already 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.569
 earthy beta of Korean I think 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.490
 this end of that year beginning and coming and 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:16.259
 It's too far, I came here and with 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.539
 sure when to have curled home 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:21.029
 many games but sure black sheep 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.529
 will bring many elements that are already 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:24.840
 many elements that have yet to be 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:26.879
 will see a game still in progress with 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.520
 stupidly realistic graphics on it 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:32.460
 a low combo mode of action with 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.169
 certainty is not a revolutionary game but 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.699
 I think Dell is looking to put 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.990
 all those elements that everyone 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.629
 want to see a game only 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.389
 In a game you only have classes and action 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:44.669
 similar to more martial things a 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:47.490
 story a little sideways 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:51.210
 something more or less similar to the 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:55.259
 mean age in the visual of some stage 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:58.020
 things to league in my quests and a 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:59.189
 action well aimed for combos with certainty 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.250
 It's going to be a very worthwhile game. 

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:04.439
 test when it arrives here with no dates 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.229
 so far nothing is in the game 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:09.210
 see it flat so stick with black sheep 

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:12.120
 I hope you have enjoyed it and if you 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:14.310
 rate this video for god's sake or 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.810
 I do not know for sure, I'm doing everything I'm doing. 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.089
 here but never mind 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.949
 If you liked it because I liked it if you 

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:23.009
 Did not like the user doing what? 

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:25.199
 and comment what you think why 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.719
 this evaluation, which is very 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:30.120
 important to discuss mine 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:33.060
 comments that share information 

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:35.279
 Both you and me against light in me, right? 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.180
 and if you are not registered sign up 

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:42.029
 always keeping an eye on the novelty of 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:44.159
 fish and well and finds doors this point with 

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:46.560

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:50.310
 other animals posted daily by the 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.589
