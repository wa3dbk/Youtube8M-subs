air<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:42.629> kind<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.410> BP<00:00:43.739> our<00:00:43.860> team<00:00:44.070> he's<00:00:44.250> got

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
air so kind of a BP our team he's got

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.799 
air so kind of a BP our team he's got
quite<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.700> few<00:00:44.820> bvr<00:00:45.210> players<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.570> then<00:00:45.660> they've

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
quite a few bvr players and then they've

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.180 
quite a few bvr players and then they've
got<00:00:45.840> some<00:00:46.170> random<00:00:46.590> players<00:00:46.800> i'm<00:00:46.980> assuming

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
got some random players i'm assuming

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.650 
got some random players i'm assuming
their<00:00:47.489> players<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:47.969> he<00:00:48.030> just<00:00:48.270> got<00:00:48.420> any

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
their players that he just got any

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.119 
their players that he just got any
starter<00:00:49.110> pack<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.469> that's<00:00:49.620> why<00:00:49.770> he's<00:00:49.890> left

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
starter pack so that's why he's left

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.650 
starter pack so that's why he's left
them<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.520> for<00:00:51.000> some<00:00:51.149> reason<00:00:51.180> he's<00:00:51.480> got<00:00:51.629> a

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
them in that for some reason he's got a

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.920 
them in that for some reason he's got a
striker<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.230> CD<00:00:52.890> Emma<00:00:53.129> didn't<00:00:53.640> seem<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.239> to

into the game before a decent highlight

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.560 
into the game before a decent highlight
but<00:01:05.280> Schurrle<00:01:05.729> scores<00:01:06.030> there<00:01:06.270> with<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
header and sure that was a one hell of

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.580 
header and sure that was a one hell of
an<00:01:08.850> annoying<00:01:09.150> player<00:01:09.330> during<00:01:09.930> this<00:01:10.170> game<00:01:10.290> but

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
an annoying player during this game but

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.950 
an annoying player during this game but
uh<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.979> still<00:01:11.909> felt<00:01:12.060> like<00:01:12.150> we<00:01:12.390> could<00:01:12.510> go<00:01:12.689> on<00:01:12.720> and

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
uh I still felt like we could go on and

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.300 
uh I still felt like we could go on and
do<00:01:13.049> some<00:01:13.200> damage<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.530> him<00:01:13.710> obviously<00:01:14.010> didn't

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
do some damage to him obviously didn't

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.710 
do some damage to him obviously didn't
have<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.700> best<00:01:14.850> team<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.180> most<00:01:15.330> people<00:01:15.450> at

have the best team and most people at
this<00:01:15.810> kind<00:01:16.049> of<00:01:16.080> level<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.470> not<00:01:16.710> that<00:01:17.549> amazing

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
this kind of level and not that amazing

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.469 
so we went through with Chad Leon one
chemistry<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.640> charlie<00:01:21.000> is<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.270> look<00:01:21.360> at

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
chemistry this charlie is and look at

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:22.850 
chemistry this charlie is and look at
that<00:01:21.570> finish<00:01:21.780> for<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> one<00:01:22.320> chemistry<00:01:22.680> player

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
that finish for a one chemistry player

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.320 
that finish for a one chemistry player
that's<00:01:23.040> pretty<00:01:23.340> good<00:01:23.640> going<00:01:23.820> even<00:01:24.119> if<00:01:24.150> I<00:01:24.270> do

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
that's pretty good going even if I do

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.719 
that's pretty good going even if I do
say<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.600> myself<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.890> actually<00:01:26.250> makes<00:01:26.520> it

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
say so myself and that actually makes it

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.539 
say so myself and that actually makes it
makes<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.720> 11<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.530> levels<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.040> game<00:01:29.189> up<00:01:29.369> nice

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
makes it 11 and levels the game up nice

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.609 
makes it 11 and levels the game up nice
and<00:01:29.579> even<00:01:30.060> for<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.360> really<00:01:30.600> really<00:01:30.689> good

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
and even for it so really really good

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.870 
and even for it so really really good
way<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.799> get<00:01:32.009> back<00:01:32.130> into<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.430> game<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.700> took

himself he looks so so fast on the ball
I<00:01:47.189> think<00:01:47.670> it's<00:01:47.759> just<00:01:47.790> because<00:01:48.000> my<00:01:48.299> Senate

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
I think it's just because my Senate

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.870 
I think it's just because my Senate
bikes<00:01:48.750> are<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.110> slow<00:01:49.530> they<00:01:50.280> just<00:01:50.490> makes<00:01:50.700> them

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
bikes are so slow they just makes them

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.670 
bikes are so slow they just makes them
look<00:01:51.000> bad<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.479> like<00:01:51.659> flash<00:01:52.020> just<00:01:52.320> running

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
look bad it's like flash just running

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.889 
look bad it's like flash just running
around<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:53.070> they<00:01:53.130> cannot<00:01:53.579> do<00:01:53.850> anything<00:01:54.659> can

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
around and they cannot do anything can

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.660 
around and they cannot do anything can
even<00:01:55.079> adjust<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.409> score<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.979> make<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.399> 2-1

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
even adjust to score that to make it 2-1

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.420 
even adjust to score that to make it 2-1
back<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.360> his<00:01:57.540> team<00:01:57.750> which<00:01:57.899> was<00:01:58.079> really<00:01:58.430> really

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
considering this guy was not really that

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.870 
considering this guy was not really that
