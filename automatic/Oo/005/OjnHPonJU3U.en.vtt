00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
ah this I was thinking the same as a few

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.330 
ah this I was thinking the same as a few
people<00:00:33.809> have<00:00:33.899> said<00:00:34.050> we're<00:00:34.680> going<00:00:34.800> five<00:00:35.040> or<00:00:35.160> six

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
nil air but do you think we kind of

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.049 
nil air but do you think we kind of
played<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.829> played<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.370> cool<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.610> little<00:00:38.700> bit<00:00:39.000> I

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
played it played it cool a little bit I

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.250 
played it played it cool a little bit I
think<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.450> we're<00:00:39.540> waiting<00:00:39.870> for<00:00:39.960> us<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.079> play

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
think that we're waiting for us to play

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.470 
think that we're waiting for us to play
into<00:00:40.500> their<00:00:40.620> hands<00:00:40.860> maybe<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.460> think<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.390> be

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
into their hands maybe I think to be

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.760 
into their hands maybe I think to be
fair<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.780> them<00:00:42.870> they<00:00:43.020> defended<00:00:43.410> well<00:00:43.500> first

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
fair to them they defended well first

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.560 
fair to them they defended well first
off<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.489> mean<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:44.789> dominate<00:00:45.149> possession<00:00:45.390> they

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
off we mean we dominate possession they

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:46.970 
off we mean we dominate possession they
they<00:00:45.750> didn't<00:00:45.930> care<00:00:46.079> about<00:00:46.170> scoring<00:00:46.530> they<00:00:46.770> came

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
they didn't care about scoring they came

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.889 
they didn't care about scoring they came
here<00:00:47.100> for<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.309> draw<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:48.329> we<00:00:49.170> got<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.410> goals<00:00:50.899> any

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
here for a draw but we got the goals any

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.560 
here for a draw but we got the goals any
point<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.379> half<00:00:52.860> time<00:00:53.190> did<00:00:53.730> he<00:00:53.760> did<00:00:54.059> he<00:00:54.090> go<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.300> to

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
point a half time did he did he go in to

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.150 
point a half time did he did he go in to
get<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.719> pint<00:00:54.930> or<00:00:55.079> whatever<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.559> think<00:00:55.829> you

get a pint or whatever and think you

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.040

know<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:56.430> they<00:00:56.520> might<00:00:56.640> Nick<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.030> no<00:00:58.020> I

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
know what they might Nick this no I

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.750 
know what they might Nick this no I
think<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:58.559> as<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.890> say<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.250> first<00:00:59.489> 10

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
think like as you say that first 10

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.520 
think like as you say that first 10
minutes<00:00:59.940> we<00:01:00.239> were<00:01:00.420> absolutely<00:01:00.719> all<00:01:01.199> over<00:01:01.440> them

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
minutes we were absolutely all over them

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.900 
minutes we were absolutely all over them
they<00:01:01.559> didn't<00:01:01.800> get<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.920> kid<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.160> think<00:01:02.340> you're

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
they didn't get a kid I think you're

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.100 
they didn't get a kid I think you're
quite<00:01:03.120> right<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.480> saying<00:01:03.510> if<00:01:03.750> we'd<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:03.960> got<00:01:03.989> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
quite right in saying if we'd have got a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.509 
quite right in saying if we'd have got a
goal<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.559> first<00:01:04.799> ten<00:01:05.010> minutes<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.400> would

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
goal in that first ten minutes it would

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.310 
goal in that first ten minutes it would
have<00:01:05.670> been<00:01:05.760> five<00:01:06.570> or<00:01:06.720> six<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:07.020> had<00:01:07.140> dropped

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
have been five or six that had dropped

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.660 
have been five or six that had dropped
the<00:01:07.350> Reds<00:01:07.560> as<00:01:07.710> Jon<00:01:07.920> says<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.340> would<00:01:08.430> have<00:01:08.580> been

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
the Reds as Jon says it would have been

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.539 
the Reds as Jon says it would have been
you<00:01:09.630> know<00:01:09.960> they<00:01:10.110> came<00:01:10.290> for<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> draw<00:01:10.799> as<00:01:11.280> soon<00:01:11.430> as

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
you know they came for a draw as soon as

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.490 
you know they came for a draw as soon as
he<00:01:11.610> conceded<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.420> was<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.750> we<00:01:13.110> saw<00:01:13.140> that

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
he conceded that that was it we saw that

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.560 
he conceded that that was it we saw that
as<00:01:13.619> soon<00:01:13.740> as<00:01:13.920> Raheem<00:01:14.549> got<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> goal<00:01:15.030> their

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
as soon as Raheem got the goal their

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.910 
as soon as Raheem got the goal their
heads<00:01:15.780> went<00:01:15.990> down<00:01:16.110> again<00:01:16.320> they<00:01:16.470> barely<00:01:16.680> got<00:01:16.890> a

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
heads went down again they barely got a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.320 
heads went down again they barely got a
kick<00:01:17.130> after<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.580> but<00:01:17.759> we<00:01:17.909> didn't<00:01:18.180> need

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
kick after that but we didn't need

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.080 
kick after that but we didn't need
another<00:01:18.360> goal<00:01:18.869> um<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.100> didn't<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.790> don't

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
another goal um I I didn't it don't

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.700 
another goal um I I didn't it don't
think<00:01:21.330> they<00:01:21.420> ever<00:01:21.450> looked<00:01:21.840> like<00:01:22.409> they<00:01:22.590> were

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
think they ever looked like they were

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:23.690 
think they ever looked like they were
going<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.890> Nick<00:01:23.040> anything<00:01:23.400> they<00:01:23.490> looked

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
going to Nick anything they looked

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.179

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
organized at the back but we pressed we

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.670 
organized at the back but we pressed we
Preston<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.119> we<00:01:27.509> look<00:01:27.720> like<00:01:27.930> we<00:01:28.080> were<00:01:28.229> creating

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
Preston we we look like we were creating

Preston we we look like we were creating
opportunities<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.369> was<00:01:29.460> just<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.700> matter<00:01:29.820> of

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
opportunities it was just a matter of

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.940 
opportunities it was just a matter of
time<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.720> worry<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:30.990> with<00:01:31.229> Sergio<00:01:31.740> not

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
time to worry that with Sergio not

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.670 
time to worry that with Sergio not
having<00:01:32.520> scored<00:01:32.729> as<00:01:32.939> many<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.750> know<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:34.530> like

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
having scored as many you know it's like

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.289 
having scored as many you know it's like
he's<00:01:34.799> taking<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.130> while<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.400> get<00:01:35.610> going<00:01:35.909> but

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
he's taking a while I get going but

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.600 
he's taking a while I get going but
everybody<00:01:36.780> else<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.110> scoring<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:38.009> find<00:01:38.520> me

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
everybody else is scoring so we find me

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.210 
everybody else is scoring so we find me
that<00:01:38.759> all<00:01:38.909> yeah<00:01:39.780> I<00:01:39.810> mean<00:01:40.020> it'd<00:01:40.320> be<00:01:40.680> nice<00:01:40.890> but<00:01:41.159> I

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
that all yeah I mean it'd be nice but I

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.880 
that all yeah I mean it'd be nice but I
think<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.670> always<00:01:42.150> takes<00:01:42.509> surge<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:43.079> couple<00:01:43.799> of

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
think it always takes surge a couple of

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.310 
think it always takes surge a couple of
games<00:01:44.040> under<00:01:44.790> his<00:01:44.909> belt<00:01:45.000> obviously<00:01:45.509> II<00:01:45.540> got
