of<00:01:59.950> my<00:02:00.220> cheekbones<00:02:00.250> just<00:02:00.909> to<00:02:01.030> highlight<00:02:01.240> that

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
of my cheekbones just to highlight that

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.530 
of my cheekbones just to highlight that

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
area too and then I just work on

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.089 
area too and then I just work on
blending<00:02:04.990> it<00:02:05.110> in<00:02:05.350> I<00:02:07.170> use<00:02:08.170> my<00:02:08.349> fingers<00:02:08.709> to<00:02:08.739> get

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
blending it in I use my fingers to get

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.339 
blending it in I use my fingers to get
it<00:02:09.250> up<00:02:09.429> underneath<00:02:09.999> the<00:02:10.450> lower<00:02:10.719> lash<00:02:11.049> line

because<00:02:11.680> I<00:02:11.799> feel<00:02:12.010> like<00:02:12.129> a<00:02:12.189> brush

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
because I feel like a brush

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.770 
because I feel like a brush
isn't<00:02:14.340> as<00:02:14.519> precise<00:02:15.030> as<00:02:15.060> my<00:02:15.390> fingertips<00:02:15.959> and

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560
