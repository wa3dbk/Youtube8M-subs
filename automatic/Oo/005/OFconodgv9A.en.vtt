00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.400
 not everything you need to know about the 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.950
 playoffs 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.230
 chapter 3 first let's make a 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.820
 very brief summary of the semifinals the 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.369
 Saturday we could see the final origin in a 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.599
 best of five facing one oscar h 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.250
 difficult duel since the statistics 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.869
 they said that both teams usually win 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.939
 when they go ahead and lose when 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.490
 they go behind we go that there is no 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.960
 comebacks the first two games 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.550
 they were for origin that were put by 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.960
 in front they carried the advantage to the 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.790
 final 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.649
 the third game h 2 that planted face 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.910
 completely origin so much that 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.980
 finally in a dragon fashion team 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.170
 something that does not usually happen they got the 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.850
 advantage and then the next game 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.680
 presents stealing it itches me sometimes 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.239
 pressure this one was on to push it away 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.590
 it's over for seconds dragon is very 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.269
 used support that will fall the 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.040
 also but can not stand the fish 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.989
 seemed fish especially useful for 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.339
 And HernÃ¡n is still under pressure not to 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.320
 appears they are already to defend to speak 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.420
 of that will not hold last blow 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.100
 another quilmas Tripoli to find it 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.239
 jump offensive on top of last 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.030
 hit there was 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.210
 went over river they get a and if they finish 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.670
 with all the equipment of origin 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.650
 despite the scare origin they were replenished in 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.420
 a very good game was made with the 31 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.659
 and went to the final to wait for his 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.659
 rival 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.520
 for the other part of the picture was repeated 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.950
 the end of the spring season 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.540
 single or soldo against fanatic the 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.920
 favorite without any doubt of the fanatic 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.060
 and no exception aaron passed 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.250
 completely above the 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.350
 unicorns the only match disputed 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.880
 it was the second in which a bad early 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.759
 of fans put unique only above 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.759
 3 3 on the scoreboard that could be 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.159
 it gets ahead of google 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.780
 blas daily zhang does not get to hit and 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.210
 know that little is still stuck to us 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.490
 prepared for the real what gets is 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.319
 brutal shoots mystic to the air there is smooth 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.090
 that is still scarce very much touched the 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.369
 fanatic team what for good the 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.020
 English with an anti-boy shield and follow 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:09.950
 forward pure and more kills flash 7 for 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.840
 kill the rubin knock me down that shows up 30 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.510
 for pure football and look how it has 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.920
 I remember I still gave him the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.349
 back to the tortilla and they got the 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.360
 victory without any surprise was a 3-0 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.160
 for fanatic 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.650
 the points are left as follows 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.080
 and there may be two first scenarios 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.550
 scenario and the most normal fanatic of 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.830
 the playoffs and goes directly to the 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.110
 this would leave the career of 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.430
 points between oscar and only sun what 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.190
 the World Cup square would be contested 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.600
 in this third and fourth place 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.640
 and to finish the first scenario 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.590
 origin would be the semifinal of the regional 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.700
 in the final would be the loser / h os 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.520
 he fell single 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.769
 second scenario origin wins the final and 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.420
 happens directly to the world in this case not 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.680
 there would be a fight for points since fanatik 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.840
 would go straight to the world championships 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.459
 have more points than anyone else has the 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.200
 third and fourth place would be decided at 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:03.150
 next the regional where the loser 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.160
 would be semifinals and the winner in the 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.290
 final to only better than 5 of the 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.209
 wolves 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.730
 well that's the third and fourth place among 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.650
 only are what will be on Saturday 22 and the 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.230

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.230
