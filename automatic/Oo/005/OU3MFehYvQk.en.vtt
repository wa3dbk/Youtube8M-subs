00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.800
 becoming more reality what 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.630
 confirms even the current 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.550
 french prime minister manuel waltz 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.130
 who stressed that the party is located 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.260

 it speaks of course deep 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:45.100
 political and economic crisis in 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:48.620
 which is France about what 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:53.350
 other political forces are losing and 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:58.219
 trust and credibility must be said 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:01.269
 in public opinion and then this 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:05.150
 denotes of course 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:08.320
 mistrust towards the European Union and 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:11.450
 EU institutions 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.210
 quite big skepticism regarding 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.360
 euro national front made a big 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:19.340
 a breakthrough in the elections to the European Parliament in 2014 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.250
 the year the party managed to take first place 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.110
 gaining 25 percent of the votes while 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.540
 in the election five years earlier result 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.580
 did not exceed 6 percent so have 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.230
 national front in parliament now 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.940
 numerical majority party 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.070
 represent twenty four deputies 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.170
 interesting age structure of voters 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.790
 if earlier marin le pins were kept in 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.320
 mostly elderly people 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.050
 from the backwoods with a low level of education 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.060
 now how their statistics show 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.310
 votes for the party with great pleasure 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.920
 he gives youth a third of all voters 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.800
 people under 35 are the best result 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.810
 among all parties that were elected in 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.250
 European Parliament and voted not 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.170
 farmers and non- farmers 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.910
 well highly skilled workers and 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.800
 middle manager and employees 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.630
 leader of the Popular Front under 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.820
 the leadership of marin le pins began to recruit 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.770
 popularity and among the French left all 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.899
 more actively support the party which 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.330
 defends national interests and 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.040
 calls for the independence of the country as from 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.910
 brussels so from washington 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:22.050
 surely anyway addiction 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:26.420
 from EU rule and mean 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:30.690
 american influence western europe 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:35.220
 will certainly be one of the main question 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:39.500
 here everything is done so that the two parties 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.430
 right socialists would remain to power 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.950
 experts are sure to win on 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.080
 presidential election of 2017 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.270
 the rising star marin le pins will be 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.310
 difficult in but you can because the population of France 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.530
 no longer believe the liberal pro 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.480
 American forces that are hiding 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.430
 either under the sign of socialism in the case 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.710
 of the socialist party francois holland 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.990
 either under the auspices of right conservatism 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.420
 this as for the Nicolas Sarkozy party and
