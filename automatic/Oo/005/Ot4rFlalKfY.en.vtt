00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
next we have parasites and parasites are

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.979

definitely harming it the parasite is

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.369 
definitely harming it the parasite is
going<00:02:30.909> to<00:02:31.030> take<00:02:31.299> something<00:02:31.780> away<00:02:31.900> from<00:02:32.049> the

be<00:02:37.599> a<00:02:37.750> tapeworm<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.620> tapeworm<00:02:39.129> gives<00:02:39.700> gets

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
be a tapeworm a tapeworm gives gets

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.740 
be a tapeworm a tapeworm gives gets
inside<00:02:40.599> and<00:02:40.659> a<00:02:41.500> vertebrate<00:02:42.430> hosts<00:02:42.790> such<00:02:43.569> as<00:02:43.720> a

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
inside and a vertebrate hosts such as a

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.500 
inside and a vertebrate hosts such as a
mammal<00:02:44.280> people<00:02:45.280> can<00:02:45.549> get<00:02:45.670> these<00:02:45.819> and<00:02:46.209> other

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
mammal people can get these and other

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.770 
mammal people can get these and other
mammals<00:02:47.230> also<00:02:47.439> get<00:02:47.739> them<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:49.540> tapeworm

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
mammals also get them and the tapeworm

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.180 
mammals also get them and the tapeworm
is<00:02:51.120> ingested<00:02:52.120> somehow<00:02:52.510> and<00:02:52.840> then<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.890> settles

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
is ingested somehow and then it settles

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.640 
is ingested somehow and then it settles
in<00:02:54.519> and<00:02:54.849> it<00:02:55.120> starts<00:02:55.480> taking<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:56.109> nutrients

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
in and it starts taking the nutrients

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.860 
in and it starts taking the nutrients
from<00:02:56.950> the<00:02:57.040> food<00:02:57.159> that<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.940> mammal<00:02:58.480> or<00:02:58.659> the

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
from the food that the mammal or the

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.800 
from the food that the mammal or the
other<00:02:59.319> vertebrate<00:02:59.889> is<00:03:00.010> eating<00:03:00.370> and

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
other vertebrate is eating and

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.839 
other vertebrate is eating and
everything<00:03:01.810> this<00:03:02.379> organism<00:03:02.950> eats<00:03:03.220> is<00:03:03.519> going

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
everything this organism eats is going

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.849 
everything this organism eats is going
to<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.060> tapeworm<00:03:04.329> instead<00:03:05.200> of<00:03:05.319> going<00:03:05.650> to

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
to the tapeworm instead of going to

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:08.129 
to the tapeworm instead of going to
themselves<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.609> so<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:07.000> organism<00:03:07.599> starts<00:03:07.930> to

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:08.139 
themselves and so the organism starts to

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:09.660 
themselves and so the organism starts to
get<00:03:08.290> malnourished<00:03:08.739> while<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.400> tapeworm

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
get malnourished while the tapeworm

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.839 
get malnourished while the tapeworm
flourishes<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:10.720> grows<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:11.430> takes<00:03:12.430> a<00:03:12.579> more

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
flourishes and grows and takes a more

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:14.940 
flourishes and grows and takes a more
and<00:03:13.060> more<00:03:13.209> space<00:03:13.480> inside<00:03:14.049> that<00:03:14.349> organisms

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
and more space inside that organisms

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.089 
and more space inside that organisms
body<00:03:15.190> while<00:03:15.579> the<00:03:15.609> organism<00:03:16.299> is<00:03:16.450> not<00:03:16.659> being

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
body while the organism is not being

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.199 
body while the organism is not being
actually<00:03:18.099> nourished<00:03:18.519> even<00:03:18.940> though<00:03:19.030> it's

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
actually nourished even though it's

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.360 
actually nourished even though it's
eating<00:03:19.540> so<00:03:20.400> they<00:03:21.400> are<00:03:21.669> known<00:03:21.940> as<00:03:21.970> parasites

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
eating so they are known as parasites

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:30.229 
eating so they are known as parasites
next<00:03:24.370> we<00:03:24.579> have<00:03:24.900> scavengers<00:03:26.220> now<00:03:27.299> scavengers

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
next we have scavengers now scavengers

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.000 
next we have scavengers now scavengers
actually<00:03:31.239> search<00:03:31.629> out<00:03:31.959> and<00:03:32.230> consume<00:03:32.709> dead

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
actually search out and consume dead

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.189 
actually search out and consume dead
animals<00:03:33.519> or<00:03:33.699> plants<00:03:33.879> so<00:03:34.599> instead<00:03:34.959> of<00:03:35.079> it<00:03:35.169> just

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:35.199 
animals or plants so instead of it just

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:39.240 
animals or plants so instead of it just
being<00:03:36.959> something<00:03:37.959> they<00:03:38.230> happen<00:03:38.680> upon<00:03:38.769> is

something they search out scavengers

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:43.170 
something they search out scavengers
want<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:41.739> eat<00:03:41.859> dead<00:03:42.129> animals<00:03:42.160> and<00:03:42.730> plants<00:03:43.060> an

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.390 
want to eat dead animals and plants an
examples<00:03:44.019> would<00:03:44.109> be<00:03:44.169> vultures<00:03:44.799> and<00:03:45.099> blowflies

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400

from time to time if it has nothing else
eat<00:03:55.150> but<00:03:55.389> it's<00:03:55.540> not<00:03:55.690> searching<00:03:56.260> it<00:03:56.410> out<00:03:56.590> so<00:03:57.190> it

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
eat but it's not searching it out so it

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.819 
eat but it's not searching it out so it
would<00:03:57.639> be<00:03:57.790> like<00:03:58.150> if<00:03:58.540> either<00:03:58.989> of<00:03:59.230> these<00:03:59.500> if<00:03:59.739> a

would be like if either of these if a

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.949 
would be like if either of these if a
carnivore<00:04:00.340> ate<00:04:00.519> plants<00:04:00.790> or<00:04:01.269> an<00:04:01.359> herbivore<00:04:01.780> ate

carnivore ate plants or an herbivore ate

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.110 
carnivore ate plants or an herbivore ate
animals<00:04:02.230> it<00:04:02.739> would<00:04:02.919> be<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:03.040> rare<00:04:03.310> exception<00:04:03.699> for

we<00:04:12.370> have<00:04:12.400> proper<00:04:13.329> horse<00:04:13.889> and<00:04:15.269> Capri<00:04:16.269> boars<00:04:16.530> eat

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
we have proper horse and Capri boars eat

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.659 
we have proper horse and Capri boars eat
animal<00:04:18.250> feces<00:04:18.549> so<00:04:19.680> dung<00:04:20.680> beetles<00:04:21.099> and<00:04:21.430> flies

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
animal feces so dung beetles and flies

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.430 
animal feces so dung beetles and flies
would<00:04:22.000> be<00:04:22.090> examples<00:04:22.599> of<00:04:22.720> that<00:04:22.930> but<00:04:23.169> there<00:04:23.409> are

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
would be examples of that but there are

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.070 
would be examples of that but there are
other<00:04:23.680> animals<00:04:23.979> like<00:04:24.639> young<00:04:25.090> elephants<00:04:25.900> or

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
other animals like young elephants or

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.200 
other animals like young elephants or
rabbits<00:04:26.710> or

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
rabbits or

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.890 
rabbits or
stirs<00:04:27.479> that<00:04:27.990> eat<00:04:28.500> other<00:04:29.090> animal<00:04:30.090> feces<00:04:30.300> to<00:04:30.750> get

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
stirs that eat other animal feces to get

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.140 
stirs that eat other animal feces to get
that<00:04:31.080> last<00:04:31.350> remaining<00:04:31.889> organic<00:04:32.550> matter<00:04:32.819> out

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
that last remaining organic matter out

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.249 
that last remaining organic matter out
of<00:04:33.180> it<00:04:34.130> to<00:04:35.130> try<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.370> get<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.419> last<00:04:36.599> nutrients

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:37.259 
of it to try to get the last nutrients

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:40.010 
of it to try to get the last nutrients
they<00:04:37.410> can<00:04:37.650> and<00:04:38.009> so<00:04:38.280> animals<00:04:38.819> that<00:04:39.150> eat<00:04:39.449> other

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
they can and so animals that eat other

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.170 
they can and so animals that eat other
animal<00:04:40.500> feces<00:04:40.710> are<00:04:41.160> known<00:04:41.310> as<00:04:41.460> cropper<00:04:41.970> horse

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
animal feces are known as cropper horse

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.390 
animal feces are known as cropper horse
so<00:04:42.870> as<00:04:42.990> you<00:04:43.139> can<00:04:43.289> see<00:04:43.349> there<00:04:43.740> are<00:04:43.860> lots<00:04:44.160> of

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
so as you can see there are lots of

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.520 
so as you can see there are lots of
different<00:04:44.759> types<00:04:44.789> of<00:04:45.240> heterotrophs<00:04:45.900> lots<00:04:46.380> of

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
different types of heterotrophs lots of

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.290 
different types of heterotrophs lots of
different<00:04:48.590> other<00:04:49.590> organisms<00:04:50.580> living<00:04:51.000> and
