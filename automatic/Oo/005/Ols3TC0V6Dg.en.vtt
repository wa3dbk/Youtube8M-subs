00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
it myself until today so I decided since

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.339 
it myself until today so I decided since
i've<00:05:22.849> been<00:05:22.880> recommending<00:05:23.180> it<00:05:23.810> to<00:05:23.840> people<00:05:24.229> for

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349 
i've been recommending it to people for

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:26.230 
i've been recommending it to people for
like<00:05:24.500> four<00:05:24.800> months<00:05:24.830> i<00:05:25.280> should<00:05:25.460> probably<00:05:25.910> try

like four months i should probably try

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.480 
like four months i should probably try
it<00:05:26.330> out<00:05:26.599> because<00:05:26.930> people<00:05:27.680> say<00:05:27.860> it's<00:05:28.039> amazing
