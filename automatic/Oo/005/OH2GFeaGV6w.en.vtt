antibodies<00:02:19.220> so<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.940> two<00:02:20.150> sets<00:02:20.450> of<00:02:20.599> secondary

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
antibodies so the two sets of secondary

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.229 
antibodies so the two sets of secondary

two organelles with different colors the
important<00:02:35.750> thing<00:02:35.989> to<00:02:36.020> remember<00:02:36.500> is<00:02:36.830> that<00:02:36.860> the

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
important thing to remember is that the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.070 
important thing to remember is that the
primary<00:02:37.459> antibodies<00:02:38.209> must<00:02:38.569> be<00:02:38.750> made<00:02:38.930> in

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.020 
primary antibodies must be made in

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.160 
could use amino fluorescence the same
