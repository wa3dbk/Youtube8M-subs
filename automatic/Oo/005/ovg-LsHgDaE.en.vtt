make this commentary today talking about
theorizing<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.100> how<00:00:23.220> Furies<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:23.789> can

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
theorizing and how Furies and can

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.179

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
competitive games you already mean so

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.480 
competitive games you already mean so
that's<00:00:28.349> what<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.529> mostly<00:00:28.920> been<00:00:29.070> doing<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.369> terms

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
that's what I mostly been doing in terms

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.339 
that's what I mostly been doing in terms
of<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.699> competi<00:00:30.060> side<00:00:30.300> of<00:00:30.420> mario<00:00:30.660> kart<00:00:30.900> 7<00:00:31.109> or

of the competi side of mario kart 7 or
to<00:00:31.529> get<00:00:31.679> better<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:32.189> just<00:00:32.579> been<00:00:32.759> thinking<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:33.270> lot

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
to get better I just been thinking a lot

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.270 
to get better I just been thinking a lot
about<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.110> game<00:00:34.260> providing<00:00:34.710> theories<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.190> how

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
about the game providing theories on how

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.069 
about the game providing theories on how
to<00:00:35.340> become<00:00:35.489> better<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.120> testing<00:00:36.930> those

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
to become better and testing those

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.750 
to become better and testing those
theories<00:00:37.320> out<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.829> see<00:00:38.010> if<00:00:38.040> they're<00:00:38.340> true<00:00:38.610> and

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
theories out to see if they're true and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.190 
theories out to see if they're true and
if<00:00:38.820> they're<00:00:38.969> not<00:00:39.120> keep<00:00:39.390> making<00:00:39.690> more<00:00:39.840> theories

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
if they're not keep making more theories

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.049 
if they're not keep making more theories
until<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.649> move<00:00:40.860> further<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> better

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
until you move further you have a better

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.240 
until you move further you have a better
understanding<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.780> mario<00:00:43.020> kart<00:00:43.200> 7<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
understanding of mario kart 7 and in the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.799 
understanding of mario kart 7 and in the
end<00:00:44.430> you'll<00:00:44.640> be<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.820> really<00:00:45.120> good<00:00:45.270> racer<00:00:45.690> that

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
end you'll be a really good racer that

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.330 
end you'll be a really good racer that
will<00:00:45.930> finish<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.350> first<00:00:46.559> most<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.129> time

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
will finish in first most of the time

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.100 
will finish in first most of the time
I've<00:00:47.520> been<00:00:47.550> using<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.059> theorizing<00:00:48.390> sort<00:00:48.989> of

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
I've been using this theorizing sort of

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.110 
I've been using this theorizing sort of
ID<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.469> Mario<00:00:49.739> Kart<00:00:49.770> 7<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.670> already<00:00:50.820> know

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
ID in Mario Kart 7 and I already know

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.549 
ID in Mario Kart 7 and I already know
that<00:00:51.390> people<00:00:51.750> have<00:00:51.960> already<00:00:52.079> figured<00:00:52.350> out

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
that people have already figured out

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.869 
that people have already figured out
this<00:00:52.770> game<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.160> know<00:00:53.250> I<00:00:53.280> mean<00:00:53.460> people<00:00:53.610> already

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
this game you know I mean people already

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.340 
this game you know I mean people already
know<00:00:54.059> what's<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.329> best<00:00:54.539> part<00:00:54.690> combination

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
know what's the best part combination

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.049 
know what's the best part combination
had<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.620> become<00:00:55.860> good<00:00:56.010> at<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.250> game<00:00:56.430> because

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
had to become good at this game because

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.520 
had to become good at this game because
this<00:00:57.270> game<00:00:57.449> has<00:00:57.660> already<00:00:57.719> been<00:00:58.020> out<00:00:58.199> for<00:00:58.500> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
this game has already been out for a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.500 
this game has already been out for a
year<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.219> same<00:00:59.520> principle<00:00:59.820> even<00:01:00.270> though

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
year but this same principle even though

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.420 
year but this same principle even though
I'm<00:01:00.629> using<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.170> an<00:01:01.260> old<00:01:01.440> game<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:02.219> still

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
I'm using it on an old game it's still

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.549 
I'm using it on an old game it's still
going<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:02.699> very<00:01:03.000> applicable<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:04.080> games<00:01:04.350> in

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
going to be very applicable to games in

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.350 
going to be very applicable to games in
the<00:01:04.650> future<00:01:05.040> like<00:01:05.159> mario<00:01:05.549> kart<00:01:05.790> 8<00:01:05.939> or<00:01:06.150> super

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the future like mario kart 8 or super

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.149 
the future like mario kart 8 or super
smash<00:01:06.630> brothers<00:01:06.810> because<00:01:07.619> those<00:01:07.799> games<00:01:08.040> are

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
smash brothers because those games are

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.469 
smash brothers because those games are
going<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.340> be<00:01:08.430> new<00:01:08.700> nobody's<00:01:09.180> going<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.360> know

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
going to be new nobody's going to know

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.210 
going to be new nobody's going to know
at<00:01:09.689> all<00:01:09.720> how<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.170> become<00:01:10.380> good<00:01:10.680> at<00:01:10.740> those<00:01:10.950> games

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
at all how to become good at those games

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.580 
at all how to become good at those games
so<00:01:11.850> therefore<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.600> approach<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.260> theorizing

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
so therefore this approach of theorizing

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.260 
so therefore this approach of theorizing
is<00:01:14.070> still<00:01:14.220> going<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.430> be<00:01:14.490> important<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.030> those

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
is still going to be important for those

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.090 
is still going to be important for those
future<00:01:15.600> games<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.380> want<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.650> become<00:01:16.740> good

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
future games if you want to become good

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.039 
future games if you want to become good
straight<00:01:17.400> off<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.520> bat<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:18.000> way<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.390> that's

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
straight off the bat that way so that's

example<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.650> how<00:01:22.799> theorizing<00:01:23.520> could<00:01:23.670> help<00:01:23.880> you

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
example of how theorizing could help you

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.460 
example of how theorizing could help you
get<00:01:24.150> better<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.900> know<00:01:25.200> when<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.409> think

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
get better so you know when you think

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.980 
get better so you know when you think
about<00:01:25.619> mario<00:01:26.040> kart<00:01:26.310> mario<00:01:26.490> kart<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.390> racing

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
about mario kart mario kart is a racing

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.480 
about mario kart mario kart is a racing
game<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.500> name<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.829> game<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.220> go

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
game and the name of the game is to go

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.130 
game and the name of the game is to go
to<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.729> finish<00:01:30.000> line<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:30.420> fast<00:01:30.630> as<00:01:30.900> possible

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
to the finish line as fast as possible

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.289 
to the finish line as fast as possible
to<00:01:32.070> be<00:01:32.220> in<00:01:32.369> first<00:01:32.579> place<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:33.210> to

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
to be in first place so you have to

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.870 
to be in first place so you have to
think<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.689> variables<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.530> govern<00:01:35.400> how

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
think of the variables that govern how

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.609 
think of the variables that govern how
to<00:01:35.939> be<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.540> best<00:01:36.570> racer<00:01:37.079> right<00:01:37.229> what<00:01:37.409> makes

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
to be the best racer right what makes

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.230 
to be the best racer right what makes
you<00:01:37.770> finish<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.250> fastest<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:38.939> mario<00:01:39.210> kart

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
you finish the fastest in mario kart

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.940 
you finish the fastest in mario kart
where<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.689> variables<00:01:40.049> i<00:01:40.140> govern<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.560> stuff

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
where the variables i govern that stuff

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.920 
where the variables i govern that stuff
so<00:01:41.189> right<00:01:41.700> off<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.970> top<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.180> my<00:01:42.329> head<00:01:42.450> i<00:01:42.899> can

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
so right off the top of my head i can

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.840 
so right off the top of my head i can
think<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.439> two<00:01:43.680> variables<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.369> first<00:01:44.610> one<00:01:44.820> is

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
think of two variables the first one is

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.850 
think of two variables the first one is
mad<00:01:45.210> knowledge<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.930> knowing<00:01:46.380> how<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:46.560> map

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
mad knowledge and knowing how the map

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.469 
mad knowledge and knowing how the map
words<00:01:47.100> knowing<00:01:47.520> all<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.729> shortcuts<00:01:48.030> knowing

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
words knowing all the shortcuts knowing

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.969 
words knowing all the shortcuts knowing
how<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.600> powerslide<00:01:49.079> around<00:01:49.470> corners<00:01:49.860> and

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
how to powerslide around corners and

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.160 
how to powerslide around corners and
things<00:01:50.130> like<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.310> basically<00:01:50.670> how<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.479> take

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
things like that basically how to take

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.630 
things like that basically how to take
the<00:01:52.350> most<00:01:52.530> optimal<00:01:53.040> path

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
the most optimal path

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.090 
the most optimal path
map<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.150> for<00:01:54.390> sure<00:01:54.630> going<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.380> guarantee<00:01:55.650> you<00:01:55.950> a

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
map is for sure going to guarantee you a

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.950 
map is for sure going to guarantee you a
lot<00:01:56.460> more<00:01:56.490> wins<00:01:57.030> right<00:01:57.300> so<00:01:57.479> that's<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.810> first

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
lot more wins right so that's the first

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.630 
lot more wins right so that's the first
variable<00:01:58.350> but<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.070> was<00:01:59.190> thinking<00:01:59.250> you<00:01:59.520> know<00:01:59.550> I

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
variable but I was thinking you know I

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.430 
variable but I was thinking you know I
want<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.970> more<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.570> know<00:02:00.690> quick<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.170> easy

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
want a more you know quick and easy

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.140 
want a more you know quick and easy
version<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:02.190> something<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.640> worry<00:02:02.850> about<00:02:02.940> I

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
version of something to worry about I

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.310 
version of something to worry about I
don't<00:02:03.390> want<00:02:03.510> to<00:02:03.570> worry<00:02:03.720> about<00:02:03.840> such<00:02:04.050> a<00:02:04.080> big

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
don't want to worry about such a big

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.620 
don't want to worry about such a big
problem<00:02:04.619> right<00:02:04.860> now<00:02:05.070> I'll<00:02:05.670> think<00:02:06.270> about<00:02:06.360> that

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
problem right now I'll think about that

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.600 
problem right now I'll think about that
later<00:02:06.869> but<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.170> know<00:02:07.290> for<00:02:07.650> a<00:02:07.680> fact<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:08.009> knowing

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
later but I know for a fact that knowing

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.580 
later but I know for a fact that knowing
the<00:02:08.759> maps<00:02:08.970> well<00:02:09.300> is<00:02:09.569> going<00:02:09.869> to<00:02:09.959> be<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.320> very

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
the maps well is going to be a very

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.470 
the maps well is going to be a very
important<00:02:11.070> variable<00:02:11.459> in<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.700> game<00:02:11.910> but<00:02:12.330> I'll

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
important variable in the game but I'll

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.760 
important variable in the game but I'll
worry<00:02:12.630> about<00:02:12.690> that<00:02:12.990> stuff<00:02:13.020> later<00:02:13.410> so<00:02:13.650> I<00:02:13.680> was

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
worry about that stuff later so I was

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.900 
worry about that stuff later so I was
like<00:02:13.830> okay<00:02:13.890> I'll<00:02:14.190> worry<00:02:14.370> about<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.550> stuff

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
like okay I'll worry about that stuff

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.790 
like okay I'll worry about that stuff
later<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.420> other<00:02:15.959> variable<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:16.680> was

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
later the other variable that I was

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.740 
later the other variable that I was
thinking<00:02:17.130> about<00:02:17.280> is<00:02:17.550> your<00:02:17.730> car<00:02:17.940> combinations

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
thinking about is your car combinations

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.710 
thinking about is your car combinations
what<00:02:18.930> combination<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.920> body<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.880> set<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.480> wheels

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
what combination of body a set of wheels

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.170 
what combination of body a set of wheels
a<00:02:22.050> glider<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.650> character<00:02:23.160> what<00:02:23.489> is<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.910> best

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
a glider and character what is the best

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.360 
a glider and character what is the best
combination<00:02:24.660> that<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:25.260> can<00:02:25.410> make<00:02:25.620> that<00:02:25.860> gives

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
combination that you can make that gives

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.610 
combination that you can make that gives
you<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.640> best<00:02:26.970> statistics<00:02:27.600> possible<00:02:28.260> in<00:02:28.440> the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
you the best statistics possible in the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.229 
you the best statistics possible in the
game<00:02:28.800> so<00:02:29.040> that's<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.670> first<00:02:29.880> that's<00:02:30.000> the

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
game so that's the first that's the

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.490 
game so that's the first that's the
other<00:02:30.360> variable<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.810> was<00:02:30.959> thinking<00:02:31.170> about<00:02:31.290> and

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
other variable I was thinking about and

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.810 
other variable I was thinking about and
that's<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.769> variable<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.250> chose<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.640> work

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
that's the variable that I chose to work

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.490 
that's the variable that I chose to work
on<00:02:33.030> because<00:02:33.420> it's<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.870> little<00:02:34.050> bit<00:02:34.140> easier<00:02:34.290> to

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
on because it's a little bit easier to

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.380 
on because it's a little bit easier to
think<00:02:34.620> about<00:02:34.890> that<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.370> all<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.670> maps<00:02:36.120> in<00:02:36.330> the

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
think about that and all the maps in the

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.910 
think about that and all the maps in the
game<00:02:36.600> that's<00:02:36.720> going<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:36.989> take<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.170> long<00:02:37.410> time<00:02:37.680> so

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
game that's going to take a long time so

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.190 
game that's going to take a long time so
ok<00:02:38.489> I'm<00:02:38.610> going<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.820> decide<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.269> focus<00:02:39.450> on<00:02:39.840> the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
ok I'm going to decide to focus on the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.259 
ok I'm going to decide to focus on the
car<00:02:40.470> combination<00:02:41.100> variable<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.730> then<00:02:42.120> you

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
car combination variable and then you

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:43.729 
car combination variable and then you
see<00:02:42.480> here<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.019> game<00:02:43.230> they<00:02:43.440> give<00:02:43.620> you

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
see here in the game they give you

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.310

been thinking about and I've been going

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.229 
been thinking about and I've been going
down<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.130> list<00:03:08.280> as<00:03:08.459> they<00:03:08.549> need<00:03:08.700> speed<00:03:09.060> of

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
down the list as they need speed of

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
is going to be really important to him

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.100 
is going to be really important to him
because<00:03:12.209> it's<00:03:12.329> going<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.510> help<00:03:12.570> him<00:03:12.900> finish

the races a lot faster does acceleration
matter<00:03:16.049> to<00:03:16.260> him<00:03:16.440> probably<00:03:17.190> not<00:03:17.340> so<00:03:17.579> much

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
matter to him probably not so much

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.670 
matter to him probably not so much
because<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.540> know<00:03:18.630> he's<00:03:18.780> very<00:03:19.079> rarely<00:03:19.350> going

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
because you know he's very rarely going

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.979

to ever come from a standstill to go to

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.630 
to ever come from a standstill to go to
top<00:03:22.260> speed<00:03:22.500> because<00:03:22.829> he's<00:03:22.980> very<00:03:23.160> rarely<00:03:23.370> going

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
top speed because he's very rarely going

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:24.770 
top speed because he's very rarely going
to<00:03:23.730> stop<00:03:23.970> you<00:03:24.120> know<00:03:24.150> i<00:03:24.239> mean<00:03:24.299> he's<00:03:24.570> going<00:03:24.720> to

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
to stop you know i mean he's going to

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.600 
to stop you know i mean he's going to
always<00:03:25.079> take<00:03:25.230> his<00:03:25.380> corners<00:03:25.739> perfectly<00:03:26.160> he's

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
always take his corners perfectly he's

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.190 
always take his corners perfectly he's
never<00:03:26.790> going<00:03:26.970> to<00:03:27.060> hit<00:03:27.239> a<00:03:27.269> wall<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.570> then<00:03:27.930> stop

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
never going to hit a wall and then stop

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.330 
never going to hit a wall and then stop
and<00:03:28.230> also<00:03:28.680> he's<00:03:28.799> never<00:03:28.920> going<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.190> hit<00:03:29.310> a

and also he's never going to hit a

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.699 
and also he's never going to hit a
banana<00:03:29.700> and<00:03:29.910> stop<00:03:30.180> so<00:03:30.450> acceleration<00:03:31.079> is<00:03:31.560> not

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
banana and stop so acceleration is not

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.080 
banana and stop so acceleration is not
going<00:03:31.799> to<00:03:31.860> be<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:31.980> important<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.790> him<00:03:32.880> so<00:03:32.940> you

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
going to be that important to him so you

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.000 
going to be that important to him so you
go<00:03:33.209> down<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.540> list<00:03:33.660> okay<00:03:33.989> this<00:03:34.470> is<00:03:34.620> important

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
go down the list okay this is important

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.530 
go down the list okay this is important
this<00:03:35.100> non-porn<00:03:35.610> this<00:03:35.790> is<00:03:35.880> important<00:03:36.239> is<00:03:36.360> not

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
this non-porn this is important is not

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.240 
this non-porn this is important is not
important<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.049> come<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.739> an<00:03:37.829> overall

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
important to come to an overall

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.160

conclusion<00:03:38.880> of<00:03:39.090> what<00:03:39.209> is<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.450> most<00:03:39.660> important

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170

conclusion of what is the most important
stat<00:03:40.410> in<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.739> game<00:03:40.920> and<00:03:41.040> that's<00:03:41.130> what<00:03:41.250> I've

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
stat in the game and that's what I've

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.090 
stat in the game and that's what I've
done<00:03:41.610> so<00:03:41.820> I've<00:03:42.000> theorized<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:42.870> i<00:03:43.200> theorize<00:03:43.739> by

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
done so I've theorized and i theorize by

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.009 
done so I've theorized and i theorize by
basically<00:03:44.610> making<00:03:44.910> assumptions<00:03:45.329> and<00:03:45.720> coming

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
basically making assumptions and coming

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:47.660 
basically making assumptions and coming
out<00:03:46.079> with<00:03:46.140> the<00:03:46.380> statement<00:03:46.650> and<00:03:46.980> then<00:03:47.310> you<00:03:47.430> test

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
out with the statement and then you test

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.580 
out with the statement and then you test
that<00:03:47.820> statement<00:03:48.180> so<00:03:48.510> my<00:03:48.630> statement<00:03:49.079> says<00:03:49.260> okay

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
that statement so my statement says okay

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.990 
that statement so my statement says okay
top<00:03:49.950> speed<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.489> going<00:03:50.579> to<00:03:50.700> be<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.880> most

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
top speed is going to be the most

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.060 
top speed is going to be the most

important stat in Mario at seven now
it's<00:03:53.280> time<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.519> go<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:53.700> time<00:03:53.970> trials<00:03:54.450> and<00:03:54.600> test

it's time to go to time trials and test
it<00:03:54.959> out<00:03:55.049> I<00:03:55.109> picked<00:03:55.440> a<00:03:55.560> cart<00:03:55.769> with<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:55.980> very

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
it out I picked a cart with a very

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.580 
it out I picked a cart with a very
minimal<00:03:56.700> speed<00:03:56.910> versus<00:03:57.630> a<00:03:57.660> car<00:03:57.930> with<00:03:58.140> a<00:03:58.170> lot<00:03:58.560> of

minimal speed versus a car with a lot of

carts<00:04:04.590> is<00:04:04.709> massive<00:04:05.340> you<00:04:05.489> go<00:04:05.640> a<00:04:05.670> lot<00:04:06.090> a<00:04:06.120> lot

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
carts is massive you go a lot a lot

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:07.000 
carts is massive you go a lot a lot
faster

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
faster

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.890 
faster
if<00:04:07.159> you<00:04:07.549> have<00:04:07.640> a<00:04:07.700> cart<00:04:08.030> that<00:04:08.180> has<00:04:08.390> a<00:04:08.420> really

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
if you have a cart that has a really

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.570 
if you have a cart that has a really
high<00:04:08.989> rating<00:04:09.530> for<00:04:09.709> top<00:04:09.830> speed<00:04:10.129> rather<00:04:10.340> than

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
high rating for top speed rather than

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.550 
high rating for top speed rather than
the<00:04:10.670> cart<00:04:10.879> that<00:04:11.000> does<00:04:11.180> not<00:04:11.329> so<00:04:11.599> that's<00:04:12.110> kind<00:04:12.500> of

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
the cart that does not so that's kind of

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.110 
the cart that does not so that's kind of
like<00:04:12.709> okay<00:04:12.890> now<00:04:13.220> you<00:04:13.280> know<00:04:13.579> more<00:04:13.790> about<00:04:13.849> the

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
like okay now you know more about the

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.429 
like okay now you know more about the
game<00:04:14.299> you<00:04:14.450> know<00:04:14.569> how<00:04:14.689> to<00:04:14.750> play<00:04:15.079> the<00:04:15.260> game<00:04:15.379> you

00:04:15.429 --> 00:04:15.439 
game you know how to play the game you

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:16.900 
game you know how to play the game you
know<00:04:15.709> important<00:04:16.160> information<00:04:16.609> about<00:04:16.669> the

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
know important information about the

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.939 
know important information about the
game<00:04:17.060> therefore<00:04:17.930> that<00:04:18.109> information<00:04:18.799> will

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
game therefore that information will

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:20.500 
game therefore that information will
make<00:04:19.100> you<00:04:19.250> better<00:04:19.459> the<00:04:19.729> next<00:04:19.760> time<00:04:20.060> you<00:04:20.329> race

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
make you better the next time you race

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.570 
make you better the next time you race
and<00:04:20.750> say<00:04:21.139> top<00:04:21.410> speed<00:04:21.739> wasn't<00:04:22.010> the<00:04:22.340> most

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
and say top speed wasn't the most

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.890 
and say top speed wasn't the most
important<00:04:23.030> stat<00:04:23.210> on<00:04:23.300> the<00:04:23.389> game<00:04:23.539> then<00:04:23.750> we'll

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
important stat on the game then we'll

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.510 
important stat on the game then we'll
see<00:04:24.080> that<00:04:24.260> when<00:04:24.500> we're<00:04:24.650> racing<00:04:25.070> or<00:04:25.190> when<00:04:25.370> we're

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:25.520 
see that when we're racing or when we're

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.070 
see that when we're racing or when we're
doing<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.760> test<00:04:26.030> because<00:04:26.660> they'll<00:04:26.900> see<00:04:27.050> the

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
doing the test because they'll see the

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.170 
doing the test because they'll see the
speed<00:04:27.440> difference<00:04:27.620> is<00:04:27.949> not<00:04:28.160> that<00:04:28.370> great<00:04:28.669> so<00:04:28.729> if

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
speed difference is not that great so if

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.610 
speed difference is not that great so if
the<00:04:29.570> difference<00:04:29.780> is<00:04:30.020> between<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.380> speed

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
the difference is between the speed

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.140 
the difference is between the speed
isn't<00:04:30.770> that<00:04:31.010> great<00:04:31.250> then<00:04:31.460> you<00:04:31.490> can<00:04:31.580> say<00:04:31.850> okay

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
isn't that great then you can say okay

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.580 
isn't that great then you can say okay
speed<00:04:32.479> or<00:04:32.690> top<00:04:32.900> speed<00:04:33.169> is<00:04:33.260> not<00:04:33.380> really

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
speed or top speed is not really

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.260 
speed or top speed is not really
important<00:04:33.919> in<00:04:34.010> this<00:04:34.070> game<00:04:34.280> maybe<00:04:34.760> I<00:04:34.880> can<00:04:35.120> put

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
important in this game maybe I can put

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.290 
important in this game maybe I can put
some<00:04:35.479> statistics<00:04:36.050> some<00:04:36.199> points<00:04:36.770> from<00:04:36.949> that

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
some statistics some points from that

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.070 
some statistics some points from that
characteristic<00:04:38.300> and<00:04:38.419> move<00:04:38.600> it<00:04:38.690> over<00:04:38.840> to

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
characteristic and move it over to

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:40.480 
characteristic and move it over to
something<00:04:39.440> like<00:04:39.560> handling<00:04:40.100> maybe<00:04:40.310> i<00:04:40.400> can

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
something like handling maybe i can

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.640 
something like handling maybe i can
afford<00:04:40.820> more<00:04:41.090> handling<00:04:41.600> in<00:04:41.750> this<00:04:42.169> game<00:04:42.350> and<00:04:42.500> so

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
afford more handling in this game and so

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:43.930 
afford more handling in this game and so
on<00:04:42.770> and<00:04:42.860> so<00:04:42.949> forth<00:04:43.039> and<00:04:43.430> that's<00:04:43.729> how<00:04:43.880> you

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
on and so forth and that's how you

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:45.490 
on and so forth and that's how you
that's<00:04:44.180> what<00:04:44.330> you<00:04:44.449> do<00:04:44.630> to<00:04:44.660> get<00:04:45.080> better<00:04:45.229> at<00:04:45.410> the

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
that's what you do to get better at the

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.140 
that's what you do to get better at the
game<00:04:45.530> with<00:04:45.830> your<00:04:46.070> eyes<00:04:46.220> you<00:04:46.460> make<00:04:46.639> questions

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
game with your eyes you make questions

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.700 
game with your eyes you make questions
you<00:04:47.570> have<00:04:47.720> statements<00:04:48.020> you<00:04:48.320> test<00:04:48.560> those

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
you have statements you test those

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.439 
you have statements you test those
statements<00:04:49.160> out<00:04:49.280> and<00:04:49.520> then<00:04:49.669> you<00:04:49.970> get<00:04:50.120> better

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
statements out and then you get better

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:52.060 
statements out and then you get better
at<00:04:50.720> the<00:04:50.840> game<00:04:50.870> by<00:04:51.199> knowing<00:04:51.590> more<00:04:51.770> about<00:04:51.800> the

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
at the game by knowing more about the

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.159 
at the game by knowing more about the
game<00:04:52.250> and<00:04:52.370> then<00:04:52.760> practicing<00:04:53.419> those<00:04:53.780> things

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
game and then practicing those things

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:55.840 
game and then practicing those things
that<00:04:54.260> you<00:04:54.350> know<00:04:54.560> so<00:04:54.860> that's<00:04:55.460> pretty<00:04:55.669> much<00:04:55.789> it

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
that you know so that's pretty much it

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.730 
that you know so that's pretty much it
that's<00:04:56.180> how<00:04:56.330> theorizing<00:04:57.020> got<00:04:57.229> me<00:04:57.410> better<00:04:57.590> in

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
that's how theorizing got me better in

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.860 
that's how theorizing got me better in
Mario<00:04:58.010> Kart<00:04:58.039> 7<00:04:58.370> I<00:04:58.669> hope<00:04:59.060> to<00:04:59.240> continue<00:04:59.479> doing

the<00:04:59.990> stuff<00:05:00.199> and<00:05:00.380> eventually<00:05:00.860> you<00:05:00.979> know<00:05:01.010> maybe

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
the stuff and eventually you know maybe

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.279 
the stuff and eventually you know maybe
I<00:05:01.430> could<00:05:01.699> be<00:05:01.850> like<00:05:02.060> a<00:05:02.090> semi<00:05:02.690> good<00:05:02.840> player<00:05:03.110> in
