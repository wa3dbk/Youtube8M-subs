00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
I'm like I'm gonna guess that hopefully

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.130 
I'm like I'm gonna guess that hopefully
this<00:01:54.120> is<00:01:54.300> straight<00:01:54.630> because<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.930> can't

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
this is straight because I can't

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:02.360 
this is straight because I can't
actually<00:01:55.320> see<00:01:57.170> so<00:02:00.440> okay<00:02:01.440> so<00:02:01.650> I've<00:02:02.010> got<00:02:02.040> two

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
there and then I've got two vertical

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.230 
there and then I've got two vertical
ones<00:02:08.369> coming<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.119> way<00:02:10.640> that<00:02:11.640> one<00:02:11.820> definitely

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
ones coming this way that one definitely

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.720 
ones coming this way that one definitely
looks<00:02:12.300> cut<00:02:12.660> good<00:02:13.010> so<00:02:14.010> do<00:02:14.130> your<00:02:14.280> best<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.550> make

vertical white line on there and that is
basically<00:04:28.870> the<00:04:29.170> design<00:04:29.560> I<00:04:29.590> think<00:04:29.800> I<00:04:30.010> kind<00:04:30.190> of

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
basically the design I think I kind of

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.440 
basically the design I think I kind of
messed<00:04:30.430> up<00:04:30.580> I<00:04:30.730> think<00:04:30.790> I<00:04:31.000> was<00:04:31.090> trying<00:04:31.270> to<00:04:31.300> be<00:04:31.420> too

quick on that nail but that one looks

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.040 
quick on that nail but that one looks
really<00:04:33.220> good<00:04:33.610> and<00:04:33.940> that<00:04:34.060> one<00:04:34.240> other<00:04:34.690> ones<00:04:34.930> look
