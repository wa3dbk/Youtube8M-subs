welcome<00:00:00.960> to<00:00:01.020> physiological<00:00:01.620> psychology

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
welcome to physiological psychology

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.649 
welcome to physiological psychology
today<00:00:02.700> we're<00:00:02.970> going<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.120> talk<00:00:03.270> about<00:00:03.449> the

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
today we're going to talk about the

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.120 
today we're going to talk about the
lobes<00:00:03.899> of<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.140> brain<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:04.710> I'm<00:00:04.799> going<00:00:04.920> to<00:00:04.980> use

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
lobes of the brain and I'm going to use

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.530 
lobes of the brain and I'm going to use
the<00:00:05.250> board<00:00:05.460> and<00:00:05.609> kind<00:00:05.879> of<00:00:05.910> sketch<00:00:06.270> out<00:00:06.509> the

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
the board and kind of sketch out the

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.849 
the board and kind of sketch out the
vote<00:00:06.870> of<00:00:06.899> the<00:00:07.049> brain<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.500> then<00:00:07.620> show<00:00:07.799> you

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
vote of the brain and then show you

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.350 
vote of the brain and then show you
another<00:00:08.189> way<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.460> kind<00:00:08.760> of<00:00:08.820> help<00:00:08.940> you<00:00:09.059> to

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
another way to kind of help you to

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.660 
another way to kind of help you to
remember<00:00:09.510> it<00:00:09.870> so<00:00:10.559> for<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.099> lobes<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.610> the

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
remember it so for the lobes of the

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.039 
remember it so for the lobes of the
brain<00:00:11.730> what<00:00:12.120> I'm<00:00:12.210> talking<00:00:12.540> about<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.780> the

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
brain what I'm talking about is the

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.020 
brain what I'm talking about is the
cortex<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.889> outer<00:00:14.070> layers<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.759> brain

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
cortex is the outer layers of the brain

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.300 
cortex is the outer layers of the brain
and<00:00:15.360> now<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.139> cortex<00:00:16.680> first<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.100> all<00:00:17.190> was

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
and now the cortex first of all was

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.609 
and now the cortex first of all was
divided<00:00:17.699> into<00:00:17.880> two<00:00:18.150> halves<00:00:18.449> we<00:00:19.109> call<00:00:19.350> those

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
divided into two halves we call those

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.890 
divided into two halves we call those
two<00:00:19.980> halves<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.580> two<00:00:20.760> hemispheres<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.720> two

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
two halves the two hemispheres the two

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.450 
two halves the two hemispheres the two
halves<00:00:22.109> are<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.350> two<00:00:22.500> hemispheres<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:23.369> the

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
halves are the two hemispheres of the

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.210 
halves are the two hemispheres of the
brain<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.359> when<00:00:24.990> we<00:00:25.080> look<00:00:25.199> at<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.439> cortex<00:00:25.980> or

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
brain and when we look at that cortex or

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.880 
brain and when we look at that cortex or
the<00:00:26.279> two<00:00:26.519> hemispheres<00:00:26.810> we<00:00:27.810> can<00:00:28.080> divide<00:00:28.619> those

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
the two hemispheres we can divide those

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.759 
the two hemispheres we can divide those
hemispheres<00:00:29.550> into<00:00:29.939> these<00:00:30.060> cortex<00:00:30.660> lobes<00:00:31.019> so

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
hemispheres into these cortex lobes so

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.170 
hemispheres into these cortex lobes so
what<00:00:31.920> we're<00:00:32.070> looking<00:00:32.099> at<00:00:32.430> here<00:00:32.489> on<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> board

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
what we're looking at here on the board

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.840 
what we're looking at here on the board
is<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.840> left<00:00:34.170> hand<00:00:34.500> side<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.130> brain<00:00:35.340> so

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
is the left hand side of the brain so

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.549 
is the left hand side of the brain so
we're<00:00:35.969> looking<00:00:36.180> at<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.360> outside<00:00:36.390> kind<00:00:37.320> of<00:00:37.410> if

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
we're looking at the outside kind of if

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.900 
we're looking at the outside kind of if
we<00:00:37.710> can<00:00:37.860> kind<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.100> take<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.399> peek<00:00:38.640> underneath

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
we can kind of take a peek underneath

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.400 
we can kind of take a peek underneath
the<00:00:39.120> skin<00:00:39.360> we've<00:00:39.899> been<00:00:40.050> looking<00:00:40.350> at

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
the skin we've been looking at

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.869 
the skin we've been looking at
underneath<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.800> skull<00:00:41.100> at<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> outside<00:00:41.730> of

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
underneath the skull at the outside of

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.610 
underneath the skull at the outside of
the<00:00:41.940> brain<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.290> see<00:00:43.590> that

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the brain and that you can see that

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.260 
the brain and that you can see that
there's<00:00:43.890> kind<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.190> frontal<00:00:44.640> part<00:00:44.910> here<00:00:45.180> where

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
there's kind of frontal part here where

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.970 
there's kind of frontal part here where
your<00:00:45.420> forehead<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.350> then<00:00:46.710> there's<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
your forehead is and then there's the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.619 
your forehead is and then there's the
back<00:00:47.160> part<00:00:47.520> where<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.820> back<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.149> your<00:00:48.210> head<00:00:48.420> is

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
back part where the back of your head is

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.180 
back part where the back of your head is
and<00:00:48.870> there's<00:00:49.350> kind<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.710> sunlight

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and there's kind of a sunlight

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.439 
and there's kind of a sunlight
projection<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.000> we're<00:00:51.120> going<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.270> talk

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
projection that we're going to talk

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.869 
projection that we're going to talk
about<00:00:51.649> let's<00:00:52.649> divide<00:00:53.010> these<00:00:53.309> into<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.699> lobes

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
about let's divide these into the lobes

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.279 
about let's divide these into the lobes
and<00:00:54.030> kind<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.300> talk<00:00:54.480> about<00:00:54.629> what<00:00:54.930> their<00:00:55.079> names

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
and kind of talk about what their names

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.500 
and kind of talk about what their names
are<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.920> I'll<00:00:56.010> draw<00:00:56.699> those<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.090> forties

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
are and I'll draw those in the forties

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.720 
are and I'll draw those in the forties
you<00:00:57.660> can<00:00:57.780> see<00:00:57.960> them<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.739> front<00:00:59.160> one<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.520> pretty

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
you can see them the front one is pretty

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.939 
you can see them the front one is pretty
easy<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.329> figure<00:01:00.390> out<00:01:00.719> because<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.530> front

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
easy to figure out because that front

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.399 
easy to figure out because that front
part<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.520> cortex<00:01:03.000> on<00:01:03.539> each<00:01:03.840> side<00:01:04.110> is

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
part of the cortex on each side is

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.490 
part of the cortex on each side is
called<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> frontal<00:01:05.610> lobe

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.470 

so<00:01:12.070> the<00:01:12.190> frontal<00:01:12.610> lobe<00:01:12.700> is<00:01:12.850> pretty<00:01:13.060> easy<00:01:13.270> to

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
so the frontal lobe is pretty easy to

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.700 
so the frontal lobe is pretty easy to
remember<00:01:13.720> because<00:01:13.870> it<00:01:14.140> has<00:01:14.260> a<00:01:14.290> reasonable

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
remember because it has a reasonable

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.130 
remember because it has a reasonable
name<00:01:15.040> front<00:01:15.640> frontal<00:01:16.330> lobe<00:01:16.510> that<00:01:16.540> part<00:01:16.990> of<00:01:17.050> the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
name front frontal lobe that part of the

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.380 
name front frontal lobe that part of the
cortex<00:01:17.350> now<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.400> back<00:01:18.640> part<00:01:19.000> of<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.150> cortex

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
cortex now the back part of the cortex

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.600 
cortex now the back part of the cortex
is<00:01:19.840> called<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.320> occipital<00:01:20.830> lobe<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
is called the occipital lobe the

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.940 
is called the occipital lobe the
occipital<00:01:24.640> lobe<00:01:25.450> right<00:01:25.870> back<00:01:26.050> here<00:01:26.350> is<00:01:26.620> that

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
occipital lobe right back here is that

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.160 
occipital lobe right back here is that
part<00:01:27.280> that's<00:01:27.520> really<00:01:27.640> involved<00:01:28.330> in<00:01:28.540> visual

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
part that's really involved in visual

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.070 
part that's really involved in visual
processes<00:01:29.860> so<00:01:30.369> if<00:01:30.580> you<00:01:30.790> have<00:01:31.210> an<00:01:31.360> accident<00:01:31.900> or

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
processes so if you have an accident or

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.840 
processes so if you have an accident or
you<00:01:32.229> fall<00:01:32.470> down<00:01:32.710> and<00:01:32.920> hit<00:01:33.130> your<00:01:33.310> head<00:01:33.550> hard

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
you fall down and hit your head hard

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.430 
you fall down and hit your head hard
enough<00:01:33.940> right<00:01:34.300> there<00:01:34.360> in<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:34.630> back<00:01:34.810> you're

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
enough right there in the back you're

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.510 
enough right there in the back you're
probably<00:01:35.650> going<00:01:35.860> to<00:01:35.920> have<00:01:36.070> some<00:01:36.310> kind<00:01:36.430> of

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
probably going to have some kind of

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.000 
probably going to have some kind of
visual<00:01:36.850> sensation<00:01:37.479> in<00:01:37.690> the<00:01:38.350> cartoons<00:01:38.800> they

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
visual sensation in the cartoons they

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.370 
visual sensation in the cartoons they
kind<00:01:39.220> of<00:01:39.250> make<00:01:39.430> fun<00:01:39.700> of<00:01:39.729> it<00:01:39.910> and<00:01:40.060> show<00:01:40.780> kind<00:01:41.320> of

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
kind of make fun of it and show kind of

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.120 
kind of make fun of it and show kind of
birds<00:01:41.729> twerk<00:01:42.729> twerking<00:01:43.630> around<00:01:44.020> your<00:01:44.170> head<00:01:44.350> so

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
birds twerk twerking around your head so

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.530 
birds twerk twerking around your head so
they<00:01:45.250> just<00:01:45.430> were<00:01:45.550> talking<00:01:45.910> about<00:01:46.000> this<00:01:46.270> having

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
they just were talking about this having

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.480 
they just were talking about this having
a<00:01:46.630> visual<00:01:47.020> sensation<00:01:47.680> and<00:01:47.890> playing<00:01:48.280> games

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
a visual sensation and playing games

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.880 
a visual sensation and playing games
with<00:01:48.610> that<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:49.660> fun<00:01:49.930> light<00:01:50.170> projection<00:01:50.770> that

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
with that the fun light projection that

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.370 
with that the fun light projection that
comes<00:01:51.130> in<00:01:51.369> on<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.759> side<00:01:52.180> part<00:01:52.570> is<00:01:52.780> actually

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
comes in on the side part is actually

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.710 
comes in on the side part is actually
called<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:53.860> temporal<00:01:54.430> lobe<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:56.380> the

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
called the temporal lobe and the

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.389 
called the temporal lobe and the
temporal<00:01:58.720> lobe<00:01:58.930> is<00:01:59.229> right<00:01:59.770> here<00:02:00.039> around<00:02:00.220> with

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
temporal lobe is right here around with

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:03.240 
temporal lobe is right here around with
a<00:02:00.430> temple<00:02:00.850> tipa<00:02:01.240> where<00:02:01.899> you're<00:02:02.080> on<00:02:02.110> temple<00:02:03.100> is

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
a temple tipa where you're on temple is

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.680 
a temple tipa where you're on temple is
so<00:02:03.460> it<00:02:03.550> kind<00:02:03.729> of<00:02:03.759> makes<00:02:03.970> sense<00:02:04.149> that's<00:02:04.390> called

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
so it kind of makes sense that's called

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.960 
so it kind of makes sense that's called
the<00:02:04.810> temporal<00:02:05.200> lobe<00:02:05.410> the<00:02:06.039> last<00:02:06.310> one<00:02:06.700> is<00:02:06.940> a

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
the temporal lobe the last one is a

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.969 
the temporal lobe the last one is a
little<00:02:07.720> bit<00:02:07.810> harder<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.200> remember<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:08.950> name

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
little bit harder to remember the name

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.199 
little bit harder to remember the name
of<00:02:09.340> because<00:02:09.550> it<00:02:09.640> doesn't<00:02:09.880> make<00:02:09.940> a<00:02:10.000> whole<00:02:10.060> lot

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
of because it doesn't make a whole lot

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.270 
of because it doesn't make a whole lot
of<00:02:10.360> sense<00:02:10.630> what<00:02:11.290> I<00:02:11.320> guess<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.680> occipital<00:02:12.010> was

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
of sense what I guess the occipital was

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.190 
of sense what I guess the occipital was
got<00:02:12.430> hard<00:02:12.700> too<00:02:12.850> but<00:02:13.090> this<00:02:13.510> one's<00:02:13.780> called<00:02:13.959> the

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
got hard too but this one's called the

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.509 
got hard too but this one's called the
parietal<00:02:14.860> lobe<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:16.890> parietal<00:02:17.890> lobe<00:02:18.340> is

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
parietal lobe and the parietal lobe is

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.509 
parietal lobe and the parietal lobe is
going<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.730> be<00:02:18.820> involved<00:02:19.060> in<00:02:19.420> things<00:02:19.660> like<00:02:20.519> body

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
going to be involved in things like body

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.670 
going to be involved in things like body
sensations<00:02:22.239> coming<00:02:22.600> in<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:23.049> warmth<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.650> your

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
sensations coming in so warmth to your

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.610 
sensations coming in so warmth to your
skin<00:02:24.209> touch<00:02:25.209> sensations<00:02:25.989> going<00:02:26.200> to<00:02:26.260> come<00:02:26.440> into

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
skin touch sensations going to come into

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.830 
skin touch sensations going to come into
the<00:02:26.769> parietal<00:02:27.160> lobe<00:02:27.459> mainly<00:02:28.239> to<00:02:28.390> about<00:02:28.660> the

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
the parietal lobe mainly to about the

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.600 
the parietal lobe mainly to about the
front<00:02:29.140> part<00:02:29.410> of<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.530> parietal<00:02:29.769> lobe<00:02:30.280> that

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
front part of the parietal lobe that

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.699 
front part of the parietal lobe that
will<00:02:30.730> be<00:02:30.790> the<00:02:30.940> sensory<00:02:31.450> strip<00:02:31.750> so<00:02:32.260> any<00:02:32.440> kind<00:02:32.620> of

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
will be the sensory strip so any kind of

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.259 
will be the sensory strip so any kind of
body<00:02:32.950> sensations<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:33.910> get<00:02:34.090> are<00:02:34.120> going

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
body sensations that you get are going

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.490 
body sensations that you get are going
to<00:02:34.420> go<00:02:34.540> into<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.870> front<00:02:35.140> part<00:02:35.380> of<00:02:35.440> the

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
to go into the front part of the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.640 
to go into the front part of the
parietal<00:02:35.739> lobe<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:37.420> so<00:02:37.840> far<00:02:37.870> we<00:02:38.200> have<00:02:38.410> then

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
parietal lobe so so far we have then

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.259 
parietal lobe so so far we have then
some<00:02:39.010> functions<00:02:39.549> for<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.730> couple<00:02:40.120> of<00:02:40.180> these

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
some functions for a couple of these

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:41.819 
some functions for a couple of these
lobes<00:02:40.570> but<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:40.870> want<00:02:41.110> to<00:02:41.170> expand<00:02:41.500> on<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:41.680> a

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
lobes but I want to expand on that a

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.920 
lobes but I want to expand on that a
little<00:02:42.010> bit<00:02:42.130> with<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:42.940> occipital<00:02:43.269> lobe<00:02:43.630> then

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
little bit with the occipital lobe then

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.830 
little bit with the occipital lobe then
we<00:02:44.079> have<00:02:44.290> primarily<00:02:44.709> vision<00:02:45.250> stuff<00:02:45.579> and<00:02:45.940> it

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
we have primarily vision stuff and it

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.680 
we have primarily vision stuff and it
really<00:02:47.049> is<00:02:47.290> set<00:02:47.530> aside<00:02:47.620> mostly<00:02:48.250> for<00:02:48.459> vision<00:02:48.820> so

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
really is set aside mostly for vision so

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.509 
really is set aside mostly for vision so
the<00:02:49.900> other<00:02:50.049> loads<00:02:50.320> will<00:02:50.530> have<00:02:50.709> several

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
the other loads will have several

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.430 
the other loads will have several
different<00:02:51.970> functions<00:02:52.450> thanks<00:02:53.019> simple<00:02:53.320> tool

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
different functions thanks simple tool

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.720 
different functions thanks simple tool
old<00:02:53.620> is<00:02:53.769> the<00:02:53.890> only<00:02:54.010> one<00:02:54.250> that's<00:02:54.459> kind<00:02:54.670> of

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
old is the only one that's kind of

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.509 
old is the only one that's kind of
purely<00:02:55.120> set<00:02:55.450> aside<00:02:55.690> for<00:02:55.870> one<00:02:56.019> thing<00:02:56.459> for<00:02:57.459> the

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
purely set aside for one thing for the

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.640 
purely set aside for one thing for the
most<00:02:57.670> part<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:58.150> then<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.989> temporal<00:02:59.470> lobe

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
most part and then the temporal lobe

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.650 
most part and then the temporal lobe
down<00:02:59.950> here<00:03:00.340> where<00:03:00.549> the<00:03:00.670> sunlight<00:03:01.090> projection

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
down here where the sunlight projection

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.240 
down here where the sunlight projection
is<00:03:01.810> the<00:03:02.320> tearful<00:03:02.590> lobe<00:03:02.890> is<00:03:03.010> going<00:03:03.130> to<00:03:03.190> be

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
is the tearful lobe is going to be

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.250 
is the tearful lobe is going to be
involved<00:03:03.459> a<00:03:03.700> couple<00:03:04.209> things<00:03:04.480> but<00:03:04.840> just<00:03:05.140> to

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
involved a couple things but just to

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.130 
involved a couple things but just to
give<00:03:05.470> you<00:03:05.709> one<00:03:06.040> thing<00:03:06.489> to<00:03:06.610> think<00:03:06.850> about<00:03:07.140> the

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
give you one thing to think about the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.990 
give you one thing to think about the
temporal<00:03:08.560> lobe<00:03:08.739> is<00:03:09.040> going<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.280> be<00:03:09.400> involved<00:03:09.670> in

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
temporal lobe is going to be involved in

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.740 
temporal lobe is going to be involved in
audition<00:03:10.690> or<00:03:10.980> hearing<00:03:11.980> so<00:03:12.549> hearing<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.360> found

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
audition or hearing so hearing is found

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.630 
audition or hearing so hearing is found
kind<00:03:14.440> of<00:03:14.530> near<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.739> top<00:03:14.829> part<00:03:15.430> of<00:03:15.579> the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
kind of near the top part of the

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.300 
kind of near the top part of the
temporal<00:03:16.060> lobe<00:03:16.269> so<00:03:16.750> audition<00:03:17.590> or<00:03:17.769> hearing<00:03:18.190> is

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
temporal lobe so audition or hearing is

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.890 
temporal lobe so audition or hearing is
going<00:03:18.489> to<00:03:18.549> end<00:03:18.730> up<00:03:18.910> here<00:03:19.329> so<00:03:19.510> that<00:03:19.629> you<00:03:19.750> can

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
going to end up here so that you can

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.320 
going to end up here so that you can
recognize<00:03:20.319> what<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.620> is<00:03:20.739> you're<00:03:20.890> hearing

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
recognize what it is you're hearing

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.290 
recognize what it is you're hearing
some<00:03:21.600> of<00:03:21.690> those<00:03:21.750> higher-level<00:03:22.010> processes

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
some of those higher-level processes

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.130 
some of those higher-level processes
parietal<00:03:24.300> lobe<00:03:24.420> we've<00:03:24.540> already<00:03:24.690> talked<00:03:24.990> about

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
parietal lobe we've already talked about

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.320 
parietal lobe we've already talked about
body<00:03:25.560> sensations<00:03:26.190> coming<00:03:26.580> in<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.820> front<00:03:26.970> part

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
body sensations coming in the front part

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.690 
body sensations coming in the front part
of<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.570> parietal<00:03:27.960> lobe<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.700> frontal

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
of the parietal lobe and the frontal

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.060 
of the parietal lobe and the frontal
lobe<00:03:29.880> is<00:03:30.240> kind<00:03:30.690> of<00:03:30.840> like<00:03:30.990> it's<00:03:31.590> like<00:03:31.710> the<00:03:31.830> best

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
lobe is kind of like it's like the best

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.370 
lobe is kind of like it's like the best
part<00:03:32.370> of<00:03:32.550> us<00:03:32.730> because<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.510> frontal<00:03:33.960> lobe<00:03:34.170> is

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
part of us because the frontal lobe is

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.350 
part of us because the frontal lobe is
our<00:03:34.500> higher<00:03:34.800> level<00:03:35.370> mental<00:03:35.700> processing

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
our higher level mental processing

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.070 
our higher level mental processing
things<00:03:36.990> like<00:03:37.320> being<00:03:38.280> able<00:03:38.490> to<00:03:38.790> plan<00:03:39.540> grocery

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
things like being able to plan grocery

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
the front part of the frontal lobe what

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.460 
the front part of the frontal lobe what
we<00:03:46.500> actually<00:03:46.680> call<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.190> pre-frontal<00:03:48.000> cortex

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
we actually call the pre-frontal cortex

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.140 
we actually call the pre-frontal cortex
the<00:03:49.470> very<00:03:49.800> front<00:03:50.100> part<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:50.520> the<00:03:50.580> frontal<00:03:50.970> lobe

is our kind of our best part of being

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.420 
is our kind of our best part of being
human<00:03:53.340> and<00:03:53.720> in<00:03:54.720> fact<00:03:55.080> pretty<00:03:55.740> much<00:03:55.800> overall

human and in fact pretty much overall

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.130 
human and in fact pretty much overall
this<00:03:56.730> is<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:57.000> way<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.240> brain<00:03:57.480> is<00:03:57.630> organized

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
this is the way the brain is organized

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.860 
this is the way the brain is organized
it's<00:03:58.650> organized<00:03:59.160> that<00:03:59.520> if<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.880> go<00:04:00.030> up<00:04:00.300> from

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
it's organized that if you go up from

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:02.540 
it's organized that if you go up from

the brain stem from the spinal cords the
brain<00:04:02.760> stem<00:04:02.970> you<00:04:03.600> get<00:04:03.750> higher<00:04:04.020> levels<00:04:04.440> of

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
brain stem you get higher levels of

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.949 
brain stem you get higher levels of
processing<00:04:05.190> with<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.400> brainstem<00:04:05.880> for<00:04:06.660> heart

then<00:04:11.640> as<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:12.090> move<00:04:12.120> further<00:04:12.720> up<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.290> outward

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
then as you move further up and outward

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:15.920 
then as you move further up and outward
into<00:04:14.220> the<00:04:14.310> cortex<00:04:14.850> you<00:04:15.030> get<00:04:15.180> higher<00:04:15.390> levels<00:04:15.840> of

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930

into the cortex you get higher levels of
processing<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.739> then<00:04:17.220> as<00:04:17.370> you<00:04:17.400> move<00:04:17.549> forward

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
processing and then as you move forward

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.259

in the cortex across the cortex you get

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.210 
in the cortex across the cortex you get

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
even higher levels of processing till

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.500 
even higher levels of processing till
you<00:04:23.280> get<00:04:23.400> to<00:04:23.460> this<00:04:23.670> part<00:04:23.940> I<00:04:24.030> was<00:04:24.150> talking<00:04:24.450> about

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
you get to this part I was talking about

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.650 
you get to this part I was talking about
a<00:04:24.660> minute<00:04:24.960> ago<00:04:25.050> the<00:04:25.590> prefrontal<00:04:26.250> cortex<00:04:26.970> for

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
a minute ago the prefrontal cortex for

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.020 
a minute ago the prefrontal cortex for
the<00:04:27.930> best<00:04:28.350> part<00:04:28.650> of<00:04:28.740> being<00:04:28.800> human<00:04:29.190> planning

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
the best part of being human planning

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.820 
the best part of being human planning
ahead<00:04:30.150> really<00:04:31.050> being<00:04:31.290> able<00:04:31.440> to<00:04:31.680> do<00:04:31.800> things

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
ahead really being able to do things

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.810 
ahead really being able to do things
like<00:04:32.450> logic<00:04:33.450> issues<00:04:34.190> very<00:04:35.190> high<00:04:35.460> level

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
like logic issues very high level

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.050 
like logic issues very high level
prefrontal<00:04:36.330> cortex<00:04:36.960> stuff<00:04:37.700> so<00:04:38.700> this<00:04:38.880> is<00:04:39.030> a

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
prefrontal cortex stuff so this is a

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.909 
prefrontal cortex stuff so this is a
little<00:04:39.419> overview<00:04:39.810> of<00:04:40.169> how<00:04:40.350> you<00:04:40.410> can<00:04:40.620> look<00:04:40.800> at

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
little overview of how you can look at

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:42.740 
little overview of how you can look at
the<00:04:41.010> brain<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.430> the<00:04:41.490> cortex<00:04:42.000> and<00:04:42.270> them<00:04:42.480> and

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
the brain and the cortex and them and

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.970 
the brain and the cortex and them and
get<00:04:43.080> a<00:04:43.110> feel<00:04:43.380> for<00:04:43.590> that<00:04:43.650> it's<00:04:43.800> separated

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
get a feel for that it's separated

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.150 
get a feel for that it's separated
primarily<00:04:44.730> into<00:04:45.120> four<00:04:45.360> different<00:04:45.570> lobes<00:04:46.160> some

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
primarily into four different lobes some

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.130 
primarily into four different lobes some
people<00:04:47.430> talk<00:04:47.640> about<00:04:47.669> five<00:04:48.180> lobes<00:04:48.540> but<00:04:48.960> for

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
people talk about five lobes but for

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.300 
people talk about five lobes but for
this<00:04:49.260> class<00:04:49.500> we're<00:04:49.860> just<00:04:49.980> going<00:04:50.100> to<00:04:50.130> talk

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
this class we're just going to talk

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.270 
this class we're just going to talk
about<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.640> four<00:04:50.850> main<00:04:51.090> ones<00:04:51.770> if<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:52.950> ever<00:04:53.070> get

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 
about the four main ones if you ever get

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.920 
about the four main ones if you ever get
on<00:04:53.400> a<00:04:53.430> test<00:04:53.730> and<00:04:53.970> you<00:04:54.090> kind<00:04:54.390> of<00:04:54.419> stumped<00:04:54.780> and

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
on a test and you kind of stumped and

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.659 
on a test and you kind of stumped and
you<00:04:55.230> think<00:04:55.410> okay<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:55.800> don't<00:04:55.980> remember<00:04:56.370> how<00:04:56.610> to

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
you think okay I don't remember how to

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.120 
you think okay I don't remember how to
kind<00:04:57.150> of<00:04:57.210> think<00:04:57.419> about<00:04:57.540> the<00:04:57.780> brain<00:04:57.990> you<00:04:58.950> can

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
kind of think about the brain you can

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.070 
kind of think about the brain you can
actually<00:04:59.340> it's<00:04:59.880> kind<00:05:00.090> of<00:05:00.120> silly<00:05:00.300> but<00:05:00.600> you<00:05:00.840> can

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
actually it's kind of silly but you can

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.750 
actually it's kind of silly but you can
kind<00:05:01.260> of<00:05:01.320> make<00:05:01.530> a<00:05:01.740> brain<00:05:01.980> for<00:05:02.220> yourself<00:05:02.550> with

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
kind of make a brain for yourself with

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.090 
kind of make a brain for yourself with
your<00:05:02.880> hand<00:05:03.090> so<00:05:03.660> you<00:05:03.690> can<00:05:03.900> do<00:05:04.110> like<00:05:04.229> this<00:05:04.440> if<00:05:04.740> you

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
your hand so you can do like this if you

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.710 
your hand so you can do like this if you
just<00:05:05.280> make<00:05:05.430> a<00:05:05.460> fist<00:05:05.760> you've<00:05:06.210> actually<00:05:06.390> just

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
just make a fist you've actually just

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.420 
just make a fist you've actually just
created<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.169> same<00:05:07.680> diagram<00:05:08.190> for<00:05:08.370> a

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
created the same diagram for a

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.980 
created the same diagram for a
brain<00:05:08.640> and<00:05:08.910> you<00:05:09.270> can<00:05:09.419> kind<00:05:09.570> of<00:05:09.660> think<00:05:09.720> about

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
brain and you can kind of think about

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.420 
brain and you can kind of think about
what<00:05:10.410> we<00:05:10.560> are<00:05:10.590> the<00:05:10.740> different<00:05:11.040> modes<00:05:11.130> to<00:05:11.340> be

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
what we are the different modes to be

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.450 
what we are the different modes to be
located<00:05:11.970> and<00:05:12.290> so<00:05:13.290> you<00:05:13.410> can<00:05:13.530> see<00:05:13.740> that<00:05:13.770> this

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
located and so you can see that this

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.040 
located and so you can see that this
part<00:05:14.790> of<00:05:14.910> a<00:05:15.060> the<00:05:15.360> hand<00:05:15.630> would<00:05:15.810> be<00:05:15.930> the

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
part of a the hand would be the

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.930 
part of a the hand would be the
prefrontal<00:05:16.500> cortex<00:05:17.100> and<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.370> frontal<00:05:17.760> lobe

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
prefrontal cortex and the frontal lobe

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.120 
prefrontal cortex and the frontal lobe
then<00:05:18.600> the<00:05:18.810> parietal<00:05:19.260> lobe<00:05:19.650> then<00:05:19.979> the

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
then the parietal lobe then the

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.600 
then the parietal lobe then the
occipital<00:05:20.490> lobe<00:05:20.760> will<00:05:20.850> be<00:05:20.910> kind<00:05:21.090> of<00:05:21.150> in<00:05:21.240> the

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
occipital lobe will be kind of in the

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.730 
occipital lobe will be kind of in the
and<00:05:21.699> then<00:05:22.150> the<00:05:22.270> thumb<00:05:22.539> of<00:05:22.569> course<00:05:23.020> is<00:05:23.289> going<00:05:23.650> to

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
and then the thumb of course is going to

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.070 
and then the thumb of course is going to
represent<00:05:23.889> the<00:05:24.460> temporal<00:05:24.849> lobe<00:05:25.030> so<00:05:25.750> hopefully

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
represent the temporal lobe so hopefully

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.140 
represent the temporal lobe so hopefully
that<00:05:26.169> kind<00:05:26.379> of<00:05:26.409> help<00:05:26.620> you<00:05:26.710> to<00:05:26.949> be<00:05:27.159> able<00:05:27.250> to<00:05:27.520> have

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.150 
that kind of help you to be able to have

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.450 
that kind of help you to be able to have
some<00:05:28.479> kinesthetic<00:05:29.349> feedback<00:05:29.379> or<00:05:30.159> feedback

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
some kinesthetic feedback or feedback

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.800 
some kinesthetic feedback or feedback
from<00:05:30.699> your<00:05:30.819> body<00:05:31.030> what<00:05:31.300> you're<00:05:31.389> doing<00:05:31.629> things

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
from your body what you're doing things

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:33.450 
from your body what you're doing things
to<00:05:32.050> kind<00:05:32.169> of<00:05:32.259> help<00:05:32.409> remember<00:05:32.919> the<00:05:32.949> stuff<00:05:33.310> in
