them on eBay I think it's where I got
mine<00:03:48.720> from<00:03:48.870> I<00:03:49.049> don't<00:03:49.140> know<00:03:49.260> where<00:03:49.350> they're

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590

mine from I don't know where they're
from<00:03:49.620> originally<00:03:50.340> and<00:03:52.609> I<00:03:53.609> think<00:03:54.890> some<00:03:55.890> people

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
from originally and I think some people

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.349 
from originally and I think some people
say<00:03:56.280> they're<00:03:56.430> expensive<00:03:56.730> but<00:03:56.940> I<00:03:57.090> think<00:03:57.269> you

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
say they're expensive but I think you

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:58.729 
say they're expensive but I think you
can<00:03:57.569> get<00:03:57.810> them<00:03:57.989> for<00:03:58.200> a<00:03:58.260> good<00:03:58.410> price

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
I usually see them in the US and I think

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.470
