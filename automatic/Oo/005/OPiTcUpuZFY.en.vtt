00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.060
Welcome back to The Dead Ball Area

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.560
Bernard Foley has come in for a lot of criticism after his kicking display against Argentina.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.480
Taking the glass half full approach, 5 out of 9 attempts doesn’t feel like the worst stat ever,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.040
but does suggest there is perhaps some justification in the criticism

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.740
and looking at the kicks individually showed there was a fair amount of erraticness.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.760
Top flight goal kicking is all about being able to maintain consistency.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.080
Something that was lacking in Foley's performance.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.980
So we’re going to have  quick look at his goal kicking against Argentina

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.460
and we’ll start by breaking down Foley's kicking process into four stages:

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.120
Alignment, Visulisation, Approach and the Strike - where he hits the ball.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.100
Like a lot of goal kickers Foley sets the seam in the middle,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.480
using it as a guideline to plot the foots path through the ball and the trajectory the ball will take once it’s left the foot.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.180
Laying it this flat reduces the contact area, which in return reduces the room for error.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.680
But it also means all the power of the kick is localised to a small area

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.200
and as such travels through the middle of the ball in a direct line.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.660
This means the ball should fly truer for longer.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.280
He also sets it very high for an instep kicker.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.640
As we can see here his foot could almost slide underneath the ball,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.480
meaning the need for accuracy at contact is paramount.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.480
This is all quite standard.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.360
Foley also has a relatively short and neat visualization process.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.820
Here we can see him focusing on where he will strike the ball

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.820
before he comes up to check the flight path

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.540
plotting from the apex of the kick backwards to the contact area of the ball.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.080
Which leads us into the approach process of his kick.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.980
First we have the activation process, which facilitates going from static to moving,

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.740
which is this step backwards

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.420
allowing his muscles to relax and begin moving in a manner that helps his approach to the ball.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.920
Which consists of this big step forward and then the acceleration process,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.420
which is these two fast steps, ending in the leg swing into the strike.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.780
As we can see when he strikes the ball Foley uses his instep,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:08.460
keeping his lower leg very rigid until the ball has left his foot, resulting in this soccer like chip kick.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.420
He also has very little follow through, which is not that unusual for an around the corner kicker,

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.000
and he keeps his head down till the ball has left the foot finishing with his shoulders square to where the ball is traveling.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.500
It’s all pretty simple, and all pretty standard.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.980
So now with that in mind lets look at some of the kicks and see what’s happening.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.760
We’ll start with what I felt was his best kick of the night

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.300
a penalty at around the 39 minute mark and we’ll use that as a reference point.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.820
We can see him plotting the flight path back to his striking point.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:39.300
As highlighted before he takes a step backwards, approaches and takes two quick steps before planting his foot and swinging through the ball.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.580
If we watch the flight of the ball we can see that even as it clears the posts, it’s spinning end over end maintaining a relatively straight trajectory.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.380
And for me that’s an important tell as we’ll hopefully see later on.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.660
If we go back to his first penalty kick of the night we can see him follow the same process.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.020
But when he strikes the ball although it sets off on it’s end over end trajectory,

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.820
early in the kick we can see that flatten out and the ball starts to spin through a diagonal axis

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.380
with the bottom leaning in and the ball spinning off to the right in a slice.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.600
So we know straight away he’s come underneath the ball and the strike has gone through the point.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.380
at an angle from right to left, pushing the bottom of the ball to the left causing the balls trajectory to spin off to the right.

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.800
Creating that Slice.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.840
If we stop the video here we can see that his kicking leg has come a lot farther around then usual,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.800
and I think the reason he’s done that is his supporting foot is further forward

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.600
and as such his foot has come through more than it would normally.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.500
On this next kick we can see the same process occur but this time he tops the kick it clearing the bar despite it being all over the shop.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.420
This time I think his supporting foot is too far back so he’s coming over the top of the ball rather than lifting it off the tee

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.140
On this next kick  at 69 min if we look through the actual strike we can see the ball is leaving Foley's foot very late,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.140
so in essence he’s pulling in and under the ball making it spin.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.320
luckily on this occasion it works in his favour and even though it’s a dog of a kick it swings back in and around,

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.760
but again note how it bends around to the right.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.700
So we’re definitely seeing inconsistency in how he strikes the ball,

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.180
and I think a lot of it is caused by where his supporting leg is in relation to the ball

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.820
and as such he’s losing efficiency in the strike.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.520
This time we can again see a nice clean strike and the ball maintain it’s end over end trajectory right the way through.

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.940
On this kick

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.500
even though it’s a miss we can see that he gets a good strike and the ball keeps a reasonably true flight path,

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.940
meaning it’s most likely a simple alignment issue.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.000
On both those kicks we can see his striking foot just lifts the ball off the tee rather than drives through it.

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:30.220
At this point i think it’s worth noting that it’s very hard to pick up genuine long term issues in a kickers technique using in game footage.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.400
Really we want low profile shots and different angles so we can do comparatives,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.640
but from what we can see,

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.680
I think the biggest variable seems to be where his kicking foot is landing in relation to the ball

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.260
and the knock on effect it has on his timing and the angle he’s striking the ball at.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.680
There could be a number of reasons this has crept in,

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.820
like Golfers kickers develop the yips,

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:54.300
Foley may be working through some adjustments to his technique and it’s not unusual for a kicker to lose his shape when bringing small tweaks into his routine.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.420
One of the key reasons he’s in the Wallabies squad though is his goal kicking,

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.520
so the key here is how Foley reacts to the on/off nature of his last kicking performance

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.200
and whether he can regain that consistency in his timing.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.460
I’m a fan of foley, and i think he’ll be able to do so,

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.420
but the real question is whether or not he can do it in time for the world cup.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.820
Thanks for watching and don’t forget to follow us on facebook and twitter.
