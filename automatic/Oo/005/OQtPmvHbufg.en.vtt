00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 some of the utilities that we most 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.430
 they like are bootcamp that is this 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.350
 application here that allows us 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.179
 restart windows directly if 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.370
 we click here therefore not 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.290
 we have to be restarting the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.150
 computer manually waiting to press 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.369
 the action key and we simply give here 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:21.300
 and another application is restarted 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.430
 that we like most are this utility of 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.140
 here that is called boss xcaret status that 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.060
 it's for people who have a macbook

 Pro 15-inch retina that has 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.059
 double graphic and as you can see if we launch 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.910
 another application that requires many 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.129
 graphics or a radio for example spain 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.739
 As you can see, it changes directly from graph 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.570
 and we are notified that have changed 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.460
 graphic these notifications that 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.410
 appear here when the applications 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.870
 they are from grow that is another of the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.800
 utilities that we also like 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.050
 quite 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.430

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.960
 right we do not always have it active what 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.270
 what he's going to do is recognize the music 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.520
 that is playing on our computer and 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.790
 is going to be indicating good for us 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.980
 author the name of the song 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.590
 we can even listen to it with apple 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.900
 quite interesting music another of the 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.020
 utilities that we like for example is 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.460
 price stroke monitor that good then no 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.760
 is neither more nor less than an application 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.370
 that will be monitoring the price of 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.500
 items that we add in this list is 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.170
 totally free has we believe that 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.430
 There are 25 items from then on 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.979
 we have to pay for the next 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.320
 version and well then it will notify us 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.240
 when the item goes down we can 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.400
 configure it in such a way that when the 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.100
 price then go down 20 percent a 25 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.770

 to be able to buy it another application that 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.810

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.910

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.750
 We consider it a kind of 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.150
 bible of the wisdom of love is this 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.610
