forty-eight<00:03:34.660> percent<00:03:34.870> now<00:03:35.230> looking<00:03:35.530> at<00:03:35.590> the

forty-eight percent now looking at the

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.340 
if it's going to happen so yo and ends
up<00:03:39.910> calculating<00:03:40.660> this<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:40.959> sees<00:03:41.110> that<00:03:41.140> it's

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
good damage all this time and he takes

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.910 
good damage all this time and he takes
out<00:03:50.350> de<00:03:51.310> jirachi<00:03:51.640> now<00:03:52.360> here<00:03:52.780> he<00:03:52.930> realizes<00:03:53.709> that

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
out de jirachi now here he realizes that

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.759 
out de jirachi now here he realizes that
he<00:03:54.850> really<00:03:55.060> can't<00:03:55.450> let<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:56.049> hack<00:03:56.290> souris<00:03:56.560> get

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
he really can't let that hack souris get

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.910 
he really can't let that hack souris get
one<00:03:57.010> free<00:03:57.370> dragon<00:03:57.850> dance<00:03:58.060> or<00:03:58.530> he's<00:03:59.530> basically

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
one free dragon dance or he's basically

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.280 
one free dragon dance or he's basically
done<00:04:00.310> because<00:04:00.940> before<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:01.810> dragon<00:04:02.019> dance

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
done because before the dragon dance

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.569 
done because before the dragon dance
he's<00:04:02.440> actually<00:04:02.560> able<00:04:02.799> to<00:04:02.950> survive<00:04:03.250> a<00:04:03.310> close

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
he's actually able to survive a close

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.300 
he's actually able to survive a close
combat<00:04:03.760> so<00:04:04.030> he<00:04:04.239> uses<00:04:05.140> the<00:04:05.260> hydro<00:04:05.590> pump<00:04:05.829> on<00:04:06.070> the

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
combat so he uses the hydro pump on the

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.280 
combat so he uses the hydro pump on the
hexers<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:06.820> first<00:04:07.030> term<00:04:07.239> hoping<00:04:08.019> that<00:04:08.140> he's

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
hexers the first term hoping that he's

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.780 
hexers the first term hoping that he's
going<00:04:08.500> to<00:04:08.620> drag<00:04:08.920> and<00:04:09.160> dancing<00:04:09.519> he's<00:04:09.610> knows

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
going to drag and dancing he's knows

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.850 
going to drag and dancing he's knows
that<00:04:10.030> since<00:04:10.209> he's<00:04:10.360> a<00:04:10.390> scarf<00:04:10.750> Rotom<00:04:11.170> it's

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
that since he's a scarf Rotom it's

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.560 
that since he's a scarf Rotom it's
pretty<00:04:12.100> safe<00:04:12.310> for<00:04:12.549> him<00:04:12.610> now<00:04:12.760> here<00:04:13.090> he's<00:04:13.390> got<00:04:13.540> a

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
pretty safe for him now here he's got a

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.819 
pretty safe for him now here he's got a
couple<00:04:13.720> options<00:04:13.959> he<00:04:14.440> can<00:04:14.590> switch<00:04:14.799> to

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
couple options he can switch to

ferrothorn but Farrell throne does get

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.229 
ferrothorn but Farrell throne does get
the<00:04:17.890> option<00:04:18.220> that<00:04:18.250> hackers<00:04:18.700> might<00:04:18.910> be<00:04:19.060> able<00:04:19.120> to

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
the option that hackers might be able to

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.969 
the option that hackers might be able to
set<00:04:19.450> up<00:04:19.570> a<00:04:19.660> little<00:04:19.870> more<00:04:20.019> he<00:04:20.260> doesn't<00:04:20.799> want<00:04:20.859> to

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
set up a little more he doesn't want to

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.650 
set up a little more he doesn't want to
risk<00:04:21.130> something<00:04:21.400> weird<00:04:21.789> like<00:04:21.880> a<00:04:22.030> rest<00:04:22.330> chest

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.409 
risk something weird like a rest chest
Oh<00:04:22.840> set<00:04:23.220> so<00:04:24.220> he<00:04:24.460> ends<00:04:24.640> up<00:04:24.700> just<00:04:24.849> sacrificing

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
Oh set so he ends up just sacrificing

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:26.680 
Oh set so he ends up just sacrificing
Dragonite<00:04:25.960> because<00:04:26.380> if<00:04:26.470> you

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
Dragonite because if you

used earthquake you just extreme speed

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.580 
used earthquake you just extreme speed

revenge's<00:04:31.430> with<00:04:31.880> the<00:04:32.210> close<00:04:32.450> combat<00:04:32.840> right

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
revenge's with the close combat right

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.300 
revenge's with the close combat right
there<00:04:33.590> so<00:04:34.010> now<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.190> scores<00:04:34.610> level<00:04:34.850> at<00:04:35.450> 323<00:04:36.310> now

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
there so now the scores level at 323 now

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.430 
there so now the scores level at 323 now
right<00:04:37.520> now<00:04:37.550> it's<00:04:38.120> tornadus<00:04:38.540> at<00:04:38.780> fifty<00:04:39.110> percent

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
right now it's tornadus at fifty percent

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.590 
right now it's tornadus at fifty percent
and<00:04:39.680> the<00:04:39.820> calculations<00:04:40.820> show<00:04:41.000> that<00:04:41.030> are<00:04:41.420> the

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
and the calculations show that are the

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.240 
and the calculations show that are the
close<00:04:41.780> comment<00:04:42.200> I<00:04:42.290> think<00:04:42.500> it<00:04:42.590> had<00:04:42.740> a<00:04:42.770> small

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
close comment I think it had a small

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.520 
close comment I think it had a small
chance<00:04:43.610> to<00:04:44.270> one<00:04:44.480> hit<00:04:44.600> KO<00:04:44.750> but<00:04:44.990> he<00:04:45.110> didn't<00:04:45.380> want

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
chance to one hit KO but he didn't want

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.220 
chance to one hit KO but he didn't want
to<00:04:45.620> risk<00:04:45.770> it<00:04:45.980> so<00:04:46.550> he<00:04:46.730> just<00:04:46.940> sacrificed<00:04:47.870> as<00:04:48.050> his

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:48.230 
to risk it so he just sacrificed as his

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.110 
to risk it so he just sacrificed as his
politoed<00:04:48.740> was<00:04:48.950> pretty<00:04:49.190> much<00:04:49.370> useless<00:04:49.640> at<00:04:50.000> this

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
politoed was pretty much useless at this

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.970 
politoed was pretty much useless at this
point<00:04:50.390> of<00:04:50.480> the<00:04:50.540> battle<00:04:50.870> and<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.620> gives<00:04:51.800> them<00:04:51.860> a

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980 
point of the battle and it gives them a

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.700 
point of the battle and it gives them a
chance<00:04:52.010> to<00:04:52.370> send<00:04:52.730> in<00:04:52.970> his<00:04:53.510> Rotom<00:04:53.960> w<00:04:54.290> now<00:04:54.500> right

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
chance to send in his Rotom w now right

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.170 
chance to send in his Rotom w now right
here<00:04:54.950> he's<00:04:55.100> got<00:04:55.190> two<00:04:55.400> options<00:04:55.550> he<00:04:55.850> can<00:04:55.970> vote

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
here he's got two options he can vote

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.810 
here he's got two options he can vote
switch<00:04:56.450> and<00:04:56.630> hit<00:04:56.990> politoed<00:04:57.560> or<00:04:58.070> tornadus<00:04:58.580> or

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
switch and hit politoed or tornadus or

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.610 
switch and hit politoed or tornadus or
we<00:04:58.880> could<00:04:59.000> hydro<00:04:59.300> pump<00:04:59.480> and<00:04:59.690> hit<00:04:59.840> dugtrio<00:05:00.350> and

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
we could hydro pump and hit dugtrio and

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.460 
we could hydro pump and hit dugtrio and
tornadoes<00:05:01.340> and<00:05:01.520> he<00:05:01.910> ends<00:05:02.210> up<00:05:02.270> going<00:05:02.810> for<00:05:03.320> the

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
tornadoes and he ends up going for the

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.190 
tornadoes and he ends up going for the
hydro<00:05:03.920> pump<00:05:04.070> as<00:05:04.340> peachy<00:05:05.180> switches<00:05:05.990> and

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
hydro pump as peachy switches and

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.960 
hydro pump as peachy switches and
dugtrio<00:05:06.710> which<00:05:06.950> is<00:05:07.130> critical<00:05:07.490> absolutely

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
dugtrio which is critical absolutely

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.730 
dugtrio which is critical absolutely
critical<00:05:08.930> and<00:05:10.180> it<00:05:11.180> allows<00:05:11.510> him<00:05:11.840> to<00:05:12.050> really<00:05:12.530> set

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
critical and it allows him to really set

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.700 
critical and it allows him to really set
up<00:05:12.860> pretty<00:05:13.490> easy<00:05:13.790> win<00:05:14.180> situation<00:05:14.960> so<00:05:15.500> right

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710
