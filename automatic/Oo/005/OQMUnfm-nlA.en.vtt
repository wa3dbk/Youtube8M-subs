00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.660
 the festival that we are presenting this 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:14.230
 tomorrow will take place on Friday 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:17.380

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:21.160
 August and Sunday, August 1 is going to 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:25.090
 take place between the comarca of levante 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.710
 among some of the previous parties 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.410
 are going to carry out in the area of 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.680
 mojácar but the bulk of the festival 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.600
 will be carried out entirely in the 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.940
 municipality of pulpí concretely in the 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.440
 coast in san juan de los terreros 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.320
 effective that we are presenting this 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.090
 tomorrow is very important not only for the 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.250
 Levante region not even for the 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:47.920
 province of almería but it is a festival 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.230
 that is unprecedented we would say could 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.120
 say nationally because to a 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.760
 festival that where a rhythm is combined 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.309
 urban rhythm urban music and a rhythm 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:05.269
 Latin and good let's have the 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:08.060
 presence as daddy yankee and well then 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.159
 very often by all lovers of 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.590
 Latin music of the Latin rhythm and is 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.440
 having a great impact you have to have in 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.600
 account that is breaking record at level 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.720
 at all times of visitors that 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.360
 they do it at the national and at the 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.340
 provincial since we have to give it a 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.170
 alternative to that sun and beach tourism 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.820
 that's why we take this edition 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.770
 I think it's very successful to be able to 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.080
 finalize in the municipality of groupies the 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.640
 province of almería an event of this 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.310
 magnitude in which all those who 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.040
 be lovers of Latin music 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.100
 you'll enjoy 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.470
 the 10 30 31 and August 1 of this 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.600
 event on the part of the culp argument and 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.970
 on the part of exit ambientaciones we are going to 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.070
 to do everything on our part so that the 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.540
 development of it so be able to 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.000
 enjoy it and have no 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.220
 negative impact on the municipality of 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.140
 pulpí is there when the bullfighters I think 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.270
 that we are offering a product that 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.790
 is equating the whole concept of the 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.110
 Latin music music to the concept 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.640
 of electronic music because in these 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.170
 moments at the international level are 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.509
 having a very similar impact and 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.510
 very parallel in growing boom the latina 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.430
 and well in these moments I think that 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.590
 we bring a poster absolutely 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.990
 representative of that musical panorama and 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.700
 They were very happy to be able to do it 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.700
 here in this area in almería
