you<00:04:10.190> go<00:04:10.310> pause<00:04:10.459> the<00:04:10.610> screen<00:04:10.730> if<00:04:10.970> you<00:04:11.060> want<00:04:11.239> and

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
you go pause the screen if you want and

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.210 
you go pause the screen if you want and
there's<00:04:13.340> some<00:04:13.489> of<00:04:13.580> the<00:04:13.670> other<00:04:13.850> than<00:04:14.030> phone<00:04:15.220> ok

there's some of the other than phone ok

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.820 
there's some of the other than phone ok
so<00:04:16.880> I<00:04:17.239> think<00:04:17.390> that<00:04:17.720> this<00:04:17.900> is<00:04:17.959> just<00:04:18.290> about<00:04:18.560> wraps

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
so I think that this is just about wraps

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.460 
so I think that this is just about wraps
