00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
a lot of people who play the game really

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.210 
a lot of people who play the game really
want<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.610> see<00:00:02.760> Pluto<00:00:03.179> or<00:00:03.620> splooge<00:00:04.620> o<00:00:04.740> in<00:00:04.920> the

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
want to see Pluto or splooge o in the

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.610 
want to see Pluto or splooge o in the
game<00:00:05.400> so<00:00:06.120> today<00:00:06.420> I'm<00:00:06.540> going<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.960> go<00:00:07.440> through

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
game so today I'm going to go through

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.129 
game so today I'm going to go through
the<00:00:07.710> steps<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.280> add<00:00:08.460> split<00:00:09.269> oh<00:00:09.389> and<00:00:09.630> you<00:00:10.019> could

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
the steps to add split oh and you could

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.499 
the steps to add split oh and you could
use<00:00:10.260> these<00:00:10.469> same<00:00:10.650> steps<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.130> add<00:00:11.250> any<00:00:12.210> kind<00:00:12.450> of

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
use these same steps to add any kind of

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.990 
use these same steps to add any kind of
planet<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.840> want<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.190> even<00:00:14.190> like<00:00:14.460> a<00:00:14.490> even

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
planet you want to even like a even

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.029 
planet you want to even like a even
bigger<00:00:15.210> gas<00:00:15.540> giant<00:00:15.960> or<00:00:16.109> an<00:00:16.440> asteroid<00:00:17.010> or

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
bigger gas giant or an asteroid or

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.790 
bigger gas giant or an asteroid or
whatever<00:00:18.109> the<00:00:19.109> first<00:00:19.320> step<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.590> going<00:00:19.650> to<00:00:19.740> be

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
whatever the first step is going to be

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.740 
whatever the first step is going to be
always<00:00:20.640> make<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> backup<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:22.020> of<00:00:23.010> your

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
always make a backup of the of your

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.730 
always make a backup of the of your
installation<00:00:24.750> folder<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.410> don't<00:00:25.560> want<00:00:25.680> to

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
installation folder you don't want to

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.019 
installation folder you don't want to
actually<00:00:25.890> work<00:00:26.130> out<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.430> where<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.670> game<00:00:26.849> is

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
actually work out of where the game is

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.480 
actually work out of where the game is
is<00:00:27.930> actually<00:00:28.289> installed<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:28.949> make<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> copy<00:00:29.369> of

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
is actually installed so make a copy of

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.600 
is actually installed so make a copy of
that<00:00:30.529> paste<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.679> somewhere<00:00:31.800> else<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.309> mean<00:00:32.430> I'm

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
that paste it somewhere else I mean I'm

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.370 
that paste it somewhere else I mean I'm
working<00:00:32.730> out<00:00:32.940> of<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.149> folder<00:00:33.510> see<00:00:33.690> dev<00:00:33.899> just

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
working out of this folder see dev just

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.100 
working out of this folder see dev just
where<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.649> typically<00:00:35.250> put<00:00:35.430> all<00:00:35.520> my<00:00:36.110> development

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
where I typically put all my development

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.440 
where I typically put all my development
stuff<00:00:37.460> so<00:00:38.460> go<00:00:38.579> into<00:00:38.700> civil<00:00:38.940> rockets<00:00:39.270> and

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
stuff so go into civil rockets and

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.780 
stuff so go into civil rockets and
there's<00:00:40.440> really<00:00:40.649> only<00:00:40.770> one<00:00:41.160> file<00:00:41.370> you<00:00:41.399> need<00:00:41.730> to

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
there's really only one file you need to

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.600 
there's really only one file you need to
modify<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.570> add<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.719> planet<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.710> smaller

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
modify to add a planet and it is smaller

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.840 
modify to add a planet and it is smaller
system<00:00:45.059> dot<00:00:45.210> XML<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.590> might<00:00:47.520> be<00:00:47.640> kind

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
system dot XML so this is might be kind

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.190 
system dot XML so this is might be kind
of<00:00:47.969> self-explanatory

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
of self-explanatory

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.510 
of self-explanatory
some<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.710> things<00:00:49.860> in<00:00:50.070> here<00:00:50.190> these<00:00:50.340> are<00:00:50.399> all

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
some of the things in here these are all

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.880 
some of the things in here these are all
the<00:00:50.640> planets<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.270> are<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> game<00:00:51.829> so<00:00:52.829> you

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
the planets that are in the game so you

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.319 
the planets that are in the game so you
can<00:00:53.010> look<00:00:53.100> at<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.760> mercury<00:00:54.059> right

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
can look at like this is mercury right

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.670 
can look at like this is mercury right
here<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.690> has<00:00:54.899> all<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> information<00:00:55.410> about

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
here it has all the information about

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.639 
here it has all the information about
smart<00:00:56.039> grid<00:00:56.219> as<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.550> gravity<00:00:57.079> radius<00:00:58.079> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
smart grid as the gravity radius the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.400 
smart grid as the gravity radius the
color<00:00:58.920> all<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.850> stuff<00:01:00.090> there's<00:01:00.989> another<00:01:01.140> tag

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
color all that stuff there's another tag

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.720 
color all that stuff there's another tag
here<00:01:01.649> which<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.980> orbit<00:01:02.280> which<00:01:02.399> defines

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
here which the orbit which defines

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.460 
here which the orbit which defines
exactly<00:01:03.420> how<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.570> orbit<00:01:03.899> looks<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.350> these

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
exactly how the orbit looks and these

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.219 
exactly how the orbit looks and these
are<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.920> orbital<00:01:05.580> parameters<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.330> can

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
are the orbital parameters and you can

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.359 
are the orbital parameters and you can
look<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.439> up<00:01:07.500> on<00:01:07.650> Wikipedia<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.130> find<00:01:08.310> out

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
look that up on Wikipedia to find out

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.460 
look that up on Wikipedia to find out
what<00:01:08.490> all<00:01:08.700> these<00:01:08.790> things<00:01:08.850> mean<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:09.470> since

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
what all these things mean but since

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.870 
what all these things mean but since
we're<00:01:10.619> simple<00:01:10.890> rockets<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.310> two-dimensional

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
we're simple rockets is two-dimensional

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.560 
we're simple rockets is two-dimensional
I'm<00:01:12.000> only<00:01:12.150> using<00:01:12.390> four<00:01:12.659> out<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> six

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
I'm only using four out of the six

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.240 
I'm only using four out of the six
there's<00:01:15.570> also<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.810> terrain<00:01:16.140> element<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.040> is

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
there's also a terrain element that is

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.940 
there's also a terrain element that is
going<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.520> determine<00:01:17.850> how<00:01:18.420> rocky<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.619> terrain

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
going to determine how rocky the terrain

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.359 
going to determine how rocky the terrain
is<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:21.409> guess<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.560> maximum<00:01:22.979> height<00:01:23.189> of

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
is and I guess the maximum height of

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.480 
is and I guess the maximum height of
peaks<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.619> overall<00:01:25.619> bumpiness<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.130> also<00:01:26.340> how

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
peaks and overall bumpiness and also how

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.080 
peaks and overall bumpiness and also how
it<00:01:26.580> looks<00:01:26.790> which<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.240> texture<00:01:27.630> here<00:01:27.810> and

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
it looks which is the texture here and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
it looks which is the texture here and
you<00:01:30.090> can<00:01:30.240> make<00:01:30.360> your<00:01:30.479> own<00:01:30.509> textures<00:01:30.930> if<00:01:31.049> you

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
you can make your own textures if you

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.520 
you can make your own textures if you
wanted<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.470> I'm<00:01:31.979> just<00:01:32.130> going<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.369> reuse

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
wanted to I'm just going to reuse

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.630 
wanted to I'm just going to reuse
probably<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.590> one<00:01:34.740> from<00:01:34.979> spoon<00:01:35.509> for<00:01:36.509> Pluto<00:01:37.110> or

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
probably the one from spoon for Pluto or

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.850 
probably the one from spoon for Pluto or
split<00:01:38.640> oh<00:01:38.790> okay<00:01:39.540> I'm<00:01:39.630> gonna<00:01:39.750> it's<00:01:40.380> easiest<00:01:40.680> to

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
split oh okay I'm gonna it's easiest to

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.170 
split oh okay I'm gonna it's easiest to
start<00:01:41.220> with<00:01:41.369> an<00:01:41.490> existing<00:01:41.700> planet<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.119> I'm

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
start with an existing planet so I'm

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.210 
start with an existing planet so I'm
gonna<00:01:42.270> go<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.450> copies<00:01:42.780> mercury<00:01:43.200> go<00:01:43.979> down<00:01:44.100> to

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
gonna go in copies mercury go down to

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.789 
gonna go in copies mercury go down to
the<00:01:44.310> bottom<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.850> want<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.299> paste<00:01:45.509> it

here's<00:01:47.640> an<00:01:47.789> Ames<00:01:47.939> flute<00:01:48.270> oh<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.659> then<00:01:48.840> we<00:01:49.380> need

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
here's an Ames flute oh and then we need

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.429 
here's an Ames flute oh and then we need
to<00:01:49.530> know<00:01:49.590> what<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.009> gravity<00:01:50.429> is<00:01:50.609> on<00:01:50.880> Pluto

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.160 
description let's say the old planet
that<00:03:06.450> everybody<00:03:08.510> loves<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.750> misses

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.520 

and<00:03:13.569> now<00:03:14.569> we<00:03:14.630> need<00:03:14.810> to<00:03:14.870> put<00:03:15.020> in<00:03:15.110> the<00:03:15.200> orbital

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
and now we need to put in the orbital

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.290 
and now we need to put in the orbital
elements<00:03:15.920> the<00:03:16.160> the<00:03:16.550> best<00:03:16.670> place<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:16.910> find<00:03:17.030> this

degrees<00:03:31.120> and<00:03:32.500> I<00:03:33.500> actually<00:03:33.680> use<00:03:33.950> radians<00:03:34.220> in

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430

degrees and I actually use radians in
the<00:03:34.490> game<00:03:34.700> so<00:03:34.940> I'm<00:03:35.000> going<00:03:35.120> to<00:03:35.180> go<00:03:35.240> and<00:03:35.390> convert

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
the game so I'm going to go and convert

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.059 
the game so I'm going to go and convert
this<00:03:36.320> to<00:03:36.530> radians<00:03:38.050> using<00:03:39.050> good<00:03:39.200> old<00:03:39.380> Google

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:42.069 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.590 

there<00:03:43.069> we<00:03:43.220> go<00:03:46.060> so<00:03:47.060> one<00:03:47.209> point<00:03:47.330> nine<00:03:47.570> eight

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
there we go so one point nine eight

here

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.559 

that's<00:04:01.260> zero<00:04:01.890> eccentricities<00:04:02.569> circular

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
that's zero eccentricities circular

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.670 
that's zero eccentricities circular
orbit<00:04:03.870> so<00:04:04.579> 0.24<00:04:05.579> is<00:04:05.730> actually<00:04:06.110> as<00:04:07.110> fairly

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
orbit so 0.24 is actually as fairly

elliptical pro-grade equals one this

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:12.890 
elliptical pro-grade equals one this
means<00:04:12.120> that<00:04:12.269> it's<00:04:12.390> going<00:04:12.480> to<00:04:12.540> rotate

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
means that it's going to rotate

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.839 
means that it's going to rotate
counterclockwise<00:04:13.110> around<00:04:13.980> the<00:04:14.310> Sun<00:04:14.519> like<00:04:14.730> all

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.840 
counterclockwise around the Sun like all
the<00:04:14.970> other<00:04:15.120> planets<00:04:15.299> do<00:04:15.569> a<00:04:15.859> is<00:04:16.859> a<00:04:16.919> semi-major

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
the other planets do a is a semi-major

the other planets do a is a semi-major
axis<00:04:21.979> here<00:04:22.979> we<00:04:23.070> go

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.920 

and<00:04:31.639> this<00:04:31.970> is<00:04:32.270> in<00:04:33.280> kilometers<00:04:34.280> so<00:04:34.759> it<00:04:35.720> add

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
and this is in kilometers so it add

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.820 
and this is in kilometers so it add
three<00:04:36.229> zeros<00:04:36.259> to<00:04:36.740> convert<00:04:36.979> it<00:04:37.100> to<00:04:37.130> meters<00:04:37.370> and

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
three zeros to convert it to meters and

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.159 
three zeros to convert it to meters and
then<00:04:39.830> delete<00:04:40.130> one<00:04:40.340> 2/10<00:04:41.240> the<00:04:41.600> last<00:04:41.810> one<00:04:41.990> here

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
then delete one 2/10 the last one here

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.450 
then delete one 2/10 the last one here
is<00:04:42.199> the<00:04:42.530> true<00:04:42.710> anomaly<00:04:42.889> and<00:04:45.100> I'm<00:04:46.100> just<00:04:46.340> going

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
is the true anomaly and I'm just going

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.159 
is the true anomaly and I'm just going
to<00:04:46.490> use<00:04:46.610> the<00:04:46.729> current<00:04:47.030> true<00:04:47.300> anomaly<00:04:47.449> of<00:04:47.810> Pluto

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
to use the current true anomaly of Pluto

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:49.930 
to use the current true anomaly of Pluto
which<00:04:48.380> is<00:04:48.530> the<00:04:49.160> true<00:04:49.340> anomaly<00:04:49.490> is<00:04:49.789> the

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
which is the true anomaly is the

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.129 
which is the true anomaly is the
position<00:04:50.240> of<00:04:50.330> the<00:04:50.419> planet<00:04:50.690> along<00:04:50.900> its<00:04:51.050> orbit

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
position of the planet along its orbit

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:53.290 
position of the planet along its orbit
so<00:04:51.470> I've<00:04:52.340> looked<00:04:52.490> at<00:04:52.639> up<00:04:52.729> on<00:04:52.850> Wolfram<00:04:53.150> Alpha

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
so I've looked at up on Wolfram Alpha

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.550 
so I've looked at up on Wolfram Alpha
and<00:04:53.740> currently<00:04:54.740> it<00:04:55.009> is<00:04:55.190> here<00:04:56.060> point<00:04:56.630> nine

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
and currently it is here point nine

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.080 
and currently it is here point nine
eight<00:04:57.590> four<00:04:57.889> two<00:04:57.949> radians<00:04:58.490> and<00:04:58.789> that<00:04:58.880> is<00:04:59.000> in

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
eight four two radians and that is in

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:06.249 
eight four two radians and that is in
radians<00:05:02.889> one<00:05:03.889> that's<00:05:04.099> a<00:05:04.250> nine<00:05:05.229> nine<00:05:06.229> eight

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:06.259 
radians one that's a nine nine eight

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:11.770 
radians one that's a nine nine eight
four<00:05:08.949> okay<00:05:09.949> so<00:05:10.940> the<00:05:11.030> terrain<00:05:11.360> element<00:05:11.720> down

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
four okay so the terrain element down

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.339 
four okay so the terrain element down
here<00:05:11.840> we<00:05:12.289> have<00:05:13.570> the<00:05:14.570> max<00:05:14.780> height<00:05:14.960> which<00:05:15.110> is<00:05:15.229> how

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
here we have the max height which is how

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:17.170 
here we have the max height which is how
tall<00:05:15.620> like<00:05:15.979> the<00:05:16.070> tallest<00:05:16.400> peaks<00:05:16.580> can<00:05:16.759> be<00:05:16.910> I'm

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
tall like the tallest peaks can be I'm

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.550 
tall like the tallest peaks can be I'm
going<00:05:17.300> to<00:05:17.360> leave<00:05:17.479> that<00:05:17.509> the<00:05:17.720> same<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:18.349> noise

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:18.560 
going to leave that the same the noise

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.920 
going to leave that the same the noise
is<00:05:18.949> how<00:05:19.160> bumpy<00:05:19.849> and<00:05:20.000> rocky<00:05:20.240> the<00:05:20.509> surface<00:05:20.780> is

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
is how bumpy and rocky the surface is

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:22.900 
is how bumpy and rocky the surface is
I'm<00:05:21.139> going<00:05:21.289> to<00:05:21.380> double<00:05:21.830> this<00:05:21.949> I'm<00:05:22.639> kind<00:05:22.880> of

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
I'm going to double this I'm kind of

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.159 
I'm going to double this I'm kind of
curious<00:05:23.090> what<00:05:23.479> that<00:05:23.539> looks<00:05:23.780> like<00:05:23.840> might<00:05:24.050> look

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
curious what that looks like might look

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.420 
curious what that looks like might look
kind<00:05:24.349> of<00:05:24.410> horrible<00:05:24.830> but<00:05:26.410> for<00:05:27.410> the<00:05:27.470> texture<00:05:28.190> I'm

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
kind of horrible but for the texture I'm

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.650 
kind of horrible but for the texture I'm
going<00:05:28.580> to<00:05:28.669> actually<00:05:28.789> use<00:05:29.120> the<00:05:29.330> one<00:05:29.479> that<00:05:29.599> we

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
going to actually use the one that we

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.260 
going to actually use the one that we
use<00:05:29.780> force<00:05:30.020> moon<00:05:30.349> and<00:05:30.710> the<00:05:31.340> color<00:05:31.580> this<00:05:32.030> is<00:05:32.240> the

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
use force moon and the color this is the

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:37.510 
use force moon and the color this is the
color<00:05:32.360> below<00:05:33.130> the<00:05:34.130> crust<00:05:35.860> the<00:05:36.860> surface<00:05:37.220> crust

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
color below the crust the surface crust

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.000 
color below the crust the surface crust
so<00:05:37.909> I'm<00:05:38.150> going<00:05:38.270> to<00:05:38.360> change<00:05:38.750> that<00:05:38.960> and<00:05:39.169> this<00:05:39.830> is

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:40.010 
so I'm going to change that and this is

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.370 
so I'm going to change that and this is
red<00:05:40.940> green<00:05:41.300> and<00:05:41.479> blue<00:05:41.720> so<00:05:41.990> this<00:05:42.080> is<00:05:42.169> actually

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
red green and blue so this is actually

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.689 
red green and blue so this is actually
going<00:05:42.500> to<00:05:42.590> be<00:05:42.680> kind<00:05:42.919> of<00:05:43.010> a<00:05:43.099> great<00:05:43.370> and<00:05:43.550> really

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
going to be kind of a great and really

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.960 
going to be kind of a great and really
really<00:05:43.940> dark<00:05:44.120> grey<00:05:44.479> and<00:05:45.550> okay<00:05:46.550> now<00:05:46.580> let's<00:05:46.849> see

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
really dark grey and okay now let's see

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.839 
really dark grey and okay now let's see
if<00:05:47.120> simple<00:05:47.419> Rockets<00:05:47.720> works<00:05:47.900> now<00:05:48.729> see<00:05:49.729> if<00:05:49.789> you

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:49.849 
if simple Rockets works now see if you

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:52.420 
if simple Rockets works now see if you
can<00:05:49.970> see<00:05:50.150> the<00:05:50.270> new<00:05:50.360> planet<00:05:51.099> go<00:05:52.099> down<00:05:52.250> here<00:05:52.400> to

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:52.430 
can see the new planet go down here to

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:58.990 
can see the new planet go down here to
sandbox<00:05:52.909> mode<00:05:53.180> and<00:05:54.080> it<00:05:54.889> says<00:05:55.130> kid<00:05:55.820> nuts<00:05:58.000> their

00:05:58.990 --> 00:05:59.000 
sandbox mode and it says kid nuts their

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.219 
sandbox mode and it says kid nuts their
message<00:05:59.360> is<00:05:59.449> kind<00:05:59.659> of<00:05:59.690> messed<00:05:59.870> up<00:05:59.930> but<00:05:59.990> it<00:06:00.110> says

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
message is kind of messed up but it says

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:02.200 
message is kind of messed up but it says
I<00:06:00.259> can't<00:06:00.500> find<00:06:00.830> smooth<00:06:01.520> P<00:06:01.849> and<00:06:01.940> G<00:06:01.970> in<00:06:02.120> the

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
I can't find smooth P and G in the

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.249 
I can't find smooth P and G in the
texture<00:06:02.479> Atlas<00:06:02.720> so<00:06:02.870> let's<00:06:03.770> go<00:06:03.889> see<00:06:05.050> what<00:06:06.050> it's

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:06.259 
texture Atlas so let's go see what it's

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:08.050 
texture Atlas so let's go see what it's
talking<00:06:06.470> about<00:06:06.680> Shamoon<00:06:07.190> dot<00:06:07.370> PNG<00:06:07.639> so<00:06:07.849> I<00:06:07.880> use

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
talking about Shamoon dot PNG so I use

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.610 
talking about Shamoon dot PNG so I use
that<00:06:08.090> for<00:06:08.300> the<00:06:08.360> icon<00:06:08.720> so<00:06:09.229> I<00:06:09.289> think<00:06:09.349> that

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
that for the icon so I think that

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.740 
that for the icon so I think that
actually<00:06:09.919> for<00:06:10.849> that<00:06:10.880> icon<00:06:11.240> actually<00:06:11.539> called

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
actually for that icon actually called

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:16.480 
actually for that icon actually called
it<00:06:11.900> moon<00:06:12.169> that<00:06:12.409> PMG<00:06:12.919> I<00:06:13.930> look<00:06:14.930> up<00:06:15.050> its<00:06:15.199> moon<00:06:15.490> yeah

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
it moon that PMG I look up its moon yeah

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:18.219 
it moon that PMG I look up its moon yeah
you're<00:06:16.789> smooth<00:06:17.180> it's<00:06:17.479> actually<00:06:17.750> using<00:06:17.990> moon

00:06:18.219 --> 00:06:18.229 
you're smooth it's actually using moon

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:20.110 
you're smooth it's actually using moon
up<00:06:18.349> handy<00:06:18.620> so<00:06:18.740> I<00:06:18.800> I<00:06:19.039> just<00:06:19.610> had<00:06:19.699> the<00:06:19.759> wrong<00:06:19.909> name

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
up handy so I I just had the wrong name

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.430 
up handy so I I just had the wrong name
for<00:06:20.180> that<00:06:20.449> icon

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.720 

let's<00:06:25.220> try<00:06:25.370> it<00:06:25.430> again<00:06:27.430> scroll<00:06:28.430> to<00:06:28.580> the<00:06:28.700> bottom

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:28.730 
let's try it again scroll to the bottom

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:31.150 
let's try it again scroll to the bottom
let's<00:06:29.690> go<00:06:29.840> to<00:06:29.900> sandbox<00:06:30.350> mode<00:06:30.560> all<00:06:30.920> the<00:06:31.010> way<00:06:31.100> to

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 
let's go to sandbox mode all the way to

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.420 
let's go to sandbox mode all the way to
the<00:06:31.610> end<00:06:31.990> here's<00:06:32.990> Pluto<00:06:33.410> okay<00:06:33.800> so<00:06:34.040> it<00:06:34.130> loaded

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
the end here's Pluto okay so it loaded

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.000 
the end here's Pluto okay so it loaded
it<00:06:34.550> correctly<00:06:34.790> this<00:06:35.000> time<00:06:35.180> and<00:06:35.890> let's<00:06:36.890> go

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.010 
it correctly this time and let's go

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:38.800 
it correctly this time and let's go
ahead<00:06:37.070> and<00:06:37.250> check<00:06:37.370> it<00:06:37.460> out<00:06:37.550> I<00:06:37.880> have<00:06:38.450> a<00:06:38.480> really

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
ahead and check it out I have a really

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:41.620 
ahead and check it out I have a really
small<00:06:39.020> rocket<00:06:39.410> here<00:06:39.590> set<00:06:39.830> up<00:06:40.300> service<00:06:41.300> gravity

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630 
small rocket here set up service gravity

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.420 
small rocket here set up service gravity
is<00:06:41.690> so<00:06:41.840> low<00:06:42.050> even<00:06:42.650> the<00:06:42.770> smallest<00:06:43.010> engine

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430 
is so low even the smallest engine

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.280 
is so low even the smallest engine
should<00:06:43.580> be<00:06:43.700> more<00:06:43.820> than<00:06:44.060> enough<00:06:44.120> to<00:06:44.540> get<00:06:45.080> around

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.290 
should be more than enough to get around

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.680 
should be more than enough to get around
on<00:06:45.470> this<00:06:45.590> thing<00:06:46.090> let's<00:06:47.090> check<00:06:47.330> and<00:06:47.450> see<00:06:47.510> how

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.690 
on this thing let's check and see how

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:51.280 
on this thing let's check and see how
rocky<00:06:47.960> it<00:06:48.170> is<00:06:48.320> sigh<00:06:48.950> I<00:06:49.220> made<00:06:49.670> that<00:06:49.790> I<00:06:50.290> doubled

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.290 
rocky it is sigh I made that I doubled

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.190 
rocky it is sigh I made that I doubled
the<00:06:51.380> rockiness<00:06:51.830> from<00:06:52.360> from<00:06:53.360> smirk<00:06:53.690> Yuri's<00:06:53.960> and

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:54.200 
the rockiness from from smirk Yuri's and

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.050 
the rockiness from from smirk Yuri's and
smirk<00:06:54.410> Yuri<00:06:54.620> is<00:06:54.710> already<00:06:55.040> really<00:06:55.370> rocky<00:06:55.580> so

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060 
smirk Yuri is already really rocky so

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.260 
smirk Yuri is already really rocky so
that's<00:06:56.300> kind<00:06:56.840> of<00:06:56.900> ridiculous<00:06:57.290> looking<00:06:58.270> so

00:06:59.260 --> 00:06:59.270 
that's kind of ridiculous looking so

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:05.680 
that's kind of ridiculous looking so
jagged<00:07:00.490> and<00:07:04.000> let's<00:07:05.000> also<00:07:05.120> look<00:07:05.330> at<00:07:05.420> the<00:07:05.480> math

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:05.690 
jagged and let's also look at the math

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:12.100 
jagged and let's also look at the math
you<00:07:05.870> too<00:07:06.140> so<00:07:06.890> here's<00:07:07.100> sciutto<00:07:07.460> and<00:07:10.960> zoom<00:07:11.960> out

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:12.110 
you too so here's sciutto and zoom out

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:16.330 
you too so here's sciutto and zoom out
really<00:07:12.530> far<00:07:13.750> to<00:07:14.750> see<00:07:14.930> it's<00:07:15.080> up<00:07:15.230> it<00:07:15.830> is<00:07:16.070> on<00:07:16.100> the

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:16.340 
really far to see it's up it is on the

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:17.740 
really far to see it's up it is on the
outskirts<00:07:16.730> of<00:07:16.850> the<00:07:16.910> solar<00:07:17.120> of<00:07:17.450> the<00:07:17.510> smaller

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:17.750 
outskirts of the solar of the smaller

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:20.980 
outskirts of the solar of the smaller
system<00:07:18.140> and<00:07:19.060> the<00:07:20.060> orbit<00:07:20.540> is<00:07:20.630> really

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:20.990 
system and the orbit is really

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.620 
system and the orbit is really
elliptical<00:07:21.920> it<00:07:22.670> looks<00:07:22.880> like<00:07:22.970> it's<00:07:23.120> by<00:07:23.330> far<00:07:23.480> the

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:23.630 
elliptical it looks like it's by far the

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.530 
elliptical it looks like it's by far the
most<00:07:23.720> elliptical<00:07:24.050> orbit<00:07:24.680> in<00:07:24.830> the<00:07:25.420> in<00:07:26.420> the

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:26.540 
most elliptical orbit in the in the

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.900 
most elliptical orbit in the in the
system<00:07:27.280> so<00:07:29.920> one<00:07:30.920> thing<00:07:31.100> to<00:07:31.220> keep<00:07:31.340> in<00:07:31.430> mind<00:07:31.490> is

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:31.910 
system so one thing to keep in mind is

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.090 
system so one thing to keep in mind is
that<00:07:31.940> if<00:07:32.240> you<00:07:32.390> happen<00:07:33.200> to<00:07:33.350> make<00:07:33.530> planets<00:07:34.010> that

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:34.100 
that if you happen to make planets that

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.170 
that if you happen to make planets that
are<00:07:34.250> really<00:07:34.430> close<00:07:34.610> together

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:35.180 
are really close together

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.360 
are really close together
even<00:07:35.870> if<00:07:35.960> they're<00:07:36.080> SOS<00:07:36.560> or<00:07:36.770> overlapping<00:07:37.130> over

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:37.370 
even if they're SOS or overlapping over

00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:38.440 
even if they're SOS or overlapping over
the<00:07:37.430> planets<00:07:37.760> themselves<00:07:38.120> at<00:07:38.210> each<00:07:38.300> other

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:38.450 
the planets themselves at each other

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:40.540 
the planets themselves at each other
that<00:07:38.900> will<00:07:39.050> it<00:07:39.680> won't<00:07:39.800> do<00:07:40.010> anything<00:07:40.190> in<00:07:40.430> this

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.550 
that will it won't do anything in this

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.340 
that will it won't do anything in this
game<00:07:40.730> I<00:07:40.910> don't<00:07:41.060> consider<00:07:41.510> those<00:07:41.810> collisions

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:42.350 
game I don't consider those collisions

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.080 
game I don't consider those collisions
so<00:07:42.950> that<00:07:43.100> the<00:07:43.430> gravity<00:07:43.790> will<00:07:43.850> not<00:07:43.910> have

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:44.090 
so that the gravity will not have

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:44.800 
so that the gravity will not have
luhan's<00:07:44.330> each<00:07:44.420> other

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:44.810 
luhan's each other

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:47.500 
luhan's each other
there's<00:07:45.230> no<00:07:45.380> collisions<00:07:46.120> everything<00:07:47.120> is<00:07:47.240> kind

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:47.510 
there's no collisions everything is kind

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.580 
there's no collisions everything is kind
of<00:07:48.280> computed<00:07:49.690> itself<00:07:50.690> on<00:07:50.930> its<00:07:51.050> own<00:07:51.170> orbital

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:51.590 
of computed itself on its own orbital

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.610 
of computed itself on its own orbital
path<00:07:51.800> it<00:07:52.070> just<00:07:52.220> ignores<00:07:52.550> everything<00:07:52.790> else<00:07:53.620> and

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:54.620 
path it just ignores everything else and

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.960 
path it just ignores everything else and
again<00:07:54.710> that's<00:07:54.950> you<00:07:55.220> know<00:07:55.340> for<00:07:55.550> performance

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:55.970 
again that's you know for performance

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.070 
again that's you know for performance
reasons<00:07:56.120> and<00:07:56.420> it<00:07:56.510> really<00:07:56.690> it<00:07:56.930> really

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:57.080 
reasons and it really it really

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.860 
reasons and it really it really
complicates<00:07:57.710> things<00:07:57.800> a<00:07:57.980> lot<00:07:58.190> if<00:07:58.370> you<00:07:58.460> start

00:07:58.860 --> 00:07:58.870 
complicates things a lot if you start

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:02.500 
complicates things a lot if you start
having<00:08:00.130> planets<00:08:01.130> that<00:08:01.340> are<00:08:01.550> you<00:08:02.420> know

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:02.510 
having planets that are you know

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:04.000 
having planets that are you know
influencing<00:08:03.050> each<00:08:03.110> other<00:08:03.290> with<00:08:03.530> gravity<00:08:03.890> and

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:04.010 
influencing each other with gravity and

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:05.440 
influencing each other with gravity and
things<00:08:04.130> like<00:08:04.250> that<00:08:04.310> that's<00:08:04.790> the<00:08:05.030> basics<00:08:05.360> of

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:05.450 
things like that that's the basics of

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.240 
things like that that's the basics of
how<00:08:05.540> to<00:08:05.570> add<00:08:05.720> a<00:08:05.750> planet<00:08:06.080> to<00:08:06.230> simple<00:08:06.830> Rockets<00:08:07.130> so

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:07.250 
how to add a planet to simple Rockets so

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.880 
how to add a planet to simple Rockets so
I<00:08:07.280> hope<00:08:07.490> you<00:08:07.550> guys<00:08:07.670> enjoyed<00:08:08.030> I<00:08:08.120> hope<00:08:08.450> to<00:08:08.600> see

I hope you guys enjoyed I hope to see
some<00:08:09.890> new<00:08:10.010> planets<00:08:10.340> out<00:08:10.460> there<00:08:10.900> thanks<00:08:11.900> for
