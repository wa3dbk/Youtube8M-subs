 premiere the site a daily 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.000
 What is created here is the one of the makers 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:33.390
 the so-called is not a big one

 Mirror image is over mirror on the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.260
 Mirror mirrored not a real studio 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.000
 everything virtual what the moderator sees 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.239
 also provides protection 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.570
 she is the new daily show she shows 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.550
 bigger more meaningful cook all over 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.739
 consciously decided the quality of

 to emphasize journalism even more 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.570
 so far we only have relatively smaller 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.310
 training beside the speaker we 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.880
 are now quite aware of the way 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.369
 went 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.720
 to have big strong clean the 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.970

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.369
 was 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.270
 he is all clear and clean and that 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.490
 here 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.400
 it is a trash can and now it comes 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:44.850
 best of all here is pure water and 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:47.640

 make the sample 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:09.070
 but the biggest challenge is the

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.880
 vivid content even more complicated 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.400
 to be able to explain

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.090
 investment 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.630
