00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.029
 so here is the test of the five buffoni 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.970
 crates so this is a Chinese model that 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:13.799
 resumes trait pour trait à l'iphone 5 s 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:16.920
 of apple here is the box very simple 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.210
 that looks like that of apple without them 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.010
 logos on the sides unfortunately 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.980
 the one who received had no big 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.529
 so that's how it's a pity but 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.470
 good is the box what then we have in 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.399
 the box a lightning cable so here 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.390
 exactly the same as the iphone 5 is this 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:39.450
 a little haddock charger sees the 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.420
 European recovery the irp ode so the 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.129
 apple headphones we know it's not the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.070
 real stars exactly takes the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.340
 design desires friends but hey it's 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.600
 of correct quality without the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:58.680
 phone and a small notice 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:01.230
 so the notice in English with the little 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:05.129
 open stuff to open the sim card 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.960
 So here is the sim card which is in nano 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.340
 sim on this model as on the original 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.729
 by the way then the phone in 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.540
 himself 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.460
 here it is in aluminum it is 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.560
 gold color for this one so here we see 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.180
 well the color 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.189
 the lighting is not top top one was born on 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.290
 care so I can not see a super 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.970
 lighting so here we see that the logo 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.509
 apple does a little bit mirror everything 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.460
 as the mention iphone below we have 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.280
 is different mention or what it was 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.170
 made by apple 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.630
 designed by ap california but all of that 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.170
 with the little logos of the fc all that 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.329
 so that's the phone exactly 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.850
 the same dimensions as the original we have 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.030
 volume + buttons - the little switch 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.640
 for the deliveryman the button on the bio a30 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.520
 for power in new this is the little 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.310
 trolley for asim 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:02.620
 this is the connection in 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.540
 lightning on the underside or by their the 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.210
 microphone and jack 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:11.830
 that's when we got the phone 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:14.190
 arrives on the apple screen with the 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.190
 little apple 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.800
 at 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:45.350
 and here we come then on 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.210
 the lock home screen we have 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.280
 the same as on the true so when 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.910
 we do that and we let him go 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.580
 rebound effect 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.260
 here we have direct access to the device 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:03:00.920
 Photo 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:02.510
 here is the picture on this one 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.440
 is definitely higher than we can 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.930
 find on Chinese phones 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.340
 classic here we will try to take 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:16.030
 a little picture like that without 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:20.720
 pretense see what it gives 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:24.080
 so we can see it's me what I 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.790
 do limoges already here that even in 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.580
 playing we still get a quality 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.450
 quite decent 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.570
 especially in relation to the conditions of 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.880
 brightness that I currently have 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:41.470
 so that's about something rather 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:44.390
 not bad about leaving camera 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.310
 here we find the managerial foot 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:51.050
 tasks we can stop the 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:53.120
 different tasks like this here so 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.730
 when we lock it now and 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.650
 we will unlock it we have a 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.980
 little transition with the icons that 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.330
 is nice enough so we'll see them a 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:08.500
 little of the settings side what is it 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:08.500
 says at the parameter level so 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.660
 in information he tells us that the 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:17.919
 phone made 16 gigabytes and that there 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.269
 15.92 of the ucad available what is 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:24.580
 not the case since in reality there is 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.389
 that 8 gigas on this phone here at 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.060
 level of software update 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.800
 software is a tool that this ios 7.0.1 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.690
 that the software is up to date but this is 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.470
 not the case it's android with a 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:38.620
 big overlay to imitate and bone is 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:40.510
 so that does not hurt the 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.840
 apple software since as it is 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.880
 see at the icons level all that we have 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.160
 exactly the same here we have the 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.330
 small center to be able to handle everything 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.050
 which is quick access buttons by 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.120
 flash example 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.560
 there we have the flash against had a band 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.900
 there is enough powerful enough selfish without 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.510
 Besides, as a flash with double LED 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:02.770
 of course like the real one here we have 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:05.770
 direct access to bubbles zik sorry to wifi 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.960
 in airplane or bluetooth mode and in the mode 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.919
 sleep i guess that's it and at the 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.100
 data synchronization 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:13.210
 seems to me that's why that's why 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.370
 after that we can find a little bit 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:18.729
 from android so right here with the menu 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:22.000
 classic and therefore quick access to gps 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:23.950
 to bluetooth airplane mode wifi all that that 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.450
 this is already on the little fly 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:29.110
 just had some stuff like this here 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.220
 so we had the different 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.680
 standard message applications 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:37.330
 which sent this calendar 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.950
 looks a lot like that of apple here 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:41.710
 access to photos the camera the 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.010
 weather in the weather is at yahoo I 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.720
 believe it's going ya ya or weather 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.900
 here I have no internet so it does not 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.510
 will not serve much plan it's 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:54.510
 google maps 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:54.510
 here 

00:05:56.230 --> 00:06:01.870
 we pissed off facebook the videos the plextor 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.130
 is already installed but yes we can app 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.840
 so blind So here we return 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:08.440
 directly to the plextor that is 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.750
 what we have others 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.520
 contacts the dictaphone the facetime 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.660
 so the theme son I do not know it has to 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.360
 send back on skype or something 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.560
 like that not on the contacts 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:19.020
 so I do not know how it works 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.640
 I did not have the opportunity to test it 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.010
 this is for the calculator all that is 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.900
 classical 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.660
 Here we will be able to stop 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:33.580
 different applications 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:37.720
 so it's a mtq processor at 65.72 I 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:39.400
 believe double core 1,2 giguère so 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.730
 is largely sufficient to turn all 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.500
 the classic applications video here 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:46.300
 good 3d games is not worth it 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:48.310
 to think that you are on a clone 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.780
 iphone is not something that is 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.970
 supposed to be very very powerful 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.860
 that's it for more than it looks like 

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:57.280
 apple that this one is really the 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.390
 power that's clear we'll try a 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.870
 little bit of music to see at the level 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.870
 sound 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:10.630
 what 

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:20.430
 so I do not know if we hear but that 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:21.870
 it does not sizzle 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.820
 not sizzle so it's pretty good 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:27.270
 it's the speaker is ok are 

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:29.130
 no problem here so I do not think so 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.770
 to have videos on we will go see 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.420
 I do not think no I do not have a video 

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.220
 so we can not do video test 

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.050
 to see a little what it gives 

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:39.090
 but overall good is a 

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:41.640
 phone that is very correct which 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.660
 lets do most things 

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.920
 we can do with a phone 

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:47.640
 classic and then that's so it's pretty 

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:52.730
 nice 

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:52.730
 that's it for this taste so 6 5s phone
