everything's frozen up solid and it
doesn't<00:00:34.040> look<00:00:34.130> like<00:00:34.310> there's<00:00:34.489> going<00:00:34.610> to<00:00:34.670> be<00:00:34.730> a

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
doesn't look like there's going to be a

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.580 
doesn't look like there's going to be a
whole<00:00:34.970> bunch<00:00:35.120> of<00:00:35.270> hunting<00:00:35.510> going<00:00:35.660> on<00:00:35.900> I<00:00:36.110> guess

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
whole bunch of hunting going on I guess

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.860 
whole bunch of hunting going on I guess
it's<00:00:36.890> time<00:00:37.010> to<00:00:37.070> practice<00:00:37.400> so<00:00:38.300> we<00:00:38.390> got<00:00:38.540> a<00:00:38.570> couple

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
it's time to practice so we got a couple

the<00:00:51.050> short<00:00:51.320> read<00:00:51.500> intro<00:00:51.920> is<00:00:52.100> your<00:00:52.580> hand

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
the short read intro is your hand

the short read intro is your hand
position<00:00:52.989> make<00:00:53.989> sure<00:00:54.019> you<00:00:54.589> maintain<00:00:55.190> that

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
position make sure you maintain that

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.930 
position make sure you maintain that
barrel<00:00:56.239> wrap<00:00:56.449> and<00:00:56.750> that<00:00:57.220> backpressure<00:00:58.220> hole

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
barrel wrap and that backpressure hole

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.079 
barrel wrap and that backpressure hole
for<00:00:59.570> your<00:00:59.659> for<00:01:00.199> your<00:01:00.320> back<00:01:00.530> pressure<00:01:03.040> okay

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
for your for your back pressure okay

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.420 
for your for your back pressure okay
once<00:01:05.089> you<00:01:05.269> have<00:01:05.479> that<00:01:05.510> then<00:01:06.500> all<00:01:06.890> you<00:01:07.100> need<00:01:07.130> to

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
once you have that then all you need to

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.480 
once you have that then all you need to
do<00:01:07.640> is<00:01:08.180> just<00:01:08.510> a<00:01:08.630> short<00:01:09.110> breath<00:01:09.409> air<00:01:09.770> through

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
do is just a short breath air through

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.800 
do is just a short breath air through
the<00:01:10.610> call<00:01:13.180> once<00:01:14.180> you've<00:01:14.330> got<00:01:14.510> your<00:01:14.659> back

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
the call once you've got your back

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.450 
the call once you've got your back
pressure<00:01:15.140> down<00:01:15.470> and<00:01:15.680> you're<00:01:16.070> doing<00:01:16.340> your

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
pressure down and you're doing your

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.570 
pressure down and you're doing your
normal<00:01:16.580> clocks<00:01:17.260> all<00:01:18.260> I<00:01:18.409> want<00:01:18.680> you<00:01:18.860> to<00:01:18.950> focus<00:01:19.159> on

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
normal clocks all I want you to focus on

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.440 
normal clocks all I want you to focus on
is<00:01:20.210> basically<00:01:20.810> just<00:01:21.140> a<00:01:21.710> steady<00:01:22.250> very<00:01:23.090> low

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
is basically just a steady very low

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.240 
is basically just a steady very low
pressure<00:01:23.870> breath<00:01:24.260> air<00:01:24.590> through<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.010> call

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
pressure breath air through the call

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:35.710 
pressure breath air through the call
just<00:01:26.120> to<00:01:26.300> make<00:01:26.600> a<00:01:26.810> slight<00:01:27.170> moan

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.000 

oh<00:01:36.160> okay<00:01:37.160> once<00:01:38.090> you<00:01:38.270> get<00:01:38.450> that<00:01:38.690> that<00:01:39.560> is<00:01:39.800> what

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 
oh okay once you get that that is what

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.280 
oh okay once you get that that is what
we<00:01:40.130> are<00:01:40.250> going<00:01:40.340> to<00:01:40.400> work<00:01:40.700> into<00:01:41.150> your<00:01:41.180> clocks<00:01:41.630> to

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
we are going to work into your clocks to

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.960 
we are going to work into your clocks to
give<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:42.770> what<00:01:43.430> I<00:01:43.460> call<00:01:43.760> the<00:01:43.940> cheater<00:01:44.180> mode

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
give you what I call the cheater mode

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.410 
give you what I call the cheater mode
now<00:01:46.970> you've<00:01:47.300> got<00:01:47.510> that<00:01:47.720> down<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.740> cheater<00:01:49.040> Mon

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
now you've got that down the cheater Mon

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.450 
now you've got that down the cheater Mon
basically<00:01:50.420> is<00:01:50.570> going<00:01:50.930> to<00:01:51.080> be<00:01:51.350> just<00:01:52.340> that

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
basically is going to be just that

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.000 
basically is going to be just that
slight<00:01:53.270> light<00:01:53.870> blow<00:01:54.170> of<00:01:54.320> air<00:01:54.500> through<00:01:54.830> the

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
slight light blow of air through the

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.080 
slight light blow of air through the
call<00:01:55.250> in<00:01:55.550> between<00:01:56.210> your<00:01:57.170> clocks<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:58.280> this<00:01:58.910> is

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
call in between your clocks so this is

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:07.380 
call in between your clocks so this is
what<00:01:59.240> it's<00:01:59.390> going<00:01:59.510> to<00:01:59.600> sound<00:01:59.780> like

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.350 

now<00:02:08.390> that's<00:02:08.600> slow<00:02:08.990> okay<00:02:09.760> make<00:02:10.760> sure<00:02:10.790> you<00:02:11.150> keep

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
now that's slow okay make sure you keep

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.449 
now that's slow okay make sure you keep
them<00:02:11.570> separate<00:02:12.110> everything<00:02:12.770> needs<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.370> be

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
them separate everything needs to be

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.250 
them separate everything needs to be
kept<00:02:13.730> separate<00:02:14.270> if<00:02:14.450> you<00:02:14.780> run<00:02:15.020> them<00:02:15.140> together

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
kept separate if you run them together

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.360 
kept separate if you run them together
it's<00:02:15.980> going<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.280> sound<00:02:16.490> like<00:02:16.610> a<00:02:16.730> hawk<00:02:17.060> oh<00:02:18.370> you

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
it's going to sound like a hawk oh you

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.490 
it's going to sound like a hawk oh you
don't<00:02:19.550> want<00:02:19.760> that<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:20.630> want<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.900> separate

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
don't want that you want to separate

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:36.580 
don't want that you want to separate
them<00:02:21.680> so<00:02:21.920> they<00:02:22.370> sound<00:02:22.610> distinct<00:02:33.310> I<00:02:35.380> find<00:02:36.380> it

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
them so they sound distinct I find it

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.190 
them so they sound distinct I find it
easier<00:02:37.100> to<00:02:37.400> put<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.760> Mon<00:02:37.970> after<00:02:38.570> the<00:02:38.690> clock<00:02:38.930> so

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
easier to put the Mon after the clock so

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.259 
easier to put the Mon after the clock so
it<00:02:39.350> doesn't<00:02:39.709> bleed<00:02:39.920> together<00:02:40.100> so<00:02:40.790> rather<00:02:41.090> than

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
it doesn't bleed together so rather than

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.509 
it doesn't bleed together so rather than
going<00:02:41.420> oh<00:02:42.310> do<00:02:43.310> it<00:02:43.870> and<00:02:44.870> it<00:02:45.590> just<00:02:45.830> really<00:02:46.190> keeps

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
going oh do it and it just really keeps

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.540 
going oh do it and it just really keeps
them<00:02:46.730> separate<00:02:47.180> so<00:02:47.709> just<00:02:48.709> match<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.070> in<00:02:49.370> your

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:49.550 
them separate so just match it in your

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:57.130 
them separate so just match it in your
clocks<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:55.430> you<00:02:55.970> basically<00:02:56.480> have<00:02:56.690> just<00:02:56.900> added

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
clocks and you basically have just added

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.130 
clocks and you basically have just added
another<00:02:57.769> goose<00:02:58.040> to<00:02:58.250> your<00:02:58.370> routine<00:02:58.730> very<00:02:59.390> very

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
another goose to your routine very very

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.570 
another goose to your routine very very
simply<00:03:01.690> now<00:03:02.690> again<00:03:03.070> make<00:03:04.070> sure<00:03:04.100> you're

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
simply now again make sure you're

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.729 
simply now again make sure you're
keeping<00:03:04.790> things<00:03:05.269> separate<00:03:05.810> you<00:03:06.230> don't<00:03:06.530> need

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
keeping things separate you don't need

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.410 
keeping things separate you don't need
to<00:03:06.860> be<00:03:07.010> that<00:03:07.190> speed<00:03:07.640> demon<00:03:08.030> I<00:03:08.120> talked<00:03:08.390> about

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
to be that speed demon I talked about
