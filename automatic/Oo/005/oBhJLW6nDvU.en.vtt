disconnects
so<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:58.760> only<00:02:58.850> disadvantage<00:02:59.270> of<00:02:59.720> doing<00:02:59.750> it

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
so the only disadvantage of doing it

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.160 
so the only disadvantage of doing it
this<00:03:00.260> way<00:03:00.320> is<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.650> will<00:03:01.040> have<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.370> leave<00:03:02.170> your

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
this way is you will have to leave your

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
this way is you will have to leave your
iPhone<00:03:06.550> in<00:03:07.900> iMediaShare<00:03:08.900> for<00:03:09.770> it<00:03:09.830> to<00:03:09.890> continue

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
iPhone in iMediaShare for it to continue

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.350 
iPhone in iMediaShare for it to continue
to<00:03:10.550> stay<00:03:10.850> so<00:03:11.840> you<00:03:12.440> can't<00:03:12.680> close<00:03:12.980> the<00:03:13.190> app<00:03:13.360> you

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
to stay so you can't close the app you

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.660 
to stay so you can't close the app you
just<00:03:14.390> have<00:03:14.690> to<00:03:14.840> leave<00:03:14.930> it<00:03:14.989> open<00:03:15.310> leave<00:03:16.310> it<00:03:16.400> open

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:16.670 
just have to leave it open leave it open

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.699 
just have to leave it open leave it open
the<00:03:16.760> background<00:03:17.300> and<00:03:17.570> then<00:03:18.050> scroll<00:03:18.680> through

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
the background and then scroll through

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.280 
the background and then scroll through
here<00:03:19.100> then<00:03:19.790> now<00:03:19.970> now<00:03:20.630> they've<00:03:20.900> also<00:03:21.080> got
