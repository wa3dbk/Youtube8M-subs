stitches in circular knitting because of

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.010 
stitches in circular knitting because of
this<00:00:17.220> part<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.760> needle<00:00:18.029> here<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.900> is

called the join and this is where the

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.210 
called the join and this is where the
cable<00:00:21.539> joins<00:00:22.140> on<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> needle<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.039> there's

cable joins on to the needle and there's

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.640 
cable joins on to the needle and there's
a<00:00:23.279> huge<00:00:23.670> change<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.449> size<00:00:24.750> here<00:00:25.170> between<00:00:25.380> the

some<00:00:56.070> kind<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.489> tendinitis<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.109> nice<00:00:58.350> to

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
some kind of tendinitis so it's nice to

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.260 
some kind of tendinitis so it's nice to
remember<00:00:58.680> that<00:00:59.070> you're<00:00:59.190> making<00:00:59.370> fabric<00:01:00.090> it

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
remember that you're making fabric it

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.599 
remember that you're making fabric it
needs<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.899> have<00:01:01.079> some<00:01:01.109> give<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.010> some<00:01:02.280> drape

and<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.480> don't<00:01:03.750> want<00:01:04.080> your<00:01:04.199> stitches<00:01:04.470> to

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
and so you don't want your stitches to

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.250 
and so you don't want your stitches to
grip<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.549> needle<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.090> lot<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.869> beginning

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.530 
grip the needle a lot of beginning
knitters<00:01:08.159> think<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.850> their<00:01:08.970> stitches<00:01:09.210> need

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
knitters think that their stitches need

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.789 
knitters think that their stitches need
to<00:01:09.659> be<00:01:09.750> really<00:01:10.020> tight<00:01:10.229> or<00:01:10.409> else<00:01:10.500> they're<00:01:10.710> gonna

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
to be really tight or else they're gonna

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.950 
to be really tight or else they're gonna
fall<00:01:11.130> off<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.369> needle<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.570> better<00:01:12.780> you

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
fall off the needle and the better you

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.929 
fall off the needle and the better you
get<00:01:13.110> at<00:01:13.170> knitting<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.979> more<00:01:14.220> relaxed<00:01:14.790> you'll

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
get at knitting the more relaxed you'll

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.580 
get at knitting the more relaxed you'll
be<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.420> know<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.810> they<00:01:15.930> are<00:01:16.049> gonna<00:01:16.170> stay

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
be and know that they are gonna stay

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.080 
be and know that they are gonna stay
there<00:01:16.830> especially<00:01:17.340> if<00:01:17.640> you're<00:01:17.759> knitting<00:01:17.939> with

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
there especially if you're knitting with

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.820 
there especially if you're knitting with
bamboo<00:01:18.450> which<00:01:18.810> naturally<00:01:19.409> grips<00:01:19.650> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
bamboo which naturally grips the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.230 
bamboo which naturally grips the
stitches<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.930> when<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:21.960> make<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> stitch<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:23.040> go<00:01:24.000> in

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
stitches so when I make a stitch I go in

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.600 
stitches so when I make a stitch I go in
from<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.540> left<00:01:24.750> side<00:01:24.960> wrap<00:01:25.890> around<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.400> back

so<00:02:06.130> the<00:02:07.130> way<00:02:07.250> that<00:02:07.280> I<00:02:07.460> do<00:02:07.549> this<00:02:07.670> is<00:02:08.000> I<00:02:08.119> go<00:02:08.269> in<00:02:08.539> I

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
so the way that I do this is I go in I

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.050 
so the way that I do this is I go in I
wrap<00:02:09.410> around<00:02:09.739> and<00:02:10.009> then<00:02:10.399> when<00:02:10.489> I<00:02:10.519> pull<00:02:10.789> up<00:02:10.819> a

wrap around and then when I pull up a
new<00:02:11.239> stitch<00:02:11.569> I<00:02:11.750> make<00:02:12.019> sure<00:02:12.170> that<00:02:12.200> my<00:02:12.379> needle<00:02:12.680> is

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
new stitch I make sure that my needle is

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.190

actually<00:02:13.069> pulling<00:02:13.610> towards<00:02:14.150> my<00:02:14.330> body<00:02:14.660> just<00:02:14.840> a

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
actually pulling towards my body just a

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.320 
actually pulling towards my body just a
little<00:02:15.440> bit<00:02:15.590> so<00:02:16.250> that<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.430> can<00:02:16.610> pop<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.150> old

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
little bit so that I can pop the old

little bit so that I can pop the old
stitch<00:02:17.569> off<00:02:17.720> with<00:02:17.959> ease<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.590> then<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.519> give

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
stitch off with ease and then I give

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.449 
stitch off with ease and then I give
just<00:02:20.120> a<00:02:20.239> teeny<00:02:20.720> tiny<00:02:20.959> tug<00:02:21.620> with<00:02:21.830> my<00:02:21.980> right<00:02:22.190> hand

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
so little that I barely even notice I'm

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.699 
so little that I barely even notice I'm
doing<00:02:25.250> it<00:02:25.370> scoop<00:02:25.700> it<00:02:25.819> up<00:02:25.940> just<00:02:26.870> enough<00:02:27.170> tug<00:02:27.440> to

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
doing it scoop it up just enough tug to

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.710 
doing it scoop it up just enough tug to
lift<00:02:28.010> the<00:02:28.280> yarn<00:02:28.459> back<00:02:28.730> into<00:02:29.090> position<00:02:29.209> and

lift the yarn back into position and

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.380 
lift the yarn back into position and
this<00:02:30.379> just<00:02:30.680> takes<00:02:30.860> lots<00:02:31.069> of<00:02:31.190> practice<00:02:31.400> your

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
this just takes lots of practice your

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.330 
this just takes lots of practice your
tension<00:02:32.959> is<00:02:33.080> going<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.349> be<00:02:33.440> kind<00:02:33.709> of<00:02:33.799> uneven

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
tension is going to be kind of uneven

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.009
