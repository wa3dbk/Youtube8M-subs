won<00:01:12.130> it<00:01:12.280> twice<00:01:12.490> I<00:01:12.820> think<00:01:13.600> messy<00:01:14.020> will<00:01:14.170> be<00:01:14.320> very

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
won it twice I think messy will be very

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.800 
won it twice I think messy will be very
determined<00:01:15.070> to<00:01:15.130> two<00:01:15.909> winner<00:01:16.120> the<00:01:16.300> third<00:01:16.510> time

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
determined to two winner the third time

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.590 
determined to two winner the third time
and<00:01:16.990> get<00:01:17.140> that<00:01:17.350> third<00:01:17.650> star<00:01:17.979> Argentina<00:01:18.700> shirt

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
and get that third star Argentina shirt

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.170 
and get that third star Argentina shirt
I<00:01:19.979> think<00:01:20.979> they've<00:01:21.130> got<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.460> quality<00:01:21.970> they've

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
I think they've got the quality they've

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.630 
I think they've got the quality they've
got<00:01:22.330> the<00:01:22.479> players<00:01:22.720> I've<00:01:22.990> got<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.320> tactics<00:01:23.799> it

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
got the players I've got the tactics it

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.520 
got the players I've got the tactics it
will<00:01:24.820> be<00:01:24.970> a<00:01:25.000> very<00:01:25.180> tough<00:01:25.450> game<00:01:25.750> this<00:01:26.080> Germany

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
will be a very tough game this Germany

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.060 
will be a very tough game this Germany
are<00:01:26.740> a<00:01:26.770> good<00:01:27.250> team<00:01:27.460> as<00:01:27.640> well<00:01:27.790> I<00:01:28.600> think

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
are a good team as well I think

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.039 
are a good team as well I think
Argentina<00:01:30.070> with<00:01:30.310> a<00:01:30.430> strike<00:01:30.790> force<00:01:31.150> I<00:01:31.600> think

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
Argentina with a strike force I think

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.840 
Argentina with a strike force I think
they<00:01:32.229> can<00:01:32.260> I<00:01:32.650> can<00:01:33.010> definitely<00:01:33.190> go<00:01:33.490> all<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.820> way

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
they can I can definitely go all the way

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.570 
they can I can definitely go all the way
yeah<00:01:34.390> Jules<00:01:34.690> it's<00:01:35.080> Germany's<00:01:35.530> 8<00:01:35.770> final<00:01:36.369> and

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
yeah Jules it's Germany's 8 final and

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.300 
yeah Jules it's Germany's 8 final and
we've<00:01:37.000> won<00:01:37.270> it<00:01:37.320> three<00:01:38.320> times<00:01:38.590> we've<00:01:38.890> lost<00:01:39.100> it

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
we've won it three times we've lost it

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.950 
we've won it three times we've lost it
four<00:01:39.490> times<00:01:39.640> so<00:01:39.940> I'm<00:01:40.210> hoping<00:01:40.479> we<00:01:40.630> can<00:01:40.659> claim

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
four times so I'm hoping we can claim

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.950 
four times so I'm hoping we can claim
our<00:01:41.170> force<00:01:41.440> star<00:01:42.100> and<00:01:42.460> I<00:01:43.180> think<00:01:43.540> we<00:01:43.659> have<00:01:43.690> been

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
our force star and I think we have been

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.179 
our force star and I think we have been
the<00:01:44.049> best<00:01:44.229> team<00:01:44.380> throughout<00:01:44.830> this<00:01:44.979> tournament

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:45.189 
the best team throughout this tournament

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.940 
the best team throughout this tournament
I<00:01:45.610> want<00:01:45.790> to<00:01:45.880> highlight<00:01:46.060> the<00:01:46.240> word<00:01:46.390> team<00:01:46.950> we

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
I want to highlight the word team we

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.070 
I want to highlight the word team we
