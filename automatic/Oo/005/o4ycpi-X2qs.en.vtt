front-wheel-drive<00:04:02.800> v6<00:04:03.640> all<00:04:04.570> is<00:04:04.959> the<00:04:05.200> word<00:04:05.380> of

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
front-wheel-drive v6 all is the word of

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.979 
front-wheel-drive v6 all is the word of
the<00:04:05.590> engine<00:04:06.010> pretty<00:04:06.280> much<00:04:06.400> hit<00:04:06.640> speeds<00:04:06.970> end<00:04:07.870> of
