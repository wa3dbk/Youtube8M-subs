00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
my are general techniques and materials

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.269 
my are general techniques and materials
that<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.380> use<00:00:22.650> on<00:00:22.859> top<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.600> the<00:00:24.600> paint<00:00:24.900> so<00:00:25.800> first

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279

that I use on top of the paint so first
I<00:00:26.460> am<00:00:26.550> using<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.570> blending<00:00:27.960> tool<00:00:27.990> to<00:00:28.529> put<00:00:29.070> my

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
I am using the blending tool to put my

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.880 
I am using the blending tool to put my
paint<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.730> my<00:00:30.090> page<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.960> non<00:00:31.230> just<00:00:31.470> page

and normally you could do it from your
craft<00:00:36.750> magis<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.410> put<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> little<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:38.100> your

craft mat and then do it like that but I

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.650 
craft mat and then do it like that but I
didn't<00:00:40.559> do<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.800> as<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.040> can<00:00:41.070> see<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.660> just

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
didn't do that as you can see and just

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.299 
didn't do that as you can see and just
blending<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.410> little<00:00:43.710> bit<00:00:43.920> with<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> baby

blending it a little bit with a baby
wipe<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.789> see<00:00:45.059> if<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.960> dry<00:00:46.289> already<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:47.039> it's

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
wipe to see if it is dry already so it's

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.700 
wipe to see if it is dry already so it's
very<00:00:47.399> quick<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:47.820> have<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.270> be<00:00:48.420> quick<00:00:49.410> if<00:00:49.649> you

very quick you have to be quick if you
want<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:51.079> blend<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.170> out<00:00:52.289> with<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.469> tissue<00:00:52.739> or

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.119 
put the paint on with baby wipe as well
but<00:00:59.160> Wow<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.390> think<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.500> is<00:01:01.590> better<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.010> now

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
but Wow I think this is better and now

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.709 
but Wow I think this is better and now
I'm<00:01:02.190> trying<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.670> sponge<00:01:03.030> because<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.449> use

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
I'm trying the sponge because I use

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.980 
I'm trying the sponge because I use
sponges<00:01:04.199> often<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.979> that<00:01:05.820> didn't<00:01:06.810> work<00:01:06.869> that

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
sponges often and that didn't work that

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.280 
sponges often and that didn't work that
well<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.710> did<00:01:08.340> work<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:09.330> well<00:01:09.510> because<00:01:10.140> if

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
well it did work that well because if

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.800 
well it did work that well because if
you<00:01:10.409> want<00:01:10.619> an<00:01:10.740> artsy<00:01:11.430> fartsy<00:01:11.700> look<00:01:12.210> then<00:01:12.600> it's

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
you want an artsy fartsy look then it's

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.679 
you want an artsy fartsy look then it's
no<00:01:13.020> problem<00:01:13.260> at<00:01:13.500> all<00:01:13.640> just<00:01:14.640> use<00:01:14.939> but<00:01:15.600> it

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
no problem at all just use but it

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.679 
no problem at all just use but it
doesn't<00:01:16.080> smear<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.250> well<00:01:17.430> it<00:01:17.909> doesn't<00:01:18.509> give

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
doesn't smear that well it doesn't give

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.539 
doesn't smear that well it doesn't give
the<00:01:18.869> good<00:01:19.229> coverage<00:01:19.680> I<00:01:19.799> think<00:01:19.830> because<00:01:20.400> of

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
the good coverage I think because of

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.490 
the good coverage I think because of
paint<00:01:20.759> soaks<00:01:21.119> into<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.810> sponge<00:01:22.409> too<00:01:22.770> much<00:01:22.950> and

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
paint soaks into the sponge too much and

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.550 
paint soaks into the sponge too much and
but<00:01:25.500> okay<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.070> works<00:01:26.400> fine<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.689> I<00:01:27.720> will<00:01:27.900> use<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
but okay it works fine so I will use the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.260 
but okay it works fine so I will use the
blending<00:01:28.860> tool<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.220> most<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.549> think<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:30.030> then

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
blending tool the most I think and then

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.109 
blending tool the most I think and then
use<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:32.090> sponge<00:01:33.090> as<00:01:33.299> well<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:35.030> putting<00:01:36.030> on

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
use the sponge as well and putting on

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.030 
use the sponge as well and putting on
the<00:01:36.240> yellow<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.590> see<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.890> it

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
the yellow and you can see that it

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.190 
the yellow and you can see that it
doesn't<00:01:38.250> mix<00:01:38.670> with<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.570> other<00:01:39.600> colors<00:01:40.049> on

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
doesn't mix with the other colors on

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.850 
doesn't mix with the other colors on
paper<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:41.009> just<00:01:41.070> covers<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.909> other<00:01:42.240> color<00:01:42.540> and

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
paper it just covers the other color and

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.719 
paper it just covers the other color and
makes<00:01:43.860> another<00:01:44.670> color<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:45.570> case<00:01:45.810> orange

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
makes another color in this case orange

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.840 
makes another color in this case orange
and<00:01:48.320> I've<00:01:49.320> experimented<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.250> little<00:01:50.670> card

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
and I've experimented on a little card

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.139 
and I've experimented on a little card
that<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.030> made<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:52.320> can<00:01:52.560> blend<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.640> colors

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
that I made and you can blend the colors

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.350 
that I made and you can blend the colors
perfectly<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.530> your<00:01:55.590> craft<00:01:56.369> mat<00:01:56.700> just<00:01:57.030> take<00:01:57.329> a

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
perfectly on your craft mat just take a

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.850 
perfectly on your craft mat just take a
bit<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.630> blue<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.110> bit<00:01:58.200> of<00:01:58.350> red<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.560> you've

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.550 
bit of blue and a bit of red and you've
got<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.100> beautiful<00:01:59.430> purple<00:02:00.090> color<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.540> you<00:02:01.200> can

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
on top of the blue and you see

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.830 
on top of the blue and you see
just<00:02:14.299> beautiful<00:02:15.299> vibrant<00:02:16.970> colors<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.239> covers

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
just beautiful vibrant colors it covers

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
so much with just a single dip into your

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:25.789 
so much with just a single dip into your
lid<00:02:22.439> so<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.310> really<00:02:23.849> like<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.090> and<00:02:24.689> you<00:02:25.650> can

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
lid so I really like that and you can

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.520 
lid so I really like that and you can
put<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.040> on<00:02:26.159> with<00:02:26.189> a<00:02:26.430> brayer<00:02:26.819> or<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.659> card<00:02:28.140> or

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
put it on with a brayer or a card or

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.979 
put it on with a brayer or a card or
whatever<00:02:28.799> you<00:02:28.920> can<00:02:29.099> think<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.659> now<00:02:30.659> my

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
whatever you can think of now my

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.559 
whatever you can think of now my
favorite<00:02:31.319> technique<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.829> course<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.280> just

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
favorite technique of course is just

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.500 
favorite technique of course is just
getting<00:02:33.569> rid<00:02:33.659> of<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:34.019> paint<00:02:34.290> through<00:02:34.560> this

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
getting rid of the paint through this

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.380 
getting rid of the paint through this
stencil<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.750> I<00:02:37.620> did<00:02:37.829> it<00:02:37.950> on<00:02:38.129> purpose<00:02:38.280> on<00:02:39.239> the

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
stencil and I did it on purpose on the

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.720 
stencil and I did it on purpose on the
places<00:02:39.780> that<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:39.959> went<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.530> last<00:02:40.980> because<00:02:41.370> if<00:02:41.609> I

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
places that I went to last because if I

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.550 
places that I went to last because if I
would<00:02:41.970> have<00:02:42.420> done<00:02:42.629> it<00:02:42.780> on<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.049> pink<00:02:43.260> then<00:02:43.439> it

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
would have done it on the pink then it

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.920 
would have done it on the pink then it
wouldn't<00:02:44.010> have<00:02:44.280> any<00:02:44.700> effect<00:02:45.209> at<00:02:45.569> all<00:02:45.629> because

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
wouldn't have any effect at all because

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.270 
wouldn't have any effect at all because
it's<00:02:46.079> right<00:02:46.440> so<00:02:47.310> quickly<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:48.959> have<00:02:49.349> to<00:02:49.560> be

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
it's right so quickly so you have to be

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.970 
it's right so quickly so you have to be
quick<00:02:50.569> um<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:52.590> then<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:53.489> course<00:02:53.780> stenciling

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
quick um and then of course stenciling

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.770 
quick um and then of course stenciling
again<00:02:55.980> with<00:02:56.370> a<00:02:56.579> black<00:02:56.970> paint<00:02:59.269> that<00:03:00.269> works

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
again with a black paint that works

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.020

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
going over the circles again blends with

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.089 
going over the circles again blends with
your<00:03:27.359> finger<00:03:27.750> brilliantly<00:03:28.609> baby<00:03:29.609> wipe<00:03:29.940> prep

no<00:03:32.099> problem<00:03:32.489> at<00:03:32.609> all<00:03:32.989> goes<00:03:33.989> on<00:03:34.230> quite<00:03:34.590> well<00:03:34.829> so

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
no problem at all goes on quite well so

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.250 
no problem at all goes on quite well so
you<00:03:35.549> can<00:03:35.790> use<00:03:35.940> that<00:03:36.150> this<00:03:36.419> is<00:03:36.599> a<00:03:36.629> New<00:03:37.079> York

work<00:03:40.709> that<00:03:40.739> well<00:03:41.129> I<00:03:41.510> think<00:03:42.510> that<00:03:42.780> neo<00:03:43.049> colors

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
work that well I think that neo colors

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.740 
work that well I think that neo colors
the<00:03:46.169> neo<00:03:46.379> color<00:03:46.680> one<00:03:47.010> that's<00:03:47.579> the<00:03:48.090> crayon<00:03:48.720> I

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
the neo color one that's the crayon I

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.809 
the neo color one that's the crayon I
mean<00:03:49.049> doesn't<00:03:49.919> work<00:03:50.099> that<00:03:50.400> well<00:03:50.549> either

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
mean doesn't work that well either

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:53.289 
mean doesn't work that well either
smoothing<00:03:51.750> it<00:03:51.840> out<00:03:51.930> with<00:03:52.109> your<00:03:52.230> fingers<00:03:52.560> so

smoothing it out with your fingers so

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:56.180 
smoothing it out with your fingers so
now<00:03:54.299> another<00:03:54.750> gelato<00:03:55.260> in<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:55.530> darker<00:03:55.859> color<00:03:56.099> I

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
just wanted to see how that worked

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.819 
just wanted to see how that worked
brilliantly<00:04:00.870> covered<00:04:02.569> everything<00:04:03.829> so

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
brilliantly covered everything so

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:09.860 
brilliantly covered everything so
perfect<00:04:05.900> going<00:04:06.900> in<00:04:07.199> with<00:04:07.470> a<00:04:07.799> brush<00:04:08.730> it<00:04:09.569> does

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
perfect going in with a brush it does

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.619 
perfect going in with a brush it does
leave<00:04:10.199> a<00:04:10.530> bit<00:04:10.709> of<00:04:10.790> brushstroke<00:04:11.790> but<00:04:12.180> not<00:04:12.449> that

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
leave a bit of brushstroke but not that

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.490 
leave a bit of brushstroke but not that
much<00:04:12.870> but<00:04:13.829> I<00:04:13.859> really<00:04:14.459> didn't<00:04:14.760> like<00:04:15.320> the<00:04:16.320> way<00:04:16.470> it

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
much but I really didn't like the way it

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.529 
much but I really didn't like the way it
went<00:04:17.010> I<00:04:17.250> don't<00:04:17.310> know<00:04:17.549> I<00:04:17.579> just<00:04:18.030> wanted<00:04:18.329> to<00:04:18.449> do

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:18.539 
went I don't know I just wanted to do

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:20.210 
went I don't know I just wanted to do
with<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.870> fingers<00:04:19.289> and<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.620> blending<00:04:19.949> tool<00:04:19.979> and

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
with the fingers and a blending tool and

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.920 
with the fingers and a blending tool and
I<00:04:20.280> think<00:04:20.519> this<00:04:20.639> paint<00:04:20.940> is<00:04:21.030> really<00:04:21.090> good<00:04:21.630> for

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.370 

using<00:04:24.930> it<00:04:25.080> without<00:04:25.530> a<00:04:25.770> brush

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
just going on with stamps works

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.400 
just going on with stamps works
perfectly<00:04:44.490> no<00:04:44.730> problem<00:04:45.060> at<00:04:45.180> all<00:04:45.270> dries<00:04:45.660> quick

perfectly no problem at all dries quick

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.880 
perfectly no problem at all dries quick
and<00:04:48.530> it<00:04:49.530> is<00:04:49.680> absolutely<00:04:50.340> I<00:04:51.350> don't<00:04:52.350> know<00:04:52.620> I

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
and it is absolutely I don't know I

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.550 
and it is absolutely I don't know I
really<00:04:53.820> like<00:04:54.000> it

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
really like it

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.840 
really like it
it's<00:04:55.560> so<00:04:55.740> different<00:04:55.980> from<00:04:56.220> acrylics<00:04:56.790> you

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
it's so different from acrylics you

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:01.040 
it's so different from acrylics you
can't<00:04:57.150> compare<00:04:57.600> it<00:04:57.630> it's<00:04:58.590> just<00:04:59.010> I<00:04:59.840> don't<00:05:00.840> know

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
can't compare it it's just I don't know

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.560 
can't compare it it's just I don't know
if<00:05:01.350> you<00:05:01.500> it<00:05:02.070> feels<00:05:02.310> like<00:05:02.550> you<00:05:02.850> have<00:05:03.120> put

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
if you it feels like you have put

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.370 
if you it feels like you have put
distress<00:05:04.200> ink<00:05:04.470> on<00:05:04.680> it<00:05:04.710> and<00:05:05.600> or<00:05:06.600> the<00:05:06.930> sprays

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
distress ink on it and or the sprays

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.690 
distress ink on it and or the sprays
it's<00:05:07.950> just<00:05:08.280> so<00:05:08.490> smooth<00:05:09.240> and<00:05:09.510> soft<00:05:09.810> and<00:05:10.260> you<00:05:10.700> see

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
it's just so smooth and soft and you see

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.440 
it's just so smooth and soft and you see
that<00:05:11.880> the<00:05:12.030> white<00:05:12.270> covers<00:05:12.990> quite<00:05:13.920> well<00:05:14.280> and<00:05:14.640> if

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
that the white covers quite well and if

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.050 
that the white covers quite well and if
you<00:05:15.600> put<00:05:15.840> the<00:05:16.170> multiple<00:05:17.100> layers<00:05:17.280> on<00:05:17.640> it<00:05:17.670> then

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
you put the multiple layers on it then

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.650 
you put the multiple layers on it then
it<00:05:18.390> is<00:05:18.570> completely<00:05:19.380> opaque<00:05:19.770> so<00:05:20.160> you<00:05:20.190> can<00:05:21.150> write

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
it is completely opaque so you can write

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.920 
it is completely opaque so you can write
on<00:05:21.900> top<00:05:22.260> of<00:05:22.440> it<00:05:22.590> without<00:05:22.860> any<00:05:23.190> problems<00:05:24.150> and

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
on top of it without any problems and

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.570 
on top of it without any problems and
you<00:05:25.050> see<00:05:25.260> just<00:05:25.500> the<00:05:25.620> white<00:05:25.800> through<00:05:26.340> the

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
you see just the white through the

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.050 
you see just the white through the
stencil<00:05:26.940> does<00:05:27.900> is<00:05:28.170> just<00:05:28.950> white<00:05:29.190> with<00:05:29.640> a<00:05:29.670> little

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
stencil does is just white with a little

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.560 
stencil does is just white with a little
sheen<00:05:30.300> of<00:05:30.480> the<00:05:31.020> color<00:05:31.290> underneath<00:05:32.030> so<00:05:33.030> I<00:05:33.390> think

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
sheen of the color underneath so I think

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.310 
sheen of the color underneath so I think
it's<00:05:33.870> great<00:05:34.400> now<00:05:35.400> trying<00:05:35.820> the<00:05:36.180> pasta<00:05:36.570> pen<00:05:36.810> the

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
it's great now trying the pasta pen the

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:44.420 
it's great now trying the pasta pen the
Sakura<00:05:38.120> sharpie<00:05:39.120> and<00:05:39.890> the<00:05:40.890> food<00:05:41.130> bowl<00:05:41.370> and<00:05:43.430> I'm

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
Sakura sharpie and the food bowl and I'm

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:52.400 
Sakura sharpie and the food bowl and I'm
repeating<00:05:44.970> it<00:05:45.270> works<00:05:45.690> perfect<00:05:46.290> as<00:05:47.270> well<00:05:50.630> so<00:05:51.630> I

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
repeating it works perfect as well so I

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.740 
repeating it works perfect as well so I
think<00:05:53.250> I<00:05:54.110> got<00:05:55.110> a<00:05:55.140> lot<00:05:55.410> of<00:05:56.090> things<00:05:57.090> to<00:05:57.240> do<00:05:57.420> with

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:57.750 
think I got a lot of things to do with

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.480 
think I got a lot of things to do with
this<00:05:57.960> this<00:05:58.890> paint<00:05:59.280> I<00:06:00.560> think<00:06:01.560> I<00:06:01.950> might<00:06:02.160> not<00:06:02.430> use

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
this this paint I think I might not use

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.730 
this this paint I think I might not use
it<00:06:02.850> for<00:06:03.060> faces<00:06:03.540> because<00:06:03.960> it<00:06:04.260> dries<00:06:04.530> too

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
it for faces because it dries too

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.160 
it for faces because it dries too
quickly<00:06:04.770> to<00:06:06.170> make<00:06:07.170> a<00:06:07.200> good<00:06:08.060> blend<00:06:09.060> it<00:06:09.450> does<00:06:09.960> on

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.170 
quickly to make a good blend it does on

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.720 
quickly to make a good blend it does on
small<00:06:11.100> surfaces<00:06:11.670> I<00:06:11.790> think<00:06:12.090> and<00:06:13.310> but<00:06:14.310> for<00:06:14.550> this

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:14.730 
small surfaces I think and but for this

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:20.360 
small surfaces I think and but for this
kind<00:06:15.060> of<00:06:15.260> work<00:06:16.260> it's<00:06:16.560> just<00:06:16.740> perfect<00:06:17.430> so<00:06:19.370> I'm

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.370
