compared to paper force it's not a huge
difference<00:02:22.410> honestly<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.220> probably<00:02:23.250> may

quickly that I really designed exactly

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.460 
quickly that I really designed exactly
for<00:03:18.390> speed

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
for speed

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.490 
for speed
I<00:03:19.760> mean<00:03:20.760> it's<00:03:20.910> light<00:03:21.170> relatively<00:03:22.170> light<00:03:22.319> boot

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
I mean it's light relatively light boot

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.180
