others<00:00:37.210> it's<00:00:37.750> just<00:00:37.780> a<00:00:38.050> matter<00:00:38.260> of<00:00:38.380> having<00:00:38.680> the

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
others it's just a matter of having the

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.500 
others it's just a matter of having the
right<00:00:39.070> attitude<00:00:39.309> and<00:00:39.820> the<00:00:39.880> work<00:00:40.059> ethic
