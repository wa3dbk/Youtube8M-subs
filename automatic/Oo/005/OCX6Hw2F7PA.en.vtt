hello get rich quick guide com here

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:04.970 
hello get rich quick guide com here
again<00:00:03.689> trying<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.290> figure<00:00:04.529> out<00:00:04.650> if<00:00:04.830> it's

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
again trying to figure out if it's

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.990 
again trying to figure out if it's
absolutely<00:00:05.220> necessary<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:06.450> have<00:00:06.830> 65<00:00:07.830> tons<00:00:08.519> of

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
absolutely necessary to have 65 tons of

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.870 
absolutely necessary to have 65 tons of
pressure<00:00:09.269> to<00:00:09.870> form<00:00:10.650> something<00:00:11.130> with

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
pressure to form something with

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.770 
pressure to form something with
approximately<00:00:12.690> three<00:00:12.990> ounces<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.969> plastic<00:00:14.969> so

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
approximately three ounces of plastic so

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.560 
approximately three ounces of plastic so
what<00:00:16.080> I'm<00:00:16.199> going<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.590> do<00:00:16.770> is<00:00:17.010> I'm<00:00:17.850> going<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.420> be

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to be

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.689 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to be
the<00:00:18.900> injection<00:00:19.439> mold<00:00:19.680> I'm<00:00:19.920> going<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.430> try<00:00:20.670> to

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
the injection mold I'm going to try to

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.390 
the injection mold I'm going to try to
form<00:00:21.060> something<00:00:21.359> out<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.720> plastic<00:00:22.170> that<00:00:22.410> looks

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
form something out of plastic that looks

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.080 
form something out of plastic that looks
like<00:00:23.580> this<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.740> at<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.920> 99-cent<00:00:26.400> store<00:00:26.910> they

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
like this so at the 99-cent store they

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.750 
like this so at the 99-cent store they
sold<00:00:27.330> these<00:00:27.539> things<00:00:28.099> I'm<00:00:29.099> not<00:00:29.340> sure<00:00:29.400> what

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
sold these things I'm not sure what

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.720 
sold these things I'm not sure what
they're<00:00:29.910> used<00:00:30.119> for<00:00:31.160> but<00:00:32.160> what<00:00:32.309> I'm<00:00:32.430> going<00:00:32.700> to

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
they're used for but what I'm going to

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.450 
they're used for but what I'm going to
do<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.450> put<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.750> little<00:00:33.899> spacer<00:00:34.530> at<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.250> bomb

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
do is put a little spacer at the bomb

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.770 
do is put a little spacer at the bomb
and<00:00:36.290> then<00:00:37.290> put<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:38.040> thing<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.670> top<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.750> that

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
and then put this thing on top so that

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.530 
and then put this thing on top so that
there's<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.170> little<00:00:40.320> bit<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.649> gap<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.360> I<00:00:42.360> can

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
there's a little bit of a gap and I can

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.660 
there's a little bit of a gap and I can
hopefully<00:00:42.719> form<00:00:43.200> something<00:00:43.530> thin<00:00:43.980> inside<00:00:44.520> of

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
hopefully form something thin inside of

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.630 
hopefully form something thin inside of
it<00:00:44.820> by<00:00:45.629> putting<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.410> correct<00:00:47.010> volume<00:00:47.250> of

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
it by putting in the correct volume of

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.450 
it by putting in the correct volume of
liquid<00:00:47.840> so<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:49.260> find<00:00:49.500> out<00:00:49.649> what<00:00:49.829> volume<00:00:50.070> goes

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
liquid so to find out what volume goes

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.560 
liquid so to find out what volume goes
in<00:00:50.640> here<00:00:50.879> I'm<00:00:51.510> going<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.079> pour<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.739> some<00:00:53.129> liquid

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
in here I'm going to pour in some liquid

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.060 
in here I'm going to pour in some liquid
then

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.850 

approximately<00:01:02.070> this<00:01:02.280> much<00:01:02.340> how<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.650> needs<00:01:04.650> to

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
approximately this much how it needs to

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.100 
approximately this much how it needs to
be<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.220> there<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.790> I'm<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.540> measure<00:01:06.870> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
be in there and I'm going to measure the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.800 
be in there and I'm going to measure the
weight<00:01:07.290> at<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.040> use<00:01:08.700> my<00:01:08.940> scale<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.630> get

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
weight at this and use my scale to get

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.260 
weight at this and use my scale to get
the<00:01:09.990> proper<00:01:10.350> amount<00:01:10.440> of<00:01:10.710> polypropylene<00:01:11.310> okay

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
the proper amount of polypropylene okay

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.370 
the proper amount of polypropylene okay
so<00:01:13.250> so<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.670> water<00:01:14.940> now

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.190 

we<00:01:18.380> have<00:01:18.590> some<00:01:19.460> fluid<00:01:19.850> in<00:01:19.970> here<00:01:20.210> just<00:01:20.840> enough

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
we have some fluid in here just enough

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.720 
we have some fluid in here just enough
fluid<00:01:21.680> to

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
fluid to

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.440 
fluid to
this<00:01:24.360> thing<00:01:24.630> for<00:01:24.870> most<00:01:25.020> glowing<00:01:25.380> I<00:01:26.300> take<00:01:27.300> up

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
this thing for most glowing I take up

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.470 
this thing for most glowing I take up
the<00:01:27.570> spacer

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:32.480 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.470 

then

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
then

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:43.440 
then
how<00:01:35.020> to<00:01:35.080> measure<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.590> volume<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:36.100> this<00:01:36.220> water

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.720 

Wow

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
Wow

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:49.380 
Wow
or<00:01:46.030> announces<00:01:46.840> I'm<00:01:47.800> actually<00:01:48.040> putting<00:01:48.490> six

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
or announces I'm actually putting six

point two ounces of polypropylene resin

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.630 
point two ounces of polypropylene resin
in<00:01:55.240> here<00:01:55.480> because<00:01:55.900> I'm<00:01:56.590> guessing<00:01:57.280> that<00:01:57.310> a<00:01:57.430> lot

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
in here because I'm guessing that a lot

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.520 
in here because I'm guessing that a lot
of<00:01:57.730> it<00:01:57.820> is<00:01:57.910> going<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.150> stick<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.600> pan<00:01:58.930> so<00:01:59.200> I

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
of it is going to stick to the pan so I

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:00.960 
of it is going to stick to the pan so I
want<00:01:59.680> to<00:01:59.710> make<00:01:59.830> sure<00:01:59.860> I<00:01:59.980> have<00:02:00.250> enough<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:00.670> form

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
want to make sure I have enough to form

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.819 
want to make sure I have enough to form
the<00:02:01.150> whole<00:02:01.300> piece<00:02:01.540> it<00:02:01.930> in

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.300 

standard<00:02:05.829> $40<00:02:06.640> skillet<00:02:07.299> from<00:02:07.570> target<00:02:08.289> have<00:02:09.190> it

stuff<00:02:12.970> on<00:02:13.420> here<00:02:14.340> you're<00:02:15.340> gonna<00:02:15.459> wait<00:02:16.590> this

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
stuff on here you're gonna wait this

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.320 
stuff on here you're gonna wait this
thing<00:02:17.830> has<00:02:17.980> been<00:02:18.010> sitting<00:02:18.160> here<00:02:18.550> for<00:02:18.790> about<00:02:18.819> 20

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
thing has been sitting here for about 20

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.630 
thing has been sitting here for about 20
minutes<00:02:19.510> now<00:02:19.810> with<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.440> lid<00:02:20.650> closed<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.340> on

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
minutes now with the lid closed and on

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.690 
minutes now with the lid closed and on
400<00:02:22.239> degrees<00:02:22.510> Fahrenheit<00:02:23.550> you're<00:02:24.550> only

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
400 degrees Fahrenheit you're only

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.580 
400 degrees Fahrenheit you're only
supposed<00:02:24.940> to<00:02:25.090> heat<00:02:25.269> this<00:02:25.450> up<00:02:25.599> to<00:02:25.750> 200<00:02:26.260> but<00:02:26.410> if<00:02:26.500> I

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
supposed to heat this up to 200 but if I

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.250 
supposed to heat this up to 200 but if I
leave<00:02:26.860> it<00:02:26.980> at<00:02:27.099> 200<00:02:27.580> the<00:02:27.790> plastic<00:02:28.599> never<00:02:28.840> melts

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
leave it at 200 the plastic never melts

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.800 
leave it at 200 the plastic never melts
because<00:02:29.590> it's<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:30.670> heat<00:02:30.880> is<00:02:31.000> distributed<00:02:31.660> so

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
because it's the heat is distributed so

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.640 
because it's the heat is distributed so
unevenly<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:33.400> before<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.330> lift<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.840> lid<00:02:35.019> I'm

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
unevenly so before I lift the lid I'm

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.930 
unevenly so before I lift the lid I'm
going<00:02:35.799> to<00:02:35.860> put<00:02:36.069> on<00:02:36.220> the<00:02:37.110> little<00:02:38.940> respirator

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
going to put on the little respirator

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.720 
going to put on the little respirator
here

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.470 

and<00:02:45.090> then<00:02:45.620> putting<00:02:46.620> on<00:02:46.800> gloves<00:02:47.480> underneath

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
and then putting on gloves underneath

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.600 
and then putting on gloves underneath
gloves<00:02:48.959> is<00:02:49.319> recommended<00:02:50.190> because<00:02:50.340> this

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
gloves is recommended because this

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:59.559 
gloves is recommended because this
thing's<00:02:50.849> is<00:02:51.000> too<00:02:51.209> hot

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.790 

this<00:03:00.569> thing<00:03:00.840> has<00:03:00.990> been<00:03:01.020> sitting<00:03:01.170> here<00:03:01.560> for

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
this thing has been sitting here for

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.980 
this thing has been sitting here for
about<00:03:01.830> 20<00:03:02.340> minutes<00:03:02.490> now<00:03:02.819> with<00:03:03.270> the<00:03:03.450> lid<00:03:03.630> closed

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
about 20 minutes now with the lid closed

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.550 
about 20 minutes now with the lid closed
hand<00:03:04.380> on<00:03:04.650> 400<00:03:05.250> degrees<00:03:05.520> Fahrenheit<00:03:06.560> you're

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
hand on 400 degrees Fahrenheit you're

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.410 
hand on 400 degrees Fahrenheit you're
only<00:03:07.680> supposed<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.100> heat<00:03:08.280> this<00:03:08.459> up<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.760> 200<00:03:09.270> but

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
only supposed to heat this up to 200 but

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.840 
only supposed to heat this up to 200 but
if<00:03:09.510> I<00:03:09.600> leave<00:03:09.870> it<00:03:09.990> at<00:03:10.110> 200<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.800> plastic<00:03:11.580> never

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
if I leave it at 200 the plastic never

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.000 
if I leave it at 200 the plastic never
melts<00:03:12.270> because<00:03:12.600> it's<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:13.680> heat<00:03:13.860> is

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
melts because it's the heat is

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.660 
melts because it's the heat is
distributed<00:03:14.670> so<00:03:14.819> unevenly<00:03:15.410> so<00:03:16.410> before<00:03:17.160> I<00:03:17.340> lift

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
distributed so unevenly so before I lift

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.940 
distributed so unevenly so before I lift
the<00:03:17.820> lid<00:03:18.030> I'm<00:03:18.660> going<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.870> put<00:03:19.080> on<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:20.209> little

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
the lid I'm going to put on the little

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.740 
the lid I'm going to put on the little
respirator<00:03:22.950> here

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.970 

then<00:03:28.640> putting<00:03:29.640> on<00:03:29.820> gloves<00:03:30.470> underneath<00:03:31.470> clubs

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
then putting on gloves underneath clubs

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.010 
then putting on gloves underneath clubs
is<00:03:32.340> recommended<00:03:33.180> because<00:03:33.330> this<00:03:33.630> thing's<00:03:33.870> is

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
is recommended because this thing's is

00:03:34.020 --> 00:05:53.150 
is recommended because this thing's is
too<00:03:34.230> hot

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:00.760 

you

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:14.640 

you

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:18.840 

ok<00:06:15.400> so<00:06:16.080> here<00:06:17.080> is<00:06:17.259> the<00:06:17.440> mold<00:06:17.680> after<00:06:18.009> it<00:06:18.310> has<00:06:18.460> cool

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:18.850 
ok so here is the mold after it has cool

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:26.730 
ok so here is the mold after it has cool
and<00:06:20.160> if<00:06:21.419> I<00:06:22.419> take<00:06:22.990> this<00:06:23.229> piece<00:06:23.530> apart<00:06:25.050> the<00:06:26.050> piece

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
and if I take this piece apart the piece

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.570 
and if I take this piece apart the piece
inside<00:06:27.639> of<00:06:27.850> it<00:06:28.030> has<00:06:28.720> formed<00:06:29.320> very<00:06:30.310> well

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
inside of it has formed very well

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.960 
inside of it has formed very well
actually<00:06:30.850> and<00:06:32.039> this<00:06:33.039> is<00:06:33.250> just<00:06:33.490> by<00:06:33.699> pressing

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:33.970 
actually and this is just by pressing

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.939 
actually and this is just by pressing
the<00:06:34.300> two<00:06:34.479> halves<00:06:34.720> together<00:06:34.990> remember<00:06:35.530> these

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:35.949 
the two halves together remember these

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:40.020 
the two halves together remember these
two<00:06:36.160> pieces<00:06:36.370> were<00:06:36.729> not<00:06:36.910> heated<00:06:37.419> at<00:06:37.600> all<00:06:37.780> and<00:06:39.030> if

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
two pieces were not heated at all and if

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.260 
two pieces were not heated at all and if
i<00:06:40.900> was<00:06:41.259> to<00:06:41.500> heat<00:06:41.800> this<00:06:42.070> the<00:06:42.580> plastic<00:06:43.090> would

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
i was to heat this the plastic would

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.080 
i was to heat this the plastic would
have<00:06:43.360> flowed<00:06:43.600> much<00:06:43.930> better<00:06:44.229> so<00:06:44.979> i<00:06:45.400> think<00:06:45.789> that

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.090 
have flowed much better so i think that

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.850 
have flowed much better so i think that
it<00:06:46.360> is<00:06:46.479> possible<00:06:46.720> to<00:06:47.020> have<00:06:47.199> a<00:06:47.229> press<00:06:47.590> mole

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:47.860 
it is possible to have a press mole

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.860 
it is possible to have a press mole
without<00:06:48.250> an<00:06:48.400> actual<00:06:48.580> injection<00:06:49.150> mold<00:06:49.389> if<00:06:49.630> your

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:49.870 
without an actual injection mold if your

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:53.100 
without an actual injection mold if your
part<00:06:50.199> is<00:06:50.470> simple<00:06:51.250> enough<00:06:51.340> and<00:06:51.760> you<00:06:52.479> can<00:06:52.720> heat

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.110 
part is simple enough and you can heat

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.800 
part is simple enough and you can heat
the<00:06:53.949> actual<00:06:54.370> form<00:06:54.669> so<00:06:54.940> that<00:06:54.970> the<00:06:55.210> plastic<00:06:55.449> will

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
the actual form so that the plastic will

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:01.440 
the actual form so that the plastic will
continue<00:06:56.289> to<00:06:56.500> flow<00:06:56.650> and<00:06:57.070> not<00:06:58.440> solidify
