well as well as the finals on the day so

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.039 
well as well as the finals on the day so
I<00:02:26.620> believe<00:02:27.459> the<00:02:27.670> top<00:02:27.909> two<00:02:28.120> vases<00:02:28.329> are<00:02:28.780> going<00:02:28.989> to

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
I believe the top two vases are going to

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.440 
I believe the top two vases are going to
go<00:02:29.319> through<00:02:29.650> each<00:02:30.519> stage<00:02:30.969> and<00:02:31.209> it's<00:02:31.299> going<00:02:31.389> to

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
go through each stage and it's going to

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.360 
go through each stage and it's going to
be<00:02:31.569> single<00:02:31.900> elimination<00:02:32.469> so<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:33.069> top<00:02:33.250> two

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
be single elimination so the top two

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.129 
be single elimination so the top two
races<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:33.879> any<00:02:33.969> given<00:02:34.329> race<00:02:34.510> though<00:02:34.959> go

get<00:03:34.479> involved<00:03:34.720> at<00:03:35.019> least<00:03:35.229> watch<00:03:35.500> it<00:03:35.709> if<00:03:35.859> you

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
get involved at least watch it if you

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.399 
get involved at least watch it if you
double<00:03:36.669> erase<00:03:36.879> some<00:03:37.269> reason<00:03:37.540> like<00:03:37.659> I<00:03:37.870> just

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:38.409 
double erase some reason like I just

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:40.800 
double erase some reason like I just
know<00:03:38.650> and<00:03:38.949> then<00:03:39.729> watch<00:03:39.909> it<00:03:40.120> in<00:03:40.389> watch<00:03:40.540> on<00:03:40.720> the

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
know and then watch it in watch on the

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.240 
know and then watch it in watch on the
stream<00:03:41.049> you<00:03:41.290> can<00:03:41.319> watch<00:03:41.439> it<00:03:41.650> afterwards<00:03:41.919> I

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
stream you can watch it afterwards I

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.679 
stream you can watch it afterwards I
think<00:03:42.609> it<00:03:42.669> would<00:03:42.759> be<00:03:42.819> a<00:03:42.849> great<00:03:43.120> little<00:03:43.389> event
