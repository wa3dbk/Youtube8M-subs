00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.030 
cards yeah which is everything stage we
just<00:02:58.750> have<00:02:58.870> to<00:02:58.989> put<00:02:59.170> mine<00:02:59.349> carts<00:02:59.739> on<00:02:59.889> there

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
just have to put mine carts on there

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.000 
just have to put mine carts on there
don't<00:03:00.219> we<00:03:00.810> place<00:03:01.810> your<00:03:02.079> mine<00:03:02.349> carts<00:03:02.769> on<00:03:02.919> the

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
don't we place your mine carts on the

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.459 
don't we place your mine carts on the
slanted<00:03:03.489> rail<00:03:04.859> maximum<00:03:05.859> of<00:03:06.010> five<00:03:07.469> either

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:08.469 
slanted rail maximum of five either

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:17.429 
slanted rail maximum of five either
pushed<00:03:08.739> off<00:03:08.950> some<00:03:09.280> of<00:03:09.310> the<00:03:09.519> circuits<00:03:16.290> so<00:03:17.290> we're

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:17.439 
pushed off some of the circuits so we're

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:19.589 
pushed off some of the circuits so we're
going<00:03:17.560> to<00:03:17.650> put<00:03:17.769> on<00:03:17.919> five<00:03:18.280> it's<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.209> lefty<00:03:19.569> on

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
going to put on five it's a lefty on

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:27.080 
going to put on five it's a lefty on
five<00:03:20.489> maximum<00:03:21.489> five<00:03:25.049> how<00:03:26.049> many<00:03:26.290> have<00:03:26.349> I<00:03:26.500> put<00:03:26.709> on

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
five maximum five how many have I put on

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.819 
five maximum five how many have I put on
40<00:03:28.169> by<00:03:29.169> jewel<00:03:30.449> is<00:03:31.449> that<00:03:31.599> five<00:03:31.870> now<00:03:32.109> I<00:03:32.349> think<00:03:32.500> so

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
40 by jewel is that five now I think so

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:38.689 
40 by jewel is that five now I think so
you<00:03:33.159> must<00:03:33.340> have<00:03:33.430> been<00:03:34.030> counting<00:03:34.750> them<00:03:34.900> to<00:03:35.139> you

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:38.699 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.009 

you<00:03:39.699> sure<00:03:39.909> made<00:03:39.939> a<00:03:40.150> bold<00:03:40.329> flyer<00:03:40.599> it<00:03:40.750> just<00:03:40.900> has<00:03:40.989> a

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
you sure made a bold flyer it just has a

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.119 
you sure made a bold flyer it just has a
maximum<00:03:41.439> of<00:03:41.709> five<00:03:41.979> I<00:03:43.109> put<00:03:44.109> on<00:03:44.259> for<00:03:44.560> I<00:03:44.590> think<00:03:44.799> the

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
maximum of five I put on for I think the

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.809 
maximum of five I put on for I think the
know<00:03:45.310> four<00:03:45.579> or<00:03:45.609> five<00:03:47.370> miles<00:03:48.370> a<00:03:48.430> pressure<00:03:48.639> plate

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
know four or five miles a pressure plate

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.110 
know four or five miles a pressure plate
there<00:03:49.060> as<00:03:49.150> well<00:03:49.329> try<00:03:50.290> pushing<00:03:50.530> it<00:03:50.769> ice<00:03:51.729> for

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
there as well try pushing it ice for

00:03:52.120 --> 00:04:00.809 
there as well try pushing it ice for
arrivals<00:03:58.139> perhaps<00:03:59.139> it<00:03:59.379> drops<00:03:59.650> the<00:03:59.919> cart<00:04:00.189> into

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
arrivals perhaps it drops the cart into

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.990 
arrivals perhaps it drops the cart into
the<00:04:01.209> rim<00:04:01.419> below<00:04:04.979> so<00:04:05.979> let's<00:04:06.189> try<00:04:06.459> calling<00:04:06.909> a

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
the rim below so let's try calling a

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:19.050 
the rim below so let's try calling a
cart<00:04:10.889> did<00:04:11.889> one<00:04:12.099> come

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:27.940 

no<00:04:23.260> there's<00:04:24.260> no<00:04:24.410> Spencer<00:04:24.980> empty<00:04:26.830> even<00:04:27.830> though

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
no there's no Spencer empty even though

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.190 
no there's no Spencer empty even though
we<00:04:28.100> just<00:04:28.130> filled<00:04:28.550> it<00:04:28.790> I<00:04:29.030> really<00:04:29.900> needed<00:04:30.080> me

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
we just filled it I really needed me

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.720 
we just filled it I really needed me
here<00:04:30.320> maybe<00:04:30.530> two<00:04:30.860> and<00:04:31.010> five<00:04:31.220> then<00:04:31.490> maybe

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:31.730 
here maybe two and five then maybe

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.510 
here maybe two and five then maybe
didn't<00:04:31.970> put<00:04:32.120> enough<00:04:32.180> in<00:04:35.950> try<00:04:36.950> playing<00:04:37.220> one

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
didn't put enough in try playing one

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.120 
didn't put enough in try playing one
more<00:04:41.110> is<00:04:42.110> wrong<00:04:42.380> we<00:04:42.530> could<00:04:42.680> have<00:04:42.770> destroyed

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
more is wrong we could have destroyed

00:04:43.130 --> 00:05:05.219 
more is wrong we could have destroyed
the<00:04:43.280> entire<00:04:43.370> thing<00:04:46.060> to<00:04:47.060> put<00:04:47.240> in<00:04:47.270> yeah<00:04:50.050> push<00:04:51.050> it

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.429

redstone on there that masters normal
let<00:05:27.259> us<00:05:27.409> a<00:05:27.439> normal<00:05:27.680> one<00:05:27.889> Oh<00:05:29.110> in<00:05:30.110> that<00:05:30.169> case

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
let us a normal one Oh in that case

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:36.730 
let us a normal one Oh in that case
let's<00:05:30.770> walk<00:05:31.449> really<00:05:33.819> what's<00:05:34.819> the<00:05:35.590> we're<00:05:36.590> gonna

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
let's walk really what's the we're gonna

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.619 
let's walk really what's the we're gonna
have<00:05:36.979> to<00:05:37.250> I'm<00:05:37.400> way<00:05:37.580> I<00:05:37.610> don't<00:05:37.909> know<00:05:38.060> I'm<00:05:38.240> sure<00:05:38.270> we

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:38.629 
have to I'm way I don't know I'm sure we

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:54.949 
deepest up by men yeah so doctors say

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:57.550 
deepest up by men yeah so doctors say
the<00:05:55.069> visible<00:05:55.599> changes<00:05:56.599> the<00:05:56.750> light<00:05:56.930> what<00:05:57.319> warm
