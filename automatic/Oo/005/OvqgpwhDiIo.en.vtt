00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.920
 hello everyone is the da and today I would like 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.470
 propose the recipe for a pop 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.660
 Christmas ingredients you need 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.590
 to make one, there are two mafias 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.720
 crumble a stick 2 tablespoons of 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.150
 jam icing on and off of 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.810
 sugar and a star-shaped mold 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:37.950
 let's start immediately pour the muffins 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:41.010
 crumble in a bowl and there 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.430
 we put about a teaspoon of 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.050
 jam clearly here you will have to 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.120
 go also according to the humidity of the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.670
 sweet that you have crumbled to regulate yourself 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.550
 you have to get enough pasta 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.469
 consisting of being able to be modeled myself 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.690
 for personal taste he used the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.940
 blueberry jam but to you 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.079
 I recommend using it clearly 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.980
 that you dirty them as little as possible 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.980
 reshuffle 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.780
 once you have mixed two ingredients 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:20.200
 get a fairly firm mixture from 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.560
 to be able to be amalgamated then it 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:28.590
 take the press well in your hand e 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.590
 get a tree-like cone shape 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:35.829
 once obtained the form must 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.859
 rest in the refrigerator for half an hour on 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:43.209
 our cone is very cold 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:44.909
 let's take the stick, we slip through 

00:01:43.209 --> 00:01:48.969
 about a centimeter 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:54.189
 then with our real ice 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:57.640
 let's just put them a tip in 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:02:00.069
 so that the same can take hold now 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.530
 all that remains is to decorate and make 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:05.469
 hints in our tree always with the 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.440
 frozen real well I mounted 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:11.519
 a spout in the shape of a star and let's go 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.519
 to create our needles 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:25.140
 our sapling after 12 hours of 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.299
 rest is well dry we just have to 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.829
 decorate and for sure for this 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.810
 operation even the children will do 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:33.659
 happy to help you 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:38.090
 we need yellow sugar paste and 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:41.849
 red and a star-shaped stencil 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.340
 start forming red balls 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.959
 let them have different sizes so that the 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.359
 your tree is even more 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.760
 characteristic we now glue the 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:57.209
 decorations just need a bit of 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:03:00.659
 We spread our own album of water 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:03.840
 yellow sugar paste leaving the 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:06.780
 benz party indeed we will go to form a 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.030
 star with the coppapasta but saw that the 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.159
 put me upright the star will have 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.540
 need a little bit of thickness per 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.540
 stay well straight 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.790
 this is our finished tree 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.850
 I hope you enjoyed the tutorial 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:33.110
 I wish you a peaceful and sugary Christmas 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.110
