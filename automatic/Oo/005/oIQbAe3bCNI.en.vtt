interaction this is the last of the
theme<00:00:15.770> five<00:00:16.129> themes<00:00:16.490> of<00:00:16.699> geography<00:00:16.730> that<00:00:17.300> we

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
theme five themes of geography that we

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.429 
theme five themes of geography that we
will<00:00:17.779> study<00:00:18.020> so<00:00:18.350> let's<00:00:18.560> get<00:00:18.740> to<00:00:18.980> it<00:00:19.810> okay<00:00:20.810> so

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:21.439 
will study so let's get to it okay so

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.759 
will study so let's get to it okay so
the<00:00:21.800> three<00:00:22.130> things<00:00:22.339> that<00:00:22.580> we<00:00:22.759> mentioned<00:00:23.769> human

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
the three things that we mentioned human

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:26.140 
the three things that we mentioned human
beings<00:00:25.099> and<00:00:25.279> interacting<00:00:25.849> with<00:00:25.880> the

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
beings and interacting with the

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.839 
beings and interacting with the
environment<00:00:26.720> they're<00:00:26.839> the<00:00:27.140> three<00:00:27.470> ways<00:00:27.800> that

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:27.849 
environment they're the three ways that

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.159 
environment they're the three ways that
we<00:00:28.849> as<00:00:28.999> people<00:00:29.449> interact<00:00:29.869> with<00:00:30.050> our

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
we as people interact with our

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:33.400 
we as people interact with our
environment<00:00:30.739> we<00:00:31.369> can<00:00:31.519> either<00:00:31.669> adapt<00:00:32.509> modify

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
environment we can either adapt modify

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.370 
environment we can either adapt modify
or<00:00:34.160> depending<00:00:34.760> on<00:00:34.790> the<00:00:34.940> environment<00:00:35.210> so<00:00:35.810> the

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
or depending on the environment so the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.439 
or depending on the environment so the
first<00:00:36.620> one<00:00:36.859> we<00:00:36.980> will<00:00:37.070> get<00:00:37.219> to<00:00:37.430> is<00:00:37.579> adapt<00:00:37.850> that

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:38.449 
first one we will get to is adapt that

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:40.240 
first one we will get to is adapt that
is<00:00:38.600> adaptation<00:00:39.350> so<00:00:39.530> what<00:00:39.649> I<00:00:39.680> want<00:00:39.920> you<00:00:40.070> guys<00:00:40.219> to

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
is adaptation so what I want you guys to

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.610 
is adaptation so what I want you guys to
do<00:00:40.520> is<00:00:40.550> write<00:00:40.850> down<00:00:41.120> the<00:00:41.899> definition<00:00:42.140> of

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
do is write down the definition of

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.459 
do is write down the definition of
adapting<00:00:43.160> and<00:00:43.309> right<00:00:43.489> now<00:00:43.670> what<00:00:43.940> that<00:00:43.969> is

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
adapting and right now what that is

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.470 
adapting and right now what that is
adapting<00:00:45.469> is<00:00:45.590> when<00:00:45.800> human<00:00:46.219> beings<00:00:46.480> change

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
adapting is when human beings change

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.389 
adapting is when human beings change
themselves<00:00:47.870> in<00:00:48.670> order<00:00:49.670> to<00:00:49.820> more<00:00:50.239> efficiently

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
themselves in order to more efficiently

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.819 
themselves in order to more efficiently
interact<00:00:52.399> with<00:00:52.640> their<00:00:52.820> environment<00:00:53.420> so<00:00:53.829> once

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
interact with their environment so once

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.139 
interact with their environment so once
again<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.719> definition<00:00:56.719> for<00:00:57.019> adapt<00:00:57.739> is<00:00:58.149> when

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
again the definition for adapt is when

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.079 
again the definition for adapt is when
human<00:00:59.510> beings<00:00:59.539> change<00:01:00.230> themselves<00:01:00.620> in<00:01:01.280> order

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:02.089 
human beings change themselves in order

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.720 
human beings change themselves in order
to<00:01:02.239> more<00:01:02.420> efficiently<00:01:03.339> interact<00:01:04.339> with<00:01:04.580> the

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
to more efficiently interact with the

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.770 
to more efficiently interact with the
environment<00:01:06.250> so<00:01:07.250> some<00:01:07.520> examples<00:01:08.120> of<00:01:08.390> human

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
environment so some examples of human

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.819 
environment so some examples of human
beings<00:01:09.020> interacting<00:01:09.560> with<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.799> environment

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:09.829 
beings interacting with the environment

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:12.640 
beings interacting with the environment
are<00:01:10.460> one<00:01:11.270> wearing<00:01:11.570> sunglasses<00:01:11.840> we<00:01:12.470> wear

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
the winter time we as human beings wear

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:28.960 
the winter time we as human beings wear
a<00:01:27.110> lot<00:01:27.409> of<00:01:27.590> we<00:01:28.189> were<00:01:28.310> heavier<00:01:28.640> clothes

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
a lot of we were heavier clothes

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.539 
a lot of we were heavier clothes
especially<00:01:29.409> the<00:01:30.409> way<00:01:30.530> in<00:01:30.829> places<00:01:31.250> where<00:01:31.399> it's

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:31.549 
especially the way in places where it's

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:33.490 
especially the way in places where it's
cold<00:01:31.820> it<00:01:32.210> doesn't<00:01:32.600> occur<00:01:32.810> too<00:01:33.020> often<00:01:33.409> like

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
cold it doesn't occur too often like

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.880 
cold it doesn't occur too often like
that<00:01:33.560> in<00:01:33.920> Louisiana<00:01:34.460> I<00:01:35.500> think<00:01:36.500> I<00:01:36.590> wore<00:01:36.740> my

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
that in Louisiana I think I wore my

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.530 
that in Louisiana I think I wore my
heavy<00:01:37.070> coat<00:01:37.310> twice<00:01:37.610> last<00:01:37.880> year<00:01:38.090> and<00:01:38.420> I<00:01:38.509> just

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
heavy coat twice last year and I just

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.749 
heavy coat twice last year and I just
think<00:01:38.930> I<00:01:39.049> wore<00:01:39.320> it<00:01:39.469> not<00:01:39.710> because<00:01:40.070> it<00:01:40.189> was<00:01:40.310> cold

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
think I wore it not because it was cold

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.120 
think I wore it not because it was cold
enough<00:01:40.909> but<00:01:41.500> you<00:01:42.500> know<00:01:42.619> I<00:01:42.649> paid<00:01:42.920> good<00:01:43.070> money

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
enough but you know I paid good money

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.530 
enough but you know I paid good money
for<00:01:43.340> that<00:01:43.520> coat<00:01:43.759> so<00:01:43.939> I<00:01:43.969> figured<00:01:44.240> I<00:01:44.270> had<00:01:44.390> to<00:01:44.479> at

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
for that coat so I figured I had to at

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.359 
for that coat so I figured I had to at
least<00:01:44.600> get<00:01:45.140> it<00:01:45.200> out<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:45.710> closet<00:01:46.100> and<00:01:46.189> wear<00:01:46.340> it

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
least get it out the closet and wear it

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.590 
least get it out the closet and wear it
once<00:01:46.610> or<00:01:46.790> twice<00:01:46.820> but<00:01:47.689> I<00:01:47.960> digress<00:01:48.590> getting<00:01:48.950> back

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
once or twice but I digress getting back

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.090 
once or twice but I digress getting back
wearing<00:01:50.600> a<00:01:50.810> heavy<00:01:51.140> coat<00:01:51.409> in<00:01:51.619> the<00:01:51.710> winter<00:01:51.950> time

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
wearing a heavy coat in the winter time

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.469 
wearing a heavy coat in the winter time
is<00:01:52.310> a<00:01:52.340> way<00:01:52.520> that<00:01:52.820> we<00:01:52.939> as<00:01:53.060> people<00:01:53.450> change

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
is a way that we as people change

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.590 
is a way that we as people change
ourselves<00:01:53.930> and<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.219> in<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:55.640> way<00:01:55.789> so<00:01:56.149> that<00:01:56.329> we<00:01:56.420> can

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
ourselves and so in a way so that we can

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.230 
ourselves and so in a way so that we can
better<00:01:56.780> interact<00:01:57.020> with<00:01:57.350> our<00:01:57.500> environment

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
better interact with our environment

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.149 
better interact with our environment
also<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.630> last<00:01:59.810> one<00:01:59.990> putting<00:02:00.710> on<00:02:00.859> a<00:02:00.890> number

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
also the last one putting on a number

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.279 
also the last one putting on a number
I'll<00:02:01.280> in<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:01.549> rain<00:02:01.820> using<00:02:02.539> an<00:02:02.630> umbrella<00:02:02.990> in

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
I'll in the rain using an umbrella in

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.980 
I'll in the rain using an umbrella in
the<00:02:03.439> rain<00:02:03.649> to<00:02:04.640> keep<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.000> rain<00:02:05.180> off<00:02:05.210> us<00:02:05.630> that<00:02:05.840> is

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
the rain to keep the rain off us that is

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.310 
the rain to keep the rain off us that is
another<00:02:06.289> way<00:02:06.560> that<00:02:06.799> we<00:02:07.609> change<00:02:08.420> ourselves<00:02:08.690> in

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
another way that we change ourselves in

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:10.810 
another way that we change ourselves in
order<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:09.680> better<00:02:09.890> interact<00:02:10.369> with<00:02:10.670> our

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:10.820 
order to better interact with our

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:13.180 
order to better interact with our
environment<00:02:11.330> that<00:02:12.170> brings<00:02:12.230> us<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.739> modifying

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
environment that brings us to modifying

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.339 
environment that brings us to modifying
okay<00:02:13.910> so<00:02:13.970> what<00:02:14.390> I<00:02:14.420> want<00:02:14.690> you<00:02:14.780> to<00:02:14.840> do<00:02:15.019> is<00:02:15.170> just

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
okay so what I want you to do is just

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.350 
okay so what I want you to do is just
think<00:02:15.500> about<00:02:15.650> modifying<00:02:16.489> being<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.569> exact

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
think about modifying being the exact

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.140 
think about modifying being the exact
opposite<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.870> adapting<00:02:19.410> okay<00:02:19.800> in<00:02:20.280> adapting

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
opposite of adapting okay in adapting

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.600 
opposite of adapting okay in adapting
people<00:02:21.870> we<00:02:22.170> change<00:02:22.440> ourselves<00:02:22.680> in<00:02:23.310> order<00:02:23.490> to

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
people we change ourselves in order to

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.820 
people we change ourselves in order to
interact<00:02:24.030> with<00:02:24.240> an<00:02:24.360> environment<00:02:24.960> when<00:02:25.710> you

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
interact with an environment when you

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:32.110 
interact with an environment when you
modify<00:02:26.220> or<00:02:26.870> modifying<00:02:29.750> we<00:02:30.750> as<00:02:30.900> people<00:02:31.140> change

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
modify or modifying we as people change

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.290 
modify or modifying we as people change
the<00:02:33.120> environment<00:02:33.810> around<00:02:34.710> us<00:02:35.280> we<00:02:35.610> change<00:02:35.940> our

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
the environment around us we change our

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.500 
the environment around us we change our
environment<00:02:36.450> around<00:02:37.050> us<00:02:37.470> so<00:02:38.400> make<00:02:39.240> sure<00:02:39.270> you

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
environment around us so make sure you

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.900 
environment around us so make sure you
have<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:39.840> written<00:02:39.990> down<00:02:40.460> humans<00:02:41.460> change<00:02:41.670> the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
have that written down humans change the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.810 
have that written down humans change the
environment<00:02:42.060> around<00:02:42.510> us<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.290> we<00:02:43.500> can<00:02:43.820> and

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
environment around us so that we can and

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.030 
environment around us so that we can and
so<00:02:45.600> humans<00:02:46.140> change<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.530> environment<00:02:46.980> around

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
so humans change the environment around

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.800 
so humans change the environment around
us<00:02:47.340> so<00:02:47.520> we<00:02:47.640> can<00:02:47.760> better<00:02:47.910> interact<00:02:48.390> with<00:02:48.630> it

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
us so we can better interact with it

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.760 
us so we can better interact with it
more<00:02:49.050> efficiently

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
more efficiently

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.800 
more efficiently
some<00:02:50.459> examples<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.120> modifying<00:02:51.690> the

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
some examples of modifying the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.449 
some examples of modifying the
environment<00:02:52.580> on<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.700> cut<00:02:53.910> down<00:02:54.090> trees

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
environment on the cut down trees

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.360 
environment on the cut down trees
another<00:02:56.459> example<00:02:57.150> is<00:02:57.650> when<00:02:58.650> we<00:02:58.890> build<00:02:59.160> bridges

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
another example is when we build bridges

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.479 
another example is when we build bridges
to<00:02:59.880> get<00:03:00.810> us<00:03:00.930> from<00:03:01.110> one<00:03:01.320> place<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.860> another<00:03:02.070> from

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
to get us from one place to another from

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.360 
to get us from one place to another from
one<00:03:02.550> end<00:03:02.910> of<00:03:02.970> a<00:03:03.090> lake<00:03:03.300> or<00:03:03.570> or<00:03:04.560> an<00:03:04.890> area<00:03:05.070> to

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
one end of a lake or or an area to

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.870 
one end of a lake or or an area to
another

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
another

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.060 
another
and<00:03:06.000> here's<00:03:06.180> another<00:03:06.360> bridge<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.110> another

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
and here's another bridge and another

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.820 
and here's another bridge and another
example<00:03:08.850> is<00:03:08.940> when<00:03:09.120> we<00:03:09.239> build<00:03:09.450> roads<00:03:09.800> to<00:03:10.800> make

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
example is when we build roads to make

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.370 
example is when we build roads to make
it<00:03:11.160> easier<00:03:11.520> to<00:03:11.640> travel<00:03:11.910> across<00:03:12.239> distances<00:03:15.380> and

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
it easier to travel across distances and

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.340 
it easier to travel across distances and
the<00:03:17.310> last<00:03:17.550> one<00:03:17.880> the<00:03:18.180> last<00:03:18.209> way<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:19.050> we<00:03:19.170> as

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
the last one the last way that we as

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.550 
the last one the last way that we as
humans<00:03:19.800> depend<00:03:20.280> on<00:03:21.260> interact<00:03:22.260> with<00:03:22.440> the

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
humans depend on interact with the

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.350 
humans depend on interact with the
environment<00:03:23.160> is<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.310> we<00:03:23.610> depend<00:03:24.030> on<00:03:24.180> the

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
environment is that we depend on the

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.630 
environment is that we depend on the
environment<00:03:24.480> so<00:03:25.320> I<00:03:25.650> want<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.400> write<00:03:26.610> down

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
environment so I want you to write down

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.270 
environment so I want you to write down
this<00:03:27.120> definition<00:03:27.720> for<00:03:28.080> it<00:03:28.140> depending<00:03:28.650> is<00:03:28.799> when

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
this definition for it depending is when

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.150 
this definition for it depending is when
people<00:03:29.730> rely<00:03:30.180> on<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:31.410> environment<00:03:32.010> to

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
people rely on the environment to

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.910 
people rely on the environment to
provide<00:03:32.519> resources<00:03:33.420> so<00:03:34.320> when<00:03:34.470> we<00:03:34.530> say<00:03:34.739> that

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
provide resources so when we say that

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.740 
provide resources so when we say that
people<00:03:35.130> depend<00:03:35.400> on<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:35.940> environment<00:03:36.060> we<00:03:36.540> mean

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
people depend on the environment we mean

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.350 
people depend on the environment we mean
that<00:03:36.930> when<00:03:37.080> people<00:03:37.500> rely<00:03:38.459> on<00:03:38.489> the<00:03:39.239> environment

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
that when people rely on the environment

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.380 
that when people rely on the environment
to<00:03:39.959> provide<00:03:40.260> resources<00:03:40.709> and<00:03:41.610> some<00:03:41.820> examples

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
to provide resources and some examples

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.370 
to provide resources and some examples
are<00:03:42.600> solar<00:03:43.440> energy<00:03:44.209> wind<00:03:45.209> energy<00:03:45.510> fossil

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
are solar energy wind energy fossil

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.500 
are solar energy wind energy fossil
fuels<00:03:46.920> we<00:03:47.190> say<00:03:47.340> fossil<00:03:47.790> fuels<00:03:48.000> we<00:03:48.120> mean<00:03:48.239> things

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
fuels we say fossil fuels we mean things

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.289 
fuels we say fossil fuels we mean things
like<00:03:48.660> oil<00:03:49.260> gas<00:03:49.440> all<00:03:50.130> those<00:03:50.340> things<00:03:50.610> petroleum

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
like oil gas all those things petroleum

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.000 
like oil gas all those things petroleum
we<00:03:51.480> use<00:03:51.660> those<00:03:51.840> things<00:03:52.019> to<00:03:52.140> make<00:03:52.290> plastics<00:03:52.860> and

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
we use those things to make plastics and

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.170 
we use those things to make plastics and
pretty<00:03:53.160> much<00:03:53.280> everything<00:03:53.610> in<00:03:53.910> our<00:03:54.000> day-to-day

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
pretty much everything in our day-to-day

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.860 
pretty much everything in our day-to-day
lives<00:03:54.769> that<00:03:55.769> is<00:03:56.010> what<00:03:56.190> we<00:03:56.340> say<00:03:56.580> that<00:03:57.269> is<00:03:57.720> what

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
lives that is what we say that is what

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.530 
lives that is what we say that is what
we<00:03:57.989> mean<00:03:58.440> when<00:03:58.769> we<00:03:58.920> say<00:03:59.100> human<00:03:59.910> beings<00:03:59.940> depend

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
we mean when we say human beings depend

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.810 
we mean when we say human beings depend
on<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.810> environment<00:04:01.350> we<00:04:02.040> also<00:04:02.220> use<00:04:02.640> the

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
on the environment we also use the

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.620 
on the environment we also use the
oceans<00:04:03.269> to<00:04:03.900> provide<00:04:04.200> food<00:04:04.440> for<00:04:04.769> us<00:04:04.920> and<00:04:05.420> we<00:04:06.420> use

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
oceans to provide food for us and we use

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.600 
oceans to provide food for us and we use
the<00:04:06.810> land<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:07.200> grow<00:04:07.440> crops<00:04:07.620> these<00:04:08.100> are<00:04:08.370> ways
