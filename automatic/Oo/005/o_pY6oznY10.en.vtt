00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.490 

okay<00:00:02.820> let's<00:00:03.179> try<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.419> prove<00:00:03.659> this<00:00:03.929> fact<00:00:04.170> about

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
okay let's try to prove this fact about

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.590 
okay let's try to prove this fact about
the<00:00:04.710> number<00:00:05.069> of<00:00:05.130> elements<00:00:05.549> in<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.790> power<00:00:06.060> set

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
the number of elements in the power set

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.030 
the number of elements in the power set
there's<00:00:06.990> always<00:00:07.230> think<00:00:07.500> about<00:00:07.770> it<00:00:07.950> that's

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
there's always think about it that's

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.520 
there's always think about it that's
going<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.460> help<00:00:08.639> us<00:00:09.019> imagine<00:00:10.019> that<00:00:10.349> we're

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
going to help us imagine that we're

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.100 
going to help us imagine that we're
thinking<00:00:10.889> again<00:00:11.309> about<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:12.059> case<00:00:12.300> with<00:00:12.990> the

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
thinking again about the case with the

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.720 
thinking again about the case with the
elements<00:00:13.500> 1<00:00:13.799> 2<00:00:14.219> &amp;<00:00:14.519> 3<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:17.990> for<00:00:18.990> each<00:00:19.260> element<00:00:19.800> how

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
elements 1 2 &amp; 3 so for each element how

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.220 
elements 1 2 &amp; 3 so for each element how
how<00:00:21.090> we're<00:00:21.270> going<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.449> write<00:00:21.689> down<00:00:21.750> all

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
how we're going to write down all

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.740 
how we're going to write down all
possible<00:00:22.740> subsets<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.490> imagine<00:00:24.359> that<00:00:24.539> a

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
possible subsets of this imagine that a

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.670 
possible subsets of this imagine that a
huge<00:00:25.019> element<00:00:26.449> you've<00:00:27.449> got<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.779> decide<00:00:28.080> yes

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
huge element you've got to decide yes

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.330 
huge element you've got to decide yes
it's<00:00:29.099> in<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.400> subset<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.300> no<00:00:30.599> reason<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.830> to

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
it's in the subset and no reason so to

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.990 
it's in the subset and no reason so to
specify<00:00:32.989> to<00:00:33.989> specify<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.980> subset<00:00:35.579> what<00:00:35.880> you

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
specify to specify a subset what you

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.420 
specify to specify a subset what you
have<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.329> do<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.750> pick<00:00:37.050> yes<00:00:37.350> or<00:00:37.559> no<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:38.399> each

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
have to do is pick yes or no for each

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.389 
have to do is pick yes or no for each
one<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.059> these<00:00:39.149> elements<00:00:39.450> for<00:00:40.230> example<00:00:40.739> if<00:00:41.129> we

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
one of these elements for example if we

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.420 
one of these elements for example if we
were<00:00:41.489> going<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.790> take<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.120> subset<00:00:42.600> 1<00:00:43.230> 2<00:00:43.739> what

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
were going to take the subset 1 2 what

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.760 
were going to take the subset 1 2 what
we<00:00:44.610> would<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.820> done<00:00:44.879> was<00:00:45.270> we<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.539> said<00:00:45.750> yes<00:00:46.410> to

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
we would have done was we to said yes to

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.020 
we would have done was we to said yes to
1<00:00:47.039> yes<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.760> -<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.480> no<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:48.930> 3<00:00:49.730> so<00:00:50.730> how<00:00:50.969> many

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
1 yes to - and no to 3 so how many

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.470 
1 yes to - and no to 3 so how many
possible<00:00:51.420> ways<00:00:51.780> are<00:00:52.260> there<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:53.270> choosing<00:00:54.270> a

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
possible ways are there of choosing a

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.200 
possible ways are there of choosing a
yes<00:00:54.719> or<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.960> No<00:00:55.350> each<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:56.070> these<00:00:56.280> or<00:00:56.789> what<00:00:56.850> that

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
yes or a No each of these or what that

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.610 
yes or a No each of these or what that
saying<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.809> have<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.020> choice<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.469> two

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
saying is you have a choice of two

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.680 
saying is you have a choice of two
possibilities<00:00:59.219> for<00:01:00.059> each<00:01:00.300> element<00:01:01.250> right<00:01:02.690> yes

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
possibilities for each element right yes

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.160 
possibilities for each element right yes
or<00:01:03.930> no<00:01:04.400> so<00:01:05.400> how<00:01:05.580> many<00:01:05.640> ways<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.420> doing<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.930> all

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
or no so how many ways of doing that all

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.990 
or no so how many ways of doing that all
that<00:01:07.290> well<00:01:07.530> there's<00:01:07.710> two<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.310> each<00:01:08.400> other<00:01:08.729> -

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
that well there's two for each other -

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.700 
that well there's two for each other -
two

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
two

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:13.180 
two
times<00:01:10.070> 2<00:01:10.310> times<00:01:10.910> 2<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:12.260> it's<00:01:12.470> 2<00:01:12.560> to<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.010> power

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
times 2 times 2 so it's 2 to the power

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.690 
times 2 times 2 so it's 2 to the power
of<00:01:13.580> n<00:01:13.990> okay<00:01:14.990> let's<00:01:15.590> try<00:01:15.800> and<00:01:15.950> write<00:01:16.160> that<00:01:16.370> down

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
of n okay let's try and write that down

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:27.969 
of n okay let's try and write that down
formally<00:01:22.120> given

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.180 

we're<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:30.280> elements

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.920 

a<00:01:34.280> subset

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.859 

in<00:01:39.410> determine

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.080 

why

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
why

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:53.179 
why
choice<00:01:47.100> by<00:01:48.100> choosing

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.980 

yes<00:01:55.009> No

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.539 

with<00:02:00.530> each<00:02:00.890> element

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
with each element

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:12.339 
with each element
so<00:02:06.640> number<00:02:07.690> impossible

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:18.160 

the<00:02:12.730> possibilities<00:02:14.469> is<00:02:15.969> ^<00:02:16.969> n<00:02:17.510> because<00:02:17.989> there's

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
the possibilities is ^ n because there's

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.179 
the possibilities is ^ n because there's
one<00:02:18.379> choice<00:02:18.620> each<00:02:19.069> element<00:02:19.760> now<00:02:20.719> that's<00:02:21.709> not<00:02:22.010> a

one choice each element now that's not a

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.069 
one choice each element now that's not a
terribly<00:02:22.760> formal<00:02:23.239> way<00:02:23.359> of<00:02:23.390> writing<00:02:23.719> it<00:02:23.930> down

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:24.079 
terribly formal way of writing it down

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.830 
terribly formal way of writing it down
as<00:02:24.680> I<00:02:24.769> hope<00:02:24.980> that<00:02:25.189> it's<00:02:25.310> clear<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:26.090> once<00:02:26.629> we've

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
as I hope that it's clear and once we've

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.979 
as I hope that it's clear and once we've
done<00:02:27.019> induction<00:02:27.709> we'll<00:02:28.280> have<00:02:28.579> a<00:02:28.849> much<00:02:29.540> more

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
done induction we'll have a much more

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.030 
done induction we'll have a much more
formal<00:02:30.680> way<00:02:30.859> of<00:02:30.890> writing<00:02:31.310> this<00:02:31.579> down<00:02:31.909> in<00:02:32.450> fact

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
formal way of writing this down in fact

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.380 
formal way of writing this down in fact
what<00:02:34.040> I've<00:02:34.189> written<00:02:34.340> that<00:02:34.579> here<00:02:34.939> is<00:02:35.209> related

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
what I've written that here is related

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.649 
what I've written that here is related
to<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.900> idea<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:37.209> characteristic<00:02:38.209> function

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:38.659 
to the idea of a characteristic function

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.990 
to the idea of a characteristic function
so<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.290> characteristic<00:02:40.220> function<00:02:40.430> is<00:02:40.819> where

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
so a characteristic function is where

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.660 
so a characteristic function is where
you<00:02:41.090> take<00:02:41.299> a<00:02:41.329> set<00:02:41.599> of<00:02:41.629> things<00:02:41.959> and<00:02:42.349> you<00:02:42.889> map<00:02:43.639> it

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
you take a set of things and you map it

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.629 
you take a set of things and you map it
to<00:02:44.450> a<00:02:44.480> two<00:02:44.930> element<00:02:45.109> set<00:02:45.650> so<00:02:46.159> you<00:02:46.220> can<00:02:46.430> figure

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:46.639 
to a two element set so you can figure

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:48.220 
to a two element set so you can figure
it<00:02:46.909> this<00:02:47.060> getting<00:02:47.420> maps<00:02:47.689> to<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.019> set

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
it this getting maps to the set

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.159 
it this getting maps to the set
containing<00:02:48.680> yes<00:02:49.930> no<00:02:51.549> but<00:02:52.549> because<00:02:52.930> that's<00:02:53.930> not

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:54.169 
containing yes no but because that's not

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:55.899 
containing yes no but because that's not

set<00:02:56.120> zero<00:02:56.540> one<00:02:57.200> kind<00:02:57.650> of<00:02:57.739> binary<00:02:58.069> things<00:02:58.669> is

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
set zero one kind of binary things is

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.970 
set zero one kind of binary things is
related<00:02:59.329> to<00:02:59.359> how<00:02:59.510> computers<00:02:59.989> work<00:03:00.019> a<00:03:00.319> lot<00:03:00.500> you

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
related to how computers work a lot you

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.339 
related to how computers work a lot you
do<00:03:01.159> everything<00:03:01.430> by<00:03:01.549> zeros<00:03:02.150> and<00:03:02.299> ones<00:03:02.569> so<00:03:03.230> if

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
do everything by zeros and ones so if

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.839 
do everything by zeros and ones so if
you<00:03:03.470> give<00:03:03.620> something<00:03:03.919> of<00:03:04.010> value<00:03:04.040> of<00:03:04.310> one<00:03:04.579> that

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
you give something of value of one that

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.909 
you give something of value of one that
means<00:03:04.909> yes<00:03:05.480> or<00:03:05.750> true<00:03:06.169> and<00:03:06.470> if<00:03:06.709> you<00:03:06.769> give

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:06.919 
means yes or true and if you give

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:08.500 
means yes or true and if you give
something<00:03:07.129> about<00:03:07.430> you<00:03:07.549> zero<00:03:07.849> that<00:03:08.090> means<00:03:08.180> no

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
something about you zero that means no

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.619 
something about you zero that means no
or<00:03:08.930> untrue<00:03:09.500> so<00:03:10.099> what<00:03:10.340> we've<00:03:10.549> done<00:03:10.849> is<00:03:11.150> we've

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:11.629 
or untrue so what we've done is we've

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.149 
or untrue so what we've done is we've
mapped<00:03:11.989> each<00:03:12.489> element<00:03:13.489> of<00:03:13.549> our<00:03:13.700> set<00:03:14.060> to<00:03:15.049> 0<00:03:15.409> or<00:03:15.769> 1

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 
mapped each element of our set to 0 or 1

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.110 
mapped each element of our set to 0 or 1
where<00:03:17.060> 1<00:03:17.389> means<00:03:17.449> yes<00:03:18.260> your<00:03:18.530> subset<00:03:19.099> and<00:03:19.340> 0

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
where 1 means yes your subset and 0

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.659 
where 1 means yes your subset and 0
means<00:03:20.479> no<00:03:20.780> you're<00:03:21.260> not<00:03:21.349> in<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.620> subset<00:03:22.069> and<00:03:22.489> so

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:22.669 
means no you're not in the subset and so

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.899 
means no you're not in the subset and so
at<00:03:22.819> the<00:03:22.909> end<00:03:23.030> each<00:03:23.629> of<00:03:23.930> those<00:03:24.109> maps<00:03:24.799> each<00:03:25.639> of

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:25.909 
at the end each of those maps each of

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:28.570 
at the end each of those maps each of
those<00:03:26.030> mappings<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:27.620> we<00:03:27.709> take

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.580 
those mappings that we take

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.760 
those mappings that we take
absolutely<00:03:29.580> come<00:03:29.760> up<00:03:30.209> everything<00:03:30.810> to<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.530> set

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
absolutely come up everything to the set

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.690 
absolutely come up everything to the set
zero<00:03:32.160> one<00:03:32.840> each<00:03:33.840> of<00:03:34.140> those<00:03:34.700> implicitly

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
zero one each of those implicitly

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.510 
zero one each of those implicitly
determines<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.630> subset<00:03:37.110> of<00:03:37.140> s<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.980> that's

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
determines a subset of s and that's

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.030 
determines a subset of s and that's
called<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.850> characteristic<00:03:39.600> function<00:03:40.040> we're

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
called a characteristic function we're

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.770 
called a characteristic function we're
going<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.310> look<00:03:41.459> at<00:03:41.610> functions<00:03:42.030> quite<00:03:42.390> soon

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
going to look at functions quite soon

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.720 
going to look at functions quite soon
and<00:03:43.140> then<00:03:43.530> we'll<00:03:43.680> see<00:03:43.950> that<00:03:44.130> there's<00:03:44.310> a<00:03:44.370> way<00:03:44.550> of

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
and then we'll see that there's a way of

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.390 
and then we'll see that there's a way of
counting<00:03:45.420> all<00:03:45.750> possible<00:03:46.350> functions<00:03:46.920> from<00:03:47.160> one

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
counting all possible functions from one

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.240 
counting all possible functions from one
place<00:03:47.640> to<00:03:47.670> another<00:03:48.709> basically<00:03:49.709> using<00:03:50.130> the

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
place to another basically using the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.430 
place to another basically using the
same<00:03:50.459> arguments<00:03:51.150> as<00:03:51.270> this<00:03:51.510> so<00:03:52.110> that's<00:03:52.290> what

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
same arguments as this so that's what

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.290 
same arguments as this so that's what
people<00:03:52.680> get<00:03:52.950> another<00:03:53.340> way<00:03:53.550> of<00:03:53.850> thinking<00:03:54.150> about

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
people get another way of thinking about

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.820 
people get another way of thinking about
the<00:03:54.420> number<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.780> elements<00:03:55.290> in<00:03:55.560> a<00:03:56.069> power<00:03:56.370> set

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
the number of elements in a power set

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.490 
the number of elements in a power set
well<00:03:59.420> that's<00:04:00.420> all<00:04:00.600> there<00:04:00.780> is<00:04:00.810> to<00:04:01.019> that<00:04:01.140> proof

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
well that's all there is to that proof

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.860 
well that's all there is to that proof
really
