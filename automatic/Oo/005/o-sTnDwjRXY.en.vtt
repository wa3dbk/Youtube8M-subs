00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 let's see the trials of a 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.390
 group that last Sunday grew 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.830
 very much and save from the sentence they 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.830
 are when now in front 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.830
 now this week will be talking to you 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.880
 alone 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.880
 barriers guys please 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.000
 i love you 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:36.000
 all right 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:43.020
 Your face 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.520
 the choir of angels fine girls well me 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.239
 I'm around here and now to 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.270
 accompany 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.890
 ruth karina because only useless and they give to 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.590
 our favorites will interpret us 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.470
 a beautiful song today last week 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.870
 they were saved from a sentence this week 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.489
 I imagine we achieved this much punch 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.629
 e for her it will not fall into another 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.879
 so is 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.680
 demanding triple the girls more than 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.140
 all in attitude because the voices the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.940
 they have harmonies there a little bit 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.820
 send a story to the room but 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.920
 well I usually say good I hope 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.680
 that tonight they put everything of themselves 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.420
 to be saved and I will not be in sentence 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.009
 also good last week what 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.380
 They did very well and surprised us 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.149
 everyone so today we're dying to see each other 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.770
 so quickly we will remember to 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.770
 the originals and we go with it 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.130

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.539

 Karim is doing a great job with 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.189
 that group with pandora that should 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.710
 sing a song that I must confess my 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:45.049
 first melodic in love or if it's a 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:49.390
 theme of memories they sing when you're not 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.390
 with me our pandora 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.590

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.770

 of the week that I do not know if it was 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.229
 some harangue these girls to be 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.940
 to the stage as they are coming out in the 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:30.060
 What happens that I speak strongly with them 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:32.009

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.169

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:36.169

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.520
 very nice seeds cute voices but what 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:49.919

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.259
 participants also 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.849
 it seems to me that today they have had a lot 

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:10.680
 better attitude on stage have 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:12.240
 much improved that shows that it 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.280

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.650
 tell what we had told you in the 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.750
 previous galas have been very 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:20.189
 intoned very similar to pandora yo 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.689
 I think of all the presentations that 

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:24.539
 have had this has been the most similar 

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:26.909
 to the originals I think this kind of 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:29.370
 issues this type of issues that is well as 

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:31.110
 slower the more he threw the ballad they are left 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:34.560
