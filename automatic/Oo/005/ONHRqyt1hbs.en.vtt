for some little piglets engineer seven
seven<00:00:44.170> five<00:00:44.850> this<00:00:45.850> is<00:00:46.469> probably<00:00:47.469> the<00:00:47.620> most

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
seven five this is probably the most

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.889 
seven five this is probably the most
complicated<00:00:48.190> system<00:00:48.640> I've<00:00:48.940> done<00:00:49.149> so<00:00:49.539> far<00:00:49.749> it

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
complicated system I've done so far it

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:51.270 
complicated system I've done so far it
doesn't<00:00:50.079> look<00:00:50.350> that<00:00:50.379> complicated<00:00:51.129> it's

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:51.280 
doesn't look that complicated it's

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.619 
doesn't look that complicated it's
pretty<00:00:51.760> small<00:00:52.030> but<00:00:53.019> on<00:00:53.170> this<00:00:53.350> site<00:00:53.559> it's

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
pretty small but on this site it's

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.939 
pretty small but on this site it's
helping<00:00:55.629> out<00:00:55.839> with<00:00:56.019> some<00:00:56.199> livestock<00:00:56.679> or

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
plumbing and it is we took because it

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.580 
plumbing and it is we took because it
was<00:01:45.939> an<00:01:46.060> existing<00:01:46.539> system<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.140> we've<00:01:47.320> added

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
was an existing system and we've added

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.080 
was an existing system and we've added
to<00:01:48.009> it

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
to it

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.580 
to it
we're<00:01:49.899> using<00:01:50.140> like<00:01:50.649> I<00:01:50.799> said<00:01:51.039> a<00:01:51.249> bank<00:01:51.999> off<00:01:52.590> flow

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
we're using like I said a bank off flow

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.080 
they are obviously and then one over at
the<00:02:18.780> other<00:02:18.930> well<00:02:19.230> so<00:02:19.440> I<00:02:20.160> went<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.550> connected

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
the other well so I went and connected

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.640 
the other well so I went and connected
them<00:02:21.210> so<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.260> kind<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:22.920> crazy<00:02:23.480> but<00:02:24.560> it<00:02:25.560> was

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
them so this is kind of crazy but it was

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:33.380 
them so this is kind of crazy but it was
fun<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:26.670> we've<00:02:27.600> got<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:31.730> solar<00:02:32.730> submersible

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
fun so we've got a solar submersible

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.760 
fun so we've got a solar submersible
pump<00:02:33.630> here<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:36.050> if<00:02:37.050> you<00:02:37.140> can<00:02:37.260> see<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.590> this

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
pump here and if you can see that this

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.170 
pump here and if you can see that this
is<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.070> solar<00:02:38.280> submersible<00:02:38.790> running<00:02:39.030> about

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
is the solar submersible running about

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.710 
is the solar submersible running about
five<00:02:39.420> gallons<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.870> minute<00:02:39.990> and<00:02:40.200> this<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.720> on

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
five gallons a minute and this is the on

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.380 
five gallons a minute and this is the on
grid<00:02:43.140> system<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.250> put<00:02:44.640> both<00:02:44.820> pumps<00:02:45.240> in<00:02:45.360> the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
grid system so I put both pumps in the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.160 
grid system so I put both pumps in the
same<00:02:45.690> well<00:02:45.960> and<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.400> we<00:02:47.550> have<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.760> complete<00:02:48.420> off

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
same well and so we have a complete off

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.630 
same well and so we have a complete off
growed<00:02:49.590> off<00:02:50.450> grid<00:02:51.450> not<00:02:51.690> off-road<00:02:52.340> system<00:02:53.340> here

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
growed off grid not off-road system here

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
growed off grid not off-road system here
and<00:02:54.560> next<00:02:55.560> I'll<00:02:55.740> show<00:02:55.770> you<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.160> tank<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:57.540> what

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
and next I'll show you the tank so what

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.060

thousand gallon tank roughly and I'm

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.660 
thousand gallon tank roughly and I'm
gonna<00:03:30.350> take<00:03:31.350> a<00:03:31.380> peek<00:03:31.620> in<00:03:31.770> here<00:03:31.920> asshole

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.200 

very<00:03:35.670> good

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
very good

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.810 
very good
we<00:03:37.020> do<00:03:37.170> have<00:03:37.290> some<00:03:37.530> plastic<00:03:38.070> floating<00:03:38.400> from

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
we do have some plastic floating from

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.850 
we do have some plastic floating from
just<00:03:39.330> hole<00:03:39.900> saws<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.470> things

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
just hole saws and things

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.250 
just hole saws and things
but<00:03:41.280> we're<00:03:41.430> almost<00:03:41.640> full<00:03:42.090> and<00:03:42.330> we've<00:03:43.080> got<00:03:43.230> a

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
but we're almost full and we've got a

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.520 
but we're almost full and we've got a
set<00:03:43.560> Tronics<00:03:44.040> float<00:03:44.370> switch<00:03:44.610> here<00:03:45.290> and<00:03:46.290> then

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
set Tronics float switch here and then

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.010 
set Tronics float switch here and then
it's<00:03:46.680> just<00:03:46.800> about<00:03:47.010> ready<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.340> shut<00:03:47.610> it<00:03:47.700> off

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.020 
it's just about ready to shut it off

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.610 
it's just about ready to shut it off
notice<00:03:49.020> this<00:03:49.170> it's<00:03:50.100> kind<00:03:50.430> of<00:03:50.460> a<00:03:50.580> it<00:03:50.880> is<00:03:50.970> a<00:03:51.590> not<00:03:52.590> a

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
notice this it's kind of a it is a not a

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.640 
notice this it's kind of a it is a not a
lightweight<00:03:52.890> but<00:03:53.670> it's<00:03:53.820> a<00:03:54.030> weight<00:03:54.360> it's<00:03:55.140> a<00:03:55.290> to

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
lightweight but it's a weight it's a to

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.790 
lightweight but it's a weight it's a to
tether<00:03:55.920> this<00:03:56.510> so<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:57.690> when<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:58.410> holds<00:03:58.740> it

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
tether this so that when it holds it

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:01.130 
tether this so that when it holds it
down<00:03:58.830> so<00:03:59.280> on<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.460> water<00:03:59.670> floats<00:04:00.000> up<00:04:00.240> here<00:04:00.540> and

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
down so on the water floats up here and

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.200 
down so on the water floats up here and
then<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.290> float<00:04:01.590> switch<00:04:01.620> comes<00:04:02.250> up<00:04:02.430> it<00:04:02.940> shuts

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
then the float switch comes up it shuts

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.700 
then the float switch comes up it shuts
the<00:04:03.300> pump<00:04:03.540> off<00:04:03.690> so<00:04:04.970> it<00:04:05.970> gets<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.300> about<00:04:06.710> right

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:07.710 
the pump off so it gets to about right

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.630 
the pump off so it gets to about right
there<00:04:07.770> I<00:04:08.280> just<00:04:08.460> shut<00:04:08.790> the<00:04:08.820> pump<00:04:09.030> off<00:04:10.490> and<00:04:11.490> then

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
there I just shut the pump off and then

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.490 
there I just shut the pump off and then
I'll<00:04:11.730> go<00:04:11.910> down

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.080 

Punk<00:04:17.500> should<00:04:17.709> be<00:04:17.830> on<00:04:18.010> there<00:04:18.400> it's<00:04:18.610> just<00:04:18.880> about

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
Punk should be on there it's just about

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.140 
Punk should be on there it's just about
ready<00:04:19.270> to<00:04:19.390> shut<00:04:19.600> off<00:04:20.370> keep<00:04:21.370> it<00:04:21.520> right<00:04:21.670> there

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
ready to shut off keep it right there

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.740 
ready to shut off keep it right there
all<00:04:22.630> right<00:04:22.840> that's<00:04:23.110> that's<00:04:23.590> it<00:04:23.800> on<00:04:23.920> the<00:04:24.010> tank

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
all right that's that's it on the tank

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.600 
all right that's that's it on the tank
okay<00:04:25.750> system<00:04:26.230> is<00:04:26.380> good<00:04:26.650> I'm<00:04:26.860> here<00:04:27.190> and<00:04:27.490> the

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
okay system is good I'm here and the

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.950 
okay system is good I'm here and the
pumps<00:04:27.940> on<00:04:28.090> and<00:04:28.120> then<00:04:28.510> the<00:04:28.660> MPPT<00:04:29.760> will<00:04:30.960> the

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
pumps on and then the MPPT will the

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.870 
pumps on and then the MPPT will the
maximum<00:04:32.380> power<00:04:32.830> point<00:04:32.980> tracking<00:04:33.280> light

flashes on and off and then in the
morning<00:04:37.030> get<00:04:37.210> low<00:04:37.360> power<00:04:37.630> at<00:04:37.870> night<00:04:38.080> when<00:04:38.620> you

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
morning get low power at night when you

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.710 
morning get low power at night when you
don't<00:04:38.860> enough<00:04:39.010> Sun<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.970> tank<00:04:40.240> full<00:04:40.450> light

the low water level light will come on

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.950 
the low water level light will come on
and<00:04:50.230> shut<00:04:50.590> the<00:04:50.710> pump<00:04:50.890> off<00:04:51.100> so<00:04:51.940> great<00:04:52.630> little

I<00:04:55.450> notice<00:04:55.690> the<00:04:55.780> circuitry<00:04:56.320> but<00:04:56.950> you<00:04:57.130> can<00:04:57.280> buy

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
I notice the circuitry but you can buy

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.580 
I notice the circuitry but you can buy
just<00:04:57.490> this<00:04:58.090> board<00:04:58.450> as<00:04:58.840> opposed<00:04:59.170> to<00:04:59.290> pulling

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
just this board as opposed to pulling

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.050 
just this board as opposed to pulling
your<00:04:59.830> pump<00:05:00.070> and<00:05:00.310> sending<00:05:00.640> it<00:05:00.730> back<00:05:00.850> to<00:05:00.910> the

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
manufacturer you can go ahead and just

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.510 
manufacturer you can go ahead and just
replace<00:05:04.750> this<00:05:04.930> board<00:05:05.290> if<00:05:06.040> you<00:05:06.220> ever<00:05:06.340> have
