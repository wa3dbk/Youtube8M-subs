00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:12.219
 Guys, it's good that you're welcome to the 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:15.490
 ufam telekom video channel today with 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:17.949
 maicon 17,600 that a customer acquires with 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.470
 people and he asked to do the 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.660
 unlock him it 's free radio 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.090
 to transmit all frequencies 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.400
 so you will follow here how it is 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.370
 done this procedure in this beautiful 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.590
 I'll show you equipment later I'll show you 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.530
 some functions it some lines 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.060
 features that this plane has touch 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:45.239
 so come on guys opened the 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:45.239
 modification with these 7 600 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.360
 necessary to remove the two 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.649
 radio so you can unlock 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.570
 from lytha 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:58.660
 it is not necessary to remove this shield 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.520
 up but I made it to show you 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.110
 for those who do not know that they have not yet 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:07.149
 opportunity to see maicon and 7,600 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.119
 opened up just so that the 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:12.659
 person to get an idea of â€‹â€‹what radio is like 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:17.020
 inside it has a very 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.859
 similar to the 756 of the entire line 756 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.670
 OK 

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:24.969
 the crazy filter to the buyer of 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.749
 antenna architecture including these 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:30.789
 modules 

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:33.880
 She is very similar to those who have seen the 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:37.060
 videos on the maintenance channel on 7 5 6 7 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.099
 5 and the own 12 to 3 will notice a 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.929
 very similar here in the part of the 

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:45.639
 ppa null profile have the same thing 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.639
 it is possible to notice a very similarity 

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:51.249
 large even on the coupling itself 

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:56.770
 automatic antennas are here the same 

00:01:51.249 --> 00:02:00.909
 type of peace motor used 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:04.389
 art drawing architecture art 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:09.270
 antenna connection 1 and 2 are actually 

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:13.060
 very similar to line 756 but 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.760
 only the physical resemblance to the 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.630
 because there are several improvements and 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.840
 modifications 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.150
 with older siblings for now 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.640
 people to be able to continue 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.100
 unlocking is required to remove the 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.580
 front panel, we just need to 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:35.720
 very careful to always work with the 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.460
 bench with grounded static blanket use 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.760
 for being anti static we will go 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.650
 working on the processor side with 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.950
 extremely delicate components 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.710
 so now remove the front panel 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.000
 are two screws on this side and more 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:56.330
 two screws on this other side here 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:01.520
 front panel removed special care 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:03.980
 with the 27 that I touch and with the others 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.940
 and link the Commission with the 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.040
 front 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.060
 now we need to remove this 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.550
 shielding 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:18.770
 You see here is opening the window. 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:22.670
 have to come out with two 2345 screws 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.900
 total screw 3 on that side and two 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.110
 sake 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:32.290
 that the armor moves have access to the 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:35.360
 others that keep the radio locked or 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:40.780
 alternate it region by country 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:50.620
 without the shield already have access 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:50.620
 the part of the diodes are those here 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:04:01.680
 are on the side of the processor is a cei bg 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:06.300
 the technology on his side 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.450
 We have very careful memories in the 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.040
 handling in this area 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.720
 precisely because of electricity 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:18.870
 static 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:22.350
 I will remove those from others to the 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:27.450
 Unlock the child here for you. 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:34.440
 I can see that the area is showing 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:38.960
 which of them will be removed service 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:43.410
 executed to unlock the 7,600 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.720
 American version in the second row 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:50.480
 right row 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:53.220
 we have today 58 and 57 is dou 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:56.400
 in the first position of the second row 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:05:00.750
 we do not have any form of gold you 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:04.320
 can see just below have the 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.750
 occupied position which is 58 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.690
 just lift one of his terminals 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:14.340
 how it was like I did here and below it 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:17.100
 we have 57 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.090
 just lift its terminal and 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.400
 ready 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.150
 that's what you need to do to 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:28.770
 unlock the transmission of the 7,600 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.669
 American version ok so now with everything 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.450
 the care 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:35.790
 we start reassembling the armor 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:38.160
 here put everything in place 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.960
 very careful attention to the part 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:44.040
 of the seven defendants 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:47.640
 they are extremely delicate and hence it is 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:51.080
 only put the panel in place to connect 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.080
 everything is ready 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:56.589
 the radio already closed let's do a test 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:56.589
 of transmission 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:19.449
 radin rtp and transmitting ok 14 100 c'mon 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:25.470
 download out of the band transmitting 7h 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:25.470
 straight leave it right here 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:44.240
 ok it 's also broadcasting 6 900 also 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:44.240
 transmitting we will be in 28 round 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:58.170
 who is and ty conveying ok 27 more 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:01.530
 also broadcasting radio is 

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:04.800
 That's it , that's unlocked. 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:07.410
 this way of doing the modification 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.010
 for transmission on all tracks in the 

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:13.230
 there are 7600 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.250
 it's worth remembering do not do this 

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.190
 at home if you have not 

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.870
 knowledge and tools 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:21.120
 for what you can finish 

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:23.370
 damaging the equipment since it is 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:27.330
 moving in extremely sensitive areas 

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:29.670
 static electricity and also the use of 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.560
 equipment under these conditions. 

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:35.690
 Is the staff good? 

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:35.690
 A big hug, see you later
