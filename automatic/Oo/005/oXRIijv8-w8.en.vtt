00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:15.289

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.300
 welcome the following and commented 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.029
 halo 4 here is a kid and now 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.009
 you know but I'll let you introduce yourself 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.570
 teams on youtube I am snoopy food and 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.270
 good because then here we are in another 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.570
 gameplay commented here with display in 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.160
 360 and so and so good this gameplay is 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.230
 something lucid because because the subject is very 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.649
 simple how to take the comments here 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.480
 in Youtube 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.539
 this you already have experience in these 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.879
 companies that better you start the same 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:43.610
 good comments is that to me to my meter 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.760
 they have more and so 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.190
 Well, it's practically like 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.920
 various types of comments some 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.880
 obviously, but good bad but 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.950
 others practically simply 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.649
 practically simply good 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:05.269
 we can take it as it can be so 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:08.540
 it's like constructive criticism by 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.610
 so to say for example I do not know the 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.650
 typical comments good I do not know if 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.440
 finally another video this one 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.110
 I do not know I like things very much 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.820
 comments that are disgusting you should 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.130
 to get out of youtube and all those things 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.010
 but there are also others that was 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.659
 obviously they are not even 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.749
 subscribers and then 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.869
 I do not know or some of them are subscribers and 

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:37.109
 they say that this is because it should be 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.899
 improve your quality or vary the content 

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:42.689
 and all those things and how it started 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:46.619
 this simple helps a lot to a 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.500
 youtuber since then from there you can 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.140
 grab like that for then for new 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.829
 ideas new things new series in your 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:59.939
 channel and thus in itself this is like that 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:02.219
 one support for it youtubers 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.780
 practically new because some like 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.489
 who can not distinguish between 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.209
 positive comments and comments 

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:11.280
 Trolls and because I can not read that they 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.200
 You can say, basically, it's not 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.480
 know how to distinguish between those that are 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.549
 progressive others that are then 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.019
 comments reflections about what 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.150
 they are doing because because they 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:25.019
 you realize easily right 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.819
 in the surrender of lÃ³pez I saw it ends 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.120
 of transmission and casually I can 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.099
 a comment to this I do not know what 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.310
 always puts medellÃ­n videos 9s 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:38.220
 melli or a little boy not to - the channel 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.530
 102 subscribers of visits leaving the 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.480
 Yesterday this 0 in the end or a 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.459
 bit, obviously there is the button 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.400
 very very wise government here in the 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.349
 youtube community is the button and 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.239
 block people because you have to 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:56.129
 block those who nothing else are 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.180
 Fucking I do not say at the end you also 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.180
 they are giving the reproduction 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.190
 Well, it's usually the protected 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.650
 are those who first in the video or you 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.990
 you upload a dislike video that already after 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.210
 it is one against one hundred likes indus like 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:14.470
 it's something they think about that but 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.330
 Well, if you have to know how to identify is 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.670
 say if you upload a video and it shows 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.740
 they tell you today this one is not for your camera 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.870
 it looks very dark to process our voucher 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.240
 that's what is giving a comment that 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.580
 it's positive not that it's going to help you or that 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.590
 tell me then I would recommend you take it away 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.750
 I know the middle edges you are very 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.140
 different here the guy comes and tells you 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:38.770
 it's a rubbish this retreat or this 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.150
 kind of people are garbage and then 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.160
 they will always be there always going to be 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.620
 The more you grow up on YouTube, the more you go 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.750
 to arrive because they 're going to start you 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.910
 to throw as always everyone to all 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.890
 all the youtubers that is there are many 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.050
 youtubers for example the big ones of 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.600
 Spain how many videos do not have what 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.050

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:03.110
 race or are 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:05.030
 center is to say that the option that 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.870
 We know how to identify what is role 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.270
 which one 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.030
 what is a maximum troll and then of 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.980
 block it or I do not like me 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.780
 the personal what many exist 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:17.570
 pockets nothing else erased the comment and 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.030
 well, but when they are light and their 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.930
 extreme and the blocks that I do not know what 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.930
 more you can add this 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.830
 we obviously good if you can 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:31.009
 block but it's already like a case 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:35.419
 extreme obviously when you've been 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:37.849

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.219

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:42.919

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:48.340

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:09.110
 Well, obviously I do not like that 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:11.210

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.830

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.700
 People start defending you or the 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:17.490
 same people give you 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.770
