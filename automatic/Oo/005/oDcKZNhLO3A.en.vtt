00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
drink a lot of water because the water

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.060

keep it strong and healthy the next tip

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.700 
keep it strong and healthy the next tip

would be to try and shampoo your hair
less<00:00:56.370> often<00:00:56.699> because<00:00:57.770> washing<00:00:58.770> your<00:00:58.890> hair

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
less often because washing your hair

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.729 
less often because washing your hair
every<00:00:59.460> day<00:00:59.489> can<00:01:00.210> strip<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.109> natural

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
every day can strip it of the natural

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.700 
every day can strip it of the natural
oils<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.219> help<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.910> protect<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.809> they

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
oils that help to protect it and they

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.730 
oils that help to protect it and they
keep<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.100> looking<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.820> feeling<00:01:06.150> healthy<00:01:06.930> so

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
keep it looking and feeling healthy so

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.280 
keep it looking and feeling healthy so
it'd<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.070> good<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.490> try<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.390> wash<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.600> every

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
it'd be good to try and wash it every

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.760 
it'd be good to try and wash it every
other<00:01:10.320> day<00:01:10.619> or<00:01:11.689> you<00:01:12.689> should<00:01:12.930> find<00:01:13.260> out<00:01:13.500> a

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
or every third day whatever it is for

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.210 
or every third day whatever it is for
you<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.439> help<00:01:23.040> maintain<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:24.330> natural<00:01:25.220> moisture

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
you to help maintain a natural moisture

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.789 
you to help maintain a natural moisture
balance<00:01:26.490> then<00:01:27.060> next<00:01:27.720> this<00:01:28.200> one<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.530> really

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
balance then next this one is really

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.410 
balance then next this one is really
important<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.850> should<00:01:30.090> try<00:01:30.299> and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
important is that you should try and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.950 
important is that you should try and
limit<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.549> amount<00:01:32.549> of<00:01:32.909> heat<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.509> use<00:01:33.720> on<00:01:33.930> your

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
hair so like curlers straighteners blow

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.929

dryers<00:01:37.500> all<00:01:37.860> those<00:01:38.070> type<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.369> things<00:01:38.520> there

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
dryers all those type of things there

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.969 
dryers all those type of things there
aren't<00:01:39.299> really<00:01:39.600> good<00:01:39.810> for<00:01:40.049> your<00:01:40.350> hair<00:01:40.590> because

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979

they just leave it damaged and split

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.630 
they just leave it damaged and split
ends<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:45.390> it's<00:01:45.720> good<00:01:46.020> if<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.229> try<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:47.130> not<00:01:47.340> use

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
because it just leaves your hair

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.330

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
stronger and a lot of times it makes it

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.640 
stronger and a lot of times it makes it
a<00:03:01.400> lot<00:03:01.519> softer<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.390> nicer<00:03:02.450> too<00:03:03.110> so<00:03:03.410> that's

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
a lot softer and nicer too so that's

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.100 
a lot softer and nicer too so that's
another<00:03:04.400> benefit<00:03:05.030> from<00:03:05.269> using<00:03:05.480> those<00:03:05.750> type<00:03:06.080> of

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
another benefit from using those type of

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.220 
another benefit from using those type of
things<00:03:06.290> step<00:03:06.950> would<00:03:07.160> be<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.630> regularly<00:03:08.630> trim

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
things step would be to regularly trim

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.660 
things step would be to regularly trim
your<00:03:09.440> hair<00:03:09.680> because<00:03:10.310> you<00:03:11.239> do<00:03:11.890> eventually<00:03:12.890> get

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
your hair because you do eventually get

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.580 
your hair because you do eventually get
split<00:03:14.090> ends<00:03:14.450> at<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.810> bottom<00:03:15.110> of<00:03:15.200> your<00:03:15.260> hair

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
split ends at the bottom of your hair

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.259 
split ends at the bottom of your hair
and<00:03:15.860> so<00:03:16.370> you<00:03:16.430> want<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:16.850> make<00:03:16.880> sure<00:03:17.000> you

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
and so you want to make sure you

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:18.910 
and so you want to make sure you
regularly<00:03:17.690> trim<00:03:18.049> it<00:03:18.200> so<00:03:18.230> if<00:03:18.470> they<00:03:18.590> don't<00:03:18.769> just

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
regularly trim it so if they don't just

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.970 
regularly trim it so if they don't just
keep<00:03:19.250> breaking<00:03:19.880> higher<00:03:20.209> and<00:03:20.570> higher<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:21.170> so

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
keep breaking higher and higher and so

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.509 
keep breaking higher and higher and so
if<00:03:22.610> you<00:03:22.910> go<00:03:23.360> to<00:03:23.420> the<00:03:23.840> hair<00:03:24.079> dressers<00:03:24.980> I<00:03:25.250> just
