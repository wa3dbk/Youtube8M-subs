 competitive as is the segment of the medium 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.650

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.429
 modern

 with very low consumption with very low emissions 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.990
 the engine doublet me with a doublet 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.340

 we only had the automatic version for the top of the range 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.710
