thing we're gonna do is we're gonna grab

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.770 
thing we're gonna do is we're gonna grab
yourself<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.740> nice<00:00:10.920> object<00:00:11.190> here<00:00:11.639> we'll<00:00:12.630> go

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
yourself a nice object here we'll go

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.029 
yourself a nice object here we'll go
with<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.019> cube<00:00:13.259> as<00:00:13.910> you<00:00:14.910> can<00:00:15.059> see<00:00:15.269> here<00:00:15.750> it<00:00:15.839> is

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:16.039 
with the cube as you can see here it is

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:18.710 
with the cube as you can see here it is
now<00:00:17.039> in<00:00:17.340> order<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.609> animate<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.330> we<00:00:18.449> have<00:00:18.570> to

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
now in order to animate it we have to

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.890 
now in order to animate it we have to
keyframe<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.520> so<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.670> first<00:00:20.939> step<00:00:21.210> is<00:00:21.449> to

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
keyframe this so the first step is to

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.929 
keyframe this so the first step is to
take<00:00:22.080> your<00:00:22.140> little<00:00:22.590> go<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.250> this<00:00:23.400> timeline

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
take your little go to this timeline

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.910 
take your little go to this timeline
here<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.480> you're<00:00:25.019> gonna<00:00:25.140> grab<00:00:25.380> you're<00:00:25.830> gonna

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
here and you're gonna grab you're gonna

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
want to grab this tiny green block and

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.380 
want to grab this tiny green block and
bring<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.500> down<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.830> zero<00:00:29.119> then<00:00:30.119> you're<00:00:30.240> gonna

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
bring it down to zero then you're gonna

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.749 
bring it down to zero then you're gonna
hit<00:00:30.660> this<00:00:30.810> keyframe<00:00:31.439> button<00:00:31.859> right<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.669> the

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
hit this keyframe button right in the

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.459 
hit this keyframe button right in the
middle<00:00:32.940> here<00:00:33.770> now<00:00:35.300> drag<00:00:36.300> this<00:00:36.510> green<00:00:36.840> box<00:00:37.110> to

middle here now drag this green box to

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.200 
middle here now drag this green box to
around<00:00:38.100> 15<00:00:39.030> seconds<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:40.670> time<00:00:41.670> right<00:00:42.000> here

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
around 15 seconds this time right here

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.630 
around 15 seconds this time right here
15<00:00:42.719> seconds<00:00:43.290> indicates<00:00:43.800> when<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.100> object

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
15 seconds indicates when the object

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.389 
15 seconds indicates when the object
will<00:00:44.789> finish<00:00:45.030> its<00:00:45.300> animation<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.200> 0<00:00:46.860> will

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
will finish its animation and 0 will

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.910 
will finish its animation and 0 will
indicate<00:00:47.730> when<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> object<00:00:48.480> will<00:00:48.600> begin<00:00:48.920> now

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
indicate when the object will begin now

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.770 
indicate when the object will begin now
we're<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.250> take<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.640> object<00:00:50.820> we're

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
we're going to take the object we're

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.420 
we're going to take the object we're
gonna<00:00:51.899> grab<00:00:52.199> this<00:00:52.379> blue<00:00:52.680> arrow<00:00:52.920> here<00:00:53.309> and

gonna grab this blue arrow here and

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.560 
gonna grab this blue arrow here and
we'll<00:00:54.030> animate<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:55.309> well<00:00:56.309> move<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.120> over<00:00:57.390> here

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
we'll animate it well move it over here

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.900 
we'll animate it well move it over here
now<00:00:57.750> as<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.500> can<00:00:58.620> see<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:59.010> shows<00:00:59.250> this<00:00:59.489> trail

this blue trail and this is where the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.000 
this blue trail and this is where the
object<00:01:02.910> will<00:01:03.390> move<00:01:03.769> from<00:01:04.769> 0<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.700> 15<00:01:06.500> so<00:01:07.500> really

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
object will move from 0 to 15 so really

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.210 
object will move from 0 to 15 so really
simple<00:01:08.369> guys<00:01:08.520> I'll<00:01:08.850> do<00:01:09.060> one<00:01:09.299> more<00:01:09.330> animation

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
simple guys I'll do one more animation

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.340 
simple guys I'll do one more animation
now<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.250> make<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.700> object<00:01:12.210> move<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.170> right

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
now I make the object move to the right

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.149 
now I make the object move to the right
over<00:01:13.770> here

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159

here up to here and now right across so
once<00:01:24.509> again<00:01:25.189> on<00:01:26.189> keyframe<00:01:26.720> keyframe<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.930> it's

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
once again on keyframe keyframe it it's

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.640 
once again on keyframe keyframe it it's
at<00:01:28.979> 15<00:01:29.430> now<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:29.820> starting<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.530> we're<00:01:31.530> gonna

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
this red arrow and bring it here and now

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.789 
this red arrow and bring it here and now
as<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:39.000> see<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.479> created<00:01:39.810> another<00:01:40.049> trail

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
as you can see it created another trail

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.389 
as you can see it created another trail
more<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.000> 90<00:01:42.420> degree<00:01:42.750> angle<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.369> you<00:01:44.369> can

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
more like a 90 degree angle and you can

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.639 
more like a 90 degree angle and you can
see<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.970> object<00:01:45.090> will<00:01:45.600> go<00:01:45.630> first

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
see that the object will go first

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.810 
see that the object will go first
0<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.729> 15<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.840> then<00:01:49.100> across<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.250> third

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
0 to 15 and then across the third

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.789 
0 to 15 and then across the third
alright<00:01:51.750> guys<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.229> that's<00:01:52.409> how<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.590> do<00:01:52.770> a

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
alright guys so that's how you do a

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.069 
alright guys so that's how you do a
quick<00:01:53.220> little<00:01:53.399> animation<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.360> cinema<00:01:54.869> 4d

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
quick little animation in cinema 4d

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.440 
quick little animation in cinema 4d
using<00:01:55.740> keyframes<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.759> was<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.299> little

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
using keyframes this was just a little

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.600 
using keyframes this was just a little
introduction<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.320> key<00:01:58.530> framing<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.070> cinema<00:01:59.430> 4d

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
introduction to key framing in cinema 4d

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.020 
introduction to key framing in cinema 4d
you<00:02:00.450> can<00:02:00.600> do<00:02:00.689> all<00:02:00.930> sorts<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.409> stuff<00:02:01.469> like
