00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
if you don't have a plan essentially

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.430 
if you don't have a plan essentially
there's<00:00:14.820> really<00:00:15.059> not<00:00:15.360> too<00:00:15.690> many<00:00:16.170> different

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
there's really not too many different

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.519 
there's really not too many different
ways<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.770> do<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.570> like<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.660> said<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:19.020> guy<00:00:19.199> comes

ways to do it like I said this guy comes
at<00:00:19.680> you<00:00:19.890> fairly<00:00:20.189> early<00:00:20.400> on<00:00:20.520> in<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.880> game

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
at you fairly early on in the game

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.259 
at you fairly early on in the game
because<00:00:22.769> why<00:00:23.039> I<00:00:23.070> talked<00:00:23.519> about<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:23.939> review

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
because why I talked about in the review

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.269 
because why I talked about in the review
and<00:00:24.510> in<00:00:24.600> some<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.930> comments<00:00:25.109> there<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
and in some of the comments there the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.169 
and in some of the comments there the
combat<00:00:26.640> here<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.029> pretty<00:00:27.619> pretty<00:00:28.619> bland<00:00:29.179> it's

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
combat here is pretty pretty bland it's

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.550 
combat here is pretty pretty bland it's
pretty<00:00:30.359> black<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.599> white<00:00:30.929> either<00:00:31.260> something

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
pretty black and white either something

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.850 
pretty black and white either something
works<00:00:31.830> or<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.160> doesn't<00:00:32.600> so<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:34.380> just<00:00:34.530> try<00:00:34.770> out

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
works or it doesn't so you just try out

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.380 
works or it doesn't so you just try out
all<00:00:34.980> your<00:00:35.130> different<00:00:35.309> moves<00:00:35.610> you've<00:00:35.940> got<00:00:36.120> five

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
all your different moves you've got five

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.340 
all your different moves you've got five
spells<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.820> two<00:00:38.820> attacks<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.660> that's<00:00:40.050> pretty

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
spells and two attacks and that's pretty

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.770 
spells and two attacks and that's pretty
much<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:41.370> some<00:00:41.969> combination<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.629> will

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
much it so some combination that will

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.529 
much it so some combination that will
work<00:00:44.780> so<00:00:47.000> essentially<00:00:48.000> what<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.210> want<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.450> do

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
work so essentially what you want to do

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.369 
work so essentially what you want to do
here<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.020> want<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.800> keep<00:00:49.950> in<00:00:50.129> close<00:00:50.430> to

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
here is want to keep in close to

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:53.630 
here is want to keep in close to
diminish<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.500> possibility<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:53.070> him<00:00:53.250> hit<00:00:53.489> me

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
diminish the possibility of him hit me

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.060 
diminish the possibility of him hit me
with<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.680> any<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.739> his<00:00:55.890> air<00:00:56.129> fire<00:00:56.520> spells<00:00:56.910> and

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
with that any of his air fire spells and

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.340 
with that any of his air fire spells and
basically<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.219> want<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.430> just<00:00:59.550> roll<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.480> come

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
basically you want to just roll and come

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.080 
basically you want to just roll and come
around<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.649> his<00:01:01.770> back<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.309> hit<00:01:02.789> with<00:01:02.969> their

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
around to his back and hit with their

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.090 
around to his back and hit with their
strong<00:01:03.270> strike<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:03.989> that's<00:01:04.559> pretty<00:01:04.860> much<00:01:04.979> it

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
strong strike and that's pretty much it

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.420 
strong strike and that's pretty much it
that's<00:01:05.670> key<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.750> guy<00:01:07.130> one<00:01:08.130> of<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.280> things

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
that's key to this guy one of the things

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.649 
that's key to this guy one of the things
you<00:01:08.520> guys<00:01:08.610> might<00:01:08.850> not<00:01:09.000> know<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.479> when<00:01:09.570> you

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
you guys might not know is that when you

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.929 
you guys might not know is that when you
roll<00:01:09.869> you<00:01:10.080> can<00:01:10.110> control<00:01:10.530> your<00:01:10.710> roll<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.640> defy

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
roll you can control your roll and defy

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.940 
roll you can control your roll and defy
the<00:01:12.000> laws<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.270> physics

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
the laws of physics

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.600 
the laws of physics
it<00:01:14.789> works<00:01:15.030> whatever<00:01:16.130> when<00:01:17.130> he<00:01:17.189> puts<00:01:17.399> up<00:01:17.490> his

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
it works whatever when he puts up his

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.069 
it works whatever when he puts up his
shield<00:01:17.909> he's<00:01:18.090> invulnerable<00:01:18.360> don't<00:01:18.930> bother

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:19.079 
shield he's invulnerable don't bother

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:21.319 
shield he's invulnerable don't bother
trying<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.619> hit<00:01:19.799> him<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.549> bounces<00:01:20.939> off<00:01:21.090> and

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
trying to hit him just bounces off and

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:22.580 
trying to hit him just bounces off and
you'll<00:01:21.420> counter-attack<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.140> nice<00:01:22.289> to<00:01:22.320> me

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
you'll counter-attack you nice to me

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.620 
you'll counter-attack you nice to me
anytime<00:01:23.429> if<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.880> hit<00:01:24.090> him<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.329> he<00:01:24.390> blocks

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
anytime if you hit him and he blocks

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.300 
anytime if you hit him and he blocks
your<00:01:24.840> strike<00:01:25.110> using<00:01:25.679> it<00:01:25.770> up<00:01:25.890> eating<00:01:26.219> a

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
your strike using it up eating a

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.870 
your strike using it up eating a
fireball<00:01:27.270> or<00:01:27.299> something<00:01:27.869> that's<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.229> face

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
fireball or something that's the face

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.690 
fireball or something that's the face
some<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:29.970> his<00:01:30.090> moves<00:01:30.329> are<00:01:30.569> borderline

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
some of his moves are borderline

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.940 
some of his moves are borderline
unblockable<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:33.360> because<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.659> can<00:01:34.649> hit<00:01:34.770> you

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
unblockable just because I can hit you

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.770 
unblockable just because I can hit you
when<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.280> seem<00:01:35.970> like<00:01:36.090> you're<00:01:36.270> behind<00:01:36.509> them<00:01:36.750> so

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
when you seem like you're behind them so

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.490 
when you seem like you're behind them so
just<00:01:37.319> be<00:01:38.009> careful<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:39.380> obviously<00:01:40.380> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
just be careful but obviously the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.959 
just be careful but obviously the
strategy<00:01:40.890> works<00:01:41.069> pretty<00:01:41.250> well<00:01:43.759> real<00:01:44.759> quick

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
strategy works pretty well real quick

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:46.399 
strategy works pretty well real quick
too<00:01:45.210> i<00:01:45.240> wanted<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.630> address<00:01:45.810> some<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
too i wanted to address some of the

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.770 
too i wanted to address some of the
criticisms<00:01:47.099> people<00:01:47.549> address<00:01:47.789> regarding<00:01:48.659> my

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
criticisms people address regarding my

criticisms people address regarding my
complaints<00:01:49.319> of<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.470> combat<00:01:49.830> in<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:49.979> game<00:01:50.069> I

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
complaints of the combat in this game I

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.160 
complaints of the combat in this game I
don't<00:01:51.630> think<00:01:51.829> that<00:01:52.829> any<00:01:53.700> topic<00:01:54.299> should<00:01:54.810> be<00:01:55.020> off

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
don't think that any topic should be off

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.559 
don't think that any topic should be off
the<00:01:55.349> table<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.770> talk<00:01:55.979> about<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.369> any<00:01:56.520> game<00:01:56.759> just

00:01:57.559 --> 00:01:57.569 
the table to talk about in any game just

because this game is more focused on the
RPG<00:01:59.759> side<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.030> don't<00:02:00.299> think<00:02:00.569> it<00:02:00.720> should<00:02:01.069> you

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
RPG side I don't think it should you

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.039 
RPG side I don't think it should you
know<00:02:02.189> be<00:02:02.459> a<00:02:02.579> reason<00:02:02.939> why<00:02:02.970> we<00:02:03.270> can't<00:02:03.539> say<00:02:03.750> any<00:02:03.989> of

the<00:02:04.110> combat<00:02:04.470> could<00:02:04.649> use<00:02:04.799> tuning<00:02:05.159> out<00:02:05.250> by<00:02:05.489> him<00:02:05.610> I

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:05.849 
the combat could use tuning out by him I

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:08.029 
the combat could use tuning out by him I
think<00:02:06.149> that's<00:02:06.299> kind<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.539> silly<00:02:06.829> the<00:02:07.829> first

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
think that's kind of silly the first

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.249 
think that's kind of silly the first
Witcher<00:02:08.340> did<00:02:08.519> combat<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> lot<00:02:09.479> differently<00:02:09.959> and

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
Witcher did combat a lot differently and

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.819 
Witcher did combat a lot differently and
I<00:02:11.120> think<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.329> had<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> lot<00:02:12.810> more<00:02:12.840> fun<00:02:13.260> playing<00:02:13.560> it

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:13.829 
I think I had a lot more fun playing it

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:18.170 
I think I had a lot more fun playing it
that<00:02:14.040> way<00:02:16.010> you<00:02:17.010> know<00:02:17.099> obviously<00:02:17.489> depending<00:02:18.090> on

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
that way you know obviously depending on

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.430 
that way you know obviously depending on
what<00:02:18.269> game<00:02:18.420> you're<00:02:18.540> playing<00:02:18.840> if<00:02:19.019> it's<00:02:19.170> more<00:02:19.319> of

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
what game you're playing if it's more of

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.080 
what game you're playing if it's more of
an<00:02:19.500> RPG<00:02:20.010> you're<00:02:20.250> probably<00:02:20.430> gonna<00:02:20.609> get<00:02:20.790> less

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
an RPG you're probably gonna get less

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.190 
an RPG you're probably gonna get less
combat<00:02:21.930> more<00:02:22.200> cookie<00:02:22.790> but<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:24.090> think<00:02:24.989> something

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
combat more cookie but I think something

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.449 
combat more cookie but I think something
like<00:02:25.260> come<00:02:25.440> on<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.709> broad<00:02:25.889> of<00:02:26.040> mass<00:02:26.250> effect

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
like come on to a broad of mass effect

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.479 
like come on to a broad of mass effect
in<00:02:26.819> Batman<00:02:27.269> and<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.750> both<00:02:27.900> those<00:02:28.170> games<00:02:28.489> just

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
in Batman and I both those games just

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.220 
in Batman and I both those games just
hardware<00:02:29.850> wise<00:02:30.030> weren't<00:02:30.480> possible<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:31.049> do<00:02:31.200> a

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
hardware wise weren't possible to do a

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.710 
hardware wise weren't possible to do a
few<00:02:31.530> years<00:02:31.769> ago<00:02:32.150> we're<00:02:33.150> starting<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.569> get<00:02:33.660> a

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
few years ago we're starting to get a

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.370 
few years ago we're starting to get a
blend<00:02:34.079> of<00:02:34.319> these<00:02:34.850> hybrid<00:02:35.850> action<00:02:36.389> RPG<00:02:36.840> s<00:02:37.019> games

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
you just didn't have the hardware to do

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.620 
you just didn't have the hardware to do

characters<00:02:54.209> you<00:02:54.720> lot<00:02:55.170> of<00:02:55.290> fun<00:02:55.470> but<00:02:55.739> in<00:02:56.700> my

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
characters you lot of fun but in my

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.300 
characters you lot of fun but in my
opinion<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.359> combat<00:02:57.870> in<00:02:58.079> The<00:02:58.200> Witcher<00:02:58.380> took<00:02:59.280> a

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
opinion the combat in The Witcher took a

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.180 
opinion the combat in The Witcher took a
step<00:02:59.639> down<00:03:00.000> from<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.750> first<00:03:01.019> game<00:03:01.109> and<00:03:02.040> not

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
step down from the first game and not

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.490 
step down from the first game and not
only<00:03:02.340> that<00:03:02.430> but<00:03:02.930> ended<00:03:03.930> up<00:03:04.049> somewhere<00:03:04.380> between

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
only that but ended up somewhere between

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.400 
only that but ended up somewhere between
the<00:03:05.040> first<00:03:05.280> Witcher<00:03:05.700> ends<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.540> Batman<00:03:07.260> as

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
the first Witcher ends and Batman as

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.080 
the first Witcher ends and Batman as
well<00:03:07.590> as<00:03:07.799> if<00:03:07.889> you<00:03:07.980> just<00:03:08.190> wear<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.849> lets<00:03:09.000> you

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
well as if you just wear it lets you

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.789 
well as if you just wear it lets you
basically<00:03:09.480> don't<00:03:09.840> do<00:03:10.019> badly<00:03:10.260> forth<00:03:10.680> between

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
basically don't do badly forth between

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.379 
basically don't do badly forth between
guides<00:03:11.220> but<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:11.609> don't<00:03:11.790> have<00:03:11.880> those<00:03:12.030> escape

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
guides but you don't have those escape

options<00:03:12.829> your<00:03:13.829> which<00:03:14.190> I<00:03:14.459> think<00:03:14.639> the<00:03:14.700> worst

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
options your which I think the worst

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
part about the combat here is not only

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.979 
part about the combat here is not only
the<00:03:17.220> fact<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:17.519> a<00:03:17.609> lacks<00:03:17.880> depth<00:03:18.269> as<00:03:18.480> a<00:03:18.540> result

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
the fact that a lacks depth as a result

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:19.870 
the fact that a lacks depth as a result
of<00:03:19.139> having<00:03:19.230> so

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
of having so

abilities but the ability to be juggled

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.230 
abilities but the ability to be juggled
and<00:03:22.940> having<00:03:23.240> so<00:03:23.480> few<00:03:23.690> escape<00:03:24.020> options<00:03:25.090> it<00:03:26.090> can

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
and having so few escape options it can

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.060 
and having so few escape options it can
make<00:03:26.330> it<00:03:26.480> very<00:03:26.510> very<00:03:26.840> frustrating<00:03:27.110> and<00:03:27.710> then

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
make it very very frustrating and then

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.460 
make it very very frustrating and then
in<00:03:28.340> order<00:03:28.460> to<00:03:28.640> beat<00:03:28.790> a<00:03:28.820> boss<00:03:29.030> like<00:03:29.330> this<00:03:29.600> and
