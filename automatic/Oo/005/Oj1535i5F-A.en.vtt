wonder why have I not cut them off

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.330 
wonder why have I not cut them off
since<00:00:30.990> I'm<00:00:31.109> ready<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.320> change<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.859> strings

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
skinny top every button which I would

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.779 
skinny top every button which I would
like<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.730> use<00:00:41.850> for<00:00:42.090> drop<00:00:42.750> tuning<00:00:43.079> but<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
like to use for drop tuning but the

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.100 
like to use for drop tuning but the
reason<00:00:45.000> for<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:46.309> want<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.370> use<00:00:48.110> these

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
reason for that is I want to use these

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.529 
reason for that is I want to use these
whole<00:00:49.350> strings<00:00:49.820> when<00:00:50.820> testing<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.300> pick<00:00:51.420> up

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
whole strings when testing to pick up

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.510 
whole strings when testing to pick up
the<00:00:51.780> new<00:00:51.899> pick<00:00:52.079> up<00:00:52.170> for<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.379> first<00:00:52.530> time<00:00:52.770> just

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
the new pick up for the first time just

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.490 
the new pick up for the first time just
so<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.820> can<00:00:53.879> get<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.410> more<00:00:55.410> accurate

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
so that I can get a more accurate

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.729 
so that I can get a more accurate
comparison<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.329> tone<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:58.079> overall<00:00:58.500> sound

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
comparison of the tone and overall sound

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.619 
comparison of the tone and overall sound
between<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.989> old<00:01:01.199> pick<00:01:01.410> up<00:01:01.530> which<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.980> yeah

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
between the old pick up which is yeah

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.600 
between the old pick up which is yeah
Casa<00:01:03.629> Dragones<00:01:03.719> v8<00:01:04.379> mmm<00:01:05.040> which<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.430> very

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
Casa Dragones v8 mmm which is a very

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.880 
Casa Dragones v8 mmm which is a very
good<00:01:05.760> pickup<00:01:06.030> it's<00:01:06.540> versatile<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.590> now<00:01:07.770> I'm

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
good pickup it's versatile but now I'm

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.310 
good pickup it's versatile but now I'm
looking<00:01:08.010> forward<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:10.369> awesome<00:01:11.369> power<00:01:11.580> and

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
looking forward to the awesome power and

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.160 
looking forward to the awesome power and
tonal<00:01:13.320> difference<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.830> deactivator<00:01:14.760> offer

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
tonal difference the deactivator offer

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.300 
tonal difference the deactivator offer
so<00:01:16.170> basically<00:01:16.590> what<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.830> need<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.040> do<00:01:17.159> is

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
so basically what you need to do is

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.649 
so basically what you need to do is
remove<00:01:18.240> your<00:01:18.390> strings<00:01:19.640> open<00:01:20.640> up<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.479> back<00:01:21.630> of

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
remove your strings open up the back of

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.230 
remove your strings open up the back of
your<00:01:21.840> guitar<00:01:22.170> as<00:01:22.830> you've<00:01:23.790> seen<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.210> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
your guitar as you've seen this is a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.990 
your guitar as you've seen this is a
Floyd<00:01:24.450> Rose<00:01:24.600> so<00:01:25.280> if<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.430> have<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.610> fixed<00:01:26.909> bridge

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
Floyd Rose so if you have a fixed bridge

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.850 
Floyd Rose so if you have a fixed bridge
the<00:01:27.840> principle<00:01:28.170> will<00:01:28.259> be<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> same<00:01:28.970> but<00:01:30.860> the

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the principle will be the same but the

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.950 
the principle will be the same but the
interesting<00:01:32.280> part<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.610> right<00:01:32.790> here<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
interesting part is right here in the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.690 
interesting part is right here in the
paths<00:01:36.140> because<00:01:37.140> that's<00:01:37.380> way<00:01:37.590> all<00:01:38.520> your

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
paths because that's way all your

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.950 
paths because that's way all your
electronics<00:01:39.090> are<00:01:40.159> now

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
electronics are now

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.830 
electronics are now
if<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.070> can<00:01:44.220> see<00:01:44.400> that<00:01:46.130> there<00:01:47.130> is<00:01:47.160> a<00:01:47.280> switch

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
if you can see that there is a switch

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.230 
if you can see that there is a switch
since<00:01:48.840> it's<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.020> 5-way<00:01:49.410> pickup<00:01:49.440> selector

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
since it's a 5-way pickup selector

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.090 
since it's a 5-way pickup selector
there's<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.300> number<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.570> wires<00:01:51.900> there<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.830> it's

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
there's a number of wires there and it's

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.930 
there's a number of wires there and it's
got<00:01:53.220> three<00:01:53.340> pickups<00:01:53.550> after<00:01:54.510> all<00:01:54.600> so<00:01:55.590> um<00:01:55.940> the

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
got three pickups after all so um the

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.900 
got three pickups after all so um the
dimaggio<00:01:57.420> or<00:01:58.290> rather<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.100> VA<00:01:59.250> told<00:01:59.610> already

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
dimaggio or rather the VA told already

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.070 
dimaggio or rather the VA told already
connects<00:02:00.710> here<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:02.660> just<00:02:03.660> have<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.840> pinpoint

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
connects here I just have to pinpoint

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.810 
connects here I just have to pinpoint
the<00:02:04.350> wires<00:02:04.530> now<00:02:04.830> I'm<00:02:05.190> not<00:02:05.370> sure<00:02:05.400> what<00:02:05.640> your

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
the wires now I'm not sure what your

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.570 
the wires now I'm not sure what your
guitars<00:02:06.120> may<00:02:06.270> be<00:02:06.330> like<00:02:06.570> but<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:08.190> important

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
guitars may be like but the important

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.430 
guitars may be like but the important
thing<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.820> note<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.149> when<00:02:10.020> you<00:02:10.110> get<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.259> new

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
thing to note is when you get a new

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.430 
thing to note is when you get a new
pickup<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:12.510> get<00:02:12.690> instructions<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.260> come

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
pickup you get instructions that come

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.260 
pickup you get instructions that come
with<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:14.000> let<00:02:15.000> me<00:02:15.030> show<00:02:15.209> that<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.570> now<00:02:17.270> and

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
with it let me show that to you now and

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.900 
with it let me show that to you now and
here<00:02:18.540> they<00:02:18.660> are<00:02:19.070> these<00:02:20.070> instructions<00:02:20.640> came

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
here they are these instructions came

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.210 
here they are these instructions came
inside<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.660> pickup<00:02:22.350> packaging<00:02:22.800> which<00:02:23.100> I've

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
inside the pickup packaging which I've

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.800 
inside the pickup packaging which I've
opened<00:02:23.370> up<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:26.300> it's<00:02:27.300> really<00:02:27.360> what<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:27.630> need

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
opened up and it's really what you need

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.470 
opened up and it's really what you need
basically<00:02:30.080> doesn't<00:02:31.080> seem<00:02:31.200> too<00:02:31.380> complicated

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
basically doesn't seem too complicated

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.220 
basically doesn't seem too complicated
and<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:33.630> is<00:02:33.750> what<00:02:33.870> we're<00:02:33.990> going<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.140> be

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
and this is what we're going to be

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.400 
and this is what we're going to be
installing<00:02:34.640> humbucker<00:02:36.170> shows<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.320> the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
installing humbucker shows you the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.710 
installing humbucker shows you the
different<00:02:37.770> why<00:02:38.580> is<00:02:38.640> that<00:02:38.760> important<00:02:39.390> red<00:02:39.570> is

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
different why is that important red is

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.199 
different why is that important red is
hot<00:02:39.870> black<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:40.830> white<00:02:40.920> go<00:02:41.130> together<00:02:41.340> green

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
hot black and white go together green

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.820 
hot black and white go together green
and<00:02:42.390> bear<00:02:42.570> to<00:02:42.750> ground<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.440> ground<00:02:43.590> is

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
and bear to ground and the ground is

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.410 
and bear to ground and the ground is
usually<00:02:44.100> on<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.459> pot<00:02:45.500> either<00:02:46.500> the<00:02:46.680> volume<00:02:47.040> pot

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
usually on the pot either the volume pot

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:52.040 
usually on the pot either the volume pot
or<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.450> tongue<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.570> instructions<00:02:51.959> are

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
or the tongue so the instructions are

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.930 
or the tongue so the instructions are
not<00:02:52.080> very<00:02:52.320> long<00:02:52.470> so<00:02:53.160> I'm<00:02:53.220> confident<00:02:53.550> I<00:02:53.640> can<00:02:53.670> do

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
not very long so I'm confident I can do

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:54.229 
not very long so I'm confident I can do
this

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
this

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.790 
this
well<00:02:55.200> enough<00:02:56.120> but<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.750> course<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.350> recommend

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
well enough but of course I recommend

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.560 
well enough but of course I recommend
taking<00:02:59.040> your<00:02:59.310> time<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.670> what<00:03:00.180> you<00:03:00.209> need<00:03:00.420> is

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
taking your time and what you need is

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.540 
taking your time and what you need is
the<00:03:00.690> solving<00:03:01.050> iron<00:03:02.030> preferably<00:03:03.030> with<00:03:03.239> a

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
the solving iron preferably with a

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.790 
the solving iron preferably with a
pinpoint<00:03:05.550> chip<00:03:05.790> such<00:03:05.970> as<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:06.800> because

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
pinpoint chip such as this because

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.060 
pinpoint chip such as this because
you'll<00:03:07.950> be<00:03:08.070> doing<00:03:09.920> electronics<00:03:10.920> while

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
you'll be doing electronics while

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.870 
you'll be doing electronics while
soldering<00:03:11.790> which<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.330> pretty<00:03:13.140> delicate<00:03:13.980> sort

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
of tip like that would be good it

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.020 
of tip like that would be good it
doesn't<00:03:16.830> have<00:03:17.010> to<00:03:17.100> be<00:03:17.190> very<00:03:17.400> high<00:03:18.000> output
