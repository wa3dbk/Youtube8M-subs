00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
started to get cold out which figures

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.160 
started to get cold out which figures
but<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.830> got<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.850> driveway<00:00:18.330> full<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.720> tractors

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
but I got the driveway full of tractors

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.599 
but I got the driveway full of tractors
now<00:00:19.439> I'm<00:00:19.710> trying<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.100> get<00:00:20.220> through<00:00:20.460> over

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
now I'm trying to get through over

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.880 
now I'm trying to get through over
before<00:00:21.000> too<00:00:21.180> much<00:00:21.330> longer<00:00:21.390> because<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.830> snow

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
before too much longer because the snow

before too much longer because the snow
is<00:00:23.160> on<00:00:23.400> its<00:00:23.580> way<00:00:23.640> before<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.330> know<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:24.900> I

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.959 
with as you can see I have my little
simplicity<00:00:34.260> snowblower<00:00:34.800> down<00:00:35.040> here<00:00:35.399> which<00:00:35.880> I

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
simplicity snowblower down here which I

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.639 
simplicity snowblower down here which I
know<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.120> guys<00:00:36.329> don't<00:00:36.570> see<00:00:36.840> much<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:37.350> but

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
know you guys don't see much of this but

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.229 
know you guys don't see much of this but
it's<00:00:38.129> probably<00:00:38.340> one<00:00:38.579> of<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.760> best<00:00:38.940> little

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
it's probably one of the best little

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.790 
it's probably one of the best little
snow<00:00:39.450> blowers<00:00:39.719> I've<00:00:39.930> had<00:00:40.140> aside<00:00:40.559> from<00:00:40.680> a

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
snow blowers I've had aside from a

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.160 
snow blowers I've had aside from a
gravely<00:00:41.300> so<00:00:42.300> we're<00:00:42.420> trying<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.690> get<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.989> when

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
gravely so we're trying to get that when

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.510 
gravely so we're trying to get that when
running<00:00:43.379> again<00:00:43.680> for<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.010> year<00:00:44.250> because<00:00:44.460> I

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
running again for this year because I

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.060 
running again for this year because I
didn't<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.030> last<00:00:45.059> year<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.719> use<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.829> I

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
didn't have it last year to use so I

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.959 
didn't have it last year to use so I
don't<00:00:47.340> know<00:00:47.399> if<00:00:47.460> I'm<00:00:47.520> gonna<00:00:47.610> have<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.789> buy

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
don't know if I'm gonna have to buy

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.850 
don't know if I'm gonna have to buy
another<00:00:48.000> carburetor<00:00:48.719> fort<00:00:49.110> or<00:00:49.350> try<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> clean

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
another carburetor fort or try to clean

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.139 
another carburetor fort or try to clean
this<00:00:50.010> one<00:00:50.190> again<00:00:50.309> because<00:00:50.670> we've<00:00:50.820> been<00:00:50.910> having

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
this one again because we've been having

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.689 
this one again because we've been having
problems<00:00:51.390> problems<00:00:52.050> with<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.520> I've<00:00:53.520> also

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
problems problems with that I've also

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.310 
problems problems with that I've also
had<00:00:53.879> another<00:00:54.000> project<00:00:54.449> that's<00:00:54.809> been<00:00:54.930> going<00:00:55.110> on

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
had another project that's been going on

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.000 
had another project that's been going on
which<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.620> taken<00:00:56.070> up<00:00:56.129> most<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.579> my<00:00:56.640> time<00:00:56.760> and

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
which is taken up most of my time and

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.040 
which is taken up most of my time and
this<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.190> an<00:00:59.309> Onan<00:00:59.760> generator<00:00:59.789> out<00:01:00.390> of<00:01:00.480> an<00:01:00.570> RV

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
this is an Onan generator out of an RV

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.359 
this is an Onan generator out of an RV
it's<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.920> BGA<00:01:02.780> five<00:01:03.780> kilowatt<00:01:04.650> generator<00:01:04.680> so

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
it's a BGA five kilowatt generator so

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.690 
it's a BGA five kilowatt generator so
5,000<00:01:06.090> watts<00:01:06.409> and<00:01:07.409> that's<00:01:08.310> going<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.549> get

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
5,000 watts and that's going to get

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.030 
5,000 watts and that's going to get
mounted<00:01:08.939> on<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.840> frame<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.500> i<00:01:10.590> welded<00:01:10.920> up

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040

for a tractor at tractor supply only I

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.440 
for a tractor at tractor supply only I
made<00:01:15.600> one<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.930> custom<00:01:16.320> fit<00:01:17.000> so<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.119> can<00:01:18.240> see

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
made one to custom fit so you can see

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.330 
made one to custom fit so you can see
that<00:01:18.479> i<00:01:18.630> have<00:01:18.689> this<00:01:18.869> plate<00:01:19.200> here<00:01:19.590> that'll<00:01:20.250> be

a generator I can always drive over with
the<00:01:36.540> kubota<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.110> drop<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.860> they'll<00:01:38.549> be

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
the kubota and drop this and they'll be

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.670 
the kubota and drop this and they'll be
all<00:01:38.880> set<00:01:39.210> because<00:01:39.869> these<00:01:39.990> are<00:01:40.170> nice<00:01:40.350> they<00:01:40.560> only

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
all set because these are nice they only

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.889 
all set because these are nice they only
run<00:01:40.860> at<00:01:40.979> 1,800<00:01:41.729> rpms<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:42.450> they're<00:01:42.600> nice<00:01:42.689> and

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
run at 1,800 rpms so they're nice and

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.200 
run at 1,800 rpms so they're nice and
quiet<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:43.979> get<00:01:44.159> one<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.310> my<00:01:44.490> big<00:01:44.729> john<00:01:45.000> deere

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
quiet and I get one of my big john deere

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.010 
quiet and I get one of my big john deere
mufflers<00:01:45.600> on<00:01:45.780> it<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.439> works<00:01:46.740> out<00:01:46.950> good

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
mufflers on it so that works out good

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.929 
mufflers on it so that works out good
also<00:01:49.020> for<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> kubota<00:01:50.220> we're<00:01:50.640> going<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.820> be

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
also for the kubota we're going to be

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.670 
also for the kubota we're going to be
doing<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.420> throw<00:01:51.750> out<00:01:51.930> bearing<00:01:51.960> for<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
doing the throw out bearing for the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.770 
doing the throw out bearing for the
clutch<00:01:52.979> probably<00:01:53.579> next<00:01:53.790> weekend<00:01:54.270> i<00:01:54.390> ordered<00:01:54.720> a

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
clutch probably next weekend i ordered a

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.230 
clutch probably next weekend i ordered a
new<00:01:54.810> one<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.860> my<00:01:56.070> plan<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.520> get<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> video<00:01:57.090> of

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
new one so my plan is to get a video of

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.940 
new one so my plan is to get a video of
that<00:01:57.360> when<00:01:57.570> we<00:01:57.689> split<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:58.110> apart<00:01:58.200> we<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:58.860> to

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
that when we split it apart we have to

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.039 
that when we split it apart we have to
pull<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.250> loader<00:01:59.430> off<00:01:59.670> and<00:02:00.420> get<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.840> in<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
pull the loader off and get it in the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.929 
pull the loader off and get it in the
garage<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.710> we're<00:02:01.979> going<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.159> break<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.700> so

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
garage and we're going to break it so

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.580 
garage and we're going to break it so
that<00:02:03.090> way<00:02:03.210> we<00:02:03.360> can<00:02:03.509> get<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> clutch<00:02:04.079> throw

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
that way we can get to the clutch throw

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.280 
that way we can get to the clutch throw
up<00:02:04.710> bearing<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.219> place<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.969> also<00:02:06.689> bent<00:02:07.170> up

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
up bearing and place that I also bent up

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.410 
up bearing and place that I also bent up
another<00:02:07.530> bucket<00:02:07.770> at<00:02:07.979> work<00:02:08.190> for<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.729> snow<00:02:09.000> bucket

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
another bucket at work for a snow bucket

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.900 
another bucket at work for a snow bucket
it's<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.619> same<00:02:10.890> exact<00:02:11.280> design<00:02:11.459> as<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
it's the same exact design as the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.400 
it's the same exact design as the
errands<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.540> wheel<00:02:12.690> horse<00:02:12.989> only<00:02:13.379> a

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
errands and the wheel horse only a

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.710 
errands and the wheel horse only a
little

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
little

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.620 
little
taller<00:02:14.400> it's<00:02:15.400> got<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.610> lot<00:02:15.790> more<00:02:15.850> room<00:02:16.240> for<00:02:16.540> the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
taller it's got a lot more room for the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.120 
taller it's got a lot more room for the
snow<00:02:16.900> just<00:02:17.380> because<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.650> one's<00:02:17.830> a<00:02:17.920> dirt

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
snow just because that one's a dirt

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.510 
snow just because that one's a dirt
bucket<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:18.730> this<00:02:19.540> one's<00:02:19.750> also<00:02:19.960> five<00:02:20.860> feet<00:02:21.280> I

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
bucket and this one's also five feet I

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.610 
bucket and this one's also five feet I
think<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:21.760> made<00:02:21.910> it<00:02:21.940> five<00:02:22.240> feet<00:02:22.540> wide<00:02:22.810> got<00:02:23.470> the

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
think I made it five feet wide got the

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.340 
think I made it five feet wide got the
ends<00:02:23.950> for<00:02:24.280> it<00:02:24.400> so<00:02:24.640> got<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:25.600> weld<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:25.930> up<00:02:26.140> and

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
ends for it so got to weld that up and

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.630 
ends for it so got to weld that up and
then<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.530> got<00:02:26.650> to<00:02:26.710> figure<00:02:26.890> out<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.130> brackets

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
then I got to figure out the brackets

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.310 
then I got to figure out the brackets
for<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.240> arms<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:28.810> everything<00:02:28.870> like<00:02:29.260> that

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
for the arms and everything like that

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.090 
for the arms and everything like that
and<00:02:29.740> we<00:02:30.400> can<00:02:30.580> put<00:02:30.700> those<00:02:30.880> on<00:02:31.150> there<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:32.500> the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
and we can put those on there and the

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.860 
and we can put those on there and the
welded<00:02:33.400> generators<00:02:33.910> we<00:02:34.060> moved<00:02:34.270> up<00:02:34.420> behind<00:02:34.690> the

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
welded generators we moved up behind the

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.540 
welded generators we moved up behind the
pellet<00:02:35.170> shed<00:02:35.380> here<00:02:35.680> made<00:02:36.010> a<00:02:36.040> little<00:02:36.310> platform

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
pellet shed here made a little platform

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.000 
pellet shed here made a little platform
for<00:02:37.150> them<00:02:37.240> so<00:02:38.140> I<00:02:38.200> got<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.590> one<00:02:38.740> on<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:38.980> end

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
for them so I got the one on the end

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.980 
for them so I got the one on the end
here<00:02:39.250> that<00:02:39.490> works<00:02:39.760> in<00:02:40.000> case<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.360> need<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.570> I<00:02:40.840> also

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
here that works in case I need it I also

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:42.900 
here that works in case I need it I also
built<00:02:41.380> carts<00:02:41.890> form<00:02:42.190> so<00:02:42.370> i<00:02:42.430> can<00:02:42.610> pull<00:02:42.820> them

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
built carts form so i can pull them

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.270 
built carts form so i can pull them
behind<00:02:43.240> the<00:02:43.480> tractor<00:02:44.290> so<00:02:44.710> a<00:02:44.740> couple<00:02:44.980> of<00:02:45.160> little

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
behind the tractor so a couple of little

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.949 
behind the tractor so a couple of little
wagons<00:02:45.959> we<00:02:46.959> can<00:02:47.110> see<00:02:47.290> that<00:02:47.470> one<00:02:47.910> so<00:02:48.910> amount<00:02:49.840> of

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
wagons we can see that one so amount of

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.150 
wagons we can see that one so amount of
that<00:02:50.200> and<00:02:50.380> that<00:02:50.500> worked<00:02:50.650> out<00:02:50.800> pretty<00:02:50.860> good

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
that and that worked out pretty good

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.890 
that and that worked out pretty good
makes<00:02:51.550> it<00:02:51.670> a<00:02:51.730> little<00:02:51.850> easier<00:02:52.120> to<00:02:52.330> move<00:02:52.600> since

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
makes it a little easier to move since

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.620 
makes it a little easier to move since
they're<00:02:53.110> so<00:02:53.140> heavy<00:02:54.150> alright<00:02:55.150> we're<00:02:55.330> up<00:02:55.450> here

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
they're so heavy alright we're up here

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.870 
they're so heavy alright we're up here
in<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.870> Quonset<00:02:56.350> hut<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:56.709> I<00:02:57.190> had<00:02:57.370> one<00:02:57.640> person

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
in the Quonset hut and I had one person

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.090 
in the Quonset hut and I had one person
asking<00:02:58.360> me<00:02:58.510> about<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.870> big<00:02:59.709> four-wheel-drive

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
asking me about the big four-wheel-drive

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.250 
asking me about the big four-wheel-drive
project<00:03:01.090> that<00:03:01.270> was<00:03:01.330> going<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.570> make<00:03:01.750> this<00:03:01.930> year

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
project that was going to make this year

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.580 
project that was going to make this year
which<00:03:02.580> unfortunately<00:03:03.990> back<00:03:04.990> in<00:03:05.170> the<00:03:05.230> spring

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
which unfortunately back in the spring

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.410 
which unfortunately back in the spring
came<00:03:05.830> to<00:03:05.980> a<00:03:06.010> standstill<00:03:06.550> given<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:07.150> I<00:03:07.209> ran

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
came to a standstill given that I ran

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.510 
came to a standstill given that I ran
out<00:03:07.540> of<00:03:07.570> time<00:03:07.870> so<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.350> can<00:03:08.590> see<00:03:08.830> that<00:03:09.040> that's

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
out of time so you can see that that's

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.390 
out of time so you can see that that's
one<00:03:09.850> of<00:03:09.940> the<00:03:10.000> transmissions<00:03:10.660> over<00:03:10.930> there<00:03:11.400> it's

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
on it which I hopefully I do because I

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.830 
on it which I hopefully I do because I
really<00:03:29.170> do<00:03:29.290> want<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.560> work<00:03:29.620> on<00:03:29.950> and<00:03:30.130> finish<00:03:30.340> it

Tuffy<00:03:43.269> which<00:03:43.930> I<00:03:44.080> haven't<00:03:44.380> seen<00:03:44.620> many<00:03:44.860> of<00:03:45.070> these

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
Tuffy which I haven't seen many of these

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.539 
Tuffy which I haven't seen many of these
so<00:03:46.209> I<00:03:46.239> took<00:03:46.630> kind<00:03:47.470> of<00:03:47.560> a<00:03:47.650> rare<00:03:47.890> little<00:03:48.250> tractor

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
so I took kind of a rare little tractor

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:50.870 
so I took kind of a rare little tractor
but<00:03:48.880> it's<00:03:49.000> cool<00:03:49.299> it's<00:03:50.019> got<00:03:50.230> this<00:03:50.470> little

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
but it's cool it's got this little

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.949 
but it's cool it's got this little
cultivator<00:03:51.880> on<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.180> back<00:03:52.420> it's<00:03:52.660> probably

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
cultivator on the back it's probably

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.500 
cultivator on the back it's probably
only<00:03:53.049> about<00:03:53.140> a<00:03:53.350> foot<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:53.650> a<00:03:53.769> half<00:03:53.799> wide<00:03:54.510> solid

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
only about a foot and a half wide solid

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.960 
only about a foot and a half wide solid
rubber<00:03:55.690> wheels<00:03:56.019> wouldn't<00:03:56.769> handle<00:03:57.190> and<00:03:57.760> it<00:03:57.820> was

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
rubber wheels wouldn't handle and it was

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.729 
rubber wheels wouldn't handle and it was
kept<00:03:58.180> inside<00:03:58.360> which<00:03:58.870> is<00:03:58.989> why<00:03:59.140> this<00:03:59.200> handles<00:03:59.650> in

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
kept inside which is why this handles in

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.009 
kept inside which is why this handles in
such<00:03:59.920> good<00:04:00.100> condition<00:04:00.160> and<00:04:00.790> this<00:04:01.600> little<00:04:01.780> I

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
such good condition and this little I

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.229 
such good condition and this little I
think<00:04:02.230> it's<00:04:02.350> a<00:04:02.440> one-horse<00:04:02.890> Briggs<00:04:03.370> it<00:04:04.000> does

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
think it's a one-horse Briggs it does

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.270 
think it's a one-horse Briggs it does
run<00:04:04.540> actually<00:04:04.900> runs<00:04:05.260> pretty<00:04:05.470> darn<00:04:05.739> good<00:04:05.830> too

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
run actually runs pretty darn good too

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.789 
run actually runs pretty darn good too
so<00:04:06.730> I<00:04:07.000> thought<00:04:07.720> that<00:04:07.780> was<00:04:08.049> pretty<00:04:08.230> neat<00:04:08.530> but<00:04:08.709> we

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
so I thought that was pretty neat but we

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:10.680 
so I thought that was pretty neat but we
got<00:04:08.920> that<00:04:09.100> up<00:04:09.280> here<00:04:09.549> for<00:04:09.730> the<00:04:09.820> winter<00:04:09.970> I<00:04:10.269> might

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
got that up here for the winter I might

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:11.970 
got that up here for the winter I might
pull<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:10.959> handle<00:04:11.290> off<00:04:11.410> and<00:04:11.620> put<00:04:11.769> it<00:04:11.799> inside

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
pull the handle off and put it inside

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.289 
pull the handle off and put it inside
just<00:04:12.459> to<00:04:12.549> protect<00:04:13.420> it<00:04:13.600> from<00:04:13.660> the<00:04:13.750> weather

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
just to protect it from the weather

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.520 
just to protect it from the weather
everything<00:04:16.299> else<00:04:16.479> is<00:04:16.690> just<00:04:16.720> starting<00:04:17.320> to<00:04:17.350> get

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
everything else is just starting to get

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.320 
everything else is just starting to get
put<00:04:18.250> down<00:04:18.280> for<00:04:18.729> the<00:04:18.850> winter<00:04:18.970> I've<00:04:19.209> been

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
put down for the winter I've been

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.990 
put down for the winter I've been
pulling<00:04:19.620> batteries<00:04:20.620> out<00:04:20.799> and<00:04:21.190> draining<00:04:21.820> gas

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
pulling batteries out and draining gas

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.460 
pulling batteries out and draining gas
and

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
and

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.350 
and
and<00:04:24.010> this<00:04:24.250> is<00:04:24.400> another<00:04:24.610> thing<00:04:24.820> I<00:04:24.940> never<00:04:25.120> did<00:04:25.330> a

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
and this is another thing I never did a

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.530 
and this is another thing I never did a
video<00:04:25.570> on<00:04:25.720> that<00:04:26.760> magic<00:04:27.760> track<00:04:28.120> you<00:04:28.330> already

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
video on that magic track you already

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.780 
video on that magic track you already
know<00:04:28.660> runs<00:04:28.990> and<00:04:29.320> this<00:04:30.070> one<00:04:30.250> you<00:04:30.370> know<00:04:30.520> Iran's

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
know runs and this one you know Iran's

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.820 
know runs and this one you know Iran's
but<00:04:31.150> I<00:04:31.180> finally<00:04:31.750> finished<00:04:32.020> getting<00:04:32.380> this<00:04:32.590> one

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
but I finally finished getting this one

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.940 
but I finally finished getting this one
into<00:04:33.190> usable<00:04:34.150> condition<00:04:34.330> I<00:04:34.840> ended<00:04:35.680> up<00:04:35.740> fixing

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
into usable condition I ended up fixing

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:38.970 
into usable condition I ended up fixing
the<00:04:36.220> steering<00:04:36.640> gear<00:04:36.910> last<00:04:37.210> year<00:04:37.600> on<00:04:37.780> it<00:04:37.980> this

the steering gear last year on it this

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.130 
the steering gear last year on it this
year<00:04:39.190> I<00:04:39.310> really<00:04:39.640> went<00:04:39.820> through<00:04:40.120> it<00:04:40.270> and<00:04:40.420> I<00:04:40.990> get

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
year I really went through it and I get

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.900 
year I really went through it and I get
the<00:04:41.260> starter<00:04:41.680> working<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.610> starter

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
the starter working the starter

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.700 
the starter working the starter
generator<00:04:43.120> so<00:04:43.630> the<00:04:43.720> charging<00:04:44.080> system<00:04:44.260> is<00:04:44.560> all

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
generator so the charging system is all

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.160 
generator so the charging system is all
set<00:04:45.010> I<00:04:45.220> got<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.610> original<00:04:45.670> tires<00:04:46.270> back<00:04:46.450> on<00:04:46.930> to

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
set I got the original tires back on to

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.250 
set I got the original tires back on to
it<00:04:47.320> I<00:04:47.520> even<00:04:48.520> made<00:04:48.610> a<00:04:48.790> pitch<00:04:49.450> for<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:49.840> back<00:04:50.020> of

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
it I even made a pitch for the back of

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.860 
it I even made a pitch for the back of
it<00:04:50.320> a<00:04:50.530> sickle<00:04:51.460> bar<00:04:51.490> sitting<00:04:52.000> on<00:04:52.180> it<00:04:52.300> but<00:04:52.750> you

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
it a sickle bar sitting on it but you

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.230 
it a sickle bar sitting on it but you
got<00:04:53.020> your<00:04:53.260> pin<00:04:53.980> hitch<00:04:54.220> here<00:04:54.520> for<00:04:54.700> a<00:04:54.730> wagon<00:04:55.150> and

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
got your pin hitch here for a wagon and

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.080 
got your pin hitch here for a wagon and
your<00:04:55.390> ball<00:04:55.660> hitch<00:04:55.930> there<00:04:56.640> so<00:04:57.640> this<00:04:57.790> has<00:04:57.910> become

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.090 
your ball hitch there so this has become

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.650 
your ball hitch there so this has become
a<00:04:58.300> new<00:04:58.570> tugging<00:04:59.230> tractor<00:04:59.710> towing<00:05:00.010> and

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:29.580 
might be a two-part video and I also

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.909 
might be a two-part video and I also
have<00:07:30.000> that<00:07:30.630> onan<00:07:31.020> generator<00:07:31.050> which<00:07:31.650> I<00:07:31.770> have<00:07:31.860> to
