anything specific to make them so any

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.340

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
deck has access to these so this is a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.529 
deck has access to these so this is a
level<00:00:46.770> 5<00:00:47.039> synchro<00:00:47.340> monster<00:00:47.640> only<00:00:47.969> 100<00:00:48.360> attack

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
but its effect is basically what it

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.619 
but its effect is basically what it
comes<00:00:49.980> down<00:00:50.160> to<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:50.940> can<00:00:51.210> only<00:00:51.390> use<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
comes down to so you can only use the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.750 
comes down to so you can only use the
effect<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.050> reincarnation<00:00:52.649> dragons<00:00:53.190> samsara

there and play it defensively and

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.090 
there and play it defensively and
perhaps<00:01:39.509> get<00:01:39.869> something<00:01:40.200> bigger<00:01:40.409> out<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.950> can

perhaps get something bigger out you can

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.039 
perhaps get something bigger out you can
actually<00:01:41.220> just<00:01:41.369> crash<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:42.000> that's<00:01:42.600> why<00:01:42.990> I

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
actually just crash it that's why I

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.480 
actually just crash it that's why I
think<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.409> public<00:01:43.680> has<00:01:43.799> slow<00:01:43.979> attack<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.280> mean

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
think it public has slow attack I mean

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.590 
think it public has slow attack I mean
could<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.700> imagine<00:01:44.729> if<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.119> thing<00:01:45.270> had<00:01:45.390> good

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
could you imagine if this thing had good

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.359 
could you imagine if this thing had good
attack<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.590> would<00:01:46.710> actually<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:47.159> really

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
attack to that would actually be really

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.310 
attack to that would actually be really
really<00:01:47.850> dumb<00:01:48.149> but<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.810> know<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:48.930> think<00:01:49.170> that

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
really dumb but you know I think that

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.450 
really dumb but you know I think that
you<00:01:49.500> know<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.770> sense<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.040> it's<00:01:50.220> kind<00:01:50.340> of

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
you know in a sense that it's kind of

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.950 
you know in a sense that it's kind of
balance<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.119> sense<00:01:51.299> that<00:01:51.329> only<00:01:51.540> has<00:01:51.750> 100

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
balance in the sense that only has 100

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.980 
balance in the sense that only has 100
attack<00:01:52.460> so<00:01:53.460> basically<00:01:53.790> if<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.420> want<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.720> let's

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
attack so basically if I want to let's

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.090 
attack so basically if I want to let's
say<00:01:55.049> you're<00:01:55.200> playing<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.500> too<00:01:55.619> dark<00:01:55.829> won't

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100

play for whatever reason they they get

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.480 
play for whatever reason they they get

need that specific card not only to run
their<00:02:43.269> deck<00:02:43.420> but<00:02:43.599> also<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:43.989> know<00:02:44.110> perhaps<00:02:44.319> for

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
their deck but also you know perhaps for

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.039 
their deck but also you know perhaps for
a<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.890> know<00:02:45.160> later<00:02:45.459> turn<00:02:45.790> but<00:02:46.360> what's<00:02:46.840> also

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
a you know later turn but what's also

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.600 
a you know later turn but what's also
really<00:02:47.290> cool<00:02:47.799> with<00:02:47.890> this<00:02:48.010> card<00:02:48.250> is<00:02:48.430> it

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
really cool with this card is it

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.789 
really cool with this card is it
actually<00:02:48.790> is<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.090> target<00:02:49.360> for<00:02:49.690> debris<00:02:50.200> dragon

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
actually is a target for debris dragon

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.470 
actually is a target for debris dragon
which<00:02:50.920> is<00:02:51.069> actually<00:02:51.280> crazy<00:02:51.640> because<00:02:51.849> you<00:02:52.360> know

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
which is actually crazy because you know

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.880 
which is actually crazy because you know
the<00:02:52.630> effect<00:02:52.870> only<00:02:53.019> has<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.349> be<00:02:53.440> a<00:02:53.470> monster<00:02:53.620> with

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
the effect only has to be a monster with

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.130 
the effect only has to be a monster with
500<00:02:54.069> less<00:02:54.459> attack<00:02:54.760> now<00:02:55.269> I<00:02:55.299> know<00:02:55.540> it<00:02:55.810> does<00:02:55.989> say

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
500 less attack now I know it does say

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.990 
500 less attack now I know it does say
the<00:02:56.470> monsters<00:02:56.829> effects<00:02:57.130> are<00:02:57.250> negated<00:02:57.700> but<00:02:57.880> you

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
the monsters effects are negated but you

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.339 
the monsters effects are negated but you
know<00:02:58.120> once<00:02:58.299> it<00:02:58.450> was<00:02:58.599> the<00:02:58.720> grave<00:02:58.900> are<00:02:59.079> you<00:02:59.230> know

00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 
know once it was the grave are you know

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.770 
know once it was the grave are you know
it's<00:02:59.769> kind<00:02:59.890> of<00:02:59.980> like<00:03:00.069> getting<00:03:00.340> you<00:03:00.790> know<00:03:00.910> a

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
it's kind of like getting you know a

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.640 
it's kind of like getting you know a
card<00:03:02.440> uh<00:03:03.360> that<00:03:04.360> you<00:03:04.540> know<00:03:04.660> um<00:03:04.930> you<00:03:05.530> know

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
card uh that you know um you know

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.900 
card uh that you know um you know
something<00:03:06.220> that<00:03:06.340> brings<00:03:06.489> something<00:03:06.700> back

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
something that brings something back

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
something that brings something back
from<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.090> grave<00:03:07.209> ever<00:03:07.360> its<00:03:07.510> effects<00:03:07.720> from<00:03:07.810> the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
from the grave ever its effects from the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.970 
from the grave ever its effects from the
Gator<00:03:08.049> but<00:03:08.170> you<00:03:08.260> know<00:03:08.319> obviously<00:03:08.590> once<00:03:08.920> it

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
Gator but you know obviously once it

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.500 
Gator but you know obviously once it
hits<00:03:09.099> the<00:03:09.190> grave<00:03:09.340> very<00:03:09.579> like<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.180> know<00:03:10.209> that's

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
hits the grave very like you know that's

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.970 
hits the grave very like you know that's
you<00:03:10.720> know<00:03:10.810> irrelevant<00:03:11.410> to<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.620> game<00:03:11.739> because

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
you know irrelevant to the game because

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.830 
you know irrelevant to the game because
you<00:03:12.010> know<00:03:12.160> it<00:03:12.280> goes<00:03:12.459> its<00:03:12.970> effect<00:03:13.239> activates<00:03:13.450> in

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
you know it goes its effect activates in

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.150 
you know it goes its effect activates in
the<00:03:13.959> graveyard<00:03:14.170> so<00:03:14.500> I<00:03:14.530> think<00:03:14.709> that<00:03:14.829> that<00:03:15.010> is

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
the graveyard so I think that that is

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.559 
the graveyard so I think that that is
pretty<00:03:15.519> awesome<00:03:15.700> so<00:03:15.970> I<00:03:16.000> mean<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:16.239> can<00:03:16.329> debris

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
pretty awesome so I mean you can debris

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:18.360 
pretty awesome so I mean you can debris
dragon<00:03:16.959> debris<00:03:17.200> dragon<00:03:17.470> only<00:03:17.709> has<00:03:17.859> a<00:03:17.889> thousand

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
dragon debris dragon only has a thousand

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.770 
dragon debris dragon only has a thousand
attack<00:03:18.519> but<00:03:18.790> you<00:03:19.180> know<00:03:19.209> you<00:03:19.359> can<00:03:19.569> kind<00:03:19.750> of

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
attack but you know you can kind of

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.900 
attack but you know you can kind of
recycle<00:03:20.260> stuff<00:03:20.440> so<00:03:20.620> you<00:03:20.709> can<00:03:20.889> I<00:03:21.220> know<00:03:21.730> this

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
recycle stuff so you can I know this

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.900 
recycle stuff so you can I know this
monster<00:03:22.709> also<00:03:23.709> gets<00:03:23.950> me<00:03:24.130> in<00:03:24.340> face<00:03:24.489> of<00:03:24.519> attack

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
monster also gets me in face of attack

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.849 
monster also gets me in face of attack
position<00:03:25.359> so<00:03:25.569> in<00:03:25.810> that<00:03:26.139> aspect<00:03:26.200> is<00:03:26.620> kind<00:03:26.799> of

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859 
position so in that aspect is kind of

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:28.259 
position so in that aspect is kind of
cool<00:03:26.950> maybe<00:03:27.160> you're<00:03:27.370> gonna<00:03:27.489> crash<00:03:27.790> this<00:03:27.819> card

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
cool maybe you're gonna crash this card

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:29.729 
cool maybe you're gonna crash this card
made<00:03:28.450> me<00:03:28.540> run<00:03:28.660> at<00:03:28.780> something<00:03:29.019> else<00:03:29.170> then<00:03:29.650> you

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
made me run at something else then you

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.830 
made me run at something else then you
can<00:03:29.889> go<00:03:29.980> ahead<00:03:30.069> and<00:03:30.220> synchro<00:03:30.819> or<00:03:31.030> XYZ<00:03:31.090> with

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
can go ahead and synchro or XYZ with

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.720 
can go ahead and synchro or XYZ with
your<00:03:31.959> debris<00:03:32.200> dragon<00:03:32.530> so<00:03:32.680> this<00:03:33.280> card<00:03:33.519> could

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
your debris dragon so this card could

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.979 
your debris dragon so this card could
you<00:03:33.850> know<00:03:33.970> potentially<00:03:34.090> go<00:03:34.480> up<00:03:34.600> you<00:03:34.810> know<00:03:34.930> to

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
you know potentially go up you know to

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.870 
you know potentially go up you know to
you<00:03:35.560> know<00:03:35.590> more<00:03:36.010> than<00:03:36.069> what<00:03:36.459> it<00:03:36.549> is<00:03:36.579> right<00:03:36.700> now

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
you know more than what it is right now

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.520 
you know more than what it is right now
believe<00:03:37.209> right<00:03:37.329> now<00:03:37.389> looks<00:03:37.600> at<00:03:37.720> one<00:03:38.019> so<00:03:38.260> you

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
believe right now looks at one so you

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.319 
believe right now looks at one so you
know<00:03:38.620> this<00:03:38.739> could<00:03:38.769> be<00:03:38.980> a<00:03:39.010> hit<00:03:39.160> this<00:03:39.400> card<00:03:39.639> you

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
know this could be a hit this card you

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.000 
know this could be a hit this card you
know<00:03:40.450> my<00:03:40.569> code<00:03:40.750> it<00:03:40.900> too<00:03:41.049> because<00:03:41.260> I<00:03:41.620> mean<00:03:41.829> you

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
know my code it too because I mean you

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.080 
know my code it too because I mean you
know<00:03:42.100> the<00:03:42.280> definitely<00:03:42.700> supports<00:03:43.030> were

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
know the definitely supports were

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.180 
know the definitely supports were
incarnation<00:03:43.630> dragon<00:03:43.959> sensor<00:03:44.290> but<00:03:44.920> next<00:03:45.069> up

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
incarnation dragon sensor but next up

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.680 
incarnation dragon sensor but next up
we're<00:03:45.370> going<00:03:45.459> to<00:03:45.579> taking<00:03:45.819> a<00:03:45.940> look<00:03:46.150> at<00:03:46.269> a<00:03:46.299> really

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
we're going to taking a look at a really

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.300 
we're going to taking a look at a really
insane<00:03:47.049> card<00:03:47.350> I<00:03:47.410> actually<00:03:47.590> want<00:03:47.859> to<00:03:47.889> build<00:03:48.130> a

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
insane card I actually want to build a

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.390 
insane card I actually want to build a
deck<00:03:48.549> completely<00:03:49.239> around<00:03:49.840> moonflower<00:03:50.500> dragon

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
deck completely around moonflower dragon

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.190 
deck completely around moonflower dragon
black<00:03:51.790> rose<00:03:52.060> now<00:03:52.450> it<00:03:52.630> actually<00:03:52.780> might<00:03:53.139> be

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
black rose now it actually might be

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.879 
black rose now it actually might be
changed<00:03:53.769> in<00:03:53.889> the<00:03:54.069> pce<00:03:54.489> to<00:03:54.940> moon<00:03:55.540> flower<00:03:56.319> black

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
changed in the pce to moon flower black

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.470 
changed in the pce to moon flower black
rose<00:03:57.099> dragon<00:03:57.670> as<00:03:57.819> you<00:03:57.970> guys<00:03:58.090> know<00:03:58.120> sometimes

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
rose dragon as you guys know sometimes

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.110 
rose dragon as you guys know sometimes
the<00:03:58.900> names<00:03:59.139> get<00:03:59.349> changed<00:03:59.859> from<00:04:00.190> OC<00:04:00.519> gene<00:04:00.670> TCG

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
the names get changed from OC gene TCG

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.339 
the names get changed from OC gene TCG
but<00:04:01.359> we'll<00:04:01.690> talk<00:04:01.810> about<00:04:01.870> that<00:04:02.079> in<00:04:02.200> a<00:04:02.260> moment

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
but we'll talk about that in a moment

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:03.660 
but we'll talk about that in a moment
cuz<00:04:02.620> it<00:04:02.680> actually<00:04:02.920> kind<00:04:03.069> of<00:04:03.130> matters<00:04:03.459> from<00:04:03.579> the

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
cuz it actually kind of matters from the
