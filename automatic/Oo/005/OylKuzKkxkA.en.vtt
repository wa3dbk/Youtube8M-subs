00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:03.500
-- THE ART SHOW --

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.730
Listen, if you fancy, on Friday night a friend of mine is having a party.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.570
He’s just bought a flat in the Bay!

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.800
There'll be loads of boys there,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.040
It'll be a night fit for a king, well, fit for a queen at least!

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:23.210
D'you wanna come?

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.040
What? A gay party?

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.870
Oh, sorry, I didn't think.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.540
I'm sure a full-blooded male like you doesn't go for fannydodgers.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.860
I've got nothing against fannydodgers…

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.100
if you're happy to turn the other cheek, like.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.010
Penbleth Dynol Ryw, recently published by Dalen…

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.280
is a graphic novel which has been described…

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.590
as the most brazen book this year.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.580
Alun Ceri Jones, who has previously translated
the Asterix books into Welsh…

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:59.100
is the one responsible for adapting the book
from the original German version.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.720
Why has this German story captured your imagination?

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.970
I've always been interested in the genre.
Graphic novels are massive on the continent…

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.120
and I'm interested in material from France specifically,
and from Germany and Belgium.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.950
I'd been thinking for about ten years…
-- ALUN CERI JONES, PUBLISHER --

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.200
that I'd like to get back in to this book publishing business…
-- ALUN CERI JONES, PUBLISHER --

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.040
and in looking for what kind of niche I could fill
this was a natural area for me to work in.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.280
Der bewegte Mann was published by Ralf König in 1987.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.170
It's a satirical book telling the story of a man…

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.670
in emotional turmoil after his girlfriend leaves him.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.490
He becomes friends with a gay man and this is where his dilemma begins.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.740
I wanted this to be an adaptation rather than a translation…

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.400
so setting the book, which covers sexual matters…

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.470
homosexuality, people's relationships…

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.320
in a city such as Cardiff is natural for a country like Wales.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.500
Cardiff is a kind of massive cauldron which brings everybody together.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.120
It also gave us a chance to use regional dialects…

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.190
because people in Cardiff would speak in north and south Wales dialects
every day with each other.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.560
Using that approach was fun.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.380
In adapting the book Alun has used lots of swear words and sexual terms…

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.750
with many of them appearing in print, in this book, for the very first time.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.590
And at the back of the book there's a list of 69 of these words.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.600
How did you go about to find this list of Welsh swear words?

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.570
Are they few and far between?

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.750
No, they're not rare at all!

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.430
Once you start looking for them and you go below the surface
you'll find them very easily.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:56.630
If you log onto Rhegiadur.com, for instance,
you'll find a jungle of fantastic words!

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.950
I was driving home late one night
and on the radio they were looking for a Welsh word for…

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.250
'orgasm'.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.800
Someone phoned in with this fantastic word and I've used it in the book!

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:15.430
The question is, do you really want to talk about orgasms?
Or do you…

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.340
Oh yes, yes, I'm dying to know!

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.750
Right… What exactly don't you understand?

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.800
Well… that bit about tickling the pink pea…

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.950
There's a cold sausage and some cheese in the fridge.

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.600
Ralf König is responsible for the original words and drawings…

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:43.080
and has his own distinctive style when it comes to creating his characters. 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.550
How distinctive is Ralf König's style?

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.820
He's very distinctive.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:55.000
His noses are distinctive. I don't know if he has a reason for big noses…
-- MUMPH, CARTOONIST --

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.370
I can see him, even though I don't know him,

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.950
but you just start with a big nose like this…

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.190
and the eyes, I noticed that with the eyes…

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.680
…very often he doesn't put the black dot in the eyes…

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:15.260
and that gives a kind of mysterious feel to the characters –
you don't get to know them immediately.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.000
Then the mouth is important.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.320
It's important because he tends to put this lump in the neck,
and if you do it yourself…

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.820
if you pout your lips slightly…

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.400
it changes the way you feel.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.140
And it works in the same way when you draw a cartoon illustration.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.750
It makes these people look low key the accept everything
that comes their way in life…

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.580
as they step over the obstacles on the winding path of life…

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.450
and it just makes them more credible.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.860
Morgan Gruffydd, in a pink party!

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.620
Oh, Rhian!

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.710
I wonder what you're doing right now?

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.840
It's not a very PC book, is it?
– No…

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.580
Is it important for us to have this kind of book in Welsh?

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.750
Very important!

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.930
I'm not a very PC man myself, but this book is honest, not PC…

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.590
it's honest, it's humorous, it's got credible characters…

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.160
it asks a lot of questions,
and those get discussed and answered.

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.970
The book lets you decide for yourself,
and it treats the reader like an adult…

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.890
and that's what life is all about,
treating people as intelligent individuals…

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:39.540
and allowing them to make up their own minds.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.280
I think this is the kind of book…

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.360
…that people will pick up…

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.360
and will either want to read…

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.690
or certainly not want to read it!

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.040
It's not a book for young readers…

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.770
it's certainly not a children's book,

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.680
on the back cover it says it's for mature readers,

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.800
you need to be mature…

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.700
you need a health sense of humour to appreciate the book.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.910
I don't expect religious newspapers will review the book…

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:13.200
You know what?
You gay boys have much more fun than us straight guys!

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.600
Why do you say that? Take your coat off.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.720
Because you gays don't have a problem with women, do you?

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.000
