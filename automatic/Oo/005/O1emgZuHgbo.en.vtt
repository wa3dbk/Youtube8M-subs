00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
was hoping to try to maybe get a few

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.920 
was hoping to try to maybe get a few
pieces<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.340> Thor<00:01:20.759> doing<00:01:21.570> my<00:01:21.689> best<00:01:22.369> I<00:01:23.369> can<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.450> go

pieces of Thor doing my best I can so go
from<00:01:25.140> there<00:01:25.320> hopefully<00:01:25.640> we<00:01:26.640> get<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.820> rare<00:01:27.150> see

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
from there hopefully we get a rare see

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.969 
from there hopefully we get a rare see
how<00:01:28.100> extremely<00:01:29.100> insane<00:01:29.579> rare<00:01:29.880> it<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.979> because

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
how extremely insane rare it is because

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.649 
how extremely insane rare it is because
he<00:01:32.070> doesn't<00:01:32.250> have<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.490> uncommon<00:01:32.939> he's<00:01:33.509> gonna

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
he doesn't have it uncommon he's gonna

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.230 
he doesn't have it uncommon he's gonna
be<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> lot<00:01:34.110> harder<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.650> get<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.100> you<00:01:35.939> really

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
be a lot harder to get and you really

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.550 
be a lot harder to get and you really
just<00:01:36.420> give<00:01:36.600> rare<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.869> epping<00:01:37.110> that's<00:01:37.290> really

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
just give rare in epping that's really

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.960 
just give rare in epping that's really
shot<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:37.920> as<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:38.250> see<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.640> don't<00:01:38.759> get

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
shot and as you can see you don't get

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.359 
shot and as you can see you don't get
too<00:01:39.180> many<00:01:39.329> rares<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.960> I'd<00:01:40.740> pretty<00:01:40.950> much<00:01:41.070> never

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
too many rares and I'd pretty much never

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.330 
too many rares and I'd pretty much never
get<00:01:41.579> epics<00:01:42.200> but<00:01:43.200> if<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.770> want<00:01:43.950> to<00:01:44.009> see<00:01:44.130> maybe

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
get epics but if you want to see maybe

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.569 
get epics but if you want to see maybe
