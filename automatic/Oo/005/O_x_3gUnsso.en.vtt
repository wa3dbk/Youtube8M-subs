higher<00:00:50.829> level<00:00:50.860> of<00:00:51.220> care<00:00:51.550> so<00:00:52.090> we<00:00:52.510> could<00:00:52.720> go<00:00:52.870> as

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
higher level of care so we could go as

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.350 
higher level of care so we could go as
far<00:00:53.320> as<00:00:53.590> you<00:00:54.190> know<00:00:54.309> Houston<00:00:54.850> to<00:00:55.000> pick<00:00:55.149> up<00:00:55.270> a

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
patient or Dallas Fort Worth or we could

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.110 
patient or Dallas Fort Worth or we could
go<00:00:57.520> for<00:00:57.940> it<00:00:58.030> to<00:00:58.500> hospital<00:00:59.500> as<00:00:59.590> closest

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
go for it to hospital as closest

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.430 
go for it to hospital as closest
Metroplex<00:01:01.120> and<00:01:01.270> clean<00:01:01.570> to<00:01:01.809> pick<00:01:01.960> up<00:01:02.110> children
