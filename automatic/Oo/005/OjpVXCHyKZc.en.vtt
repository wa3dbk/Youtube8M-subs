00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.440
 through the increasing use of 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.780
 Converters in combination with micro 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.270
 Electronics become the electromagnetic 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.890
 compatibility is increasingly important therefore 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.720
 It is already both devices and systems 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.730
 planning important the info too 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.660
 account 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:30.179
 Today I'll show you a g 120 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:34.620
 dmv just construction every construction 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:38.489
 divided into zones feeding same 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:43.940
 rail system power switch network 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:50.809
 protects power supply unit consisting of 120 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:54.469
 power module control unit terminal block 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.969
 and at the very bottom mv rail 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:01.079
 First I want the line from the 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.470
 socket area then the clothes line 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.570
 drop 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:08.479
 cut off the screen but about 1 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.400
 let stand centimeters 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:15.780
 the protruding screen over the 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.420
 Foreign trade will then come with a blow 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:24.750
 or rubber cover now seal with help 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:28.490
 a strap clamp the cable to the mv 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:33.329
 put rail and tighten firmly 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:36.950
 set down the line and on the for that 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.950
 Laying provided terminal strip 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:53.070
 now for engine performance first measures 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.450
 then stop the line 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.770
 and cut off the screen but about 5 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.770
 let stand cm 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:13.349
 Here, too, the beautiful for foreign trade 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.430
 berlin and with a comedy or 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:19.590
 smurf hose the end different 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:23.750
 so that about two inches from the screen 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.470
 Visible are with a hot air 55 loud 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.140
 shrinking small 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.959
 Now the line can be put on 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:36.330
 The included frame ties around the 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:44.660
 Cable bending and inters in the sheet metal 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:44.660
 hook in and tighten the screw 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:03:00.130
 Now the veins are deposed and with 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.130
 an address provided 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.710
 After that, the veins on the motor 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:12.760
 plug enlightened and the plug can 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.760
 be plugged again 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.700
 Now the line is in the cable channel 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.010
 professionally installed is on 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.450
 separate relocation between tax and 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.450
 lask tear to places 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:35.230
 at the end, the engine power with 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.230
 to relieve an ironing station 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.890
 at the signal lines is with the 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:47.180
 collars tie in the same way and 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.650
 wise procedure on good contact 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.110
 between frequency converter and 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.100
 pay attention to mounting plate 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.050
 important to mention is that 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.320
 between inverter and mounting plate 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.230
 a large-area connection exists 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.830
 retrofit systems no varnished 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.630
 use mounting plates 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.130
 when settling the motor lines can 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.730
 proceed in the same way 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.490
 become 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.800
 it is important to mention that mv 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.780
 The prescriptions are used 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.870
 an optimal connection between screen 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.880
 and housing as you are now 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.580
 You can have seen under consideration 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.380
 some principles relatively easy one 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.250
 edv just install converters 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.250
 realize
