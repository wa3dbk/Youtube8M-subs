when I'm talking about home cooking I

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.649 
when I'm talking about home cooking I
think<00:01:47.100> that's<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.310> nice<00:01:47.460> way<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.299> I<00:01:48.390> think

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
think that's a nice way to and I think

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.749 
think that's a nice way to and I think
the<00:01:48.780> channel<00:01:49.140> but<00:01:49.470> there's<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.740> nice<00:01:50.070> sense<00:01:50.579> of

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
the channel but there's a nice sense of

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.969 
the channel but there's a nice sense of
obsessiveness<00:01:51.420> about<00:01:51.869> your<00:01:52.140> about<00:01:52.500> your<00:01:52.560> work

obsessiveness about your about your work

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.499 
obsessiveness about your about your work

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
as well which is great because it's a

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.780 
as well which is great because it's a
reader<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.930> think<00:01:55.320> she<00:01:56.130> really<00:01:56.430> knows<00:01:56.579> this

I think in the end it really comes down

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.350 
I think in the end it really comes down
to<00:02:28.080> you<00:02:28.350> reliable<00:02:28.709> recipe<00:02:29.370> sources<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.180> some

somebody or some you know publication

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.610 
somebody or some you know publication
that's<00:02:33.180> going<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.690> make<00:02:33.959> sure<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.470> works

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
that's going to make sure that it works

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.710 
that's going to make sure that it works
every<00:02:35.069> time<00:02:35.280> no<00:02:35.880> matter<00:02:36.000> what<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.390> do<00:02:36.569> and

every time no matter what you do and

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.840 
every time no matter what you do and

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
maybe anticipate the places where it

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.520 
maybe anticipate the places where it
might<00:02:39.060> be<00:02:39.270> weird<00:02:39.540> like<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.959> cake<00:02:40.170> batter

might look rough here or it might seem

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.330 
might look rough here or it might seem

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
and the kitchen was smaller but I

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.610 
and the kitchen was smaller but I
