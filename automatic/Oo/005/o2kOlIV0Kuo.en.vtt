00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
gameplay from an unreleased game so i

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.790 
gameplay from an unreleased game so i
guess<00:00:51.750> i<00:00:51.870> would<00:00:51.930> actually<00:00:52.260> have<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.649> get

guess i would actually have to get
permission<00:00:53.329> from<00:00:54.329> activision<00:00:54.930> or<00:00:55.079> somebody

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.010 
I've thought about it again since seeing
the<00:01:46.649> gameplay<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.479> haven't<00:01:48.479> been<00:01:48.600> keeping<00:01:48.810> up

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
the gameplay I haven't been keeping up

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.389 
the gameplay I haven't been keeping up
with<00:01:49.170> all<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> trailers<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.979> all<00:01:50.040> the<00:01:50.159> news

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
with all the trailers and all the news

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.649 
with all the trailers and all the news
and<00:01:50.790> stuff<00:01:50.939> like<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.149> I've<00:01:51.420> just<00:01:51.540> been

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
and stuff like that I've just been

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.719 
and stuff like that I've just been
looking<00:01:51.869> from<00:01:52.200> afar<00:01:52.500> I<00:01:52.560> did<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.979> news<00:01:53.220> thing<00:01:53.520> I

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
looking from afar I did the news thing I

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.480 
looking from afar I did the news thing I
did<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.540> breaking<00:01:54.930> news<00:01:55.140> race<00:01:55.439> with<00:01:55.740> with<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
did the breaking news race with with the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.310 
did the breaking news race with with the
lead<00:01:56.670> up<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.850> modern<00:01:57.090> warfare<00:01:57.360> 3<00:01:57.600> N<00:01:58.049> and

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
lead up to modern warfare 3 N and

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.929 
lead up to modern warfare 3 N and
through<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> good<00:01:59.070> portion<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.610> lifespan

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
through a good portion of the lifespan

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.520 
through a good portion of the lifespan
of<00:02:00.060> modern<00:02:00.360> warfare<00:02:00.509> 3<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:00.990> decided<00:02:01.320> it

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
of modern warfare 3 and I decided it

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.580 
of modern warfare 3 and I decided it
just<00:02:02.090> it's<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.180> not<00:02:03.390> my<00:02:03.570> thing<00:02:03.600> at<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.140> ed

at<00:02:04.860> this<00:02:05.040> point<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.430> game<00:02:05.460> maybe<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:06.000> will

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
at this point in the game maybe it will

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.580 
at this point in the game maybe it will
be<00:02:06.149> maybe<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.630> while<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.930> don't<00:02:07.079> know<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.439> is

another video about hype we say this
every<00:03:31.690> year<00:03:31.840> that<00:03:32.169> the<00:03:32.290> that<00:03:32.709> it<00:03:32.829> seems<00:03:33.129> as

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
every year that the that it seems as

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.670 
every year that the that it seems as
though<00:03:33.340> they're<00:03:33.669> trying<00:03:33.970> to<00:03:34.120> innovate<00:03:34.680> but

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680

this<00:03:35.949> year<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:37.150> is<00:03:37.449> as<00:03:37.629> though<00:03:37.870> they<00:03:38.319> have

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
this year it it is as though they have

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.180 
this year it it is as though they have
significantly<00:03:39.879> revamped<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.470> idea<00:03:41.859> of<00:03:42.099> a

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
significantly revamped the idea of a

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.550 
significantly revamped the idea of a
perk<00:03:42.489> system<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.180> they've<00:03:43.989> done<00:03:44.230> away<00:03:44.530> with

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
perk system and they've done away with

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.729 
perk system and they've done away with
the<00:03:45.160> the<00:03:45.639> traditional<00:03:46.480> tiered<00:03:46.930> system<00:03:47.349> that

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
the the traditional tiered system that

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:49.890 
the the traditional tiered system that
we<00:03:47.859> have<00:03:48.010> used<00:03:48.220> in<00:03:48.760> call<00:03:49.090> of<00:03:49.120> duty<00:03:49.269> since<00:03:49.720> the

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
we have used in call of duty since the

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.990 
we have used in call of duty since the
days<00:03:50.079> of<00:03:50.199> call<00:03:50.410> of<00:03:50.440> duty<00:03:50.680> 4<00:03:51.010> modern<00:03:51.040> warfare<00:03:51.370> up

until the most recent modern warfare 3

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.949 
until the most recent modern warfare 3
we've<00:03:54.609> we've<00:03:54.970> seen<00:03:55.209> that<00:03:55.299> a<00:03:55.359> constant<00:03:55.750> C<00:03:55.870> 1<00:03:56.079> 2<00:03:56.739> 3

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
we've we've seen that a constant C 1 2 3

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.809 
we've we've seen that a constant C 1 2 3
4<00:03:58.959> 5<00:03:59.260> we've<00:03:59.500> seen<00:03:59.709> that<00:03:59.829> across<00:04:00.129> six<00:04:00.489> titles

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
4 5 we've seen that across six titles

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.240 
4 5 we've seen that across six titles
six<00:04:01.239> call<00:04:01.510> of<00:04:01.629> duty<00:04:01.810> titles<00:04:02.139> and<00:04:02.260> it<00:04:02.769> seems<00:04:03.040> as

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
six call of duty titles and it seems as

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.979 
six call of duty titles and it seems as
though<00:04:03.280> they<00:04:03.549> have<00:04:03.639> significantly<00:04:04.480> revamped

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
though they have significantly revamped

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.180 
though they have significantly revamped
it<00:04:05.199> not<00:04:05.440> added<00:04:06.220> gun<00:04:06.519> proficiencies<00:04:07.299> like<00:04:07.870> a

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
it not added gun proficiencies like a

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:11.699 
it not added gun proficiencies like a
like<00:04:09.190> infinity<00:04:09.729> ward<00:04:09.940> /<00:04:10.150> /<00:04:10.959> sledgehammer<00:04:11.440> did

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
like infinity ward / / sledgehammer did

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.860 
like infinity ward / / sledgehammer did
with<00:04:12.190> modern<00:04:12.519> warfare<00:04:12.699> 3<00:04:12.909> but<00:04:13.269> significantly

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
with modern warfare 3 but significantly

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.509 
with modern warfare 3 but significantly
revamped<00:04:14.349> it<00:04:14.560> to<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:14.739> point<00:04:15.069> that<00:04:15.159> where<00:04:15.430> it

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
revamped it to the point that where it

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.399 
revamped it to the point that where it
could<00:04:15.790> be<00:04:15.970> innovative<00:04:16.570> again<00:04:16.810> I<00:04:16.840> can't<00:04:17.169> say

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:17.409 
could be innovative again I can't say

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:18.509 
could be innovative again I can't say
