00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.410
 went good afternoon after mounting the window we 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.530
 We meet with the problem of how we finish 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:15.030
 this window is outside the building means window 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.660
 mounts guys differently correctly 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:22.039
 There is a case when but flush that 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.600
 there is exactly the wall surface 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.750
 We have a foam that must be protected from 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.349
 light from moisture and so on I want you 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.180
 to offer 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.450
 flashings PVC plastic that is here 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.540
 his 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.570
 the product to which we are the whole thing and 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.960
 plan to close 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:46.140
 it means it is mounted on such here 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.829
 products called nipples to nipples 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.770
 the usual most ordinary black screw 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.750
 fasten the whole thing in the frame here with us 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.289
 on the stand all this is done to 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.620
 save your time here enshrined in 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.460
 frame 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.280
 nipple so that it does not take long 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.290
 it means that I could see everything clearly 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.570
 I 'll show you now how to mount means 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.930
 products are long 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.020
 six meters but since time we have 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.479
 limited we already slaughtered everything at an angle and 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.929
 Here I show you the installation means 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:27.969
 present all this is not a movie 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:31.810
 the latch flap in its cross section has 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:36.229
 so here it will probably be seen 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.770
 cavities under the peels he holds them 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.630
 nipple 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.759
 still in time you can put here 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.329
 wiring or tv cable what 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:47.689
 usually the whole thing is forgotten here 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:52.280
 we do it all on mount further 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:55.090
 trim the corners snap here 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.989
 here is what was seen here nipple 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:04.849
 here is a dock and dock with a simple click 

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:09.799
 close here is ready we have a window means 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:13.269
 framed on the little face and this is the case 

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:15.980
 difference from the adhesive itself on the rapist 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.799
 then it will not fall off after 1 through 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.560
 move 10 will be fixed on everything 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:24.099
 time means there are different 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.099
 width 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:34.110
 three main widths 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.030
 rapist that's about 38 for one 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.680
 wider leg 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:42.870
 goes 56 and goes further 78 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.580
 if you window is laminated it all in 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:52.830
 color is not a problem on the laminate 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:54.390
 further window for a penny on so 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.410
 flush mounted 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:01.470
 usually houses are all put in a quarter and we 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:05.120
 we have here such a thing that after 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:09.660
 mounting ugly want it somehow a 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.040
 noble means for this there is a corner 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:16.440
 platband 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:18.560
 here is such a he has a cross section for his 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.660
 mounting mounted start profile 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.910
 to save time again video 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.040
 lest it be too long we already 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.730
 the whole thing is mounted on ordinary 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.459
 self-tapping screws 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:35.040
 except this whole thing is mounted 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.950
 along the perimeter of the wall we mount again all those 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.450
 same nipple 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:44.400
 nipple and then install our 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:55.200
 you close the corner commander 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:56.040
 closes snaps on our corner 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.599
 all slaughtered 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.530
 to again video Daughter 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.989
 starting there is inserted and 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.739
 snap like that 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:10.859
 This is the old manâ€™s business for them 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:13.500
 you can see how it's all done here 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:16.169
 its time the question arises that when 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.510
 hitting the court of water the whole thing will go 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:26.910
 to the house there is no matter of it yet 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:29.099
 the abuser has inside a special drain 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.110
 so that the water does not remember going there further 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:38.039
 how much the whole thing if once 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:40.919
 falls runs down the drill means width 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:43.800
 This is from the course of the outside 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:49.979
 different and for this two profiles can 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:53.760
 let one wide this one here 90 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:57.770
 60 if that is not enough, that is 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:00.810
 180 large profile by 90 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.810
 and do all this if you want, you can 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:07.880
 watch everything in color 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:07.880
 so far so good
