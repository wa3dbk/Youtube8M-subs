00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
actually give it a be because i think is

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.020 
actually give it a be because i think is
supposed<00:06:11.100> to<00:06:11.160> do<00:06:11.280> what<00:06:11.460> it's<00:06:11.610> going<00:06:11.790> to<00:06:11.850> do

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:12.030 
supposed to do what it's going to do

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:17.540 
supposed to do what it's going to do
what<00:06:12.330> they<00:06:12.450> wanted<00:06:12.690> to<00:06:12.780> do<00:06:12.960> I<00:06:13.229> just<00:06:13.979> don't<00:06:16.550> for
