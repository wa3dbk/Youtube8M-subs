00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
Beth what specifically is different

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.960 
Beth what specifically is different
about<00:03:58.949> auto<00:03:59.400> nation<00:03:59.909> from<00:04:00.150> car<00:04:00.419> max<00:04:01.970> well

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
about auto nation from car max well

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.300 
about auto nation from car max well
certainly<00:04:03.359> it<00:04:03.449> offers<00:04:03.750> both<00:04:03.930> used<00:04:04.229> in<00:04:04.470> new

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
certainly it offers both used in new

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.479 
certainly it offers both used in new
vehicles<00:04:05.849> throughout<00:04:06.269> its<00:04:06.479> mix<00:04:06.720> but<00:04:07.489> it's

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
vehicles throughout its mix but it's

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.909 
vehicles throughout its mix but it's
also<00:04:08.760> dealing<00:04:09.659> with<00:04:09.810> many<00:04:10.470> more<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:10.799> those

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
also dealing with many more of those

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.159 
also dealing with many more of those
premier<00:04:11.459> lines<00:04:11.699> it<00:04:11.940> has<00:04:11.989> diversification<00:04:12.989> in

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
premier lines it has diversification in

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.370 
premier lines it has diversification in
sense<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.799> be<00:04:13.889> more<00:04:14.129> focused<00:04:14.609> on<00:04:15.049> that<00:04:16.049> new

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
sense to be more focused on that new

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.740 
sense to be more focused on that new
lineup<00:04:16.680> versus<00:04:17.280> that<00:04:17.459> used<00:04:17.789> the<00:04:18.209> company<00:04:18.630> has

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
lineup versus that used the company has

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.560 
lineup versus that used the company has
been<00:04:18.959> managing<00:04:19.469> itself<00:04:19.829> extremely<00:04:20.639> well<00:04:20.880> I

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
been managing itself extremely well I

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.210 
been managing itself extremely well I
think<00:04:21.750> that's<00:04:22.049> something<00:04:22.349> that's<00:04:22.529> very

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
think that's something that's very

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.890 
think that's something that's very
between<00:04:23.640> both<00:04:23.910> companies<00:04:24.300> is<00:04:24.600> that<00:04:24.630> they're

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
between both companies is that they're

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.600 
between both companies is that they're
very<00:04:24.930> concerned<00:04:25.590> about<00:04:25.710> that<00:04:25.890> bottom<00:04:26.430> line

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
very concerned about that bottom line

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:28.730 
very concerned about that bottom line
it's<00:04:26.850> not<00:04:27.000> necessarily<00:04:27.780> a<00:04:27.960> difference

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
it's not necessarily a difference

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.320 
it's not necessarily a difference
between<00:04:29.220> them<00:04:29.430> it's<00:04:29.970> that<00:04:30.180> they're

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
between them it's that they're

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.520 
between them it's that they're
approaching<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:30.900> market<00:04:31.230> through<00:04:31.500> a

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
approaching the market through a

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.270 
approaching the market through a
different<00:04:32.130> way<00:04:32.280> used<00:04:32.700> and<00:04:32.940> new<00:04:33.150> versus<00:04:33.630> used

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
different way used and new versus used

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.950 
different way used and new versus used
but<00:04:35.280> it's<00:04:35.430> how<00:04:35.640> they<00:04:35.970> are<00:04:36.120> paying<00:04:36.780> attention

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
but it's how they are paying attention

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.810 
but it's how they are paying attention
to<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.500> bottom<00:04:37.770> line<00:04:37.950> that<00:04:38.160> is<00:04:38.280> really<00:04:38.520> making

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
to the bottom line that is really making

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.490 
to the bottom line that is really making
them<00:04:38.940> successful<00:04:39.180> interesting<00:04:40.050> once<00:04:40.230> I<00:04:40.350> saw

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
them successful interesting once I saw

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.590 
them successful interesting once I saw
that<00:04:40.710> what<00:04:41.160> a<00:04:41.190> nation<00:04:41.550> right<00:04:42.060> now<00:04:42.210> I<00:04:42.240> think<00:04:42.450> on

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
that what a nation right now I think on

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.510 
that what a nation right now I think on
their<00:04:42.750> Lots<00:04:42.990> has<00:04:43.200> about<00:04:43.410> 30<00:04:43.770> percent<00:04:44.070> domestic

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
their Lots has about 30 percent domestic

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.940 
their Lots has about 30 percent domestic
vehicles<00:04:45.420> but<00:04:45.630> about<00:04:45.780> 70<00:04:46.260> percent<00:04:46.680> of<00:04:46.800> those

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
vehicles but about 70 percent of those

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.340 
vehicles but about 70 percent of those
vehicles<00:04:47.190> are<00:04:47.580> from<00:04:48.180> auto<00:04:48.450> manufacturers

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
an auto nation let's start with Mary

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.409 
an auto nation let's start with Mary
Beth<00:06:07.370> well<00:06:08.370> I<00:06:08.400> think<00:06:08.490> it<00:06:08.700> certainly<00:06:09.060> is<00:06:09.270> an

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:09.419 
Beth well I think it certainly is an

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:11.420 
Beth well I think it certainly is an
advantage<00:06:09.750> at<00:06:10.350> this<00:06:10.560> point<00:06:10.860> because<00:06:11.040> it<00:06:11.310> is

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
advantage at this point because it is

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.270 
advantage at this point because it is
worrying<00:06:11.729> too<00:06:11.940> towards<00:06:12.360> new<00:06:12.630> vehicles<00:06:13.280> there

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 
worrying too towards new vehicles there

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.890 
worrying too towards new vehicles there
is<00:06:14.430> an<00:06:14.580> opportunity<00:06:15.090> and<00:06:15.180> it<00:06:15.570> would<00:06:15.750> really

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
is an opportunity and it would really

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.159 
is an opportunity and it would really
depend<00:06:16.080> on<00:06:16.410> used<00:06:16.950> vehicles<00:06:17.490> as<00:06:17.700> to<00:06:18.169> what

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:19.169 
depend on used vehicles as to what

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:21.020 
depend on used vehicles as to what
percentage<00:06:19.650> of<00:06:19.740> the<00:06:19.860> population<00:06:20.010> of<00:06:20.610> vehicles

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
percentage of the population of vehicles

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.610 
percentage of the population of vehicles
that<00:06:21.180> car<00:06:21.360> Marx<00:06:21.630> has<00:06:21.810> would<00:06:22.140> actually<00:06:22.500> qualify

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
that car Marx has would actually qualify

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.360 
that car Marx has would actually qualify
under<00:06:23.130> those<00:06:23.370> rules<00:06:23.669> so<00:06:24.660> it<00:06:25.169> is<00:06:25.290> certainly<00:06:25.680> an

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
under those rules so it is certainly an

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.280 
under those rules so it is certainly an
advantage<00:06:26.940> for<00:06:27.120> auto<00:06:27.270> nation<00:06:27.660> at<00:06:27.840> this<00:06:27.990> point

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
advantage for auto nation at this point

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:31.130 
advantage for auto nation at this point
the<00:06:28.919> the<00:06:29.000> challenge<00:06:30.000> moving<00:06:30.360> it<00:06:30.660> down<00:06:30.900> the

the the challenge moving it down the

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.990 
the the challenge moving it down the
road<00:06:31.289> is<00:06:31.560> what<00:06:31.890> does<00:06:32.039> it<00:06:32.070> do<00:06:32.370> to<00:06:32.520> the<00:06:32.550> vehicle

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 
road is what does it do to the vehicle

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.610 
road is what does it do to the vehicle

and the repair industry down the road if

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.900 
and the repair industry down the road if
we<00:06:36.450> take<00:06:37.110> out<00:06:37.290> a<00:06:37.320> segment<00:06:37.890> of<00:06:37.950> the<00:06:38.550> vehicle

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:38.910 
we take out a segment of the vehicle

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.940 
we take out a segment of the vehicle
population<00:06:39.110> by<00:06:40.110> scrapping<00:06:40.440> those<00:06:40.740> vehicles

about<00:06:44.820> the<00:06:44.940> cash<00:06:45.090> for<00:06:45.300> clunkers<00:06:46.280> I'm<00:06:47.280> not<00:06:47.550> sure

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:47.790 
about the cash for clunkers I'm not sure

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:49.460 
about the cash for clunkers I'm not sure
what<00:06:48.030> to<00:06:48.150> make<00:06:48.330> of<00:06:48.360> it<00:06:48.570> yet<00:06:48.630> I'm<00:06:48.930> still<00:06:49.200> trying

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:49.470 
what to make of it yet I'm still trying

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:51.290 
what to make of it yet I'm still trying
to<00:06:49.590> wade<00:06:49.860> through<00:06:49.890> it<00:06:50.220> it<00:06:50.430> seems<00:06:50.910> like<00:06:51.090> there's

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
to wade through it it seems like there's

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.240 
to wade through it it seems like there's
a<00:06:51.390> lot<00:06:51.540> of<00:06:51.660> loopholes<00:06:52.110> it's<00:06:52.680> going<00:06:52.920> to<00:06:52.980> be<00:06:53.100> very

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:53.250 
a lot of loopholes it's going to be very

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.040 
a lot of loopholes it's going to be very
complicated<00:06:53.640> it<00:06:54.240> will<00:06:54.330> probably<00:06:54.720> get<00:06:54.810> more

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.050 
complicated it will probably get more

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.640 
complicated it will probably get more
complicated<00:06:55.500> as<00:06:55.860> it<00:06:56.040> goes<00:06:57.110> but<00:06:58.110> I<00:06:58.170> don't

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
complicated as it goes but I don't

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.110 
complicated as it goes but I don't
really<00:06:58.830> have<00:06:59.040> a<00:06:59.070> problem<00:06:59.370> with<00:06:59.580> it<00:06:59.700> including

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 
really have a problem with it including

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.020 
really have a problem with it including
used<00:07:00.330> cars<00:07:00.630> I<00:07:00.810> guess<00:07:01.020> if<00:07:01.350> the<00:07:01.560> goal<00:07:01.800> is<00:07:02.070> to<00:07:02.340> to

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.030 
used cars I guess if the goal is to to

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.620 
used cars I guess if the goal is to to
use<00:07:03.660> less<00:07:03.900> oil<00:07:04.280> if<00:07:05.280> you<00:07:05.550> trade<00:07:05.850> in<00:07:06.060> your<00:07:06.240> 18

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630 
use less oil if you trade in your 18

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.020 
use less oil if you trade in your 18

that gets 35 miles to the gallon why
isn't<00:07:11.760> that<00:07:11.880> okay<00:07:12.290> interesting

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 
isn't that okay interesting
