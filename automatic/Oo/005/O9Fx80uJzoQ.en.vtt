Alex<00:01:50.430> Rafael<00:01:50.729> at<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.970> end<00:01:51.090> as<00:01:51.240> well<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.540> know

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
Alex Rafael at the end as well you know

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.899 
Alex Rafael at the end as well you know

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
if suppose you spent 85 minutes

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.090 
if suppose you spent 85 minutes
defending<00:01:54.869> high<00:01:55.020> balls<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.500> then<00:01:55.619> we've<00:01:55.979> am

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
defending high balls and then we've am

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.039 
defending high balls and then we've am
organic<00:01:56.430> well<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.180> know<00:01:57.299> what's<00:01:57.509> coming<00:01:57.810> home

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
organic well you know what's coming home

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.510 
organic well you know what's coming home
especially<00:01:58.500> required<00:01:58.979> if<00:01:59.130> they've<00:01:59.250> got<00:01:59.340> the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
especially required if they've got the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.160 
especially required if they've got the
the<00:01:59.759> personnel<00:02:00.210> up<00:02:00.329> front<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.600> thrive<00:02:01.140> on

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the personnel up front that thrive on

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.170 
the personnel up front that thrive on
that<00:02:01.350> sort<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.710> service<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.250> like<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:02.880> said<00:02:03.030> I

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
that sort of service and like I said I

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.940 
that sort of service and like I said I
think<00:02:03.270> as<00:02:03.540> a<00:02:03.570> defense<00:02:03.930> we<00:02:04.110> perform<00:02:04.680> very<00:02:04.890> well

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
think as a defense we perform very well

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.580 
think as a defense we perform very well
with<00:02:05.340> Thomas<00:02:05.640> Darren<00:02:06.140> managed<00:02:07.140> another<00:02:07.320> for

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
with Thomas Darren managed another for

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.169 
with Thomas Darren managed another for
any<00:02:07.710> threat<00:02:07.950> they<00:02:08.069> had<00:02:08.190> be<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.729> very<00:02:08.910> different

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
any threat they had be a very different

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.040 
any threat they had be a very different
threat<00:02:09.599> on<00:02:09.780> Tuesday<00:02:10.289> higher<00:02:10.410> Bournemouth

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
threat on Tuesday higher Bournemouth

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.650 
threat on Tuesday higher Bournemouth
very<00:02:11.800> much<00:02:11.950> like<00:02:12.160> we<00:02:12.280> saw<00:02:12.310> ham<00:02:12.790> how<00:02:13.540> they

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
very much like we saw ham how they

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.110 
very much like we saw ham how they

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
played against this last time and

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.370 
played against this last time and
technically<00:02:16.120> at<00:02:16.330> a<00:02:16.360> very<00:02:16.720> good<00:02:16.900> side<00:02:17.140> and

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
technically at a very good side and

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.590 
technically at a very good side and
certainly<00:02:17.980> different<00:02:18.310> 22<00:02:18.880> saw<00:02:19.030> what<00:02:19.240> we<00:02:19.390> face
