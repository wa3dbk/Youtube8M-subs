this<00:00:35.019> was<00:00:35.350> used<00:00:36.089> heavily<00:00:37.089> in<00:00:37.359> the<00:00:38.260> last<00:00:38.949> World

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
this was used heavily in the last World

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.149 
this was used heavily in the last World
Cup<00:00:39.579> that<00:00:39.609> just<00:00:39.999> went<00:00:40.149> by<00:00:40.239> in<00:00:40.600> 2014<00:00:41.409> so<00:00:41.679> it's

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:42.159 
Cup that just went by in 2014 so it's

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:43.829 
Cup that just went by in 2014 so it's
it's<00:00:42.609> pretty<00:00:42.879> sweet<00:00:43.300> I<00:00:43.329> mean<00:00:43.629> it's<00:00:43.719> really

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
it's pretty sweet I mean it's really

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:45.840 
it's pretty sweet I mean it's really
cool<00:00:44.050> now<00:00:44.530> they<00:00:44.739> don't<00:00:44.949> have<00:00:45.159> all<00:00:45.609> of<00:00:45.640> the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
cool now they don't have all of the

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.360 
cool now they don't have all of the
games<00:00:46.239> in<00:00:46.510> one<00:00:46.749> stadium<00:00:47.170> I<00:00:47.229> think<00:00:47.499> it's<00:00:47.979> all<00:00:48.219> in

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
games in one stadium I think it's all in

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.369 
games in one stadium I think it's all in
one<00:00:48.519> country<00:00:48.729> obviously<00:00:48.999> Brazil<00:00:49.539> hosted<00:00:49.989> this

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
one country obviously Brazil hosted this

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.369 
one country obviously Brazil hosted this
year's<00:00:50.649> World<00:00:50.920> Cup<00:00:51.010> but<00:00:51.819> I<00:00:52.210> think<00:00:53.109> they<00:00:53.229> use

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
year's World Cup but I think they use

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:54.840 
year's World Cup but I think they use
something<00:00:53.710> like<00:00:53.829> 12<00:00:54.129> stadiums<00:00:54.579> and<00:00:54.729> this

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 
something like 12 stadiums and this

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.360 
something like 12 stadiums and this
isn't<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.239> main<00:00:55.539> one<00:00:55.839> the<00:00:56.049> main<00:00:56.289> one<00:00:56.530> was<00:00:57.129> in

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
isn't the main one the main one was in

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.520 
isn't the main one the main one was in
Rio<00:00:57.549> de<00:00:57.760> Janeiro<00:00:58.149> where<00:00:58.659> the<00:00:58.749> finals<00:00:59.139> were<00:00:59.289> but

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
Rio de Janeiro where the finals were but

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.919 
Rio de Janeiro where the finals were but
this<00:00:59.739> one<00:00:59.949> held<00:01:00.249> a<00:01:00.489> semifinal<00:01:01.420> match<00:01:01.569> so<00:01:01.780> it's

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:01.929 
this one held a semifinal match so it's

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:03.660 
this one held a semifinal match so it's
pretty<00:01:02.440> awesome<00:01:02.620> I<00:01:02.920> mean<00:01:03.069> it's<00:01:03.280> it's<00:01:03.579> really

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
pretty awesome I mean it's it's really

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.300 
pretty awesome I mean it's it's really
cool<00:01:03.999> so<00:01:04.239> yeah<00:01:04.870> this<00:01:05.110> is<00:01:05.320> basically<00:01:05.860> it<00:01:06.100> it's

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
cool so yeah this is basically it it's

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.649 
cool so yeah this is basically it it's
basically<00:01:06.729> it's<00:01:06.909> one<00:01:07.090> of<00:01:07.180> the<00:01:07.270> I<00:01:07.360> think<00:01:07.390> it's

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:07.659 
basically it's one of the I think it's

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:08.639 
basically it's one of the I think it's
the<00:01:07.719> second-biggest

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
the second-biggest

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:11.039 
the second-biggest
Stadium<00:01:09.369> in<00:01:09.490> Brazil<00:01:09.850> of<00:01:10.060> course<00:01:10.299> the<00:01:10.630> rio<00:01:10.840> de

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
Stadium in Brazil of course the rio de

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:12.539 
Stadium in Brazil of course the rio de
janeiro<00:01:11.350> one<00:01:11.590> is<00:01:11.829> a<00:01:11.860> little<00:01:12.039> bigger<00:01:12.280> that's

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
janeiro one is a little bigger that's

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.149 
janeiro one is a little bigger that's
why<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.700> final<00:01:13.240> there<00:01:13.600> but<00:01:14.289> I'm<00:01:14.770> not<00:01:14.920> sure

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:15.159 
why the final there but I'm not sure

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:16.649 
why the final there but I'm not sure
exactly<00:01:15.490> what<00:01:15.759> I'm<00:01:15.850> just<00:01:16.030> assuming<00:01:16.270> that<00:01:16.450> this

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
exactly what I'm just assuming that this

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.109 
exactly what I'm just assuming that this
is<00:01:16.840> probably<00:01:17.140> one<00:01:17.530> of<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.649> top<00:01:17.920> three<00:01:18.189> largest

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
is probably one of the top three largest

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.649 
is probably one of the top three largest
stadiums<00:01:19.570> in<00:01:19.750> Brazil<00:01:20.020> it<00:01:20.140> holds<00:01:20.649> like<00:01:21.659> 60,000

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
stadiums in Brazil it holds like 60,000

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.779 
stadiums in Brazil it holds like 60,000
people<00:01:22.810> I<00:01:23.079> think<00:01:23.320> just<00:01:23.619> under<00:01:23.890> 60,000<00:01:24.579> maybe<00:01:24.729> a

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789 
people I think just under 60,000 maybe a

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.300 
people I think just under 60,000 maybe a
few<00:01:24.969> under<00:01:25.240> so<00:01:25.930> it's<00:01:26.140> really<00:01:26.469> cool<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:27.039> it's

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
few under so it's really cool and it's

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.190 
few under so it's really cool and it's
one<00:01:27.460> of<00:01:27.520> the<00:01:27.579> most<00:01:27.729> iconic<00:01:27.850> ones<00:01:28.390> its<00:01:28.570> brand

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
one of the most iconic ones its brand

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.840 
one of the most iconic ones its brand
new<00:01:29.350> it's<00:01:29.380> got<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:29.740> little<00:01:29.950> like<00:01:30.189> arch<00:01:30.460> thingy

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
new it's got a little like arch thingy

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.510 
new it's got a little like arch thingy
over<00:01:31.090> here<00:01:31.420> on<00:01:31.659> both<00:01:31.869> sides<00:01:31.899> and<00:01:32.469> yeah<00:01:33.340> it's

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
over here on both sides and yeah it's

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.830 
over here on both sides and yeah it's
pretty<00:01:33.579> epic<00:01:33.880> so<00:01:34.119> I'm<00:01:34.210> gonna<00:01:34.299> go<00:01:34.420> and<00:01:34.570> you<00:01:34.659> guys

pretty epic so I'm gonna go and you guys

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.910 
pretty epic so I'm gonna go and you guys
a<00:01:34.869> little<00:01:35.049> bit<00:01:35.200> of<00:01:35.289> a<00:01:35.350> tour<00:01:35.590> now<00:01:35.770> this

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
a little bit of a tour now this

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.969 
a little bit of a tour now this
obviously<00:01:36.130> is<00:01:36.759> a<00:01:37.270> Minecraft<00:01:38.200> replica<00:01:38.679> so<00:01:38.829> this

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
obviously is a Minecraft replica so this

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.440 
obviously is a Minecraft replica so this
probably<00:01:39.250> wouldn't<00:01:39.520> hold<00:01:39.670> on<00:01:39.880> you<00:01:40.149> know<00:01:40.179> what

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
probably wouldn't hold on you know what

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.870 
probably wouldn't hold on you know what
this<00:01:41.380> probably<00:01:41.710> would<00:01:41.979> hold<00:01:42.159> a<00:01:42.250> few<00:01:42.460> thousand

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
this probably would hold a few thousand

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.609 
this probably would hold a few thousand
Steve's<00:01:43.119> it<00:01:43.899> could<00:01:44.049> probably<00:01:44.200> fit<00:01:44.380> a<00:01:44.439> few

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
Steve's it could probably fit a few

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.739 
Steve's it could probably fit a few
thousand<00:01:45.039> season<00:01:45.340> here<00:01:45.460> maybe<00:01:45.609> not<00:01:45.880> 60,000

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:46.749 
thousand season here maybe not 60,000

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:49.889 
thousand season here maybe not 60,000
but<00:01:46.899> yeah<00:01:47.799> so<00:01:48.130> it<00:01:48.460> basically<00:01:48.700> threw<00:01:49.630> out<00:01:49.689> the

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
but yeah so it basically threw out the

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.929 
but yeah so it basically threw out the
back<00:01:50.140> of<00:01:50.350> this<00:01:50.469> it's<00:01:50.710> not<00:01:50.979> too<00:01:51.369> heavily

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:51.939 
back of this it's not too heavily

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.090 
back of this it's not too heavily
decorated<00:01:52.149> I'm<00:01:52.570> not<00:01:52.719> sure<00:01:53.020> what<00:01:53.499> the<00:01:53.590> actual

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100

that there isn't any parking or anything

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:08.219 
that there isn't any parking or anything
which<00:02:07.210> is<00:02:07.240> a<00:02:07.479> little<00:02:07.749> bit<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:07.899> a<00:02:07.960> bummer<00:02:08.140> but

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
which is a little bit of a bummer but

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.840 
which is a little bit of a bummer but
that<00:02:08.470> would<00:02:08.560> have<00:02:08.590> been<00:02:08.710> cool<00:02:09.009> um<00:02:09.190> but<00:02:09.700> out

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
that would have been cool um but out

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.000 
that would have been cool um but out
here<00:02:09.880> it's<00:02:10.360> actually<00:02:10.570> ground<00:02:11.170> level<00:02:11.620> out<00:02:11.740> here

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
here it's actually ground level out here

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.970 
here it's actually ground level out here
so<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.640> actual<00:02:13.240> arm<00:02:13.830> pit

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
so the actual arm pit

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.589 
so the actual arm pit
where<00:02:15.069> they<00:02:15.159> actually<00:02:15.340> would<00:02:15.730> play<00:02:16.000> soccer<00:02:16.390> is

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
where they actually would play soccer is

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.720 
where they actually would play soccer is
actually<00:02:16.930> underground<00:02:17.409> which<00:02:18.159> is<00:02:18.489> pretty

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
actually underground which is pretty

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:19.979 
actually underground which is pretty
cool<00:02:18.940> not<00:02:19.090> sure<00:02:19.269> if<00:02:19.360> that's<00:02:19.450> accurate<00:02:19.750> to

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
cool not sure if that's accurate to

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:22.050 
cool not sure if that's accurate to
real-life<00:02:20.440> but<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.040> can<00:02:21.190> see<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.790> soccer

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
real-life but you can see the soccer

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.539 
real-life but you can see the soccer
field<00:02:22.360> is<00:02:22.599> down<00:02:22.780> here<00:02:23.230> and<00:02:23.379> the<00:02:24.010> actual<00:02:24.370> ground

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
field is down here and the actual ground

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:26.820 
field is down here and the actual ground
is<00:02:24.760> up<00:02:24.909> there<00:02:25.090> which<00:02:25.299> is<00:02:25.510> pretty<00:02:26.080> pretty<00:02:26.560> sweet

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
is up there which is pretty pretty sweet

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.610 
is up there which is pretty pretty sweet
so<00:02:27.280> yeah<00:02:27.940> it's<00:02:28.540> rich<00:02:28.840> it's<00:02:29.049> a<00:02:29.140> really<00:02:29.409> simple

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
so yeah it's rich it's a really simple

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.350 
so yeah it's rich it's a really simple
build<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.250> mean<00:02:30.549> there's<00:02:30.730> not<00:02:30.819> much<00:02:30.879> to<00:02:31.180> talk

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
build I mean there's not much to talk

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.670 
build I mean there's not much to talk
about<00:02:31.420> if<00:02:31.810> you<00:02:31.900> guys<00:02:32.019> want<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.349> check<00:02:32.379> it<00:02:32.590> out

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
about if you guys want to check it out

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.350 
about if you guys want to check it out
for<00:02:32.799> yourselves<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.459> would<00:02:33.940> definitely

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
for yourselves I would definitely

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.089 
for yourselves I would definitely
definitely<00:02:34.900> definitely<00:02:35.230> check<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.620> out<00:02:35.769> it<00:02:35.920> is

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099

really<00:02:36.129> really<00:02:36.549> cool<00:02:36.849> so<00:02:37.030> over<00:02:37.510> there<00:02:37.690> would

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
really really cool so over there would

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.449 
really really cool so over there would
be<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.200> benches<00:02:38.620> where<00:02:38.769> the<00:02:38.890> players<00:02:39.160> and

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
be the benches where the players and

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.850 
be the benches where the players and
coaches<00:02:39.910> or<00:02:40.180> managers<00:02:40.660> or<00:02:40.810> whatever<00:02:41.049> would<00:02:41.620> be

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
coaches or managers or whatever would be

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.069 
coaches or managers or whatever would be
the<00:02:42.280> trainers<00:02:42.700> and<00:02:42.910> all<00:02:42.970> that<00:02:43.150> stuff<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.629> then

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
the trainers and all that stuff and then

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.660 
the trainers and all that stuff and then
the<00:02:44.230> players<00:02:44.440> obviously<00:02:44.650> playing<00:02:45.400> some

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
the players obviously playing some

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.110 
the players obviously playing some
soccer<00:02:45.849> or<00:02:46.239> whatever<00:02:46.870> out<00:02:47.319> there<00:02:47.349> and<00:02:48.160> then<00:02:48.819> in

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
soccer or whatever out there and then in

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.850 
soccer or whatever out there and then in
here<00:02:49.480> it's<00:02:49.690> actually<00:02:50.170> pretty<00:02:50.410> cool<00:02:50.620> because

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
here it's actually pretty cool because

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.949 
here it's actually pretty cool because
he<00:02:51.610> did<00:02:51.849> go<00:02:52.000> into<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.209> little<00:02:52.329> bit<00:02:52.510> of<00:02:52.599> detail

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
he did go into a little bit of detail

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.690 
he did go into a little bit of detail
over<00:02:53.200> here<00:02:53.440> and<00:02:53.620> left<00:02:53.799> these<00:02:53.950> rooms<00:02:54.250> which<00:02:54.489> I

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
over here and left these rooms which I

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.449 
over here and left these rooms which I
would<00:02:55.090> assume<00:02:55.590> would<00:02:56.590> be<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.920> locker<00:02:57.099> rooms

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
would assume would be the locker rooms

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.240 
would assume would be the locker rooms
for<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:58.209> home-and-away<00:02:58.720> team<00:02:59.140> or<00:02:59.410> maybe<00:03:00.040> if

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
for the home-and-away team or maybe if

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.740 
for the home-and-away team or maybe if
there's<00:03:00.430> no<00:03:00.579> home<00:03:00.760> in<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:00.970> way<00:03:01.090> team<00:03:01.269> just<00:03:01.480> the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
there's no home in a way team just the

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.199 
there's no home in a way team just the
two<00:03:01.900> teams<00:03:02.170> that<00:03:02.290> are<00:03:02.379> playing<00:03:02.470> so<00:03:03.250> uh<00:03:03.760> yeah

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
two teams that are playing so uh yeah

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.670 
two teams that are playing so uh yeah
it's<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.750> fairly<00:03:05.140> fairly<00:03:07.140> simple<00:03:08.140> build<00:03:08.440> I<00:03:08.560> mean

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
it's a fairly fairly simple build I mean

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.960 
it's a fairly fairly simple build I mean
he<00:03:08.769> didn't<00:03:09.010> go<00:03:09.069> into<00:03:09.160> too<00:03:09.250> much<00:03:09.340> detail<00:03:09.609> but

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
he didn't go into too much detail but

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.690 
he didn't go into too much detail but
the<00:03:10.090> actual<00:03:10.420> build<00:03:10.780> itself<00:03:11.200> is<00:03:11.709> ginormous

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
the actual build itself is ginormous

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.869 
the actual build itself is ginormous
this<00:03:13.540> thing<00:03:13.720> is<00:03:13.900> massive<00:03:14.440> it's<00:03:14.890> crazy<00:03:15.370> how<00:03:15.670> big

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
this thing is massive it's crazy how big

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.490 
this thing is massive it's crazy how big
this<00:03:16.030> is<00:03:16.090> so<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:16.750> would<00:03:17.049> definitely<00:03:17.410> recommend

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
this is so I would definitely recommend

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.349 
this is so I would definitely recommend
checking<00:03:17.920> this<00:03:18.099> out<00:03:18.250> for<00:03:18.579> yourself<00:03:18.670> if<00:03:19.180> you

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
checking this out for yourself if you

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.479 
checking this out for yourself if you
are<00:03:19.510> into<00:03:20.260> some<00:03:20.500> savings<00:03:20.889> maybe<00:03:21.130> if<00:03:21.340> you're

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
are into some savings maybe if you're
