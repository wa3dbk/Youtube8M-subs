blow<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.539> rectifier<00:01:04.339> now<00:01:05.339> I'm<00:01:05.549> going<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.850> show

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
blow the rectifier now I'm going to show

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.780 
blow the rectifier now I'm going to show
you<00:01:06.030> how<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.510> test<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.860> system<00:01:08.040> with<00:01:08.640> an

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
you how to test the system with an

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.030 
you how to test the system with an
ohmmeter

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
ohmmeter

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.490 
ohmmeter
okay<00:01:11.040> so<00:01:11.100> I'll<00:01:11.460> turn<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.970> scale<00:01:12.479> twenty<00:01:13.290> ohms

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
okay so I'll turn the scale twenty ohms

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.240 
okay so I'll turn the scale twenty ohms
at<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.400> lowest<00:01:14.689> setting<00:01:15.890> they<00:01:16.890> what<00:01:17.100> we've

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
at the lowest setting they what we've

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.390 
at the lowest setting they what we've
looking<00:01:17.640> for<00:01:17.880> as<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.680> looking<00:01:19.680> for<00:01:19.860> two<00:01:20.070> blue

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
looking for as the looking for two blue

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.940 
looking for as the looking for two blue
wires<00:01:20.640> coming<00:01:21.060> out<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.630> top<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.170> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
wires coming out of the top of the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.460 
wires coming out of the top of the
cowling<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.270> it's<00:01:24.390> near<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.930> other<00:01:25.020> side<00:01:25.290> of

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
cowling so it's near the other side of

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.260 
cowling so it's near the other side of
this<00:01:27.200> okay<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.259> we'll<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:28.619> test<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.520> charging

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
this okay so we'll just test a charging

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.649 
this okay so we'll just test a charging
coil

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.520 

so<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.950> book<00:01:35.130> says<00:01:35.399> a<00:01:36.829> point<00:01:38.780> 0.13<00:01:39.780> so

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
so that the book says a point 0.13 so

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.069 
so that the book says a point 0.13 so
you<00:01:40.590> get<00:01:40.860> point<00:01:41.159> three<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:42.060> sits<00:01:42.750> within

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
you get point three so it sits within

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.429 
you get point three so it sits within
the<00:01:43.289> ballpark<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:45.600> charge<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.140> coils

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
the ballpark so the charge and coils

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.039 
the ballpark so the charge and coils
okay<00:01:46.829> in<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.149> must<00:01:48.360> be<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.570> rectifier

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
okay in this so it must be the rectifier

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.260 
okay in this so it must be the rectifier
so<00:01:49.679> we'll<00:01:49.890> get<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.280> rectify<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.729> out<00:01:50.939> and

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
so we'll get the rectify it out and

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.749 
so we'll get the rectify it out and
we'll<00:01:51.630> tear<00:01:51.869> stats<00:01:55.130> before<00:01:56.130> continuing<00:01:56.700> to

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
we'll tear stats before continuing to

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.359 
we'll tear stats before continuing to
test<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.420> rectifier<00:01:58.079> we'll<00:01:58.590> just<00:01:58.890> test<00:01:59.130> the

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
test the rectifier we'll just test the

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.090 
test the rectifier we'll just test the
fuse<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.970> fuse<00:02:00.360> holder<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:01.319> make<00:02:01.350> sure<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
fuse and fuse holder to make sure the

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.889 
fuse and fuse holder to make sure the
fuse<00:02:02.369> hasn't<00:02:02.729> blown<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.240> there's<00:02:03.479> no<00:02:03.630> wiring

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
fuse hasn't blown and there's no wiring

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:04.700 
fuse hasn't blown and there's no wiring
problems

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
problems

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.580 
problems
okay<00:02:05.670> we've<00:02:05.880> taken<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.420> rectifier<00:02:06.959> right<00:02:07.170> and

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
okay we've taken the rectifier right and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.400 
okay we've taken the rectifier right and
we're<00:02:07.890> just<00:02:08.009> going<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.429> test<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:09.110> if<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.229> say

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
we're just going to test it if you say

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.940 
we're just going to test it if you say
your<00:02:10.619> emitter<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.489> connectivity<00:02:12.150> or<00:02:12.769> the<00:02:13.769> very

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
your emitter to connectivity or the very

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.979 
your emitter to connectivity or the very
lowest<00:02:14.220> ohm<00:02:14.640> setting<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:20.280> tone<00:02:20.459> cannot

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
lowest ohm setting the tone cannot

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.750 
lowest ohm setting the tone cannot
connectivity<00:02:21.989> okay<00:02:22.799> so<00:02:22.860> there's<00:02:23.190> two<00:02:23.250> blue

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
connectivity okay so there's two blue

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.630 
connectivity okay so there's two blue
wires<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:25.019> green<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.500> red<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:26.190> two<00:02:26.400> blue

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
wires and a green and red the two blue

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.240 
wires and a green and red the two blue
wires<00:02:26.910> are<00:02:27.360> from<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.049> charger<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:29.040> green

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
wires are from the charger and the green

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.110 
wires are from the charger and the green
and<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.700> red<00:02:29.730> are<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.239> outputs<00:02:31.910> so<00:02:32.910> we'll

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
and the red are the outputs so we'll

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.160 
and the red are the outputs so we'll
first<00:02:33.329> test<00:02:33.690> did<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.410> green<00:02:35.310> at<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.720> green<00:02:36.989> a

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
first test did a green at the green a

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.020 
first test did a green at the green a
positive<00:02:38.069> ID<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.450> blue<00:02:40.230> negative<00:02:41.100> and<00:02:41.370> there's

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
positive ID to blue negative and there's

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.569 
positive ID to blue negative and there's
no<00:02:42.180> connectivity<00:02:43.019> and<00:02:43.260> if<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.100> then<00:02:44.280> do<00:02:44.459> it

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
no connectivity and if you then do it

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:50.330 
no connectivity and if you then do it
the<00:02:45.030> other<00:02:45.060> way<00:02:45.359> around<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:48.859> no<00:02:49.859> connectivity

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
the other way around and no connectivity

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.699 
the other way around and no connectivity
but<00:02:50.760> there<00:02:50.910> should<00:02:51.150> be<00:02:51.329> that<00:02:52.139> tells<00:02:52.380> me<00:02:52.590> this

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
but there should be that tells me this

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.050 
but there should be that tells me this
is<00:02:52.920> not<00:02:53.579> working

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
is not working

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.770 
is not working
the<00:02:54.840> other<00:02:55.109> thing<00:02:55.319> you've<00:02:55.470> got<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.769> do<00:02:55.920> is<00:02:56.220> the

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
the other thing you've got to do is the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.400 
the other thing you've got to do is the
blue<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.049> the<00:02:58.170> red<00:03:00.950> again<00:03:01.950> no<00:03:02.310> connectivity

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
blue and the red again no connectivity

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.090 
blue and the red again no connectivity
which<00:03:04.410> is<00:03:04.560> correct

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
which is correct

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.890 
which is correct
and<00:03:06.170> red<00:03:07.670> to<00:03:09.290> blue<00:03:10.880> and<00:03:11.880> of<00:03:12.180> course<00:03:12.420> that's<00:03:12.630> no

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
and red to blue and of course that's no

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.420 
and red to blue and of course that's no
connect<00:03:13.230> build<00:03:13.500> just<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.829> little<00:03:14.040> somebody

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
connect build just a little somebody

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.500 
connect build just a little somebody
with<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:15.150> positive<00:03:15.930> tester<00:03:16.709> a<00:03:16.970> pip<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.150> on<00:03:18.359> the

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
with a positive tester a pip it on the

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.379 
with a positive tester a pip it on the
green<00:03:18.810> and<00:03:19.139> the<00:03:19.859> negative<00:03:20.310> on<00:03:20.579> any<00:03:21.090> of<00:03:21.269> the

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
green and the negative on any of the

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.470 
green and the negative on any of the
Blues<00:03:21.600> and<00:03:21.989> you<00:03:22.410> should<00:03:22.590> get<00:03:22.739> no<00:03:22.889> connectivity

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
Blues and you should get no connectivity

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.140 
Blues and you should get no connectivity
then<00:03:24.480> put<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.780> positive<00:03:25.049> onto<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:26.030> and<00:03:27.030> the

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
then put the positive onto the and the

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.900 
then put the positive onto the and the
positive<00:03:27.720> wanted<00:03:28.139> blue<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.709> the<00:03:29.519> negative

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
positive wanted blue and the negative

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.370 
positive wanted blue and the negative
onto<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.359> green<00:03:30.569> and<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:31.049> should<00:03:31.260> get

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
onto the green and you should get

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.620 
onto the green and you should get
connectivity<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.670> in<00:03:32.880> the<00:03:33.060> same<00:03:33.299> with<00:03:33.480> the

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
connectivity and in the same with the

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.770 
connectivity and in the same with the
blue<00:03:33.900> in<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.170> red<00:03:35.120> okay<00:03:36.120> I'm<00:03:36.239> just<00:03:36.420> not<00:03:36.630> down

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
blue in the red okay I'm just not down

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.960 
blue in the red okay I'm just not down
to<00:03:36.989> map<00:03:37.170> ones<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.829> I<00:03:38.099> bought<00:03:38.310> this<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.519> little

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
to map ones and I bought this a little

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.110 
to map ones and I bought this a little
bit<00:03:39.389> rectifier<00:03:40.079> and<00:03:40.380> it's<00:03:40.920> like<00:03:41.220> four<00:03:41.639> pins<00:03:41.880> on

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
bit rectifier and it's like four pins on

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.059 
bit rectifier and it's like four pins on
it

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
it

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.780 
it
but<00:03:43.610> and<00:03:44.569> looking<00:03:44.930> at<00:03:45.080> it<00:03:45.260> you<00:03:45.349> think<00:03:45.790> which

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
but and looking at it you think which

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.240 
but and looking at it you think which
bins<00:03:47.090> go<00:03:47.360> on<00:03:47.510> we<00:03:47.780> are<00:03:47.930> so<00:03:48.650> we're<00:03:48.829> just<00:03:48.860> going<00:03:49.159> to

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
bins go on we are so we're just going to

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.280 
bins go on we are so we're just going to
go<00:03:49.400> over<00:03:49.549> that<00:03:49.700> in<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:50.120> moment<00:03:50.209> now<00:03:50.599> if<00:03:50.930> you<00:03:51.019> spot

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
go over that in a moment now if you spot

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.679 
go over that in a moment now if you spot
the<00:03:51.470> appendix<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.099> odd<00:03:52.250> one<00:03:52.459> out<00:03:52.579> that's<00:03:53.510> the

00:03:53.679 --> 00:03:53.689 
the appendix the odd one out that's the

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:57.309 
the appendix the odd one out that's the
positive<00:03:54.670> for<00:03:55.670> the<00:03:55.790> output<00:03:56.329> and<00:03:56.599> the<00:03:57.140> one

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
positive for the output and the one

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:00.250 
positive for the output and the one
diagonal<00:03:57.769> e<00:03:57.980> opposite<00:03:58.459> is<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:59.060> negative<00:03:59.540> for

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
diagonal e opposite is the negative for

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.569 
diagonal e opposite is the negative for
the<00:04:00.379> output<00:04:01.370> and<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:03.470> two<00:04:03.650> others<00:04:03.950> are<00:04:04.250> the

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
the output and the two others are the

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:10.089 
the output and the two others are the
input<00:04:05.030> wires<00:04:05.379> from<00:04:06.379> your<00:04:06.470> charging<00:04:07.040> coil<00:04:09.099> some

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
input wires from your charging coil some

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.509 
input wires from your charging coil some
will<00:04:10.549> have<00:04:10.760> a<00:04:10.790> little<00:04:11.000> a<00:04:11.299> cutout<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.519> others

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
will have a little a cutout and others

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:16.360 
will have a little a cutout and others
have<00:04:13.819> a<00:04:13.849> have<00:04:14.390> a<00:04:14.420> little<00:04:14.720> mark<00:04:14.930> that<00:04:15.370> signifies

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
have a have a little mark that signifies

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.240 
have a have a little mark that signifies
which<00:04:17.329> one<00:04:17.570> is<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:18.079> positive<00:04:18.949> terminal

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
which one is the positive terminal

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.450 
which one is the positive terminal
they're<00:04:20.209> fairly<00:04:20.600> easy<00:04:20.870> to<00:04:20.989> do<00:04:21.289> okay<00:04:22.280> we'll

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
they're fairly easy to do okay we'll

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:55.520 
they're fairly easy to do okay we'll
just<00:04:22.639> turn<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.120> wires

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:03.930 

so<00:04:56.530> just<00:04:56.890> solder<00:04:57.640> the<00:04:57.730> wires<00:04:57.940> in<00:05:01.680> go<00:05:02.790> last<00:05:03.790> one

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
so just solder the wires in go last one

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.610 
so just solder the wires in go last one
they<00:05:04.600> a<00:05:04.630> blue<00:05:04.960> wires<00:05:05.170> the<00:05:06.540> NP<00:05:07.540> wires<00:05:07.780> a<00:05:08.170> it

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
they a blue wires the NP wires a it

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.170 
they a blue wires the NP wires a it
doesn't<00:05:08.800> matter<00:05:09.040> which<00:05:09.310> we<00:05:09.520> rent<00:05:09.790> a<00:05:09.940> cool

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
doesn't matter which we rent a cool

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.370 
doesn't matter which we rent a cool
because<00:05:11.110> it's<00:05:11.470> alternating<00:05:11.830> current<00:05:13.080> okay<00:05:14.110> so

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
because it's alternating current okay so

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.580 
because it's alternating current okay so
the<00:05:14.560> red<00:05:15.160> is<00:05:15.520> the<00:05:16.120> positive<00:05:16.630> and<00:05:16.930> if<00:05:17.470> you

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
the red is the positive and if you

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.490 
the red is the positive and if you
remember<00:05:17.950> that's<00:05:18.100> the<00:05:18.340> one<00:05:18.490> that's<00:05:18.760> a

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
remember that's the one that's a

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.550 
remember that's the one that's a
definitely<00:05:20.500> different<00:05:21.180> different<00:05:22.180> side<00:05:22.560> so

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.560 
definitely different different side so

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.010 
definitely different different side so
we're<00:05:23.740> just<00:05:23.770> pushing<00:05:24.580> that<00:05:24.820> through<00:05:25.330> just

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
we're just pushing that through just

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:39.960 
we're just pushing that through just
sort<00:05:26.440> of<00:05:26.560> happened<00:05:26.980> please

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:53.930 

the<00:05:40.970> total<00:05:41.360> court<00:05:41.660> there

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:57.840 

and<00:05:54.940> I'm<00:05:55.060> the<00:05:55.210> green<00:05:55.450> puppy<00:05:56.730> when<00:05:57.730> the

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
and I'm the green puppy when the

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:07.999 
and I'm the green puppy when the
negative

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:08.009 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:45.029 

then<00:06:10.289> one<00:06:11.289> day<00:06:11.319> through

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:50.050 

hmm<00:06:46.990> this<00:06:47.990> is<00:06:48.289> just<00:06:48.680> a<00:06:48.740> case<00:06:48.889> of<00:06:48.949> put<00:06:49.550> that<00:06:49.820> back

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
hmm this is just a case of put that back

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.340 
hmm this is just a case of put that back
on
