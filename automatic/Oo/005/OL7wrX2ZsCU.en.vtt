00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
want to look on your breadcrumbs as a

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.300 
want to look on your breadcrumbs as a
lot<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.180> them<00:02:42.330> already<00:02:42.660> have<00:02:43.470> seasoning<00:02:44.160> in

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
lot of them already have seasoning in

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.820 
lot of them already have seasoning in
them<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.450> is<00:02:45.630> kind<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:45.960> going<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.440> depend

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
them so this is kind of going to depend

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.630 
them so this is kind of going to depend
on<00:02:47.070> what<00:02:47.790> kind<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.060> breadcrumbs<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.690> use<00:02:49.640> and

dry<00:03:04.470> green<00:03:05.130> beans<00:03:05.459> will<00:03:06.150> help<00:03:06.510> them<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:06.959> hold

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
dry green beans will help them to hold

on the egg and the breadcrumb mixture a
little<00:03:09.930> bit<00:03:10.140> better<00:03:10.440> my<00:03:11.280> green<00:03:11.550> beans<00:03:11.760> were

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970
