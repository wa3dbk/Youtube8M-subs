00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:08.290
 hey girls welcome to a new one 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:11.980
 video today we are going to record video about it 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:15.759
 well how you can be satisfied yourself 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.530
 and that is very important because you have you 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.040
 only one body and you have to 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.360
 to do 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.250
 and it's just very important that you 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.800
 thereby satisfied 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.750
 and such a thing where especially nuts 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.220
 girls have some difficulty with that 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.720
 but we have four tips for you how you 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.580
 not even on all my social TV 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.920
 that is that you should not mirror with 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.260
 So it's important that you just go to it 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.910
 you look at your self-esteem and you 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.440
 own standards and just does whole 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.940
 It is important that you do not go to others 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.899
 look at all that does it so 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.160
 maybe i'm not doing it right and yes 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:50.020
 what i feel it is a middle 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.399
 school that really annoys me 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.750
 competite with a my dear 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.760
 girlfriend than being dutch 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.190
 had a higher figure of environmental god than 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.050
 god sometimes an 8 that achieved so 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.390
 entrance just look at yourself and how 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.890
 you do and to your own ability because up 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.570
 for a moment you just go somebody 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.760
 otherwise a scrub is much better none 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.500
 nothing but where you actually are 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.880
 are not that good at all and 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.520
 therefore you feel that you are just you 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.840
 if you like if you like you have failed 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.340
 for example not 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.020
 but that doesn't mean you at all 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.550
 yourself that you are not good what 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.220
 maybe that's just way and so on 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.860
 you are your fit with your light led it 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.570
 Immediately top tip 2 to that is appoint for 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.560
 yourself things you are good at 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.030
 are up for it 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.070
 I am very good again and then I will be one 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.300
 good writing or I can learn quickly 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.710
 for instance 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.210
 well that is also very human that you 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.590
 are good at something and do something 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.510
 are not good at it 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.310
 so that it is just that something 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.100
 very important is a lot of girls 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.590
 maybe not know but not there 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.840
 good to stand still because everyone wants to 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.970
 anything is possible but I can do that with you 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.320

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.149
 image and the ideal image and everyone wants 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.250
 just mirror it 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.069
 must accept your own body that is 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.290
 and maybe you just have beautiful 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.670
 curves or you just have to go to yourself 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.860
 looking at what I found beautiful about myself 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.689
 and not how this is i suffered that is ugly 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.579
 but try to look right now 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:25.409
 just digest yourself from well me 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.819

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.459
 or no then you just have to learn more 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.140
 life and that is just that something 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.420
 you have to accept yourself you can only 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.030
 but you yourself are someone you can certainly 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.799
 from your family but you have to do that 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.269
 But it is important that you yourself 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.799
 accepts 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.970
 of course you also try it yourself 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.920
 done it once 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.590
 Go to the mirror and is going to look at 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.930

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.769
 I am 22 and I am at one point 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.819
 that I am really satisfied with my body 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.530
 not exactly as I would like it 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.629
 but I am happy with my curves and 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.459

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:09.510

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.090

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.040
 So what you just said just yes you should 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.079

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.549

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:48.840

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.090

 to the strip in the loot for a bit 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:09.090
 in a kind all my thought of it 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.889
 but there are only three people 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.740
 leftover now think something of seeming though 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.570
 three very good friends 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.740
 with much more valuable than people who 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.930
 only in school and beyond actually 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.739
 not no what was how many people we and there 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.739
 primary school anyway 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.530

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.850
 good friend who is slightly older sister 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.770
 on leaving in primary school 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.540
 actually when I was a group of six 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.520
 girls and then we are only two frugal 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.620
 of what also is very special 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.260
 often the thing is that you still take metro 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.750
 school idea dish then you say you about it 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:49.460
 gives with your own life and that that 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.320
 go ahead for me and then you give the good 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.880
 apart and you don't have to argue 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.920
 to go but 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.360
 but that 's just okay that's okay 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.300
 it is also important to accept 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.610
 and then you can let it go again 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.220
 so then you don't feel we all 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.470

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.000
