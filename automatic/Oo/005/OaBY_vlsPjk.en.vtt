00:00:01.499 --> 00:00:05.170
 hello hello welcome to all in your allow for 

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:08.349
 discover today the first entry-level 2 by clinical casing 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:12.819
 5 the shinobi a box that will be sold between 49 and 59 euros 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:15.839
 according to who turns a small window integrate 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.859
 so we'll go right first, we'll talk about finishing 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.519
 semolina it's very expensive used mixed so it's sweet under the 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.439
 fingers and it's pretty cool we also look at the level of design we have two 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.339
 mesh metal lines running across the goutier story to give 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.120
 a small latch starts at the best loose attack set to find 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.330
 also at the back here 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.150
 and not below we will be able to place 2 120 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.680
 millimeters or 2 140 millimeters further ahead we have the different 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.030
 you are a 10 ml price which has 4 usb for two hours 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.540
 diode of activity finally the pot rens and the real this season 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.760
 over a year before we find our three beasts his range 25 inches e-ink story 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.260
 to install readers 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.590
 dvd burner and the brand logo 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.810
 we received the model with the window so we find a window here form 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.420
 triangular 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.149
 with a location to add by fan in 130 millimeters 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.060
 it will be possible to remove the upper part by attracting but with three 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.060
 fingers it is not possible necessarily 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.410
 precisely the chassis we come to the back with 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.510
 a 92 '120 mm pitch with its fan 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.200
 the location of the apec that stammers me from the motherboard 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.399
 this extension note for die cards 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.760
 the two pass-walls 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.760
 and finally a feeding placement in the bar 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.680
 yet the substitute on the case 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.360
 we see 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.350
 the location of the feeding that filtered 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.690
 and not a place to vote the extra time in 120 140 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.700
 millimeters the filtered oci by cons we note that there is no tip for the 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.220
 moment but know that all members of our country are acolyte 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.429
 here it is there that it seems that it will arrive inside the case 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.259
 right away we go in 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:13.909
 the shinobi 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.049
 here we are now inside the shinobi the first thing that we 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:18.479
 notice is that of course 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:22.239
 the cable management and the party and so far since it is constant 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.489
 mandatory now we also have no broad access to the head of the state cp 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.640
 at the replacement program 150 millimeters of water we talked 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:34.380
 just now for that traditional fans 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.650
 in Mexico the three bays 5 25 inches a screwless mounting system in 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.650
 activity ap ap the top 5 25 3d 

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:46.879
 also available these were the different locations for them 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:47.749
 HDDs 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:49.389
 3 25 inches 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:54.139
 we have 2 3 4 5 6 7 eight locations in total which is pretty good for 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.139
 a case at this price with a disassembly mounting system 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.120
 its v6 gasoline tool that seems very practical and very functional 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.999
 in the back we find the fan of 120 millimeters we already spoke 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:10.029
 just now the different spots extension with mounting system speaks 

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:11.819
 from his hand 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.819
 and finally in the bottom the location 2 the power supply 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.519
 we finish with map can be drawn 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.189
 with precisely the main competition and small touches 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:23.009
 to avoid possible subsidies 

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:26.939
 and then the additional placement between 120 and 140 millimeters sequester it 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:30.639
 not below this is what we can say for the moment we reserve a little 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.729
 will complete soon we'll see you soon at the farm
