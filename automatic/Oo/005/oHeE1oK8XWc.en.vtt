 sometimes we pots outfit the young stink lack of 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.350
 sportsmanship I want variations in the elderly or in most cases this fails 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.810
 occurs due to manipulation intensity continuous motion during 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.810
 the use for an immediate solution 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.830
 the game has become hot in the fight and can be applied without dismantling the equipment 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:29.539
 It is worth remembering that it is an immediate solution soon after use. 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.879
 authorized technical assistance 

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:34.879
 This is one more tip of who leaves TV 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.100
 with alex speed with this with you here in de decides stevie 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.370
 hope that my

 the sergipe procedure 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.190
 then we'll talk a little bit about your territory that the state needs 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.120
 to know a vinyl simulator 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.400
 last Saturday after five or six athletes between the points you 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.400
 see this 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.200
 thor he actually 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.530
 when suffering 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:39.800
 which accompanies the collective and not for nothing which is a serious and daniel discount is 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.910
 We can manipulate 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.880
 with the teams with what's right 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.100
 first of all 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.580
 come back here 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.840
 We will love you first and second 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.480
 3rd worst fourth 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.800
 was france 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.360
 gave a click 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.300
 morning of the 15th 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.380
 5 abbas the first is that the configuration of aldo 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.100
 at 26 20 will leave a mood here 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.420
 he aldo accident in relation to the community will appear other 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.979
 options like curitiba and audio and two audi 3 and 4 

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:17.159
 but in the right way you can use it as a controller as 

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.989
 Vinyl simulator is to leave in shape 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.159
 amy audio the sp has to be long 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:28.199
 if you are going to use for example the 10 points to some other product wins 

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:30.660
 adepts that I have to leave as adultery 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.479
 but in our case we use as simulator 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:34.920
 the correct way 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.979
 external 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:39.029
 why we are going to use the indexes is not to download 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:43.739
 slowly will not use the mixer on a ground that it works here is the 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.649
 main teresa bottom and kieza came out winner 

00:02:47.649 --> 00:02:50.419
 the channels move in the times 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:53.879
 the deck that the seriousness of the left or in what concerns the view of the left 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:59.069
 we lost configured as analog audio with one and two art 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:00.760
 his tech 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.859
 will be on the way out 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:05.910
 there in everything that references 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.300
 to the channel still there of the plate being flexible and will extend 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.200
 click here 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.480
 the turntables 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.389
 listen to cpj 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.389
 sensitivity of colleagues you can operate here 

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:21.249
 Yes, because the pattern does not have this 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:24.649
 your response time going from here national 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:25.599
 the vinyl 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:27.140
 This is the third of the year. 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.769
 it was crucial for you to 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.489
 work right with access after 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.089
 This is where you will select the 

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:36.690
 What do you want to work with? 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.690
 this year against 11 we will leave as rs 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:42.649
 exactly because I'm going to use 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:45.749
 the controllers here places of worship and vinyl 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:48.420
 calibration becky art 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.859
 against toronto 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:55.599
 what kind of control of the lusa voice account of the generic is the vinyl cd 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.750
 in my case the vinyl part of the refis that carries an audi that already to facilitate 

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:01.059
 what 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:03.089
 The girl here for you. 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:04.989
 I'm going to put my reading here 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.029
 The fury 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:09.289
 he already shows that the speed with which the guava takata 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:14.790
 the position that is referred to that is the reader in the software itself 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:19.370
 as you will run into the team on the leukemia chart that the spectrum of 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.409
 audio it increases with those who are struggling 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.370
 here are eurides 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:27.460
 selective red is because there is something 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.870
 is wrong there or suddenly you turn the cables 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:34.370
 can be problem only casa tamar 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:37.410
 placed or even some liquid already 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.300
 you need an exchange for why these simulators 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:47.439
 if not only because all of them tarso if it occurs does not really have ocde 

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:50.560
 part of the headache will jump easily 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.040
 it may even occur to halt the final show of public accounts 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.630
 and for your safety 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.160
 also take the sedex and also with the leader have to watch in the ballad 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.199
 with the problem 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:06.169
 uncounter nantes reveal stj at least you do not compromise your work 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.210
 so this is this farce of the smart setup explained by 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.460
 service is to speak a little bit now from after the score in 5 in the strong group in the 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.610
 truth was not so malicious fry the radio it is called collective 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.210
 as well as the other pieces of evialis we have many points which is the 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.499
 controller awakened more 

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:29.559
 then this board that how the system works and has several cases 

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:30.479
 on here 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.599
 in fact you have already programmed a turntable 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:34.820
 already denise joke 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.729
 we have a correction here 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.099
 sp logo here takes computer 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:43.309
 the line entry 

00:05:43.309 --> 00:05:44.599
 1 and 2 

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:48.919
 that is the face of all the left and here I will jump with you and from here on the right 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:51.879
 which is 3 and 4 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:57.560
 they then that left part of the knife is the part of entry acronym in English 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:05:59.559
 that connects do not loose happy 

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:02.959
 the tutelary counselor what you were used to 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.319
 here we will dispute 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:09.460
 1 and 2 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.460
 gradually also 1 and 2 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:18.979
 before plating score and would be suffering because if you plug the sp 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:20.719
 not collective 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:23.490
 there on your machine and then install the software 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:27.680
 for you to send the author that opens a message will appear for the effect 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:32.620
 the art and tattoo that will not recognize baggy so that's it 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:35.319
 I hope you liked the idea 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:38.770
 tragically with the pide or there for you about the configuration 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.120
 our territory 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.310
 remembering here 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.770
 if purchased at the store vip equip our address www store bike shop 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.330
