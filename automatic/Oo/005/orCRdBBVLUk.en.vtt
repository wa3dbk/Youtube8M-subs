00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
hello and welcome back this is the

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.840 
hello and welcome back this is the
lesson<00:00:04.470> 2<00:00:04.680> of<00:00:04.950> computer<00:00:05.490> programming

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
lesson 2 of computer programming

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.540 
lesson 2 of computer programming
concepts<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:06.720> computer<00:00:06.870> programming<00:00:07.440> in<00:00:07.799> the

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
concepts of computer programming in the

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.770 
concepts of computer programming in the
first<00:00:08.940> video<00:00:09.269> we<00:00:09.809> explained<00:00:10.650> what<00:00:11.240> a<00:00:12.240> computer

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
first video we explained what a computer

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.010 
first video we explained what a computer
program<00:00:13.170> really<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.759> and<00:00:14.759> after<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.570> in<00:00:15.870> this

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
program really is and after that in this

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.260 
program really is and after that in this
video<00:00:16.350> we're<00:00:16.560> going<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.710> talk<00:00:16.830> about<00:00:17.029> what<00:00:18.029> is

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
video we're going to talk about what is

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.980 
video we're going to talk about what is
really<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:19.199> programming<00:00:20.010> language<00:00:20.270> ok<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.539> if

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
really a programming language ok and if

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.599 
really a programming language ok and if
you<00:00:22.020> haven't<00:00:22.289> check<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.890> previous<00:00:23.250> video

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
you haven't check the previous video

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.310 
you haven't check the previous video
then<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.330> need<00:00:24.449> to<00:00:24.570> check<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.900> previous

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
then you need to check the previous

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.310 
then you need to check the previous
video<00:00:25.560> first<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.070> then<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.880> one<00:00:27.289> so<00:00:28.289> check

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
video first and then this one so check

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.660 
video first and then this one so check
the<00:00:28.529> lesson<00:00:28.800> one<00:00:28.949> first<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.310> then<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:29.609> one

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
the lesson one first and then this one

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.990 
the lesson one first and then this one
so<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:31.109> problem<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.590> now<00:00:31.769> what<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.669> a

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
so the problem is now what is a

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.630 
so the problem is now what is a
programming<00:00:33.809> language<00:00:34.070> well<00:00:35.070> interesting

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
programming language well interesting

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.940 
programming language well interesting
question<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.870> order<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.350> understand<00:00:37.860> a

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
question in order to understand a

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.380 
question in order to understand a
programming<00:00:38.340> language<00:00:38.399> first<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.120> all<00:00:39.239> we

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
programming language first of all we

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.450 
programming language first of all we
need<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.570> understand<00:00:40.020> what<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.739> really<00:00:41.340> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
need to understand what is really a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.889 
need to understand what is really a
language<00:00:42.110> yes<00:00:43.670> this<00:00:44.670> seems<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.270> silly<00:00:45.450> question

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
language yes this seems a silly question

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.080 
language yes this seems a silly question
but<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.260> really<00:00:46.559> an<00:00:47.280> important<00:00:47.700> question<00:00:47.820> in

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
but it's really an important question in

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.660 
but it's really an important question in
order<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.390> understand<00:00:48.780> this<00:00:49.280> suppose<00:00:50.280> there

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
order to understand this suppose there

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.090 
order to understand this suppose there
are<00:00:50.700> two<00:00:51.120> persons<00:00:51.570> -<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.199> person<00:00:52.469> more<00:00:52.829> and

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
are two persons - this person more and

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.660 
are two persons - this person more and
this<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.579> person<00:00:53.969> 2<00:00:54.770> so<00:00:55.770> language<00:00:56.219> is

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
this is person 2 so language is

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.330 
this is person 2 so language is
basically<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.710> medium<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.949> communication

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
basically a medium of communication

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.490 
basically a medium of communication
between<00:01:00.300> these<00:01:00.809> two<00:01:00.870> persons<00:01:02.120> suppose<00:01:03.500> you

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
between these two persons suppose you

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.280 
between these two persons suppose you
and<00:01:04.769> your<00:01:05.070> friend<00:01:05.430> both<00:01:06.000> are<00:01:06.150> talking<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.720> how

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
and your friend both are talking and how

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.980 
and your friend both are talking and how
are<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.680> interacting<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:08.700> each<00:01:08.729> other<00:01:09.000> so

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
are you interacting with each other so

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.980 
are you interacting with each other so
that<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.530> language<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.820> language<00:01:12.030> helps<00:01:12.780> us

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
that is language the language helps us

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.560 
that is language the language helps us
to<00:01:13.260> interact<00:01:13.680> with<00:01:14.010> each<00:01:14.220> other<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.299> is

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
to interact with each other so it is

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.830 
to interact with each other so it is
basically<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.409> medium<00:01:17.130> of<00:01:17.310> communication<00:01:17.840> so

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
basically a medium of communication so

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.800 
basically a medium of communication so
when<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.409> were<00:01:19.619> talking<00:01:19.920> with<00:01:20.220> your<00:01:20.369> friend

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
when you were talking with your friend

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.179 
when you were talking with your friend
you<00:01:21.810> are<00:01:21.900> talking<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.680> language<00:01:22.890> like

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
you are talking in a language like

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.480 
you are talking in a language like
English<00:01:23.850> because<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.710> which<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.340> are

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
English because this is in which you are

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.969 
English because this is in which you are
comfortable<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:27.299> know<00:01:27.570> English<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.740> are

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
comfortable you know English so you are

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.399 
comfortable you know English so you are
talking<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.549> English<00:01:29.909> but<00:01:30.869> there<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.380> a

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
talking in English but there is a

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.640 
talking in English but there is a
problem<00:01:32.060> whenever<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.329> want<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.869> talk<00:01:34.229> with<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
problem whenever I want to talk with the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.090 
problem whenever I want to talk with the
computer<00:01:35.130> suppose<00:01:36.060> it's<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.930> you<00:01:37.860> are

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
computer suppose it's you and you are

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.179 
computer suppose it's you and you are
talking<00:01:38.759> with<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.180> computer<00:01:39.780> but<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
talking with the computer but the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.310 
talking with the computer but the
problem<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.060> computer<00:01:42.600> cannot

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
problem is the computer cannot

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.230 
problem is the computer cannot
understand<00:01:44.040> what<00:01:44.189> you're<00:01:44.399> saying<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.090> is

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
understand what you're saying so it is

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.090 
understand what you're saying so it is
giving<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.810> bunch<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.380> question<00:01:47.070> marks

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
giving you a bunch of question marks

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.060 
giving you a bunch of question marks
because<00:01:47.820> you<00:01:48.689> are<00:01:48.840> talking<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.380> English<00:01:49.829> and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
because you are talking in English and

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.149 
because you are talking in English and
the<00:01:50.579> computer<00:01:51.000> cannot<00:01:51.450> understand<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.159> so

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
the computer cannot understand that so

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.940 
the computer cannot understand that so
the<00:01:53.939> problem<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.750> cannot<00:01:55.200> program<00:01:55.799> a

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
the problem is you cannot program a

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.149 
the problem is you cannot program a
computer<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.700> English<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:58.259> how<00:01:58.680> do<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:59.009> do

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
computer in English so how do you do

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.880 
computer in English so how do you do
that<00:01:59.399> in<00:02:00.119> order<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.750> program<00:02:00.960> a<00:02:01.200> computer<00:02:01.229> you

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
that in order to program a computer you

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.060 
that in order to program a computer you
need<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.310> learn<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.780> Perl<00:02:04.079> languages<00:02:04.860> which

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
need to learn the Perl languages which

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.890 
need to learn the Perl languages which
are<00:02:05.159> suitable<00:02:05.399> for<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.969> computer

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
are suitable for the computer

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.719 
are suitable for the computer
and<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.530> languages<00:02:07.980> which<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.340> suitable<00:02:08.610> for

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
and the languages which is suitable for

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.170 
and the languages which is suitable for
the<00:02:08.970> computer<00:02:09.420> those<00:02:10.110> are<00:02:10.410> called

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
the computer those are called

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.120 
the computer those are called
programming<00:02:12.410> languages<00:02:13.410> and<00:02:13.590> this<00:02:13.920> is<00:02:14.010> to

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
programming languages and this is to

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.280 
programming languages and this is to
to--for<00:02:14.430> computer<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.060> this<00:02:15.270> is<00:02:15.480> computer

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
to--for computer so this is computer

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.890 
to--for computer so this is computer
programming<00:02:16.920> language<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:18.240> this<00:02:18.660> is<00:02:18.720> what

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
programming language and this is what

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.280 
programming language and this is what
you<00:02:19.170> need<00:02:19.440> in<00:02:19.830> order<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.340> program<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:20.820> computer

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
you need in order to program a computer

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.380 
you need in order to program a computer
you<00:02:22.290> can<00:02:22.470> just<00:02:22.860> use<00:02:23.550> English<00:02:24.000> or<00:02:24.180> any<00:02:24.300> other

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
you can just use English or any other

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.990 
you can just use English or any other
language<00:02:24.600> in<00:02:25.020> order<00:02:25.170> to<00:02:25.290> do<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:26.520> what<00:02:26.790> is

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
language in order to do that so what is

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
language in order to do that so what is
the<00:02:27.120> computer<00:02:27.420> programming<00:02:27.720> language

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
the computer programming language

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.840 
the computer programming language
actually<00:02:28.740> there<00:02:28.950> are<00:02:29.040> a<00:02:29.070> lot<00:02:29.400> of<00:02:29.430> type<00:02:29.700> of

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
actually there are a lot of type of

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.260 
actually there are a lot of type of
languages<00:02:30.360> there<00:02:30.840> are<00:02:31.460> high<00:02:32.460> level<00:02:32.790> languages

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
languages there are high level languages

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.020 
languages there are high level languages
low<00:02:33.810> level<00:02:34.170> languages<00:02:34.620> there<00:02:35.130> are<00:02:35.160> assemble

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
low level languages there are assemble

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.570 
low level languages there are assemble
languages<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.780> we<00:02:37.650> will<00:02:37.830> talk<00:02:38.100> about<00:02:38.130> all

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
languages and we will talk about all

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.520 
languages and we will talk about all
these<00:02:38.970> kind<00:02:39.210> of<00:02:39.300> languages<00:02:39.810> in<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.290> next

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
these kind of languages in the next

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.410 
these kind of languages in the next
video<00:02:40.800> in<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.490> next<00:02:41.520> video<00:02:41.850> we'll<00:02:41.970> talk<00:02:42.210> how

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
video in the next video we'll talk how

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.470 
video in the next video we'll talk how
the<00:02:42.840> language<00:02:43.470> really<00:02:43.770> evolved<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.460> why<00:02:45.420> do

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
the language really evolved and why do

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.540 
the language really evolved and why do
we<00:02:45.720> really<00:02:46.140> need<00:02:46.470> these<00:02:46.830> kind<00:02:47.100> of<00:02:47.190> programming

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
we really need these kind of programming

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.710 
we really need these kind of programming
languages<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.180> different<00:02:48.360> kind<00:02:48.690> of

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
languages and different kind of

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.590 
languages and different kind of
languages<00:02:49.160> so<00:02:50.160> all<00:02:50.610> of<00:02:50.880> your<00:02:51.030> concepts<00:02:51.420> will

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
languages so all of your concepts will

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.170 
languages so all of your concepts will
become<00:02:51.870> clear<00:02:52.170> in<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.830> second<00:02:53.460> video<00:02:53.520> I<00:02:53.880> mean

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
become clear in the second video I mean

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.600 
become clear in the second video I mean
in<00:02:54.300> third<00:02:54.570> video<00:02:54.900> so<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.860> think<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.490> have

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
in third video so I think you have

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.340 
in third video so I think you have
enjoyed<00:02:56.940> this<00:02:57.120> video<00:02:57.270> a<00:02:57.450> lot<00:02:57.720> and<00:02:58.020> learn
