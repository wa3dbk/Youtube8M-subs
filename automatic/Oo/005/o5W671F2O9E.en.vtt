00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.460
 this pasodoble of the musical group 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.770
 Intense we start our journey 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.160
 by iniesta and let's start with 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.349
 discover its most emblematic buildings 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.719
 Among them, it is worth mentioning the 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.500
 bullring but iniesta is much more 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.560
 what's that 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.240
 good afternoon herminio you're going to teach 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.310
 the most emblematic buildings of 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.619
 iniesta and we started by the plaza de 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.540
 good bulls the bullring is about 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.420
 what would be the parade ground of the 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.420
 the medieval castle esplanade 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:38.260
 formed at some point is determined 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.790
 it must sink the platform because 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.519
 the troglodyte dwellings that were in 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.650
 the bottom of it 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.900
 they gathered and decided maybe from 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.850
 dig everything that is the coso what 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.960
 would be the arena in such a way that in the 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.239
 present at the top of the 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.890
 locality that would be the excavated castle 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.050
 down as you can see the 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.719
 bricks appears the arena los toriles 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.670
 they are still remains of ancient 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.230
 troglodyte dwellings that looked out 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.030
 what would be the cutting of the wall 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.860
 it is at the end of the village 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.119
 the current toriles will be the houses 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.619
 transferred as he told us before, not if 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.649
 possibly sheltered from the wall 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.119
 since the early middle ages the 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.940
 people from iniesta got to live under 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:21.790
 protecting itself even though the 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.860
 strength or the wall in the 13th century 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.330
 people are still living below when they 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.210
 leaves the wall when it is abandoned 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.440
 the fortress and people are abandoned 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.410
 still living and leaks 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.030
 so they cause it to sink we can see 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.590
 still at the same level as 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.960
 the floor is currently the floor 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.050
 of some of those homes here it 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.570
 You can see how it is still 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.490
 dug into the bar nut looks 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.770
 better dug into the nut than it 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.390
 it was the dwelling of the rock 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.180
 characteristic of iniesta is the earth 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.160
 soft clay like the tunnel that 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.229
 communicated with other homes and that 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.580
 allowed the shelter of the population and the 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.000
 housing under the subsoil of the 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.000
 location 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.469
 we have already reached our second 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.450
 stop that is the church of our 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:10.899
 very close function of more than the contribution 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.549
 of itself when the church happens to be the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.629
 village rather when the village passes 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.390
 to be from royal with the kings 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:18.519
 Catholics the people tend to sit 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.680
 around what would be the official center 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.360
 of power that is the town hall or the 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.799
 house of the villa and therefore very close 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.500
 from it a church of 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.030
 new plant in the way of how they were 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.860
 the churches that there are in the locality the 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.480
 building as we said before it 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:35.500
 raised on the site of what was the 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.180
 first church of the solution and due 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.030
 the fire rises much safer 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.150
 with the stone vault with three naves 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.430
 all of it vault with vaults of lunettes 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.319
 with a large dome that makes 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.450
 transmitter of the central element of the 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.310
 Latin fort plant and most 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.530
 remarkable that could remain of the 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.930
 moment of the 18th century would be the chapel 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:02.689
 We are now in the chapel 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:04.489
 the soil is the most if it is built 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:07.099
 a different way both the decoration 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.590
 as the constructive elements and 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:12.680
 decorative of the same mark in the 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.719
 inside a large central dome that 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.000
 remember those little chapels 

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:20.389
 chapels a centrist style 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.430
 classic exactly and the most 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:24.379
 characteristic perhaps the most important 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.049
 it would be the ceramic floor of manises 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:29.659
 of 18 that covers all of it that 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.939
 In some areas, the 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.859
 less busy with their coloration and 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.450
 with his original plant figuration 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.400
 we are in the hermitage of our lady 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.519
 of conception in the neighborhood of 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.250
 convent of san francisco is an area of 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.590
 almost millenary occupation because about 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.200
 200 meters from here would be the deposit 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.579
 Iberian archaeological site the necropolis of 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.219
 point of the new neighborhood you can not 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:54.219
 we appreciate the visit thank you good
