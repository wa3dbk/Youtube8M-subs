00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.469
 to me 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.119
 Greetings to all I am add your almost 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.110
 known favorite bringing them the

 most important news of the geek world

 let's start the first news talk to us 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.230
 of a story arc that has been raised 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.949
 a lot of anticipation from your announcement 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.769
 called the death of wolverine and the 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.780
 editor in chief of marvel axel alonso has 

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:38.210
 decided to talk a little more about the 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.780
 history and doubts about it being 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.930
 permanent in his own words says 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.910
 it's funny because there are a lot of people 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.260
 he complains that there is too much wolverine 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:54.020
 from now on this is no longer a plan 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.719
 long- term is dead 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.149
 these plans well let's say that if the 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.190
 fans do not like a marvel universe in 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.339
 the one that is not from wolverine we can 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.289
 fix it fast mike martz the editor 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.539
 of the collections of the mutants of his 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:10.580
 team have a very complex plan and 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:13.190
 exciting to fill the hole that 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.069
 will leave logan in the marvel universe that 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.050
 let's hope it works right now 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:20.530
 there is no plan 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.830
 escape this reminds a little bit of what 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.050
 happened with Peter Parker and his death to 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.360
 octopus doctor's hands when 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.490
 They assured that there would be further back to 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.070
 this movement more for the readers 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.250
 marily regulars we know that always 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.370
 there is hunger the second news 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.080
 it has to do with the great stan lee who 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.780
 He was present at a press conference 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.510
 in london on the occasion of london 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.310
 in comic-with where he talked about the effect 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.770
 positive that movies have 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.320
 based on comics in the industry itself 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.480
 of the comics besides confirming his 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:58.210
 cameo for the tape of the avengers 2 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.580
 the age of the throne but without giving many 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.830
 details about this also awarded with 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.260
 the idea of ​​how flattering it would be to 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.440
 the film of batman and superman dawn of 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.540
 justice if I made a cameo in this and 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.640
 that would be unexpected and many will 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.000
 would encourage you to watch the tape just for 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.370
 confirm that it's real let's hope that this 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.770
 cameo is not affected like that of the 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.940
 movie of the avengers where the 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.340
 original was removed 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.770
 to record one on the fly with a lot 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.530
 less important the third and last 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.230
 news has to do with everything or more 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.450
 well your replacement if you listened well 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.520
 will be replaced by another 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.540
 character that will take its place as the 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:43.700
 god of thunder or in this case goddess the 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.550
 writer jason aaron and the cartoonist 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.580

 wield the hammer of my soul since at 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.590
 seem the same thor has been considered 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.260
 unworthy of continuing to brandish his weapon 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.720
 besides that the girl who will not come back 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.930
 in question has been someone who the god 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.690
 nordic has saved in the past others 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.360
 rumors point to that it could be angel to 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.090

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.480
