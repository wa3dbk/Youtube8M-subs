I was just stylized and everyone hated
it<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.110> they<00:01:40.650> want<00:01:40.829> to<00:01:40.890> just<00:01:41.040> do<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.159> full<00:01:41.460> art

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
it and they want to just do a full art

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.160 
it and they want to just do a full art
one<00:01:41.820> or<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.630> mean<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.840> these<00:01:42.960> are<00:01:43.110> not

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
one or it can mean that these are not

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.080 
one or it can mean that these are not
the<00:01:43.409> card<00:01:43.619> are<00:01:43.740> either<00:01:44.369> way<00:01:44.670> it's<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.850> little

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
the card are either way it's a little

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.190 
the card are either way it's a little
confusing<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.600> we'll<00:01:45.720> get<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:45.960> in<00:01:46.079> a

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
confusing and we'll get to that in a

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.630 
confusing and we'll get to that in a
second<00:01:46.530> because<00:01:46.590> we<00:01:46.829> have<00:01:46.950> another<00:01:47.189> play<00:01:47.430> mat

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
second because we have another play mat

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.210 
second because we have another play mat
and<00:01:47.820> this<00:01:48.600> guy<00:01:48.840> I'd<00:01:49.500> actually<00:01:49.740> don't<00:01:50.009> know<00:01:50.100> I'm

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
and this guy I'd actually don't know I'm

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.819 
and this guy I'd actually don't know I'm
assuming<00:01:50.670> he's<00:01:50.820> also<00:01:51.060> on<00:01:51.390> day<00:01:51.960> 9<00:01:52.140> series<00:01:52.470> here

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
assuming he's also on day 9 series here

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.319 
assuming he's also on day 9 series here
but<00:01:53.280> if<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.460> can<00:01:53.579> see<00:01:53.729> it's<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:53.970> little<00:01:54.000> bit<00:01:54.270> of

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
but if you can see it's a little bit of

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.670 
but if you can see it's a little bit of
a<00:01:54.360> weird<00:01:54.540> angle<00:01:55.280> but<00:01:56.280> we<00:01:56.430> have<00:01:56.610> here<00:01:57.350> AJ's<00:01:58.350> play

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
a weird angle but we have here AJ's play

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.209 
a weird angle but we have here AJ's play
mat<00:01:58.860> definitely<00:01:59.790> looking<00:02:00.000> very<00:02:00.299> dark<00:02:00.780> as<00:02:01.219> well

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
mat definitely looking very dark as well

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.340 
mat definitely looking very dark as well
which<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.180> weird<00:02:03.630> because<00:02:03.840> course<00:02:04.200> that

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
which is weird because course that

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.569 
which is weird because course that
supposed<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.619> draw<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.829> new<00:02:05.009> players<00:02:05.280> it's<00:02:05.490> not

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
supposed to draw a new players it's not

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.700 
supposed to draw a new players it's not
usual<00:02:05.939> they<00:02:06.030> go<00:02:06.149> for<00:02:06.299> such<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.450> dark<00:02:06.750> theme<00:02:07.079> but

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
usual they go for such a dark theme but

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.290 
usual they go for such a dark theme but
this<00:02:07.920> Jace<00:02:08.220> are<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.580> little<00:02:08.819> different<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.209> we

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
this Jace are a little different so we

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.449 
this Jace are a little different so we

standing in front of the tablet of the

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
gill too because remember what that is

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.950 
gill too because remember what that is
that<00:02:13.750> is<00:02:13.990> the<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:15.220> represents<00:02:15.970> defy<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:16.600> ten

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
that is the it represents defy the ten

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.810 
that is the it represents defy the ten
gills<00:02:17.230> sorry<00:02:17.710> and<00:02:17.950> he's<00:02:18.370> standing<00:02:18.490> in<00:02:18.700> front

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
gills sorry and he's standing in front

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.180 
gills sorry and he's standing in front
of<00:02:18.910> it<00:02:19.030> looking<00:02:19.300> all<00:02:19.480> evil<00:02:19.960> mysterious<00:02:20.440> this

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
of it looking all evil mysterious this

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.940 
of it looking all evil mysterious this
makes<00:02:21.460> me<00:02:21.610> think<00:02:21.640> if<00:02:22.000> it's<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.780> case<00:02:22.990> then<00:02:23.770> we

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
makes me think if it's the case then we

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.010 
makes me think if it's the case then we
may<00:02:24.160> have<00:02:24.460> a<00:02:24.700> new<00:02:25.030> Jace<00:02:25.330> as<00:02:25.540> well<00:02:25.810> because

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
may have a new Jace as well because

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.970 
may have a new Jace as well because
we're<00:02:26.110> pretty<00:02:26.260> sure<00:02:26.350> we're<00:02:26.560> having<00:02:26.770> a<00:02:26.830> new

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
we're pretty sure we're having a new

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.190 
we're pretty sure we're having a new
Garak<00:02:27.400> I<00:02:27.780> don't<00:02:28.780> think<00:02:28.960> they<00:02:29.050> would<00:02:29.140> just

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
Garak I don't think they would just

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.750 
Garak I don't think they would just
print<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.740> same<00:02:29.920> or<00:02:30.070> attack<00:02:30.250> before<00:02:30.370> me<00:02:30.610> Jace

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
print the same or attack before me Jace

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.280 
print the same or attack before me Jace
pelerines<00:02:31.240> probably<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.570> darkest<00:02:32.020> Jace

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
pelerines probably the darkest Jace

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.980 
pelerines probably the darkest Jace
you've<00:02:32.470> had<00:02:32.650> in<00:02:32.860> the<00:02:32.950> past<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:34.570> ball<00:02:34.900> this

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
you've had in the past and the ball this

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.360 
you've had in the past and the ball this
could<00:02:35.050> be<00:02:35.320> a<00:02:35.350> new<00:02:35.530> Jace<00:02:35.710> Felder<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.160> fact<00:02:36.310> that

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
could be a new Jace Felder the fact that

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.910 
could be a new Jace Felder the fact that
his<00:02:36.520> hood<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:36.880> unhooded<00:02:37.600> like<00:02:38.350> a<00:02:38.380> better<00:02:38.680> term

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
his hood is unhooded like a better term

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.390 
his hood is unhooded like a better term
makes<00:02:39.670> me<00:02:40.060> wonder<00:02:40.480> if<00:02:40.750> this<00:02:40.900> is<00:02:41.020> a<00:02:41.050> new<00:02:41.290> Jace<00:02:41.530> he

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
makes me wonder if this is a new Jace he

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.670 
makes me wonder if this is a new Jace he
is<00:02:42.550> the<00:02:42.700> face<00:02:42.850> of<00:02:42.910> magic<00:02:43.450> key<00:02:43.660> and<00:02:43.780> Liliana<00:02:44.110> so

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
is the face of magic key and Liliana so

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.980 
is the face of magic key and Liliana so
I<00:02:44.710> assume<00:02:45.250> that<00:02:45.730> a<00:02:45.760> new<00:02:45.970> Jace<00:02:46.210> would<00:02:46.450> not<00:02:46.630> be

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
I assume that a new Jace would not be

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.530 
I assume that a new Jace would not be
unheard<00:02:47.950> of<00:02:48.130> but<00:02:48.790> what<00:02:48.880> makes<00:02:49.030> me<00:02:49.150> interesting

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
unheard of but what makes me interesting

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.790 
unheard of but what makes me interesting
what<00:02:49.810> makes<00:02:49.990> interesting<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:50.440> because<00:02:50.500> it's

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
what makes interesting is because it's

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.510 
what makes interesting is because it's
so<00:02:50.920> dark<00:02:51.310> maybe<00:02:52.530> and<00:02:53.530> if<00:02:53.680> this<00:02:53.800> was<00:02:53.980> not<00:02:54.130> a

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
so dark maybe and if this was not a

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.040 
so dark maybe and if this was not a
course<00:02:54.880> i<00:02:54.970> would<00:02:55.180> definitely<00:02:55.480> speculate<00:02:56.020> that

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
course i would definitely speculate that

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.090 
course i would definitely speculate that
we're<00:02:56.350> going<00:02:56.440> to<00:02:56.500> have<00:02:56.620> more<00:02:56.770> than<00:02:56.950> one

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
we're going to have more than one

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.590 
we're going to have more than one
multicolored<00:02:57.550> planeswalker<00:02:58.090> this<00:02:58.390> could<00:02:58.510> be

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
multicolored planeswalker this could be

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.300 
multicolored planeswalker this could be
a<00:02:58.630> black<00:02:58.870> blue<00:02:59.230> Jace<00:02:59.470> which<00:02:59.890> i<00:03:00.040> think<00:03:00.100> would

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
a black blue Jace which i think would

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.860 
a black blue Jace which i think would
definitely<00:03:00.730> mix<00:03:00.910> things<00:03:01.120> up<00:03:01.270> with<00:03:01.750> his

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
definitely mix things up with his

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.510 
definitely mix things up with his
abilities<00:03:02.320> we<00:03:02.470> pretty<00:03:02.680> much<00:03:02.770> done<00:03:03.100> the<00:03:03.280> blue

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
abilities we pretty much done the blue

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.310 
abilities we pretty much done the blue
side<00:03:03.790> to<00:03:04.060> death<00:03:04.270> so<00:03:04.810> I<00:03:04.840> think<00:03:04.930> that<00:03:05.140> would<00:03:05.260> be

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
side to death so I think that would be

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.140 
side to death so I think that would be
interesting<00:03:05.740> but<00:03:05.980> unless<00:03:06.640> they're<00:03:06.820> really

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
interesting but unless they're really

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.610 
interesting but unless they're really
mixing<00:03:07.480> up<00:03:07.600> the<00:03:07.630> corset<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.170> putting

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
mixing up the corset and putting

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.650 
mixing up the corset and putting
multicolored<00:03:09.100> in<00:03:09.280> I<00:03:09.490> can't<00:03:10.270> imagine<00:03:10.330> them

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
multicolored in I can't imagine them

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:11.910 
multicolored in I can't imagine them
doing<00:03:10.720> more<00:03:10.990> than<00:03:11.140> one<00:03:11.230> planeswalker<00:03:11.680> that

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
doing more than one planeswalker that

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.310 
doing more than one planeswalker that
way<00:03:12.070> which<00:03:12.700> still<00:03:13.030> implies<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.420> new<00:03:13.690> Jace<00:03:13.930> and

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
way which still implies a new Jace and

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.320 
way which still implies a new Jace and
if<00:03:14.470> you<00:03:14.530> go<00:03:14.620> over<00:03:14.740> here<00:03:14.830> back<00:03:15.040> to<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.280> Box<00:03:15.940> arts

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
if you go over here back to the Box arts

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:17.700 
if you go over here back to the Box arts
that<00:03:16.450> we<00:03:16.540> just<00:03:16.810> speculate<00:03:17.200> on<00:03:17.230> a<00:03:17.350> little<00:03:17.500> while

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
that we just speculate on a little while

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.280 
that we just speculate on a little while
ago<00:03:17.830> so<00:03:18.610> you<00:03:18.670> see<00:03:18.880> this<00:03:19.300> is<00:03:19.540> jae's<00:03:19.780> architect

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
ago so you see this is jae's architect

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.440 
ago so you see this is jae's architect
but<00:03:20.500> his<00:03:20.650> hood<00:03:20.830> is<00:03:20.920> up<00:03:21.070> and<00:03:21.310> it's<00:03:22.060> just<00:03:22.240> the

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
but his hood is up and it's just the

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.950 
but his hood is up and it's just the
it's<00:03:23.440> jase<00:03:23.680> Bellerin<00:03:24.190> but<00:03:24.970> you<00:03:25.240> see<00:03:25.420> here<00:03:25.690> this

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
it's jase Bellerin but you see here this

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.360 
it's jase Bellerin but you see here this
is<00:03:26.020> pretty<00:03:26.290> much<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.500> artwork<00:03:26.980> that<00:03:27.190> we're

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
is pretty much the artwork that we're

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.430 
is pretty much the artwork that we're
seeing<00:03:27.580> on<00:03:27.910> this<00:03:28.620> image<00:03:30.480> so<00:03:31.480> but<00:03:32.020> this<00:03:32.140> artwork

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
seeing on this image so but this artwork

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.430 
seeing on this image so but this artwork
for<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.740> Garrick<00:03:33.160> is<00:03:34.080> looks<00:03:35.080> more<00:03:35.290> like<00:03:35.410> he's

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
for the Garrick is looks more like he's

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.110 
for the Garrick is looks more like he's
charging<00:03:35.950> which<00:03:36.160> is<00:03:36.310> more<00:03:36.490> of<00:03:36.670> a<00:03:36.760> planeswalker

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
charging which is more of a planeswalker

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.910 
charging which is more of a planeswalker
action<00:03:37.810> planeswalkers<00:03:38.410> usually<00:03:38.680> what<00:03:38.800> they

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
action planeswalkers usually what they

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.460 
action planeswalkers usually what they
like<00:03:39.130> not<00:03:39.700> him<00:03:39.880> just<00:03:40.120> standing<00:03:40.510> there<00:03:40.540> scary

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
like not him just standing there scary

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.920 
like not him just standing there scary
which<00:03:41.980> is<00:03:42.100> weird<00:03:42.280> so<00:03:42.550> it<00:03:43.000> leaves<00:03:43.450> us<00:03:43.630> not

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
which is weird so it leaves us not

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.780 
which is weird so it leaves us not
really<00:03:44.200> sure<00:03:44.470> if<00:03:44.500> these<00:03:45.100> even<00:03:45.730> though

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
really sure if these even though

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.360 
really sure if these even though
ultrapro<00:03:46.120> tends<00:03:46.390> to<00:03:46.570> represent<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.020> card

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
ultrapro tends to represent the card

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.830 
ultrapro tends to represent the card
this<00:03:48.370> may<00:03:48.550> not<00:03:48.700> be<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.910> card<00:03:49.270> art<00:03:49.450> or<00:03:49.600> maybe<00:03:49.780> a

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
this may not be the card art or maybe a

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.610 
this may not be the card art or maybe a
promo<00:03:50.200> art<00:03:50.410> of<00:03:50.590> Garrick<00:03:51.780> but<00:03:52.780> I'm<00:03:52.990> pretty<00:03:53.350> sure

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
promo art of Garrick but I'm pretty sure

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.680 
promo art of Garrick but I'm pretty sure
this<00:03:53.890> is<00:03:54.130> going<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:54.490> be<00:03:54.640> if<00:03:54.880> they're<00:03:55.420> having<00:03:55.540> a

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
this is going to be if they're having a

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:56.970 
this is going to be if they're having a
new<00:03:55.780> Jace<00:03:56.020> they're<00:03:56.320> going<00:03:56.440> to<00:03:56.500> have<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.770> JS

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
new Jace they're going to have the JS

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.340 
new Jace they're going to have the JS
art<00:03:57.220> because<00:03:57.550> it's<00:03:58.060> the<00:03:58.420> exact<00:03:58.780> same<00:03:58.870> art<00:03:59.200> as

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
art because it's the exact same art as

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.620 
art because it's the exact same art as
this<00:03:59.640> which<00:04:00.640> means<00:04:00.880> it's<00:04:01.030> highly<00:04:01.270> likely<00:04:01.300> that

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
this which means it's highly likely that

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.140 
this which means it's highly likely that
would<00:04:01.900> be<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:03.190> would<00:04:03.250> be<00:04:03.460> the<00:04:03.580> art<00:04:03.730> for<00:04:03.940> Jace

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
would be that would be the art for Jace

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.200 
would be that would be the art for Jace
and<00:04:04.420> it<00:04:05.110> also<00:04:05.410> but<00:04:05.830> implies<00:04:06.070> not<00:04:06.370> JS<00:04:06.790> architect

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.210 
and it also but implies not JS architect

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.820 
and it also but implies not JS architect
thought<00:04:07.390> probably<00:04:07.870> not<00:04:08.170> Jace<00:04:08.500> Valerie

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
thought probably not Jace Valerie

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.110 
thought probably not Jace Valerie
neither<00:04:09.100> of<00:04:09.160> is<00:04:09.250> jace<00:04:09.400> felder<00:04:09.430> its<00:04:09.760> hood<00:04:09.880> is<00:04:09.910> up

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
neither of is jace felder its hood is up

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.290 
neither of is jace felder its hood is up
and<00:04:10.270> his<00:04:10.420> is<00:04:10.600> down<00:04:11.430> but<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.610> Garrick<00:04:12.910> art<00:04:13.090> is<00:04:13.270> a

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
and his is down but the Garrick art is a

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.390 
and his is down but the Garrick art is a
little<00:04:13.690> bit<00:04:13.870> confusing<00:04:14.440> even<00:04:15.160> though<00:04:15.250> in<00:04:15.310> this

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
little bit confusing even though in this

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.820 
little bit confusing even though in this
image<00:04:15.700> she<00:04:15.910> does<00:04:16.090> look<00:04:16.359> very<00:04:16.420> much<00:04:16.840> like<00:04:16.900> the

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
image she does look very much like the

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.530 
image she does look very much like the
one<00:04:17.980> we<00:04:18.100> see<00:04:18.250> here<00:04:18.460> so<00:04:19.060> anyway<00:04:19.239> this<00:04:19.359> is<00:04:19.510> just

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:19.540 
one we see here so anyway this is just

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.030 
one we see here so anyway this is just
complete<00:04:19.900> speculation<00:04:20.109> please<00:04:20.710> let<00:04:20.890> me<00:04:21.010> know
