strong large ridge of high pressure it's

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.470 
strong large ridge of high pressure it's
been<00:02:56.010> in<00:02:56.160> place<00:02:56.400> for<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.700> last<00:02:56.940> few<00:02:57.240> days

been in place for the last few days

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.630 
been in place for the last few days
it'll<00:02:58.110> stay<00:02:58.350> in<00:02:58.380> place<00:02:58.500> for<00:02:58.980> about<00:02:59.070> another

it'll stay in place for about another

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.760 
it'll stay in place for about another
day<00:02:59.940> so<00:03:00.000> that's<00:03:00.360> why<00:03:00.540> tomorrow<00:03:00.780> it's<00:03:01.500> going<00:03:01.709> to
