00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.730
 things 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:23.560
 where can you say they have stores 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.400
 nike 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.900

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.890
 with a trace of marks but their maturity 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.890
 for all 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.360
 nothing that you see a little to people like 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.950
 do as it is we have restaurants cafes 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.010
 and also 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.010
 to 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.460
 of rector to say mostly to people 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:55.520
 Indian people 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.520
 Southern China Mongolia 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.620
 factoring they always want balls of 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:16.349
 steel people 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:35.040
 and this is like the square 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.040
 more or less where 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.010
 yes 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.010
 in the power 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:56.989
 and not only 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:04.710
 is where the fish always goes 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.130
 the heat 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.440
 here 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.290
 it's a pass 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.230
 and with this we come to the end of the video 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.670
 that they did not teach anything four things 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.170
 the most important thing that there is because I want 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.000
 say it's a residential area where the 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.830
 people are like a bedroom city 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.250
 where people come to sleep alone at 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.250
 work then a weekend and 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.960
 so 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:05:05.419
 so you have seen a little bit of me 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:07.030
 neighborhood I hope they subscribed and if 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.600
 you want 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.600
