hello today's our view is going to be on
the<00:00:02.850> motion<00:00:03.060> radioactive<00:00:03.959> ram<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:06.170> they<00:00:07.170> are

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
the motion radioactive ram and they are

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.379 
the motion radioactive ram and they are
quite<00:00:07.830> unique<00:00:08.130> because<00:00:08.189> they<00:00:08.639> come<00:00:09.090> with<00:00:09.269> an
