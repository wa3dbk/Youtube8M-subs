00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:08.450
 This time, I make an animation of this kind of a catch phrase balloon 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:12.769
 I will explain the 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:18.060
 At first we prepare the material and make the nest material of the balloon in photoshop 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:20.200
 Layers are in a state of divided those that move each 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.950
 In we will enter in the production 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.270
 First of all in the new composition wind key 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:30.120
 Ok 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.630
 And size is about 500 applying 600 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.630
 10 seconds 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:37.610
 Make you 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.970
 The material of the balloon with 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.740
 First read 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.270
 Let's put an animation on this 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.380
 It is the scale is first start at zero 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.180
 so 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:56.170
 You have 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.170
 10 and to the way I feel coming out of the zero of the coma 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.980
 This is right 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.980
 so 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.720
 After 5 frames 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.640
 a little 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.570
 I feel smaller 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.740
 Up to 5 more 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:23.470
 This beep 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.570
 Copy the previous key gray too 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.830
 with this 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:33.900
 Come out from scratch 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:36.440
 Say the return is tiny with a little 48 become 50 In addition to the 50 people 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.910
 It becomes something like a name 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.570
 In here and leave smoothly Tsu'll go with f 9 so I want to move over 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.200
 Then 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.200
 Something like this 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.119
 Because I want to loop the part that is fluffy after coming out in this 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.960
 Select a scale 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.030
 animation 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.000
 Add an experiment 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:06.470
 Properties from this tab 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.860
 Loopout keyframes have a history 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.860
 With that 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.420
 I 'll loop it like this, but with this setting all keyframes 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.970
 Well of this scale 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.350
 Is the last to be looped 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.520
 Only three behind 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.520
 Set to loop 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.750
 Because now is 0 It is that Prime Minister to all 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.740
 I loop 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.740
 Loop load settings 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:37.760
 this 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:42.720
 Count from behind 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:46.890
 It seems that the first salary for the first two months is zero . 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.840
 It is an ancha one and two in one 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.879
 Loop out to the second 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.879
 I want to do a loop, so here 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.380
 I will put it in here twice 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.080
 Then fully 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.850
 It is said like this 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.850
 Only this part will become beginners 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.550
 so 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.550
 I will also read the layer of characters 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.250
 It is a thing 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:32.010
 It is the setting of the key frame that I found this balloon now 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:36.819
 All because you want to copy to copy the control cd in the transform 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:40.860
 When it is pasted on all layers to save money 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:46.580
 It came to do the same movement by such feeling 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:46.580
 The gold frame of each layer after in 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:54.330
 It's nice to have a machine star with a central animation, and we have a speech bubble 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.800
 Even at the position of this balloon 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.400
 Each 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.560
 Center around the letters 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.959
 To come to the center 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.959
 We are moving loosely 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.100
 Then 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.890
 th 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:18.090
 It is such a feeling eh 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:20.769
 After that, the start position is shifted, and it is about Japanese coma 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:25.259
 Decide 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.259
 I'm telling you 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.219
 If it looks like this 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:36.490
 It feels good like this 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.080
 Some more 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.080
 Fine adjustment fee for position 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.900
 I guess looks like A' 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.480
 It looks like this, the animation of the speech bubble is completed 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.289
 later 

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.420
 For example, in a new composition 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:10.460
 Usual 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.460
 Make it in 720 p size 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:16.110
 I also like loading product photos in such a feeling 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:27.980
 One year city animation something said 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.980
 Doing Move 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.629
 With this speech bubble 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.629
 Read 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.779
 I will arrange 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.010
 Right 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:49.590
 This is completed 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:50.610
 This expression method itself can be used with any product and catch phrase combination 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.070
 You 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:57.130
 Since also a really kind can make in one minute once you know even how to make to make 

00:05:54.070 --> 00:06:01.380
 I think it would be nice if you use it in various ways 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.380
 This time is over and let's do more
