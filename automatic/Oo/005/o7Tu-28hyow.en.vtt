contrary to what you see on TV cop and

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
computer it looks a little more

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.870 
computer it looks a little more
realistic<00:05:05.760> in<00:05:06.090> that<00:05:06.390> it<00:05:06.540> has<00:05:06.720> a<00:05:06.750> little<00:05:07.169> bit<00:05:07.560> of

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
realistic in that it has a little bit of

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.840 
realistic in that it has a little bit of
roughness<00:05:08.880> to<00:05:09.090> it<00:05:09.320> the<00:05:10.320> granularity<00:05:10.860> of<00:05:11.100> the

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850

matches the background and the
foreground<00:05:14.370> subject<00:05:15.150> both<00:05:15.420> so<00:05:16.050> it<00:05:16.140> looks<00:05:16.290> a

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
foreground subject both so it looks a

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
little more real it looks real but the

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.550 
little more real it looks real but the
plain<00:05:20.070> fact<00:05:20.370> is<00:05:20.550> that<00:05:20.940> most<00:05:21.180> UFO<00:05:21.840> photos<00:05:22.290> are

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
plain fact is that most UFO photos are

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.500 
plain fact is that most UFO photos are
of<00:05:22.770> such<00:05:22.980> poor<00:05:23.250> quality<00:05:23.520> that<00:05:24.360> it's

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
of such poor quality that it's

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.900 
of such poor quality that it's
impossible<00:05:24.900> to<00:05:25.260> tell<00:05:25.530> if<00:05:25.710> they're<00:05:25.890> fake<00:05:26.160> but

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
impossible to tell if they're fake but

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.880 
impossible to tell if they're fake but
there's<00:05:27.090> something<00:05:27.450> strange<00:05:27.900> about<00:05:28.140> UFOs

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
there's something strange about UFOs

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.000 
there's something strange about UFOs
something<00:05:29.610> that<00:05:29.730> makes<00:05:29.910> us<00:05:30.120> want<00:05:30.540> to<00:05:30.660> believe

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
something that makes us want to believe

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.660 
something that makes us want to believe
for<00:05:32.010> instance

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:32.670 
for instance

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.160 
for instance
you'd<00:05:33.000> think<00:05:33.180> the<00:05:33.360> folks<00:05:33.630> at<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:33.900> shopping

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:34.170 
you'd think the folks at the shopping

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:35.960 
you'd think the folks at the shopping
mall<00:05:34.380> would<00:05:34.830> be<00:05:34.980> relieved<00:05:35.400> to<00:05:35.580> know<00:05:35.790> our

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
mall would be relieved to know our

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.990 
mall would be relieved to know our
photos<00:05:36.360> were<00:05:36.750> a<00:05:36.810> hoax<00:05:37.140> instead<00:05:38.130> they<00:05:38.940> were

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
photos were a hoax instead they were

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.780 
photos were a hoax instead they were
disappointed<00:05:40.220> what<00:05:41.220> would<00:05:41.310> you<00:05:41.400> think<00:05:41.460> if<00:05:41.670> I

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
disappointed what would you think if I

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:43.220

laughs<00:05:46.830> enough<00:05:47.130> I<00:05:47.250> don't<00:05:47.430> care<00:05:47.640> about<00:05:47.700> the

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
laughs enough I don't care about the

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.220 
laughs enough I don't care about the
patients<00:05:48.240> though<00:05:48.300> I<00:05:48.480> still<00:05:48.660> believe<00:05:48.930> there<00:05:49.110> is

there now that we know how easily photos

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.300 
there now that we know how easily photos
can<00:06:02.480> be<00:06:02.510> faked<00:06:02.900> it<00:06:03.440> will<00:06:03.620> take<00:06:03.800> much<00:06:04.070> more

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
can be faked it will take much more

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.260 
can be faked it will take much more
concrete<00:06:04.940> evidence<00:06:05.090> to<00:06:05.660> prove<00:06:06.080> it
