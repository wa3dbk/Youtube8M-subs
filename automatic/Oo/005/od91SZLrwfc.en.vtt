00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
I got tied to do this because I get a

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.509 
I got tied to do this because I get a
lot<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.359> comments<00:00:27.840> about<00:00:27.900> my<00:00:28.109> accent<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.710> I

thought it would be good because I

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.609 
thought it would be good because I
probably<00:00:30.810> say<00:00:31.019> all<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.260> these<00:00:31.320> words
