Clinton's election campaign and it's a

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.490 
Clinton's election campaign and it's a
real<00:00:11.250> simple<00:00:11.400> tune<00:00:12.620> starts<00:00:13.620> out<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.730> intro<00:00:15.120> is

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
real simple tune starts out the intro is

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:28.370 
real simple tune starts out the intro is
e<00:00:16.500> na<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.490> e<00:00:23.660> is<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:25.369> and<00:00:26.369> D<00:00:26.519> on<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.760> second<00:00:27.170> G<00:00:28.170> on

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
e na so e is a and D on the second G on

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.609 
e na so e is a and D on the second G on
the<00:00:28.410> first<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.789> DG<00:00:30.269> be<00:00:30.449> on<00:00:30.660> the<00:00:30.750> second<00:00:31.140> so

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
the first a is DG be on the second so

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:41.959 
the first a is DG be on the second so
it's<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:39.290> and<00:00:40.520> as<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.820> verse

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
it's just like this and as the verse

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.549 
it's just like this and as the verse
begins<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.629> just<00:00:43.110> goes<00:00:43.260> eda<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:45.570> d<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
begins it just goes eda so the d is the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.310 
begins it just goes eda so the d is the
g<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.610> e<00:00:47.940> on<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.270> second<00:00:48.600> fret<00:00:48.719> be<00:00:49.140> on<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
g and e on the second fret be on the

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:57.050 
g and e on the second fret be on the
third<00:00:49.670> so<00:00:50.670> here's<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.120> pattern

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.060 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:03.150 

I

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.220 

and<00:01:03.310> then<00:01:03.880> after<00:01:04.300> that<00:01:04.420> repeats<00:01:04.750> three<00:01:04.989> times

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
and then after that repeats three times

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.180 
and then after that repeats three times
the<00:01:05.560> last<00:01:05.850> line<00:01:06.850> of<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.150> verse<00:01:07.360> is<00:01:07.650> goes<00:01:08.650> to<00:01:09.010> be

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
the last line of the verse is goes to be

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.150 
the last line of the verse is goes to be
and<00:01:09.370> just<00:01:09.490> hang<00:01:09.700> on<00:01:09.820> be<00:01:10.000> four<00:01:10.180> that<00:01:10.240> line<00:01:10.450> so

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
and just hang on be four that line so

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.360 
and just hang on be four that line so
the<00:01:12.160> B<00:01:12.400> is<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:14.050> a<00:01:14.410> string<00:01:14.830> on<00:01:14.920> the<00:01:15.010> second<00:01:15.340> fret

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
the B is the a string on the second fret

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.230 
the B is the a string on the second fret
the<00:01:16.060> D&amp;G<00:01:16.570> on<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.170> fourth<00:01:17.640> actually<00:01:18.640> you<00:01:19.120> can

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
the D&amp;G on the fourth actually you can

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.450 
the D&amp;G on the fourth actually you can
do<00:01:19.360> a<00:01:19.390> B<00:01:19.570> major<00:01:19.750> too<00:01:20.050> so<00:01:20.500> that's<00:01:20.740> DG<00:01:21.250> or<00:01:21.340> the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
do a B major too so that's DG or the

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.840 
do a B major too so that's DG or the
fourth<00:01:21.729> and<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.630> be<00:01:23.020> on<00:01:23.260> the<00:01:23.350> fourth<00:01:23.590> as<00:01:23.740> well

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.620 

so<00:01:27.850> here's<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.150> pattern<00:01:29.640> if<00:01:30.640> you<00:01:30.940> wake<00:01:31.180> up

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
so here's the pattern if you wake up

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.120 
so here's the pattern if you wake up
don't<00:01:32.140> smile<00:01:33.540> if<00:01:34.540> it<00:01:34.810> takes<00:01:35.080> just<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.800> little

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
don't smile if it takes just a little

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.760 
don't smile if it takes just a little
wide<00:01:37.619> open<00:01:38.619> your<00:01:38.770> eyes<00:01:38.979> look<00:01:39.940> at<00:01:40.180> the<00:01:40.390> day<00:01:40.770> you

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
wide open your eyes look at the day you

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.300 
wide open your eyes look at the day you
will<00:01:42.070> see<00:01:42.340> things<00:01:42.729> in<00:01:43.300> a<00:01:43.360> different<00:01:43.539> way<00:01:44.350> and

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
will see things in a different way and

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.779 
will see things in a different way and
the<00:01:46.149> course<00:01:46.390> is<00:01:46.630> exactly<00:01:47.050> the<00:01:47.170> same<00:01:47.380> as<00:01:47.530> that

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
the course is exactly the same as that

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.590 
the course is exactly the same as that
don't<00:01:48.789> stop<00:01:49.800> thinking<00:01:50.800> about<00:01:50.890> tomorrow<00:01:51.600> don't

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
don't stop thinking about tomorrow don't

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.680 
don't stop thinking about tomorrow don't
stop<00:01:53.610> it'll<00:01:54.610> soon<00:01:54.850> be<00:01:56.039> it'll<00:01:57.039> be<00:01:57.220> better<00:01:58.210> than

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
stop it'll soon be it'll be better than

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.930 
stop it'll soon be it'll be better than
before<00:01:59.399> yes<00:02:00.399> it<00:02:00.640> is<00:02:00.789> gone<00:02:01.149> yes<00:02:02.050> it<00:02:02.530> is<00:02:02.710> gone<00:02:03.009> and

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
before yes it is gone yes it is gone and

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.600 
before yes it is gone yes it is gone and
then<00:02:04.600> in<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:04.990> interims<00:02:05.470> between<00:02:06.009> when<00:02:06.460> you're

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
then in the interims between when you're

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.010 
then in the interims between when you're
singing<00:02:06.850> you're<00:02:07.240> just<00:02:07.420> going<00:02:07.569> to<00:02:07.630> go<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:07.840> the

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
singing you're just going to go to the

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.100 

that's<00:02:18.400> basically<00:02:18.850> at<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.180> course<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:19.750> the

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
that's basically at the course and the

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.020 
that's basically at the course and the
verse<00:02:20.350> are<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.680> same<00:02:20.920> when<00:02:21.820> you're<00:02:21.940> not

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
the solo is the same pattern and at the

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.360 
the solo is the same pattern and at the
end<00:02:28.330> there's<00:02:28.630> an<00:02:28.750> outro<00:02:29.140> where<00:02:29.470> they<00:02:30.040> go<00:02:30.190> oh
