00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.240
 it's up to him 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.309
 How did I say what led to climatempo? 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.009
 in the first semester 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:12.159
 I think it has to have 

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:13.779

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:15.389

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:24.560
 be careful 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.980
 when it was worth for every three worked 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.220

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.370
 like friend 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.330
 but has not yet testified 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.820
 It's all wrong 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.130
 it was a work of seduction 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.200
 the new car 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.780
 at that night

 he hit the crossbar 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.120
 Parallel to this 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.890
 noting that Fulham

 so the team has finally gone wrong 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.670

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:27.929
 she will get 

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:29.729
 well 

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:32.729
 first time 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:36.159
 the value was revealed 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.159
 with the victory by 2 to 0 

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:44.279
 and still 

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:46.679
 was leading to worse

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:13.219

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:16.219
 talking that would enter the core works
