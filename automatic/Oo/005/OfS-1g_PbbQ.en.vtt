00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
a container yes a container of rice I

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.030 
a container yes a container of rice I
have<00:01:21.299> brown<00:01:21.570> rice<00:01:21.810> here<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.439> could<00:01:22.619> use<00:01:22.770> white

have brown rice here you could use white

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.410 
have brown rice here you could use white
rice<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.520> doesn't<00:01:23.820> really<00:01:23.909> matter<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.299> can

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
rice it doesn't really matter you can

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.690 
rice it doesn't really matter you can
even<00:01:24.540> use<00:01:24.780> instant<00:01:25.320> runs<00:01:25.500> anything<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.549> why

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
use rice well because rice seeks out

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.450 
use rice well because rice seeks out
moisture<00:01:30.799> okay<00:01:31.799> what<00:01:32.040> you're<00:01:32.159> going<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.340> do
