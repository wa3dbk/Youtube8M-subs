chasing<00:00:08.849> towing<00:00:09.059> podcast<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.929> question<00:00:10.740> we<00:00:10.860> get

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
chasing towing podcast a question we get

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.900 
chasing towing podcast a question we get
quite<00:00:11.160> often<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:13.070> do<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.130> need<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> boost<00:00:14.610> pedal

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
quite often is do I need a boost pedal

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.070 
quite often is do I need a boost pedal
or<00:00:15.299> do<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:15.929> need<00:00:16.020> an<00:00:16.440> overdrive<00:00:17.300> set<00:00:18.300> clean<00:00:18.690> as<00:00:19.020> a

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
or do I need an overdrive set clean as a

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.830 
or do I need an overdrive set clean as a
boost<00:00:19.890> pedal<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.520> it's<00:00:21.300> all<00:00:21.570> personal

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
boost pedal and it's all personal

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.810 
boost pedal and it's all personal
preference<00:00:22.289> but<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:22.980> kind<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.340> want<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.609> show

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
preference but I kind of want to show

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.029 
preference but I kind of want to show
you<00:00:23.880> some<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:24.990> tonal<00:00:25.470> differences

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
you some of the tonal differences

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.269 
you some of the tonal differences
running<00:00:26.910> into<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.810> clean<00:00:28.349> tone<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.890> then<00:00:28.980> into

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
running into a clean tone and then into

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.120 
running into a clean tone and then into
a<00:00:29.310> dirty<00:00:29.609> tone<00:00:29.910> so<00:00:30.949> the<00:00:31.949> main<00:00:32.099> difference

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
a dirty tone so the main difference

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.400 
a dirty tone so the main difference
between<00:00:32.669> what<00:00:33.420> I'm<00:00:33.510> using<00:00:33.719> now<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.110> I'm<00:00:34.230> using

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
between what I'm using now is I'm using

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.340 
between what I'm using now is I'm using
our<00:00:34.559> decibel<00:00:35.130> which<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:36.059> full<00:00:36.390> range<00:00:36.660> full

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
our decibel which is a full range full

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.290 
our decibel which is a full range full
frequency<00:00:37.590> boost<00:00:38.129> in<00:00:38.340> other<00:00:38.489> words<00:00:38.730> it's

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
frequency boost in other words it's

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.709 
frequency boost in other words it's
boosting<00:00:39.840> your<00:00:40.129> basement<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.309> treble<00:00:41.730> and

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
boosting your basement and treble and

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.709 
boosting your basement and treble and
then<00:00:43.290> I'm<00:00:43.410> also<00:00:43.559> using<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:44.309> Clarksdale<00:00:44.910> Delta

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
then I'm also using a Clarksdale Delta

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.590 
then I'm also using a Clarksdale Delta
overdrive<00:00:46.260> which<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.489> tube<00:00:47.850> screamer<00:00:48.210> style

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
overdrive which is a tube screamer style

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.569 
overdrive which is a tube screamer style
pedal<00:00:48.989> which<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> very<00:00:49.920> common<00:00:50.219> that'll

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
pedal which is a very common that'll

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.459 
pedal which is a very common that'll
that<00:00:50.730> people<00:00:50.969> like<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.149> run<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.780> game<00:00:51.989> low<00:00:52.230> and

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
that people like to run the game low and

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.850 
that people like to run the game low and
the<00:00:52.530> volume<00:00:52.829> high<00:00:53.539> to<00:00:54.539> get<00:00:54.750> more<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.649> boost

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
the volume high to get more of a boost

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.689 
the volume high to get more of a boost
so<00:00:56.899> the<00:00:57.899> easy<00:00:58.170> answer<00:00:58.710> there<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.949> one's

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
so the easy answer there is one's

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.880 
so the easy answer there is one's
boosting<00:01:00.210> every<00:01:00.449> frequency<00:01:00.780> across<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
boosting every frequency across the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.179 
boosting every frequency across the
board<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.399> then<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.690> Clarksdale<00:01:04.199> or<00:01:04.530> you

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
board and then the Clarksdale or you

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.190 
board and then the Clarksdale or you
know<00:01:05.309> any<00:01:05.909> other<00:01:06.090> pedal<00:01:06.570> that's<00:01:06.750> designed<00:01:07.110> to

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
know any other pedal that's designed to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.910 
know any other pedal that's designed to
do<00:01:07.380> something<00:01:08.150> this<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.570> boosting<00:01:10.320> kind

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
do something this one is boosting kind

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.480 
do something this one is boosting kind
of<00:01:11.040> a<00:01:11.130> specific<00:01:11.880> frequency<00:01:12.150> more<00:01:12.900> than<00:01:13.080> others

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
of a specific frequency more than others

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.420 
of a specific frequency more than others
in<00:01:14.490> this<00:01:14.760> case<00:01:14.970> it's<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.360> mid-range<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.560> what

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
in this case it's the mid-range so what

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.289 
in this case it's the mid-range so what
I'm<00:01:17.520> going<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.700> do<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.909> I'm<00:01:17.970> going<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.180> play

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
I'm going to do is I'm going to play

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.060 
I'm going to do is I'm going to play
some<00:01:18.509> clean<00:01:18.780> stuff<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.439> then<00:01:19.619> I'll<00:01:19.740> click<00:01:19.950> on

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
some clean stuff and then I'll click on

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.130 
some clean stuff and then I'll click on
the<00:01:20.250> decibel<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.030> you'll<00:01:21.450> hear<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.869> it's<00:01:22.020> a

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
the decibel and you'll hear that it's a

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.710 
the decibel and you'll hear that it's a
full<00:01:22.409> range<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.130> then<00:01:23.610> I'll<00:01:23.729> stop<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.299> then

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
full range and then I'll stop and then

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.929 
full range and then I'll stop and then
I'll<00:01:24.869> play<00:01:25.110> more<00:01:25.350> clean<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.890> then<00:01:26.580> I'll<00:01:26.700> kick

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
I'll play more clean and then I'll kick

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.460 
I'll play more clean and then I'll kick
on<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.509> Clarksdale<00:01:28.020> so<00:01:28.229> here's<00:01:28.409> just

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
on the the Clarksdale so here's just

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:48.320 
on the the Clarksdale so here's just
your<00:01:28.770> clean<00:01:28.979> tone

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.399 

so<00:01:49.200> once<00:01:49.410> again

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:06.190 

and<00:01:54.560> then<00:01:55.399> on

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.930 

so<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.259> could<00:02:07.439> hear<00:02:07.679> every<00:02:08.099> frequency<00:02:08.429> across

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
so you could hear every frequency across

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.110 
so you could hear every frequency across
the<00:02:09.119> board<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.629> being<00:02:10.349> boosted<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.129> you're

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
the board is being boosted and you're

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.670 
the board is being boosted and you're
also<00:02:12.209> gonna<00:02:12.450> notice<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:12.840> sometimes<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.650> can

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
also gonna notice that sometimes it can

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.130 
also gonna notice that sometimes it can
get<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.920> little<00:02:14.099> wolfy<00:02:14.640> or<00:02:14.879> Basie<00:02:15.209> because<00:02:15.840> your

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
get a little wolfy or Basie because your

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.509 
get a little wolfy or Basie because your
bass<00:02:16.349> is<00:02:16.379> also<00:02:16.920> being<00:02:17.870> boosted<00:02:18.870> and

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
bass is also being boosted and

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.740 
bass is also being boosted and
especially<00:02:20.519> when<00:02:20.610> running<00:02:20.879> into<00:02:21.090> game<00:02:21.269> pedals

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
especially when running into game pedals

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.000 
especially when running into game pedals
and<00:02:21.840> I'll<00:02:21.930> go<00:02:22.049> into<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.319> here<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.709> minute

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
and I'll go into that here in a minute

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.800 
and I'll go into that here in a minute
but<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.549> can<00:02:23.700> also<00:02:23.849> make<00:02:24.000> some<00:02:24.180> of<00:02:24.510> them<00:02:24.629> kind

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
but that can also make some of them kind

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.330 
but that can also make some of them kind
of<00:02:24.870> sound<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.140> little<00:02:25.379> fuzzy<00:02:25.799> which<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.099> pretty

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
of sound a little fuzzy which is pretty

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.240 
of sound a little fuzzy which is pretty
cool<00:02:27.049> so<00:02:28.049> now<00:02:28.080> let's<00:02:28.410> do<00:02:28.590> the<00:02:28.709> Clarksdale

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
cool so now let's do the Clarksdale

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.160 
cool so now let's do the Clarksdale
which<00:02:29.489> is<00:02:29.670> going<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:29.970> boost<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.540> mid-range<00:02:30.959> a

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
which is going to boost the mid-range a

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.400 
which is going to boost the mid-range a
little<00:02:31.410> bit<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:32.519> first<00:02:33.060> clean<00:02:33.450> then<00:02:34.140> I'll<00:02:34.260> turn

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
little bit so first clean then I'll turn

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.259 
little bit so first clean then I'll turn
the<00:02:34.530> Clarksdale<00:02:34.950> on<00:02:35.129> and<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.700> game<00:02:35.879> it's

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
the Clarksdale on and the game it's

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.550 
the Clarksdale on and the game it's
gonna<00:02:36.480> get<00:02:36.690> a<00:02:36.720> little<00:02:36.870> gain<00:02:37.110> here<00:02:37.290> because

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
gonna get a little gain here because

00:02:37.560 --> 00:03:10.729 
gonna get a little gain here because
it's<00:02:37.739> it's<00:02:38.489> gonna<00:02:39.030> clip<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.390> little<00:02:39.510> so

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.080 

so<00:03:11.739> you<00:03:11.830> can<00:03:11.980> you're<00:03:12.129> boosting<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.730> volume

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
so you can you're boosting the volume

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.880 
so you can you're boosting the volume
but<00:03:13.269> there's<00:03:13.480> also<00:03:13.690> a<00:03:13.870> frequency<00:03:14.500> in<00:03:14.650> there

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
but there's also a frequency in there

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.820 
but there's also a frequency in there
that<00:03:15.670> that's<00:03:16.599> getting<00:03:16.780> boosted<00:03:17.080> as<00:03:17.379> well<00:03:17.620> and

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
that that's getting boosted as well and

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.930 
that that's getting boosted as well and
there's<00:03:17.980> also<00:03:18.129> some<00:03:18.519> gain<00:03:18.819> that's<00:03:19.120> introduced

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
there's also some gain that's introduced

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.550 
there's also some gain that's introduced
what<00:03:21.940> I<00:03:21.970> really<00:03:22.330> like<00:03:22.480> that<00:03:22.660> for<00:03:22.930> is<00:03:23.080> running

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
what I really like that for is running

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.300 
what I really like that for is running
into<00:03:23.830> a<00:03:23.860> gain<00:03:24.250> channel<00:03:24.790> or<00:03:25.780> another<00:03:26.310> dirt

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
into a gain channel or another dirt

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.000 
into a gain channel or another dirt
pedal<00:03:27.700> and<00:03:27.910> really<00:03:28.480> tightens<00:03:28.959> things<00:03:29.260> up<00:03:29.530> so

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
pedal and really tightens things up so

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.039 
pedal and really tightens things up so
it's<00:03:30.910> going<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.120> have<00:03:31.269> kind<00:03:31.510> of<00:03:31.569> the<00:03:31.690> reverse

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
it's going to have kind of the reverse

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.020 
it's going to have kind of the reverse
effect<00:03:32.290> of<00:03:32.739> say<00:03:32.980> like<00:03:33.220> a<00:03:33.250> full<00:03:33.519> range<00:03:33.730> boost

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
effect of say like a full range boost

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.819 
effect of say like a full range boost
because<00:03:34.269> that<00:03:34.599> can<00:03:34.780> make<00:03:35.019> it<00:03:35.140> sag<00:03:35.409> or<00:03:35.650> get

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:35.829 
because that can make it sag or get

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.150 
because that can make it sag or get
fuzzy<00:03:36.959> so<00:03:37.959> I'll<00:03:38.260> just<00:03:38.440> go<00:03:38.590> through<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:38.920> so

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
fuzzy so I'll just go through that so

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.270 
fuzzy so I'll just go through that so
here<00:03:39.489> I'm<00:03:39.610> going<00:03:39.760> to<00:03:39.819> kick<00:03:39.970> on<00:03:40.180> our<00:03:40.750> pinnacle

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
here I'm going to kick on our pinnacle

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:50.449 
here I'm going to kick on our pinnacle
and<00:03:42.280> that'll<00:03:42.579> give<00:03:42.700> us<00:03:42.730> some<00:03:43.000> dirt

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.100 

so<00:03:51.459> now<00:03:51.610> the<00:03:51.670> full<00:03:52.030> frequency<00:03:52.300> boost<00:03:52.840> and

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
so now the full frequency boost and

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.720 
so now the full frequency boost and
you'll<00:03:53.470> notice<00:03:53.680> that<00:03:53.950> some<00:03:54.010> of<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.340> bass<00:03:54.520> is

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
you'll notice that some of the bass is

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:17.720 
you'll notice that some of the bass is
going<00:03:54.790> to<00:03:54.940> get<00:03:55.060> boosted<00:03:55.390> as<00:03:55.510> well

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.270 

so<00:04:18.730> it<00:04:19.540> changes<00:04:20.080> the<00:04:20.230> tone<00:04:20.470> a<00:04:20.500> little<00:04:20.680> but<00:04:21.250> more

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
so it changes the tone a little but more

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.890 
so it changes the tone a little but more
than<00:04:21.580> anything<00:04:21.790> it<00:04:22.240> just<00:04:22.270> changes

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
than anything it just changes

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.830 
than anything it just changes
frequencies<00:04:23.620> it<00:04:23.860> changes<00:04:24.280> volume<00:04:24.880> to<00:04:25.630> where

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
frequencies it changes volume to where

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.690 
frequencies it changes volume to where
if<00:04:26.110> I<00:04:26.260> kick<00:04:26.470> on<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.740> Clarksdale<00:04:27.280> it's<00:04:27.520> going

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
if I kick on the Clarksdale it's going

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.100 
if I kick on the Clarksdale it's going
to<00:04:27.760> really<00:04:27.880> tighten<00:04:28.210> things<00:04:28.510> up<00:04:28.750> and<00:04:28.930> add<00:04:29.080> a

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
to really tighten things up and add a

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.280 
to really tighten things up and add a
little<00:04:29.200> bit<00:04:29.560> of<00:04:29.710> game<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.940> also<00:04:31.150> boost<00:04:31.570> so

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
little bit of game and also boost so

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:39.990 
little bit of game and also boost so
here's<00:04:33.040> the<00:04:33.160> pinnacle<00:04:38.820> and<00:04:39.820> now<00:04:39.940> the

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
here's the pinnacle and now the

00:04:40.000 --> 00:05:08.230 
here's the pinnacle and now the
Clarksdale<00:04:40.570> with

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.439 

so<00:05:09.240> you<00:05:09.330> can<00:05:09.449> hear<00:05:09.630> that<00:05:09.660> tightens<00:05:10.259> it<00:05:10.410> up<00:05:10.590> has

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
so you can hear that tightens it up has

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.909 
so you can hear that tightens it up has
it<00:05:12.449> added<00:05:12.840> some<00:05:12.990> compression<00:05:13.440> actually

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
it added some compression actually

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.159 
it added some compression actually
because<00:05:14.160> it's<00:05:14.550> gain<00:05:14.970> going<00:05:15.479> into<00:05:15.750> more<00:05:15.960> gain

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
because it's gain going into more gain

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:17.810 
because it's gain going into more gain
so<00:05:16.740> it's<00:05:16.860> adding<00:05:17.100> compression<00:05:17.610> it's

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
so it's adding compression it's

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.490 
so it's adding compression it's
tightening<00:05:18.270> things<00:05:18.449> up<00:05:18.750> and<00:05:18.990> it's<00:05:19.350> also

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
tightening things up and it's also

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.820 
tightening things up and it's also
changing<00:05:19.949> the<00:05:20.100> tone<00:05:20.370> a<00:05:20.400> little<00:05:20.759> bit<00:05:20.910> more<00:05:21.180> so

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
changing the tone a little bit more so

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.779 
changing the tone a little bit more so
that's<00:05:22.830> why<00:05:23.039> you<00:05:23.100> would<00:05:23.340> want<00:05:23.520> to<00:05:23.610> use

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
that's why you would want to use

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.719 
that's why you would want to use
different<00:05:24.449> pedals<00:05:24.840> as<00:05:25.139> a<00:05:25.199> boost<00:05:26.130> other<00:05:26.490> than

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:26.729 
different pedals as a boost other than

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.629 
different pedals as a boost other than
just<00:05:26.970> a<00:05:27.060> clean<00:05:27.360> boost<00:05:27.630> or<00:05:27.840> a<00:05:27.870> full<00:05:28.110> frequency

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 
just a clean boost or a full frequency

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:32.540 
just a clean boost or a full frequency
boost<00:05:29.639> to<00:05:30.479> either<00:05:31.380> change<00:05:31.740> your<00:05:31.800> gain<00:05:32.070> or<00:05:32.370> your

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
boost to either change your gain or your

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.370 
boost to either change your gain or your
clean<00:05:32.820> tone<00:05:33.060> so<00:05:33.570> hopefully<00:05:33.900> this<00:05:34.050> helped<00:05:34.320> a

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:34.380 
clean tone so hopefully this helped a

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.600 
clean tone so hopefully this helped a
little<00:05:34.530> bit<00:05:34.800> helped<00:05:35.130> to<00:05:35.250> answer<00:05:35.310> that

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
little bit helped to answer that

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.270 
little bit helped to answer that
