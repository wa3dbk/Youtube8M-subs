00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
we have we're working together we have

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.390 
I think that's where really the bond
comes<00:02:32.050> is<00:02:33.050> really<00:02:33.350> solidified<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:34.069> fact<00:02:34.100> that

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
comes is really solidified the fact that
