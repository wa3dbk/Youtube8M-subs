this<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> very<00:02:01.950> cool<00:02:02.310> part<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.909> gameplay

this is a very cool part of the gameplay
now<00:02:05.579> we<00:02:05.640> follow<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.299> bullets<00:02:06.600> through<00:02:06.929> the
