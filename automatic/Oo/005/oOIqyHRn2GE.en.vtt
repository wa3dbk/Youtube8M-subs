is<00:00:41.219> perfect<00:00:41.910> story<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.989> store<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.410> a

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
is perfect story to the store is a

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.470 
is perfect story to the store is a
little<00:00:43.710> weird<00:00:43.950> but<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.280> finally<00:00:44.730> understand

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
little weird but you finally understand

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.450
