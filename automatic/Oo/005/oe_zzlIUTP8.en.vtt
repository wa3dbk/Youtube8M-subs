for a rip or a tear where all the fabric
is<00:00:08.980> still<00:00:09.490> left<00:00:09.760> behind<00:00:10.200> what<00:00:11.200> we're<00:00:11.379> going<00:00:11.530> to

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.650 
is still left behind what we're going to

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.640 
is still left behind what we're going to
do<00:00:11.860> is<00:00:12.459> actually<00:00:12.789> turn<00:00:13.299> the<00:00:13.539> fabric<00:00:13.750> inside

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.650 
do is actually turn the fabric inside

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.740 
do is actually turn the fabric inside
out<00:00:14.949> this<00:00:15.219> is<00:00:15.279> if<00:00:15.549> you<00:00:15.670> can<00:00:15.850> get<00:00:16.119> to<00:00:16.420> the<00:00:16.570> wrong

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:16.750 
out this is if you can get to the wrong

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.349 
out this is if you can get to the wrong
side<00:00:17.109> so<00:00:17.560> then<00:00:18.279> you<00:00:18.430> can<00:00:18.640> pull<00:00:18.970> the<00:00:19.150> fabric

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:19.359 
side so then you can pull the fabric

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:22.410 
side so then you can pull the fabric
through<00:00:19.810> onto<00:00:20.560> the<00:00:20.680> wrong<00:00:20.830> side<00:00:21.220> and<00:00:21.550> pull<00:00:22.240> all

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
through onto the wrong side and pull all

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.990 
through onto the wrong side and pull all
the<00:00:22.450> little<00:00:22.930> fibers<00:00:23.440> through<00:00:23.710> with<00:00:23.949> it<00:00:24.100> then

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
the little fibers through with it then

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.420 
the little fibers through with it then
you're<00:00:25.240> going<00:00:25.390> to<00:00:25.480> fiddle<00:00:25.930> a<00:00:26.260> little<00:00:26.770> bit<00:00:26.949> to

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
you're going to fiddle a little bit to

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.230 
you're going to fiddle a little bit to
get<00:00:27.580> that<00:00:27.820> put<00:00:28.090> back<00:00:28.330> together<00:00:28.539> again

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240

patch we recommend lightweight cotton
for<00:00:39.760> patches<00:00:40.269> I'm<00:00:41.199> using<00:00:41.499> a<00:00:41.679> patch<00:00:41.920> of<00:00:42.159> a

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
for patches I'm using a patch of a

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:43.919 
for patches I'm using a patch of a
different<00:00:42.550> color<00:00:42.760> so<00:00:43.030> you<00:00:43.089> can<00:00:43.329> actually<00:00:43.479> see

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:43.929 
different color so you can actually see

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:45.389 
different color so you can actually see
clearly<00:00:44.289> what<00:00:44.499> I'm<00:00:44.620> doing<00:00:44.949> here

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
clearly what I'm doing here

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.160 
clearly what I'm doing here
if<00:00:45.729> I<00:00:45.879> was<00:00:46.030> doing<00:00:46.179> this<00:00:46.389> at<00:00:46.569> home<00:00:46.600> I'd<00:00:46.960> use<00:00:47.139> a

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
if I was doing this at home I'd use a

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.750 
if I was doing this at home I'd use a
gray<00:00:47.440> patch<00:00:47.739> that<00:00:48.039> blends<00:00:48.280> in

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
gray patch that blends in

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.729 
gray patch that blends in
but<00:00:49.269> remember<00:00:49.659> ladies<00:00:49.989> these<00:00:50.229> are<00:00:50.289> on<00:00:50.559> the

but remember ladies these are on the

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:52.559 
but remember ladies these are on the
wrong<00:00:50.889> side<00:00:51.249> so<00:00:51.309> nobody's<00:00:51.999> actually<00:00:52.149> going<00:00:52.479> to

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:52.569 
wrong side so nobody's actually going to

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:53.520 
wrong side so nobody's actually going to
see<00:00:52.749> them<00:00:52.929> anyway

inside of a fluffy sweater and then

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.479 
inside of a fluffy sweater and then
we're<00:02:06.170> going<00:02:06.319> to<00:02:06.380> cut<00:02:06.560> it<00:02:06.679> up<00:02:06.829> so<00:02:07.100> the<00:02:07.219> easiest

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 
we're going to cut it up so the easiest

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:08.979 
we're going to cut it up so the easiest
way<00:02:07.610> to<00:02:07.700> do<00:02:07.939> that<00:02:07.970> is<00:02:08.299> to<00:02:08.450> roll<00:02:08.630> it<00:02:08.750> into<00:02:08.899> a

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
way to do that is to roll it into a

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.800 
way to do that is to roll it into a
little<00:02:09.110> ball<00:02:09.380> take<00:02:10.310> your<00:02:10.459> scissors<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:10.819> chop

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
little ball take your scissors and chop

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.380 
little ball take your scissors and chop
it<00:02:11.959> up<00:02:12.049> as<00:02:12.230> fine<00:02:12.500> as<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.709> can<00:02:13.010> the<00:02:13.940> finer<00:02:14.180> you

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
it up as fine as you can the finer you

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.910 
it up as fine as you can the finer you
can<00:02:14.569> chop<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:14.840> up<00:02:15.079> the<00:02:15.230> better<00:02:15.380> it's<00:02:15.620> going<00:02:15.799> to

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
can chop it up the better it's going to

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.800 
can chop it up the better it's going to
work<00:02:16.069> so<00:02:16.519> we<00:02:16.640> just<00:02:16.819> keep<00:02:17.000> chopping<00:02:17.299> it<00:02:17.540> up<00:02:17.630> and

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
work so we just keep chopping it up and

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.990 
work so we just keep chopping it up and
chopping<00:02:18.140> it<00:02:18.230> up<00:02:18.349> and<00:02:18.500> chopping<00:02:18.890> it<00:02:18.980> up<00:02:19.099> till

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
chopping it up and chopping it up till

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.319 
chopping it up and chopping it up till
it<00:02:20.090> looks<00:02:20.299> a<00:02:20.630> little<00:02:20.989> bit<00:02:21.260> like<00:02:21.410> fluff<00:02:22.329> flicks

now<00:03:49.380> if<00:03:49.650> we<00:03:49.890> have<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.190> hole<00:03:50.640> in<00:03:50.940> a<00:03:51.180> pattern

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
now if we have a hole in a pattern

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.040 
now if we have a hole in a pattern
fabric<00:03:51.870> or<00:03:52.380> a<00:03:52.440> flat<00:03:53.220> fabric<00:03:53.520> the<00:03:54.480> chopping<00:03:54.930> up

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
fabric or a flat fabric the chopping up

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.560 
fabric or a flat fabric the chopping up
method<00:03:55.500> like<00:03:55.680> I<00:03:55.860> did<00:03:56.040> on<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.310> wall<00:03:56.550> is<00:03:57.240> not

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
method like I did on the wall is not

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.590 
method like I did on the wall is not
suitable<00:03:58.190> here<00:03:59.190> what<00:03:59.700> we<00:03:59.850> need<00:03:59.880> to<00:04:00.150> do<00:04:00.330> is

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
suitable here what we need to do is

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.140 
suitable here what we need to do is
replace<00:04:00.990> the<00:04:01.290> pattern<00:04:02.010> that<00:04:02.580> is<00:04:02.700> actually

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
replace the pattern that is actually

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.870 
replace the pattern that is actually
missing<00:04:03.540> so<00:04:04.500> we<00:04:04.680> need<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:05.040> cut<00:04:05.310> a<00:04:05.340> piece<00:04:05.640> out

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
missing so we need to cut a piece out

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.060 
missing so we need to cut a piece out
that<00:04:06.600> is<00:04:06.750> slightly<00:04:07.050> bigger<00:04:07.470> than<00:04:07.590> what<00:04:07.920> is

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
that is slightly bigger than what is

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.970 
that is slightly bigger than what is
missing<00:04:08.580> and<00:04:08.910> then<00:04:09.810> we<00:04:10.080> can<00:04:10.260> actually<00:04:10.440> piece

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
missing and then we can actually piece

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.990 
missing and then we can actually piece
it<00:04:11.250> in<00:04:11.540> so<00:04:12.540> again<00:04:12.990> we<00:04:13.860> can<00:04:14.070> just<00:04:14.130> if<00:04:14.550> we<00:04:14.700> can't

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
it in so again we can just if we can't

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.550 
it in so again we can just if we can't
get<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.240> the<00:04:15.480> wrong<00:04:15.630> side<00:04:15.960> if<00:04:16.230> you're<00:04:16.380> working

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
get to the wrong side if you're working

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.229 
get to the wrong side if you're working
on<00:04:16.770> a<00:04:16.830> quilt<00:04:17.160> or<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.430> comforter<00:04:17.730> or<00:04:18.030> anything

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
on a quilt or a comforter or anything

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.660 
on a quilt or a comforter or anything
like<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:18.570> we<00:04:19.350> can<00:04:19.530> actually<00:04:19.680> put<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.400> patch

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
like that we can actually put the patch

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.170 
like that we can actually put the patch
through<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.750> tear<00:04:22.020> and<00:04:22.380> fuse<00:04:23.250> it<00:04:23.430> all<00:04:23.580> from

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
through the tear and fuse it all from

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.840 
through the tear and fuse it all from
the<00:04:24.420> right<00:04:24.630> side<00:04:24.990> so<00:04:25.800> all<00:04:25.950> we<00:04:26.160> would<00:04:26.190> recommend

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
the right side so all we would recommend

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.510 
the right side so all we would recommend
that<00:04:26.910> you<00:04:27.030> do<00:04:27.330> is<00:04:27.660> you<00:04:27.960> just<00:04:28.170> dampen<00:04:28.890> the<00:04:29.010> area

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
that you do is you just dampen the area

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.820 
that you do is you just dampen the area
and<00:04:29.760> sprinkle<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.300> powder<00:04:30.570> that<00:04:30.960> is<00:04:31.380> actually

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
and sprinkle the powder that is actually

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.060 
and sprinkle the powder that is actually
going<00:04:32.100> to<00:04:32.340> fit<00:04:32.640> underneath<00:04:33.630> this<00:04:34.080> area<00:04:34.650> here

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
going to fit underneath this area here

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:40.700 
going to fit underneath this area here
now<00:04:36.060> when<00:04:36.510> I<00:04:36.540> did<00:04:36.780> this<00:04:37.680> silk<00:04:38.220> jacket<00:04:38.850> I<00:04:39.450> used<00:04:40.350> a

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
now when I did this silk jacket I used a

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.830 
now when I did this silk jacket I used a
piece<00:04:41.040> of<00:04:41.100> fabric<00:04:41.490> that<00:04:41.790> I<00:04:42.030> actually<00:04:42.330> found

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
piece of fabric that I actually found

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.890 
piece of fabric that I actually found
off<00:04:43.230> the<00:04:43.620> shoulder<00:04:44.010> pad<00:04:44.300> that<00:04:45.300> matched<00:04:45.600> in

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
off the shoulder pad that matched in

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.460 
off the shoulder pad that matched in
with<00:04:46.110> the<00:04:46.260> pan<00:04:46.700> so<00:04:47.700> I<00:04:47.730> was<00:04:48.180> able<00:04:48.360> to<00:04:49.290> actually

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
with the pan so I was able to actually

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.190 
with the pan so I was able to actually
do<00:04:50.070> that<00:04:50.280> technique<00:04:50.640> but<00:04:51.600> because<00:04:51.900> I<00:04:52.020> could

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
do that technique but because I could

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.260 
do that technique but because I could
get<00:04:52.380> to<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:52.650> wrong<00:04:52.830> side<00:04:53.220> it<00:04:53.490> was<00:04:53.640> easier<00:04:54.060> to

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
get to the wrong side it was easier to

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.630 
get to the wrong side it was easier to
put<00:04:54.450> the<00:04:54.570> patch<00:04:54.780> on<00:04:54.810> here<00:04:55.530> over<00:04:56.010> the<00:04:56.100> hole<00:04:56.340> and

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
put the patch on here over the hole and

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.920 
put the patch on here over the hole and
then<00:04:57.540> when<00:04:58.470> we<00:04:58.680> look<00:04:58.860> at<00:04:59.040> it<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.850> patch<00:05:00.150> is

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
then when we look at it the patch is

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.190 
then when we look at it the patch is
showing<00:05:01.530> through<00:05:01.830> the<00:05:02.040> hole<00:05:02.250> and<00:05:02.630> we<00:05:03.630> have<00:05:04.020> it

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
showing through the hole and we have it

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.340 
showing through the hole and we have it
fixed<00:05:04.590> in<00:05:04.920> with<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.340> panel<00:05:05.820> so<00:05:06.660> it<00:05:06.960> is<00:05:07.110> very

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
fixed in with the panel so it is very

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.770 
fixed in with the panel so it is very
difficult<00:05:07.890> because<00:05:08.070> number<00:05:08.760> one<00:05:08.970> it<00:05:09.419> doesn't

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
difficult because number one it doesn't

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.390 
difficult because number one it doesn't
change<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.200> feel<00:05:10.410> of<00:05:10.440> the<00:05:10.650> silk<00:05:10.919> it<00:05:11.100> stays

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
change the feel of the silk it stays

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.240 
change the feel of the silk it stays
soft<00:05:11.730> and<00:05:11.940> flexible<00:05:12.180> and<00:05:12.780> it's<00:05:13.650> difficult<00:05:13.919> to

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
soft and flexible and it's difficult to

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.730 
soft and flexible and it's difficult to
see<00:05:14.550> where<00:05:14.760> we've<00:05:14.940> patched<00:05:15.210> it<00:05:15.570> but<00:05:16.260> if<00:05:16.380> I<00:05:16.500> hold

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
see where we've patched it but if I hold

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.730 
see where we've patched it but if I hold
it<00:05:16.919> up<00:05:17.100> against<00:05:17.550> a<00:05:17.640> backlight<00:05:18.230> we<00:05:19.230> may<00:05:19.410> be<00:05:19.470> able

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
it up against a backlight we may be able

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.740 
it up against a backlight we may be able
to<00:05:20.160> see<00:05:20.580> that

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
to see that

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.830 
to see that
more<00:05:22.320> clearly<00:05:22.880> where<00:05:23.880> we've<00:05:24.120> actually<00:05:24.300> P

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
more clearly where we've actually P

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.830 
more clearly where we've actually P
stood<00:05:25.080> in

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.900 

you
