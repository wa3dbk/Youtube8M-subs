for<00:02:06.150> this<00:02:06.330> particular<00:02:06.900> guitar<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.650> only

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
for this particular guitar the only

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.940 
for this particular guitar the only
thing<00:02:08.340> that<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.610> don't<00:02:08.729> like<00:02:09.030> about<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.690> is<00:02:10.110> it

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
thing that I don't like about this is it

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.920 
thing that I don't like about this is it
when<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.190> move<00:02:11.430> it<00:02:11.550> back<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.880> forth<00:02:11.970> say

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
when I move it back and forth say

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.540 
when I move it back and forth say
there's<00:02:13.440> kind<00:02:13.740> of<00:02:13.770> like<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.980> hologram<00:02:14.370> effect

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
there's kind of like a hologram effect

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.000 
there's kind of like a hologram effect
of<00:02:15.030> one<00:02:15.209> side<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.690> other<00:02:15.720> as<00:02:16.260> if<00:02:16.440> it<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.770> that

van Green coming at ya it's not bad not
all<00:02:22.230> bad<00:02:22.500> top<00:02:22.800> it'll<00:02:23.340> make<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.520> fine<00:02:23.820> guitar<00:02:24.440> but

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
all bad top it'll make a fine guitar but

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.170 
all bad top it'll make a fine guitar but
that's<00:02:25.800> kind<00:02:26.070> of<00:02:26.130> like<00:02:26.280> once-in-a-lifetime

that's kind of like once-in-a-lifetime

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.430 
that's kind of like once-in-a-lifetime
wood<00:02:28.880> so<00:02:32.090> you<00:02:33.090> want<00:02:33.900> to<00:02:34.050> pick<00:02:34.230> for

wood so you want to pick for

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.970 
wood so you want to pick for
once-in-a-lifetime<00:02:35.040> talk<00:02:35.870> so<00:02:36.870> since<00:02:37.830> the

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
once-in-a-lifetime talk so since the

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.470 
once-in-a-lifetime talk so since the
pallet<00:02:38.310> jack<00:02:38.489> was<00:02:38.700> already<00:02:38.970> out<00:02:39.120> we<00:02:39.330> brought

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
pallet jack was already out we brought

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.150 
pallet jack was already out we brought
down<00:02:39.690> another<00:02:39.900> pallet<00:02:40.470> of<00:02:40.530> Adirondack<00:02:41.070> spruce

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
down another pallet of Adirondack spruce

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.930 
down another pallet of Adirondack spruce
and<00:02:41.550> checked<00:02:42.330> out<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.510> stuff<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:43.350> stack

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
and checked out the stuff in that stack

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.699 
and checked out the stuff in that stack
and<00:02:44.940> we<00:02:45.030> went<00:02:45.209> through<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.600> he<00:02:45.690> had<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.440> really

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
and we went through and he had a really

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.949 
and we went through and he had a really
really<00:02:47.010> interesting<00:02:47.190> almost<00:02:47.820> master<00:02:48.660> class

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
really interesting almost master class

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.640 
really interesting almost master class
of<00:02:50.030> looking<00:02:51.030> at<00:02:51.180> spruce<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.930> mean<00:02:52.170> Here<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.440> am

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
of looking at spruce I mean Here I am

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.039 
of looking at spruce I mean Here I am
sitting<00:02:53.130> with<00:02:53.370> Andy<00:02:53.670> powers<00:02:54.060> at<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.480> table<00:02:54.780> and

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
sitting with Andy powers at a table and

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.930 
sitting with Andy powers at a table and
we're<00:02:55.140> going<00:02:55.170> through<00:02:55.709> piece<00:02:56.549> after<00:02:56.760> piece

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
we're going through piece after piece

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.240 
we're going through piece after piece
and<00:02:57.420> he's<00:02:57.660> showing<00:02:57.930> me<00:02:58.049> he's<00:02:58.230> like<00:02:58.350> this<00:02:58.980> tree

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
and he's showing me he's like this tree

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.490 
and he's showing me he's like this tree
had<00:02:59.610> a<00:02:59.640> really<00:02:59.880> slow<00:03:00.180> first<00:03:00.540> you<00:03:01.019> know<00:03:01.110> fifty

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
had a really slow first you know fifty

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.410 
had a really slow first you know fifty
years<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.799> its<00:03:01.920> life<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.400> then<00:03:03.120> all<00:03:03.299> of<00:03:03.330> a

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
years of its life and then all of a

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.150 
years of its life and then all of a
sudden<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:04.170> know<00:03:04.200> things<00:03:04.650> got<00:03:04.799> a<00:03:04.860> little<00:03:05.010> bit

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
sudden you know things got a little bit

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.830 
sudden you know things got a little bit
easier<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:05.610> it<00:03:05.790> was<00:03:05.910> just<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.660> most

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
easier and it was just the most

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.400 
easier and it was just the most
interesting<00:03:07.350> way<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.500> look<00:03:07.739> at<00:03:07.890> wood<00:03:08.100> but<00:03:08.580> also

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
interesting way to look at wood but also

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.990 
interesting way to look at wood but also
kind<00:03:10.410> of<00:03:10.500> correlate<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.400> how<00:03:11.730> it<00:03:11.880> was

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
kind of correlate that to how it was

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.330 
kind of correlate that to how it was
going<00:03:12.150> to<00:03:12.209> sound<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.840> mean<00:03:13.230> two<00:03:13.950> pieces<00:03:14.310> of

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
Adirondack spruce that looked almost

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.690 
Adirondack spruce that looked almost
identical<00:03:15.959> had<00:03:16.799> extremely<00:03:17.459> different

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
identical had extremely different

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
planed adhesive what I thought was

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.950 
planed adhesive what I thought was
mahogany<00:04:37.760> he<00:04:38.030> just<00:04:38.240> left<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.479> wood<00:04:38.660> room<00:04:38.840> he's

candy store I mean it's ridiculous so

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.380 
candy store I mean it's ridiculous so
actually<00:04:49.400> it's<00:04:49.550> not<00:04:49.669> mahogany<00:04:50.270> it's

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:50.390

actually it's not mahogany it's
tasmanian<00:04:50.960> black<00:04:51.140> wood<00:04:51.970> but<00:04:52.970> we<00:04:53.120> were<00:04:53.210> just

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
tasmanian black wood but we were just

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.600 
tasmanian black wood but we were just
discussing<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:53.900> similarities<00:04:54.590> but<00:04:54.919> probably

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
discussing the similarities but probably

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.600 
discussing the similarities but probably
tonal<00:04:56.030> variations<00:04:56.600> that<00:04:56.810> correct<00:04:57.200> yep<00:04:57.830> it's

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
tonal variations that correct yep it's

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.640 
tonal variations that correct yep it's
like<00:04:58.880> mahogany<00:04:59.300> with<00:04:59.750> some<00:04:59.930> rosewood<00:05:00.320> mixed

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
like mahogany with some rosewood mixed

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.940 
like mahogany with some rosewood mixed
in<00:05:00.800> so<00:05:01.790> it's<00:05:01.970> like<00:05:02.560> mahogany<00:05:03.560> and<00:05:03.860> rosewood

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950
