00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
HCG does work however I have come to

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.820 
HCG does work however I have come to
believe<00:01:06.600> that<00:01:06.659> there's<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.080> wrong<00:01:07.380> way<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.619> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
believe that there's a wrong way and a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.730 
believe that there's a wrong way and a
right<00:01:07.860> way<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.280> do<00:01:08.610> HCG<00:01:09.320> because<00:01:10.320> my<00:01:10.500> first

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
right way to do HCG because my first

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.070 
right way to do HCG because my first
round<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.220> didn't<00:01:11.580> lose<00:01:11.790> anybody<00:01:12.210> fat<00:01:12.630> percent

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
round I didn't lose anybody fat percent

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.249 
round I didn't lose anybody fat percent
at<00:01:13.439> all<00:01:13.790> even<00:01:14.790> though<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.000> lost<00:01:15.240> fat<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.810> lost<00:01:16.080> so

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
at all even though I lost fat I lost so

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.109 
at all even though I lost fat I lost so
much<00:01:16.380> lean<00:01:16.619> mass<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.189> my<00:01:17.310> body<00:01:17.520> fat<00:01:17.729> percent

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
much lean mass that my body fat percent

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.420 
much lean mass that my body fat percent
didn't<00:01:18.420> change<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.590> do<00:01:19.830> think<00:01:20.220> you<00:01:20.280> can

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
didn't change so I do think you can

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.609 
didn't change so I do think you can
screw<00:01:20.700> it<00:01:20.790> up<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.750> do<00:01:21.810> think<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.140> can<00:01:22.350> do<00:01:22.470> it

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
screw it up and I do think you can do it

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.460 
screw it up and I do think you can do it
right<00:01:22.770> um<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:24.240> know<00:01:24.390> it's<00:01:24.990> important<00:01:25.380> to

right um and you know it's important to

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.710 
right um and you know it's important to
lose<00:01:25.590> fat<00:01:26.030> you<00:01:27.030> don't<00:01:27.210> if<00:01:27.299> that's<00:01:27.390> what<00:01:27.600> you

necessarily<00:01:50.700> I've<00:01:50.880> been<00:01:51.000> exercising<00:01:51.240> every

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
necessarily I've been exercising every
