00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
like I said the homing bow will make it

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.369 
like I said the homing bow will make it
via<00:00:54.210> off<00:00:54.449> so<00:00:54.629> if<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.780> am<00:00:54.930> over<00:00:55.170> here<00:00:56.899> if<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.260> got

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
to be in a certain distance at least

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.240 
to be in a certain distance at least
there<00:01:00.930> we<00:01:01.050> go<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.260> can<00:01:01.440> see<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.620> shot<00:01:01.949> over<00:01:02.190> in

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
there we go you can see I shot over in

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.920 
there we go you can see I shot over in
this<00:01:02.340> area<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.789> then<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.059> shot<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.690> sheep

over<00:01:04.229> here<00:01:04.760> so<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.210> explosive<00:01:06.840> arrow

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
over here so that is the explosive arrow

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.130 
over here so that is the explosive arrow
next<00:01:07.320> we<00:01:07.439> have<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.590> lightning<00:01:08.189> arrow<00:01:12.140> and

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
next we have the lightning arrow and

next we have the lightning arrow and
there<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.350> go<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.740> see<00:01:13.950> when<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.280> hits<00:01:14.520> it

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
there you go you can see when it hits it

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.499 
there you go you can see when it hits it
shoots<00:01:15.000> lightning<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:17.210> don't<00:01:18.210> know<00:01:18.270> why<00:01:18.450> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
shoots lightning I don't know why the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.820 
shoots lightning I don't know why the
lightning<00:01:18.960> arrow<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.200> not<00:01:19.229> picking<00:01:19.470> up<00:01:19.650> my

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
lightning arrow is not picking up my

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.270 
lightning arrow is not picking up my
machine<00:01:20.159> there<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.460> go<00:01:21.530> so<00:01:22.530> forces<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
machine there you go so forces a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.620 
machine there you go so forces a
lightning<00:01:23.700> bolt<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:24.000> come<00:01:24.150> down<00:01:24.330> out<00:01:24.360> of<00:01:24.570> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
lightning bolt to come down out of the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.539 
lightning bolt to come down out of the
sky<00:01:25.729> next<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:26.820> have<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.000> fire<00:01:27.600> arrow<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:29.280> what

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
sounds like it just sets a block plays

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.010 
sounds like it just sets a block plays
with<00:01:34.140> fire

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.260

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
hit just the ground it will spawn a

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.290 
hit just the ground it will spawn a
chicken<00:01:52.350> but<00:01:52.950> if<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.160> shoot<00:01:53.400> another<00:01:53.640> mob<00:01:54.000> it

that's the egg arrow now we have the ice
arrow<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.800> the<00:02:01.800> ice<00:02:01.920> arrow<00:02:02.220> is<00:02:02.490> really<00:02:03.060> just

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
arrow and the ice arrow is really just

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.000 
arrow and the ice arrow is really just
something<00:02:03.570> simple<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:04.320> places<00:02:04.710> ice

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
something simple that just places ice

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.750 
something simple that just places ice
blocks<00:02:05.400> in<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.300> ground<00:02:06.720> I<00:02:07.520> don't<00:02:08.520> think<00:02:08.670> it

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
blocks in the ground I don't think it

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:14.150 
blocks in the ground I don't think it
does<00:02:08.850> anything<00:02:09.119> on<00:02:09.390> land<00:02:09.690> nor<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.340> mobs<00:02:13.160> so

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
does anything on land nor to the mobs so

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.820 
does anything on land nor to the mobs so
yeah<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.730> ILO<00:02:15.090> really<00:02:15.590> isn't<00:02:16.590> all<00:02:16.710> that

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
yeah the ILO really isn't all that

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.410 
yeah the ILO really isn't all that
useful<00:02:18.770> so<00:02:19.770> that<00:02:20.160> is<00:02:20.340> the<00:02:20.520> elemental<00:02:21.180> arrows
