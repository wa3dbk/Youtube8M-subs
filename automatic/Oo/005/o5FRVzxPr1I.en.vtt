00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
these jars again instead of just

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.410 
these jars again instead of just
throwing<00:00:12.780> them<00:00:13.230> away<00:00:13.670> so<00:00:14.670> step<00:00:14.969> 1<00:00:15.150> i'm<00:00:15.269> just

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
throwing them away so step 1 i'm just

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.580 
throwing them away so step 1 i'm just
going<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.599> go<00:00:15.690> ahead<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:15.990> peel<00:00:16.170> off<00:00:16.379> this

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
going to go ahead and peel off this

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.740 
going to go ahead and peel off this
front<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.070> label<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.640> is<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.150> little<00:00:18.330> bit<00:00:18.480> hard

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
front to label it is a little bit hard

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.170 
front to label it is a little bit hard
to<00:00:18.810> take<00:00:19.020> off<00:00:19.170> at<00:00:19.320> first<00:00:19.560> but<00:00:19.920> i<00:00:20.189> like<00:00:20.699> how<00:00:20.939> once

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
to take off at first but i like how once

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.029 
to take off at first but i like how once
you<00:00:21.390> actually<00:00:21.689> peel<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.289> off<00:00:22.410> there<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.830> no

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
you actually peel it off there is no

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.040 
you actually peel it off there is no
messy<00:00:23.279> residue<00:00:23.850> left<00:00:24.119> over<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.869> glass

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
messy residue left over on the glass

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.429 
messy residue left over on the glass
there<00:00:25.490> is<00:00:26.490> also<00:00:27.000> a<00:00:27.240> label<00:00:27.689> on<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.869> bottom<00:00:28.199> but

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
there is also a label on the bottom but

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.570 
there is also a label on the bottom but
we'll<00:00:28.560> go<00:00:28.710> ahead<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:28.920> just<00:00:29.070> worry<00:00:29.250> about<00:00:29.310> that

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
we'll go ahead and just worry about that

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.790 
we'll go ahead and just worry about that
later<00:00:29.779> so<00:00:30.779> step<00:00:31.080> 2<00:00:31.289> we're<00:00:31.500> going<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.679> go<00:00:31.769> ahead

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
later so step 2 we're going to go ahead

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.130 
later so step 2 we're going to go ahead
and<00:00:31.949> put<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.430> candle<00:00:32.820> in<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.059> freezer<00:00:33.420> this

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
and put the candle in the freezer this

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.560 
and put the candle in the freezer this
is<00:00:34.320> just<00:00:34.530> going<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:35.070> help<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.760> wax<00:00:36.000> separate

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
is just going to help the wax separate

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.299 
is just going to help the wax separate
from<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.960> glass<00:00:37.200> itself<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:38.010> just<00:00:38.160> make<00:00:38.280> it

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
from the glass itself and just make it

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.910 
from the glass itself and just make it
easier<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.850> take<00:00:39.059> out<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:40.200> 30<00:00:40.500> minutes<00:00:40.770> later

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
easier to take out so 30 minutes later

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.639 
easier to take out so 30 minutes later
we're<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.250> going<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.579> pop<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.750> glass<00:00:43.350> back

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
we're just going to pop the glass back

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.889 
we're just going to pop the glass back
out<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.129> freezer<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.940> as<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.719> can<00:00:45.870> see

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
out of the freezer and as you can see

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.080 
out of the freezer and as you can see
the<00:00:46.440> wax<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:46.980> started<00:00:47.280> already<00:00:47.489> cracked<00:00:47.879> up

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the wax is started already cracked up

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.690 
the wax is started already cracked up
which<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> really<00:00:48.870> really<00:00:49.230> good<00:00:49.590> sign<00:00:49.860> now

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
which is a really really good sign now

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.040 
which is a really really good sign now
we're<00:00:50.820> go<00:00:51.000> ahead<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.510> take<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> butter

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
we're go ahead and just take a butter

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.410 
we're go ahead and just take a butter
knife<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.559> carefully<00:00:53.100> start<00:00:53.820> separating<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
knife and carefully start separating the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.869 
knife and carefully start separating the
wax<00:00:54.629> from<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.050> glass<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:56.160> carefully<00:00:56.610> going

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
wax from the glass just carefully going

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.910 
wax from the glass just carefully going
around<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.329> perimeter<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.109> wax<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.739> just

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
around the perimeter of the wax and just

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.099 
around the perimeter of the wax and just
separating<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.699> carefully<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.750> just<00:01:00.930> taking

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
separating it carefully and just taking

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.870 
separating it carefully and just taking
your<00:01:01.289> time

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
your time

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.430 
your time
so<00:01:03.330> once<00:01:03.540> that<00:01:03.630> is<00:01:03.930> done<00:01:03.960> we're<00:01:04.230> gonna<00:01:04.320> go

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
so once that is done we're gonna go

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.860 
so once that is done we're gonna go
ahead<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.890> carefully<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.970> brake<00:01:06.120> off<00:01:06.450> chunks

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
ahead and carefully and brake off chunks

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.070 
ahead and carefully and brake off chunks
of<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.320> wax<00:01:07.590> it'll<00:01:08.430> be<00:01:08.700> fairly<00:01:08.940> easy<00:01:09.150> for

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
of the wax it'll be fairly easy for

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.900 
of the wax it'll be fairly easy for
everything<00:01:10.410> to<00:01:10.500> come<00:01:10.530> out<00:01:10.800> and<00:01:11.460> now<00:01:11.790> we're

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.270 
we're gonna add and just fill up the
candle<00:01:27.060> glass<00:01:27.870> holder<00:01:28.260> with<00:01:28.560> some<00:01:28.860> warm<00:01:29.100> water

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
candle glass holder with some warm water

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.390 
candle glass holder with some warm water
and<00:01:29.640> let<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.210> sit<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:30.600> about<00:01:30.870> 15<00:01:31.470> minutes<00:01:31.740> this

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
and let it sit for about 15 minutes this

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.580 
and let it sit for about 15 minutes this
is<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:32.850> going<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.150> help<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.900> wax<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
is just going to help the wax and the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.440 
is just going to help the wax and the
glue<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.280> inside<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> glass<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.330> to

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
glue that is inside the glass just to

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.600 
glue that is inside the glass just to
carefully<00:01:37.440> loosen<00:01:37.680> up<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.130> it'll<00:01:38.220> be<00:01:38.280> easier

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610
