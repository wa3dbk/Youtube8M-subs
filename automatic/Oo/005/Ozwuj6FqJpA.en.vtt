00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.790
 yes, a wonderful afternoon 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:09.269
 here is again pearl tv with this one 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:13.200
 gadget of the day is ripe and I will 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.299
 Now try our two devices 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.600
 Start here for at least 1 of them 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.609
 and I look forward to it because the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.150
 here is really a classic from 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.849
 quadrocopter four engines and here in front 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.010
 yet he takes an extra camera and 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.830
 a hd so I have to say I was already 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.320
 as a toddler so totally fascinated about 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.390
 helicopter where everything flies and 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.270
 now these quadrocopter are the ones 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.820
 of course, again a piece better and 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.050
 I see you are profi but that 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.239
 can actually be a lay fast 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.460
 has to learn within five minutes 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.160
 the shots and then the movements 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.530
 Can you fly that part and you have 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.559
 It just mentions it is really great 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.649
 is of course still a hd camera with 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:02.370
 board and so I can mine 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:04.140
 Environment excellent filming up to 800 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.080
 photos or 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.540
 30 minutes of video recordings are 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.210
 so possible and I'll take some photos 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.070
 from a completely different perspective 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.110
 and the whole thing is then saved on 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.119
 a sd card I then without 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.670
 make problems when their calculation 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.560
 can and rest there once around again 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.170
 watch and harry on the man 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.549
 back to the child or those are toys 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.659
 I spend hours with them 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.640
 can deal with 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.390
 but now we have a first 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:40.200
 Zuspieler shows our colleague how 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:41.729
 the whole thing works so i realize 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.369
 the camera even has problems with that 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.780
 to follow the plane fast and clear 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.549
 maneuverable and he survives that way 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.770
 easy crash so if you like it now 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.049
 poor catches you then can also 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.159
 let's go but he puts it without 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.990
 problems away 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.090
 So you do not have to worry that 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.619
 get a once let down 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.600
 then yes even one today 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.020
 protection corp which one can order 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.869
 so that the rotors too 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:13.010
 You should be protected more often 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.200
 so my fear that indoor plants 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.280
 We already have some leaves with us 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.410
 clearly blessed because you do not have that much 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.379
 So let's try it again 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.030
 to get the thing in the air that way 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:27.890
 funny whenever i go to then too 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.200
 said hello to my father 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.940
 I like it because you do not need something like that 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.450
 that meanwhile also a need 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.790
 you do not but it is incredibly fun 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.010
 and once you are like that 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.900
 Then you want to develop a fever 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.640
 do not stop then you are 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.819
 fascinated by the flow characteristics 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.799
 our patrol koppers and then I can 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.290
 can we go fly at night the 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:54.650
 has wonderful LED lights on customers 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.120
 and unauthorized trips was you 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.250
 but shalt our our cameramen 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.000
 please do not fresh save the 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:04.250
 All were my thumbs first, I hope 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.440
 it comes down to some extent how much 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.720
 By the way , we have fun there 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.150
 also three speed levels 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.889
 So this can be slower 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.739
 for the beginner to try and 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:19.010
 then of course advanced and the 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:21.109
 Profiles when they were professionals back then 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.700
 sometimes fly at night that they have animals 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:28.250
 out and just with these four rotors that 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.900
 There are no motorless rotors there 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.880
 was very flexible and you 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.769
 is also very stable in the air yes 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.519
 and the recordings you as 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.519
 unique 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.260
 they gnaw my ladies can harry can 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.769
 Do not stop because that's how it is 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.140
 is a real addiction potential 94 eur 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:51.590
 91 that's the price for 100, by the way 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.450
 great quadrocopter here and we see 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.099
 here again in the recordings 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.440
 even at dusk how great the 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:02.780
 looks yes and the order as the 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.579
 mx 12 32 and the 5600 times right 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.099
 fun is not just fun for the little ones 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:10.099
 even the big kids just that 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.569
 You do not show that in the game 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.730
 remembered that there is such a thing 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.489
 want 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.769
 yes, there was the first styrofoam base 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.810
 flirting and that was not so stable and 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.120
 now he has even one more year in the 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.660
 the thing keeps stable down here then 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.729
 these cameras and with this chip 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.010
 cards put the bet in the back 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:31.400
 and then you can take great pictures 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:34.270
 do 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.070
 So that's something I mean 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.840
 plane park will be expanded again so 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.000
 have fun in addition to great 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.220
 recordings and again for little 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.370
 lent money fulfilled her 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.370
 childhood-dream
