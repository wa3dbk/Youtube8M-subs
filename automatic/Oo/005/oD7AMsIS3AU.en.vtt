00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
we guys put it on a lot of waiting

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.550 
we guys put it on a lot of waiting
between<00:00:54.940> there<00:00:55.270> because<00:00:56.140> is<00:00:56.260> that<00:00:56.290> just

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
between there because is that just

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.630 
between there because is that just
hydrating<00:00:56.950> or<00:00:57.900> so<00:00:58.900> reading<00:00:59.290> I<00:00:59.460> think<00:01:00.460> would<00:01:00.610> be

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
hydrating or so reading I think would be

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:16.109 
hydrating or so reading I think would be
smug<00:01:01.239> yeah<00:01:05.520> actually<00:01:14.369> enough<00:01:15.369> we're<00:01:15.790> too<00:01:15.910> much

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
smug yeah actually enough we're too much

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:28.230 
smug yeah actually enough we're too much
right<00:01:26.460> does<00:01:27.460> that<00:01:27.550> affect<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:27.970> speed<00:01:28.180> a

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
right does that affect the speed a

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:39.719 
right does that affect the speed a
little<00:01:28.330> bit<00:01:28.540> to<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.950> does<00:01:30.130> yeah<00:01:30.340> right

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.910 

like<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:41.210> military<00:01:41.720> when<00:01:41.900> they<00:01:42.020> do<00:01:42.140> maneuvers

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920

and I think you mentioned this to me

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.140 
and I think you mentioned this to me
before<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.780> guys<00:01:56.960> at<00:01:57.470> 135<00:01:58.100> our<00:01:58.640> bigger<00:01:58.910> guys

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
before the guys at 135 our bigger guys

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.510 
before the guys at 135 our bigger guys
sucking<00:01:59.990> down<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:00.290> 135<00:02:00.770> so<00:02:01.040> is<00:02:01.130> there<00:02:01.310> a<00:02:01.340> lot<00:02:01.460> of

sucking down to 135 so is there a lot of

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:41.650 
sucking down to 135 so is there a lot of
