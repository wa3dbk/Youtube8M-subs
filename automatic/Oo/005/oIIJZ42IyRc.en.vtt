00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:02.600
 and january 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.230
 Lucas's boyfriend 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.190
 and today that the crisis is over I told them 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.639
 as rapporteur the deputy 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.679
 first you have to rest and you need a program called an animal 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:14.539
 catch 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:18.550
 You will not find it here but then I think the GM's sit here are 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.140
 given the fact that I'm counting on you 

00:00:24.159 --> 00:00:25.390
 that's when I 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.390
 chest 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.080
 so the problem 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.480
 Olympic 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.480
 on the same date on the 20th because 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.520
 log in 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.550
 I highlight here 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.359
 not look for one of the last program 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.659
 I saw that this year can leave the actor's attitude as 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.540
 according to the deputy the notary 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.190
 the sector will have one of the notebooks sta 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.670
 alexandre that you are crazy 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.300
 and be there 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.300
 currently 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.700
 in the final phase and until it has no virus and nothing wrong the computer 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.270
 and it's not too little 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.050
 so i opened 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.050
 then the merchant putting himself abroad 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.990
 I must be a reference in the region. 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.000
 in this technique called 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.310
 until then he was a star is perfect this draft acts 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.310
 and hence the charge of 7 thousand hectares 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.690
 so that's it I hope so 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.630
 the french senate 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.110
 to be recorded later this year 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.490
 because it's easy 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.710
 in the intestine internal crisis 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:58.979
 want to participate 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.510

 You click on Sydney here. 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.880
 which is going to be the same as the one charged 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.550
 the notary's office 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.709
 you can never win 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.050
 I hope the crowd of the team no doubt no limitation 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:15.700
