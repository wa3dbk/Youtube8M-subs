00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:15.640
 hi all let's make a cake 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:18.510
 Puff pastry stuffed with angel hair 

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:22.680
 for this we are 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:25.220
 two puff pastry plates 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.220
 yes 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.120
 there was a little bit of flour from below 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:37.010
 so that we are not 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:39.770
 well we need a boat or two of 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.890
 angel hair 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.460
 icing sugar and a little bit of flour 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:51.190
 we have it for this a little paper 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:54.070
 to put in the oven 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.860
 the trains follow 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.640
 this paper is very very 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.640
 so is 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:10.550
 and that we do not need to 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:12.840
 to grease the counts looks with this 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.070
 it suits us very well 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.070
 we are beautiful sand 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.260
 two 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.940
 [Music] 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.039
 do not extend us a little bit because not much 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.540
 had a little 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.540
 and we're going to put it right here 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.710
 then it does not remove violence 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.610
 fill in 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.610
 in the blood 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.700
 well, we have extended our 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.350
 angel hair and now let's get wet 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.540
 a little bit with water 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.700
 this can be done with egg also or 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.550
 water does not happen anything is for the other 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.550
 part of the mass sticks 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.660
 we already see him with the other part of what 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.660
 same 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.650
 this is a dough a ball tart 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.849
 its veracity 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.630
 we have ten minutes ready 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.090
 and beyond 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.420
 there is no 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.420
 i 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.700
 it comes out a little bit and assures us the daddy 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.440
 over here, we cut it 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.000
 [Music] 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.000
 let's stay I started more curious 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.200
 and now we do the same with this one 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.200
 bit 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.670
 I told myself that it can be done with 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.500
 eggs 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.610
 they are not a little water 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.610
 [Music] 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.689
 with the egg is a little more golden 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:47.290
 and we are going to throw 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:50.159
 if not 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.159
 a little bit of 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.610
 icing sugar 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.100
 while now we have the oven 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.350
 preheated we have put it to 200 that 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.860
 it's hot, we're going to put it in there 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.720
 Until we get golden, I do not say 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.970
 the minutes because I always say the same 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.040
 it depends on each oven has its time 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.549
 then when we see it golden brown the 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:24.139
 we take out 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:27.470
 Well, we have our cake here 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:31.340
 of puff pastry we have left almost 17 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:34.819
 minutes a bit of the return maybe with 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.819
 two or three minutes less would have been 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:40.990
 a little bit I give sugar before 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:45.229
 that we were to medicate a little 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:48.860
 so then this is seen as 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:51.199
 we like but if left 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.270
 a few minutes less maybe better 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.069
 we do not encourage you to do what you have 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.430
 seen that it is very fast that in ten 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:05:02.560
 minutes we have the cake made many 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.560
 thank you and see you in the next video
