 friends 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.940
 it was the year of 1839 when the physicist 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.579
 french luis jacobo dagger discovered a 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.089
 new science and a new art 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.960
 the photograph that at first and for 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.390
 the surname of the inventor lager was called 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.840
 daguerreotype 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:16.240
 what was it to raise awareness of 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.670
 metal plate with a layer of iodide 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.130
 Silver achieve the image in the camera 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.470
 dark and reveal it and fix it with 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.960
 mercury vapors 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.050
 it remains quiet as a statue of 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.730
 ivory does not move because it does not know Swedish 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.270
 and it's not the nice thing that this platform 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:37.210
 moves seen badass sends the king have 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.190
 the explanation now yes in garrocha and 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.700
 with the view here that will fall irún 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.700
 for singing 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:49.789
 ah 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.890
 this will cost them dearly they cost again 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.049
 well because in addition to the photo he owes us 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.659
 an order of starry eggs in a 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.250
 principle was not yet possible to take 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.350
 snapshots but only pictures of 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.500
 time that sometimes took so long 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.470
 that a young man who posed like this at the end 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.750
 the bottle was in place but little by little 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.230
 the art was perfected 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:18.650
 Photographic and now even children 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.230
 can take impeccable photographs me 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.420
 are you going to portray of the whole body or of 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.090
 look for us today of week since if the 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.489
 take bust because it does not fit but the one 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.319
 I remember he took her bust and with a lot 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:36.500
 taste again as time goes by 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:39.140
 we arrived in 1895 when the German doctor 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.900
 william rue kings discovered the rays 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.780
 x that they deserved the Nobel Prize 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.980
 physical in 1900 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:51.709
 and poor thing and they do not die is not son 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.400
 mine you have not heard about the rays 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:58.390
 cathodic as not doña isabel and don 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.180
 fernando those were the Catholic kings 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.800
 but here thanks to the cathode rays 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.250
 we can see through the human body 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.610
 and observe the bones look at it more than one 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.819
 same, look how interesting you are here 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.520
 the tibia so let's see if it gets hot 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:19.880
 let us go to recreate the girl this 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.160
 is the eighth rib is false face and what 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.080
 that are the things because it seemed good 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.720
 but then you see that you do not have to trust 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.170
 of appearances and this other bone is 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.350
 the rap and that does not have television then 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:36.740
 what a delayed girl 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:41.450
 He kept running the time and we got to 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.670
 london in 1927 when bieber had 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.280
 invented a shoe polish for footwear that 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.090
 had some success among the shoeshine boys 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.090
 Londoners 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.920
 will not complain sir winston were from before 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.920
 and stop them from throwing 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.900
 [Music] 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.170
 but when bieber dreamed of an idea 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:17.389
 brighter I was experimenting for 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:19.609
 invent nothing less than television 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.129
 and with the little that the tulle produced 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.080
 shoemaker was installed in an attic 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:26.720
 a poor neighborhood of london 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.610
 can hardly believe but his first 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.879
 team built it with boxes of 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.300
 cookies pieces of cardboard ribbons 

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:37.759
 wood some prismatic lenses the engine 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.030
 of a motorcycle and a lamp 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:44.689
 projector inside a tea box today 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.969
 he was not going to watch soap operas and in a 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:49.669
 fourth of that attic installed the 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:54.169
 projector and in the room together the 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:56.569
 receiver and the stack figure a doll 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.969
 of ventriloquist was the first 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:02.539
 managed to televise in the history of 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:05.300
 prodigious invention was already a reality 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:07.460
 of the video but now urged him to 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.190
 inventor a human being to transmit 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.430
 I wanted to have movement in the image 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.740
 received the first one who passed a buttons 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.680
 of a hotel he gave a tip so that 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.229
 come up let's remember for the story the 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.779
 name of that boy was called 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:26.190
 guillermo tempted and was the first person 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:29.130
 televised live 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:32.490
 a little after the historic night of 8 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:35.400
 April 1927 was the first 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:37.160
 remote transmission from the top of 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.650
 a building in the trafalgar square 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.570
 large infrared aces 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.910
 illuminated Nelson's column before the 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.520
 surprised west end crowd of 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.230
 london was believed to be a fire and 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.210
 until firefighters arrived 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:53.270
 they were about to spoil what 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:57.210
 that then it was not yet called 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:06:00.420
 television but doctor abyss does not 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.030
 make distinguished tragahumo if we do not 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.740
 the fire is coming to the rigging 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.560
 Well, they do not realize they are rays 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.050
 infracol now two in the museum victoria 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.840
 and Alberto de Londres is preserved as 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.830
 a relic that primitive apparatus 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:19.860
 which I saw but the father of the video 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:22.580
 he died in 1946 when he was about 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:26.380
 to invent color television 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:29.390
 glory that fit the Mexican 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:32.420
 gonzález camarena now 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:36.290
 to remember those precursors them 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:38.660
 we render the most fervent homage but 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:41.060
 to complete the thing what made them 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:45.210
 lack was to invent the announcers and the 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:46.440
 commercial let's make favor 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:58.260
 all right
