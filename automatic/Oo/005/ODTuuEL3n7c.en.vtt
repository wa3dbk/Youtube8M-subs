lower<00:01:37.619> vantage<00:01:38.100> point<00:01:38.400> right<00:01:38.610> here<00:01:38.939> my<00:01:39.570> lower

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
lower vantage point right here my lower

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.679 
lower vantage point right here my lower
vantage<00:01:40.170> point<00:01:40.470> does<00:01:40.650> two<00:01:40.860> things<00:01:40.890> for<00:01:41.369> me

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
vantage point does two things for me

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.850 
vantage point does two things for me
since<00:01:42.689> I'm<00:01:42.840> going<00:01:43.020> down<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.380> steps<00:01:43.649> it's

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
since I'm going down the steps it's

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.649 
since I'm going down the steps it's
putting<00:01:44.070> me<00:01:44.220> further<00:01:44.460> away<00:01:44.759> from<00:01:44.790> them<00:01:45.180> which

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
putting me further away from them which

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.210 
putting me further away from them which
means<00:01:45.899> I<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.259> zoom<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.009> what's<00:01:47.159> that

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
means I have to zoom in and what's that

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.370 
means I have to zoom in and what's that
going<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.549> do<00:01:47.759> I'm<00:01:48.689> waiting<00:01:48.990> for<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.140> answer

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
going to do I'm waiting for that answer

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.780 
going to do I'm waiting for that answer
it's<00:01:49.740> going<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.009> make<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.220> background<00:01:50.399> get

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
it's going to make the background get

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.100 
it's going to make the background get
bigger<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.540> it's<00:01:51.659> going<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.869> make<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
bigger so it's going to make the

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.679 
bigger so it's going to make the
pavilion<00:01:52.649> get<00:01:52.799> even<00:01:53.070> larger<00:01:53.310> for<00:01:53.759> me<00:01:54.479> right

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
pavilion get even larger for me right

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.020 
pavilion get even larger for me right
here<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.229> it's<00:01:55.799> sort<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.100> minimizes<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
here and it's sort of minimizes the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.090 
here and it's sort of minimizes the
situation<00:01:57.719> with<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.710> colored

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
situation with that this colored

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.740 
situation with that this colored
sidewalk<00:01:59.670> we<00:01:59.820> got<00:01:59.969> a<00:02:00.000> little<00:02:00.180> bit<00:02:00.390> less<00:02:00.600> of

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
sidewalk we got a little bit less of

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.109 
sidewalk we got a little bit less of
