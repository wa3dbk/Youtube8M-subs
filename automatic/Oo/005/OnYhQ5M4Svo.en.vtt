00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
out I have yet to do that because we

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.099 
out I have yet to do that because we

have such pristine water because of the

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:13.179 
have such pristine water because of the
other<00:01:12.200> glass<00:01:12.409> I'll<00:01:12.799> show<00:01:12.950> you<00:01:13.039> that<00:01:13.130> later

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
other glass I'll show you that later

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.819 
other glass I'll show you that later
that<00:01:13.700> looks<00:01:13.909> great

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:14.829 
that looks great

that looks great
the<00:01:15.829> modular<00:01:16.249> just<00:01:16.460> plugs<00:01:16.670> into<00:01:16.819> the<00:01:16.969> bottom

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270 
the modular just plugs into the bottom

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.219 
the modular just plugs into the bottom
here<00:01:17.479> it's<00:01:17.780> real<00:01:18.170> simple<00:01:18.670> right<00:01:19.670> here<00:01:19.880> I<00:01:20.229> have

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
here it's real simple right here I have

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.950 
here it's real simple right here I have
it<00:01:21.409> for<00:01:21.590> 120<00:01:22.119> and<00:01:23.119> that<00:01:23.329> scalding<00:01:23.749> hot

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
it for 120 and that scalding hot

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.660 
it for 120 and that scalding hot
I<00:01:24.229> also<00:01:25.390> insulated<00:01:26.390> the<00:01:27.200> hot<00:01:27.799> water<00:01:28.009> to<00:01:28.429> the

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
I also insulated the hot water to the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.359 
I also insulated the hot water to the
other<00:01:29.450> hallway<00:01:30.200> thrill<00:01:30.679> at<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:30.859> house<00:01:31.009> that

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
other hallway thrill at the house that

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.520 
other hallway thrill at the house that
maintains<00:01:31.789> about<00:01:32.090> 4<00:01:32.840> degrees<00:01:32.929> difference

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
maintains about 4 degrees difference

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.529 
maintains about 4 degrees difference
from<00:01:33.889> the<00:01:34.009> furthest<00:01:34.310> point<00:01:34.369> which<00:01:34.939> is<00:01:35.119> tomates

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
from the furthest point which is tomates

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.469 
from the furthest point which is tomates
to<00:01:35.659> be<00:01:35.749> about<00:01:35.929> 75<00:01:36.439> feet<00:01:36.909> it<00:01:37.909> also<00:01:38.030> maintains

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
to be about 75 feet it also maintains

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.550 
to be about 75 feet it also maintains
the<00:01:39.079> heat<00:01:39.289> in<00:01:39.469> the<00:01:40.039> pipe<00:01:40.429> for<00:01:40.670> a<00:01:40.729> lot<00:01:40.880> longer<00:01:41.030> so

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
the heat in the pipe for a lot longer so

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.529 
the heat in the pipe for a lot longer so
if<00:01:42.560> you're<00:01:42.829> going<00:01:43.069> up<00:01:43.189> all<00:01:43.819> night<00:01:44.030> not<00:01:44.240> running

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
if you're going up all night not running

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.330 
if you're going up all night not running
it<00:01:44.659> it<00:01:44.810> takes<00:01:45.020> about<00:01:45.139> 35<00:01:45.530> seconds<00:01:46.100> to<00:01:46.130> get<00:01:46.310> to

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
it it takes about 35 seconds to get to

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.059 
it it takes about 35 seconds to get to
the<00:01:46.520> furthest<00:01:47.289> faucet<00:01:48.289> so<00:01:48.560> that's<00:01:48.889> something

00:01:49.059 --> 00:01:49.069 
the furthest faucet so that's something

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:53.319 
the furthest faucet so that's something
to<00:01:49.189> know<00:01:49.280> -<00:01:49.659> gasps<00:01:50.740> that<00:01:51.740> wasn't<00:01:52.159> I<00:01:52.429> don't<00:01:53.149> know

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
to know - gasps that wasn't I don't know
