 But something similar could actually be your own color pictures

 to a dense scientist the mountain is

 crack hackers the American military has been great for decades 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.120
 Height the Soviet Union observed corner special attention was given to the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.840
 Soviet nuclear tests the Foris it could well be that even in 1947 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.180
 trying to detect such a test by infrared and it could 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.520
 also being an infrared signal of other civilizations 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.360
 was caught because with infrared information about 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.480
 The DAX transmits interstellar distances 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.140
 Jailbreaks Back to the Shadows is apparently the other civilizations one

 Embassy in Vienna he briefly acts sda it could be unique on such 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.070
 Message was sticking out of the noise in the forest making it easier to 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.090
 would be discovering 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.130
 besides, he is the airport the easiest of all political system one 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.870
 The farewell message is easy to decode and not understand 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.430
 only her niece 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.730
 was the starting signal 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.830
 is pigs Alien civilization would first be a simple signal 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.620
 send out that is easy to discover since March, the county PI eBay as 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.560
 Information in it very suitable 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.180
 because every civilization is smart enough to send and receive 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.280
 to construct was PI Cham 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.390
 So I think that we would first receive such a signal v 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.970
 then we would probably feel a more refined the signal on 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.570
 that much more complex information contains Brigitte Enzmann Stock on 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.790
 Pacific people

 Eric Becker as the Klauer 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.860
 I think it's possible even for a signal from the signal 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.000
 not from a biological but from an intelligent machine 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.280
 but we are of biological origin we tend to assume 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.540
 that great earthly ones would have to be too 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.940
 but perhaps they have developed machines that are fast 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.190
 can improve themselves if they are not subject to the Darwinian 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.670
 Judge evolution theory 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.730
 a machine can travel safely through the universe 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.930
 she can divide up, she can use every thinkable source of energy and she can 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.360
 can carry a large amount of information 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.230
 Apart from the fact that the transmitter sends out a signal definitely one 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.990
 machine 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.560
 and we should adjust to the serial possibility that this 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.929
 Machine in the service of another machine is Herbert 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:15.079
 but after I have already

 In the first six years of her research program, the Sci 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:23.049
 Receive dozens of signals that could be extraterrestrial origin 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.680
 Through extensive analysis of the physicist port project, almost all of them could 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.709
 Be assigned to a rung jump 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.069
 but to this day there are still five signals whose origin is unclear
