00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.249 
strong it's not too overbearing and
that's<00:02:05.340> what<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.549> like<00:02:05.790> about<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.420> do<00:02:07.140> not

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
that's what I like about it I do not

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.120 
that's what I like about it I do not
like<00:02:07.560> real<00:02:07.799> strong<00:02:08.190> scents<00:02:08.879> and

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
like real strong scents and

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.020 
like real strong scents and
this<00:02:10.640> is<00:02:10.850> not<00:02:11.030> too<00:02:11.300> strong<00:02:11.720> for<00:02:12.110> any<00:02:12.290> room<00:02:13.030> it

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
this is not too strong for any room it

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.960 
this is not too strong for any room it
does<00:02:14.510> its<00:02:14.690> job<00:02:14.750> it<00:02:15.320> as<00:02:15.590> a<00:02:15.980> pleasant<00:02:16.280> smell<00:02:16.730> to

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
does its job it as a pleasant smell to

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.120 
does its job it as a pleasant smell to
the<00:02:17.060> room<00:02:17.270> but<00:02:17.870> it<00:02:18.020> doesn't<00:02:18.320> just<00:02:18.500> overwhelm

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
the room but it doesn't just overwhelm

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.740 
the room but it doesn't just overwhelm
me<00:02:19.310> so<00:02:19.580> that's<00:02:19.760> what<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:19.970> like<00:02:20.210> about<00:02:20.390> it<00:02:20.630> as

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
me so that's what I like about it as

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.170 
me so that's what I like about it as
well<00:02:20.990> so<00:02:21.230> I<00:02:21.620> would<00:02:21.980> highly<00:02:22.430> recommend<00:02:23.030> the

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
well so I would highly recommend the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.050 
well so I would highly recommend the
Glade<00:02:23.510> solid<00:02:24.260> air<00:02:24.410> fresheners<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.190> I<00:02:25.730> really

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
Glade solid air fresheners and I really

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.800
