00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.839
 my friends one thing that I love them 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:09.120
 share today is here we are going to see these 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:09.120
 visits that by the way are bad betxÃ­ 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.330
 is that the worms are from the baits 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.769
 more attractive to the fish I have seen 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.230
 people who use earthworms 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.830
 land even to fish in the sea with 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:20.830
 very good results 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.119
 both times where we do it more 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.509
 prohibitive in fishing almost any 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.180
 fish as big as a boy is going to 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.430
 enter the earthworms the carps the 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.949
 You will mojar the bassins the catfish all 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.090
 everything practically eat worms the 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:38.040
 problem of man is that he does not always 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.140
 they get then I bring them these 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.909
 options I tell you of chasm I do not have in 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.040
 two sizes in five centimeters in 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:46.649
 seven centimeters these who live in the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.510
 darkness even more in the catalog now 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.339
 come these new groups suit in 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.890
 several colors in black in chartres in 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.710
 lumo colors that shine in the dark 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.570
 this horrifying medium color beats from 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.449
 then mentions test is a color pitch 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.820
 this or red color got beats that I do not 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.920
 it gave him credibility but there in the pc 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.590
 the doll a compass when a little group of 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.439
 these of this color I put a scrub 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.750
 there with the payrolls I brought my pallets 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.369
 years of age like you heard me quoted the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.930
 roll came successful profit I put a 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.210
 good dragged then that's why I 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.590
 I 'm wearing this merthiolate color because 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.290
 I learned an election all 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.180
 colors work 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.470
 I brought these other larvae that these 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.480
 they are also the most who live in the 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.640
 darkness in this color that I mentioned to you 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.770
 the color, hello, you are in color 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.690
 natural white you are a little more 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.930
 small others that live in the dark 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.460
 also smaller than these others 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.100
 that I have here that are bigger than 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.800
 they have the perfect consistency of a 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.500
 worm these there are in the things 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.720
 rotten of these worms of the 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.210
 flies that are of the species or of the 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.280
 preferred prey of fish and 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.350
 we comment here in the catalog in this 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.710
 new catalog that we made of the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.420
 soft lures that those who go 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.400
 starting that many of my clients are 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.560
 people who are starting do not look for 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.459
 large species do not look for equipment 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.610
 look for light equipment start 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.800
 to try small fish do not want 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.770
 run first that walks on this road 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.230
 of fishing and this one start walking 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.630
 with light equipment use light lines 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.520
 take out tiny fish because a fish 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.410
 big maybe I do not say no what 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.360
 they can always always take out 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.120
 get a big fish but 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.850
 they will lose the fine touch they teach 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.800
 little by little with tiny fish that 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.130
 those little fish in front of a team 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.990
 light because we enjoy it as much as 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.970
 like a big fish in front of a team 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.100
 heavy for the children that are starting 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.990
 in this of fishing these days we 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.440
 they take out a 20 kilos horse mackerel and they 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.360
 sun 10 hours to get 45 horse mackerel 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.640
 because they will not take the fun to 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.980
 a little puddle where they are taking 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.240
 mojarritas and in 23 hours take 40-50 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.330
 little children are going to return 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:01.800
 delighted and in love with this fishing 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.940
