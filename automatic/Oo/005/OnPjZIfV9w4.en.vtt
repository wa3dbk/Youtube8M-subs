00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.120
 Hi everyone, steven l'aktu 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.710
 jailbreak and the most news apple 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.070
 marking was immediately in the 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.540
 summary of the week style hd this is the 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.580
 name of the theme of the week that I you 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.189
 have also presented on video and who 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.300
 will allow to totally customize 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.699
 the interface of your iphone or your 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.079
 ipod touch a beautiful theme that I 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.310
 invites you to discover or rediscover 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:30.619
 on iphoneaddict.fr still manufactured 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.809
 by samsung the processor of the new 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.980
 Apple TV introduced in January 2013 is 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.449
 smaller than the previous 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.879
 despite the fact that it is still 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.590
 a chip a5 instead of a chip a5 x 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.940
 as one might have guessed 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.210
 this new version of the apple tv that 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.050
 so has this new processor a5 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.250
 offers exactly the same 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.090
 features that apple tv 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.649
 former 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.449
 so we can think that applle is in 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:52.190
 test a smaller processor 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.839
 in order to implement it in the iphone low 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.910
 cost that will no doubt see the day this 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.679
 summer 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.480
 this is the surprise of the apple week at 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.519
 improve the maps in japan in his 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.189
 map application without updating ios 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.930
 in version 6.1 points 3 normally 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:09.170
 intended to make these changes 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.820
 eyeos six points 1.3 still available 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.650
 in beta 2 for developers 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.240
 should therefore bring to its output 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.350
 mainly bug fixes 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.970
 and performance improvements 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.290
 for the iphone the ipod touch and the ipad 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.180
 escape the program that allows the 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.240
 untethered jailbreak of all iphone 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.210
 ipod touch and ipad under ios 6 improves 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.799
 still version 1.5.2 brings the 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.229
 support for 3 new languages ​​on 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.729
 French German and Chinese the 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.500
 instructions displayed on the software 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:37.909
 during the jailbreak procedure will be 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.009
 translated for better 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.659
 understanding and once again the 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.770
 preloaded packets of cydia have been 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.659
 modified for a loading time 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.789
 faster at the first opening of 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.219
 cydia so this is an update 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.200
 minor of the escape program and well 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:53.060
 heard if your iphone ipod touch or 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.649
 ipad is already jailbroken you do not have 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.159
 need to redo this jailbreak with 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.360
 this new version 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.979
 google our google service 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.870
 currently reserved for devices 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.630
 android could well be 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.300
 available under ios for iphone and ipad 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.490
 a promotional video was published 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.660
 on youtube and then quickly removed this 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.940
 which makes us think that in a 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.560
 near future ios terminals will be able to 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.450
 have this function that allows you to 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.130
 do some research on google and who 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.410
 offers similar functions to siri 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.300
 the apple vocal assistant we have left 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.010
 so wait a while to see 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.390
 how will google react and if this 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.880
 new feature will be coming soon 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.260
 available 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.940
 hurtubise the famous tweak that you 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.709
 allows in particular to choose the quality 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.600
 of video playback on youtube or 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.190
 yet to download these videos is 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.890
 now fully compatible with 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:42.160
 the bones 6 for any iphone ipod touch or 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.500
 ipad jailbroken it's a very patent 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.970
 interesting filed by apple is put 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.560
 in light this week that proves that 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.900
 the firm is thinking about a new type of 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.180
 smart cover the protection would contain 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.890
 a battery and would offer to recharge 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.900
 ipad when this one is on the 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.330
 support or covered by protection 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.860
 the patent was therefore filed but 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.750
 At the moment we do not know if apple 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.250
 really works on the issue in 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.720
 any case one thing is sure if this 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.959
 accessory came to see the day there 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:09.280
 would be very interesting the best 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.739
 this week's tweak cydia is called 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.180
 enemies reminder and they offer you 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.250
 a function remind me later 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.079
 which works in sms mails 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.709
 safari or with the calls 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.720
 phone 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.700
 the goal of this tweak is to extend the 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.380
 reminder functions under ios so 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.610
 to make sure you never 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.980
 forget what you intended to 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.269
 make 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.680
 the French operator bouygues telecom has 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.959
 obtained this week the authorization 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.910
 to use the 1800 frequency bands 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.150
 mega hertz used to date for the 2g 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.950
 to spend them in 4g lte and them 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.660
 the iphone 5 as well as the ipad fourth 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.700
 generation cell models will be 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.620
 so the compatible with 7.4 g French 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.390
 but the bad news comes from the fact 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.310
 that this authorization of use does not 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.730
 will take effect from 1 October 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.830
 2013 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.920
 and by then the iphone 5 is it will be 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.480
 presumably already gone he will have 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.950
 had to wait a dozen 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.840
 beta versions be released for the 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.510
 developers for that apple finally render 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.319
 available bone x 10 points 8 points 3 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:04.909
 for the public 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.830
 this system update 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:08.900
 operating mac computers 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.640
 apple therefore brings mainly 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.390
 improvements in stability and 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.430
 compatibility 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.930
 like all news 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:16.430

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.139
 want more details on the subject 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.310
 evoked I invite you to look at the 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.870

 waiting for the next summary of the 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:29.770
 week next Friday
