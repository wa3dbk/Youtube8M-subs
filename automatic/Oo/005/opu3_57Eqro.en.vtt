00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
comma 1 to X records I feel like if he

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.520 
comma 1 to X records I feel like if he
just<00:04:20.269> said<00:04:20.539> regular<00:04:20.870> rekha's<00:04:21.199> he<00:04:21.289> probably

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
just said regular rekha's he probably

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.870 
just said regular rekha's he probably
would<00:04:21.739> have<00:04:21.799> drained<00:04:22.039> him<00:04:22.160> to<00:04:22.280> a<00:04:22.310> level<00:04:22.580> which

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
would have drained him to a level which

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.580 
would have drained him to a level which
one<00:04:23.210> low<00:04:23.389> for<00:04:23.690> it<00:04:23.750> in<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:23.870> superwoman<00:04:25.389> doesn't

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
one low for it in the superwoman doesn't

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
one low for it in the superwoman doesn't
matter<00:04:27.590> anyway<00:04:27.949> Mago<00:04:28.460> ends<00:04:28.789> up<00:04:28.880> taking<00:04:29.090> it

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
matter anyway Mago ends up taking it

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.820

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:34.930 
canedo of course only really plays in
coma<00:04:34.130> so<00:04:34.280> I<00:04:34.340> don't<00:04:34.490> think<00:04:34.639> it's<00:04:34.729> going<00:04:34.820> to<00:04:34.880> be

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
coma so I don't think it's going to be

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:42.080 
coma so I don't think it's going to be
changing<00:04:35.150> characters<00:04:35.690> anytime<00:04:36.080> soon<00:04:36.380> right
