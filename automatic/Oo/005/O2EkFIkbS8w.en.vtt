I'm you know on a per grade or if

I'm you know on a per grade or if
there's<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.520> different<00:01:50.850> tank<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.329> don't

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
there's just a different tank I don't

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.060 
there's just a different tank I don't
really<00:01:51.960> want<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.200> have<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.500> type<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.890> his<00:01:53.009> name

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
really want to have to type in his name

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.810 
really want to have to type in his name
I<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:54.600> don't<00:01:54.840> want<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.020> have<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:55.710> I've<00:01:56.579> got

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
I just don't want to have to so I've got

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.249 
I just don't want to have to so I've got
it<00:01:56.909> set<00:01:57.090> up<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:57.659> just<00:01:57.840> set<00:01:58.020> someone

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
it set up so that I can just set someone

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.380 
it set up so that I can just set someone
as<00:01:58.380> my<00:01:58.500> focus<00:01:58.950> target<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.520> then<00:01:59.909> I'll<00:02:00.060> see

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
as my focus target and then I'll see

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.830 
as my focus target and then I'll see
every<00:02:01.049> single<00:02:01.619> stack<00:02:01.950> of<00:02:02.189> this<00:02:02.850> debuff<00:02:03.630> on

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
every single stack of this debuff on

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.569 
every single stack of this debuff on
them<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.350> I'll<00:02:04.439> know<00:02:04.680> when<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:04.920> have<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.310> taunt

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
them and I'll know when I have to taunt

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.139 
them and I'll know when I have to taunt
because<00:02:06.270> it's<00:02:06.450> going<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.689> be<00:02:06.840> right<00:02:07.140> over<00:02:07.829> here

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
because it's going to be right over here

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.180 
because it's going to be right over here
so<00:02:09.149> otherwise<00:02:09.720> where<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.080> set<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.500> up<00:02:10.590> was<00:02:10.950> I

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
so otherwise where I set it up was I

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.470 
so otherwise where I set it up was I
said<00:02:11.489> before<00:02:11.700> debuff<00:02:12.120> I<00:02:12.270> said<00:02:12.450> either

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
said before debuff I said either

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.330 
said before debuff I said either
because<00:02:13.750> if<00:02:14.110> it's<00:02:14.349> above<00:02:14.560> or<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.860> debuff<00:02:15.220> I

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
because if it's above or a debuff I

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.160 
because if it's above or a debuff I
don't<00:02:15.519> want<00:02:15.670> some<00:02:15.879> of<00:02:16.000> them<00:02:16.090> being<00:02:16.360> buffs<00:02:16.840> or

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
don't want some of them being buffs or

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.660 
don't want some of them being buffs or
something<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:17.799> something<00:02:18.220> weird<00:02:18.459> like<00:02:18.519> that

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
something and something weird like that

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.000 
something and something weird like that
messing<00:02:19.209> it<00:02:19.330> up<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:19.599> just<00:02:20.019> want<00:02:20.200> either<00:02:20.349> I<00:02:20.680> don't

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
messing it up I just want either I don't

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.100 
messing it up I just want either I don't
really<00:02:21.099> care<00:02:21.310> either<00:02:21.519> works<00:02:22.060> buff<00:02:22.450> or<00:02:22.690> debuff

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
really care either works buff or debuff

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.800 
really care either works buff or debuff
so<00:02:23.379> you<00:02:23.440> just<00:02:23.680> take<00:02:23.799> either<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.629> then<00:02:25.629> you

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
so you just take either and then you

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.350 
so you just take either and then you
leave<00:02:26.049> these<00:02:26.709> alone<00:02:27.099> okay<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.150> can<00:02:28.330> just

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
leave these alone okay you can just

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.390 
leave these alone okay you can just
leave<00:02:28.629> those<00:02:28.750> alone<00:02:28.860> show<00:02:29.860> States<00:02:30.220> and

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
leave those alone show States and

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.750 
leave those alone show States and
opacity<00:02:30.670> you<00:02:31.330> want<00:02:31.480> sit<00:02:31.629> present<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:32.760> show

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
opacity you want sit present and show

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.789 
opacity you want sit present and show
timer<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.450> Showtime<00:02:34.959> a<00:02:34.989> text<00:02:35.410> or<00:02:35.530> if<00:02:35.680> you're

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
timer and Showtime a text or if you're

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.940 
timer and Showtime a text or if you're
using<00:02:36.010> lui<00:02:36.519> a<00:02:36.940> show<00:02:37.299> lui<00:02:37.900> timer<00:02:38.290> text<00:02:38.769> and

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
using lui a show lui timer text and

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.949 
using lui a show lui timer text and
that's<00:02:39.519> all<00:02:39.760> that<00:02:39.819> you<00:02:40.239> really<00:02:40.510> need<00:02:40.660> to<00:02:40.780> worry

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
that's all that you really need to worry

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.190 
that's all that you really need to worry
about<00:02:41.079> or<00:02:41.319> you<00:02:41.829> can<00:02:42.430> even<00:02:42.610> set<00:02:43.000> it<00:02:43.150> up<00:02:43.360> so<00:02:44.170> that

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
about or you can even set it up so that

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.619 
about or you can even set it up so that
there's<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.620> minimum<00:02:45.010> number<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.400> stacks<00:02:45.879> that

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:46.629 
there's a minimum number of stacks that

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:48.270 
there's a minimum number of stacks that
it<00:02:46.750> will<00:02:46.930> have<00:02:47.200> before<00:02:47.680> it<00:02:47.769> starts<00:02:48.099> showing

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
it will have before it starts showing

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.750 
it will have before it starts showing
but<00:02:49.140> personally<00:02:50.140> I<00:02:50.349> won't<00:02:50.799> do<00:02:50.980> that<00:02:51.040> because

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
but personally I won't do that because

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.910 
but personally I won't do that because
it<00:02:52.359> was<00:02:52.480> just<00:02:52.629> sort<00:02:52.750> of<00:02:52.780> weird<00:02:53.290> me<00:02:53.500> out<00:02:53.530> and<00:02:53.890> I

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
it was just sort of weird me out and I

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.680 
it was just sort of weird me out and I
like<00:02:54.099> to<00:02:54.280> know<00:02:54.400> every<00:02:54.760> single<00:02:54.790> one<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.450> the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
like to know every single one of the

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.599 
like to know every single one of the
stacks<00:02:55.959> that<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.290> person<00:02:56.620> has<00:02:56.829> but<00:02:57.370> you<00:02:57.489> can

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
stacks that the person has but you can

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:58.860 
stacks that the person has but you can
set<00:02:57.819> it<00:02:57.849> there<00:02:58.030> for<00:02:58.090> example<00:02:58.540> you<00:02:58.569> can<00:02:58.720> have

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
set it there for example you can have

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.349 
set it there for example you can have
minimum<00:02:59.230> number<00:02:59.530> of<00:02:59.560> stacks<00:02:59.950> set<00:03:00.250> to<00:03:00.400> like<00:03:00.549> to

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
minimum number of stacks set to like to

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.599 
minimum number of stacks set to like to
if<00:03:01.629> there's<00:03:02.319> none<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.829> these<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:03.459> know

if there's none of these that you know
you<00:03:03.910> have<00:03:04.060> to<00:03:04.209> worry<00:03:04.420> about<00:03:04.569> until<00:03:05.079> the<00:03:05.170> other

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
you have to worry about until the other

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:07.470 
you have to worry about until the other
guys<00:03:05.530> of<00:03:05.769> two<00:03:05.950> stacks<00:03:06.280> of<00:03:06.489> them<00:03:06.640> you<00:03:07.090> can<00:03:07.239> set

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
guys of two stacks of them you can set

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.900 
guys of two stacks of them you can set
it<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.599> two<00:03:07.870> if<00:03:08.109> you<00:03:08.500> want<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.829> that<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.579> can

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
it to two if you want to that you can

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.000 
it to two if you want to that you can
you<00:03:10.329> can<00:03:10.480> totally<00:03:10.750> configure<00:03:11.290> it<00:03:11.379> however<00:03:11.709> you

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
you can totally configure it however you

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.710 
you can totally configure it however you
want<00:03:12.160> but<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:12.730> would<00:03:13.060> say<00:03:13.269> this<00:03:13.420> is<00:03:13.480> probably

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
want but I would say this is probably

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.280 
want but I would say this is probably
the<00:03:14.019> most<00:03:14.670> amazing<00:03:15.670> thing<00:03:16.569> for<00:03:16.599> tell<00:03:16.989> me<00:03:17.140> when

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.680 
the most amazing thing for tell me when
to<00:03:17.319> use<00:03:17.650> especially<00:03:18.130> for<00:03:18.489> tanks<00:03:18.819> because<00:03:19.359> it

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
to use especially for tanks because it

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.599 
to use especially for tanks because it
can<00:03:19.840> be<00:03:19.959> quite<00:03:20.169> hard<00:03:20.380> to<00:03:20.560> see<00:03:20.889> what<00:03:21.099> your<00:03:21.250> other

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:21.609 
can be quite hard to see what your other

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:23.580 
can be quite hard to see what your other
tank<00:03:21.970> stacks<00:03:22.359> are<00:03:22.599> at<00:03:22.720> and<00:03:22.959> it's<00:03:23.079> actually<00:03:23.560> a

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
tank stacks are at and it's actually a

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.259 
tank stacks are at and it's actually a
real<00:03:24.069> nuisance<00:03:24.400> so<00:03:25.389> I<00:03:25.739> find<00:03:26.739> that<00:03:26.859> this<00:03:27.010> is
