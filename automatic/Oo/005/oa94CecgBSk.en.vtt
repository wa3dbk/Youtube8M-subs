00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
now is some environment art this is all

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.110 
now is some environment art this is all
the<00:02:17.540> fun<00:02:18.170> interesting<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.069> is<00:02:19.220> my<00:02:19.430> expertise

the fun interesting so is my expertise
so<00:02:20.780> we're<00:02:20.930> gonna<00:02:21.050> start<00:02:21.319> off<00:02:21.470> by<00:02:21.530> painting<00:02:22.310> a

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
so we're gonna start off by painting a

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.240 
so we're gonna start off by painting a
background<00:02:23.060> that'll<00:02:23.450> be<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:24.080> foreground<00:02:24.620> the

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
background that'll be the foreground the

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.729 
background that'll be the foreground the
mid-ground<00:02:25.640> in<00:02:26.120> the<00:02:26.540> background<00:02:27.020> things<00:02:27.440> in

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
mid-ground in the background things in

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.229 
mid-ground in the background things in
the<00:02:27.860> environment<00:02:27.980> that<00:02:28.489> are<00:02:28.610> closer<00:02:28.850> to<00:02:29.120> you

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
the environment that are closer to you

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.809 
the environment that are closer to you
such<00:02:29.630> as<00:02:29.840> these<00:02:30.319> bushes<00:02:30.739> with<00:02:30.890> fences<00:02:31.340> will

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
such as these bushes with fences will

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.910 
such as these bushes with fences will
move<00:02:32.000> really<00:02:32.330> fast<00:02:32.690> from<00:02:33.380> the<00:02:33.560> right<00:02:33.739> to<00:02:33.860> the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
move really fast from the right to the

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.550 
move really fast from the right to the
left<00:02:34.099> of<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.370> screen<00:02:34.610> as<00:02:34.940> Redford<00:02:35.750> goes<00:02:35.989> to

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
left of the screen as Redford goes to

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.160 
left of the screen as Redford goes to
the<00:02:36.680> right<00:02:36.860> behind<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:38.060> we<00:02:38.540> have<00:02:38.750> bridges

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
the right behind that we have bridges

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.979 
the right behind that we have bridges
trees<00:02:39.980> that<00:02:40.610> just<00:02:40.910> move<00:02:41.180> a<00:02:41.360> little<00:02:41.630> bit<00:02:41.810> slower

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
trees that just move a little bit slower

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:44.770 
trees that just move a little bit slower
and<00:02:42.440> then<00:02:42.830> far<00:02:43.190> off<00:02:43.459> in<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.670> back<00:02:43.910> distance<00:02:44.209> we

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
and then far off in the back distance we

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.840 
and then far off in the back distance we
have<00:02:44.959> some<00:02:45.260> giant<00:02:45.769> trees<00:02:46.069> that<00:02:46.280> move<00:02:46.459> really

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
have some giant trees that move really

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.940 
have some giant trees that move really
really<00:02:47.330> slow<00:02:47.660> oh<00:02:47.989> my<00:02:48.290> gosh<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:48.590> never<00:02:48.739> would

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
components ready so I'm wondering what

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.849 
components ready so I'm wondering what
you<00:03:14.000> can<00:03:14.120> do<00:03:14.269> for<00:03:14.480> me<00:03:14.510> okay<00:03:15.170> well<00:03:15.440> I<00:03:15.470> can<00:03:15.709> take

you can do for me okay well I can take

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:17.860 
you can do for me okay well I can take
all<00:03:16.160> of<00:03:16.190> those<00:03:16.430> components<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:17.239> put<00:03:17.750> them

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
all of those components and put them

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.440 
all of those components and put them
together<00:03:17.989> using<00:03:18.440> code<00:03:18.859> to<00:03:19.430> make<00:03:19.579> game<00:03:19.850> work<00:03:20.030> so

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
together using code to make game work so

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.420 
together using code to make game work so
how<00:03:20.600> do<00:03:20.660> you<00:03:20.780> do<00:03:20.930> that<00:03:21.049> with<00:03:21.200> code<00:03:21.500> oh<00:03:21.829> well

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
how do you do that with code oh well

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.310 
how do you do that with code oh well
it's<00:03:22.850> a<00:03:22.910> lot<00:03:23.030> of<00:03:23.180> type<00:03:23.329> of<00:03:23.480> using<00:03:23.870> math<00:03:24.290> and

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
it's a lot of type of using math and

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.140 
it's a lot of type of using math and
physics<00:03:25.150> math<00:03:26.150> and<00:03:26.450> physics<00:03:26.630> yeah<00:03:27.910> okay<00:03:28.910> I

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
physics math and physics yeah okay I

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.120 
physics math and physics yeah okay I
have<00:03:29.570> an<00:03:29.660> idea<00:03:29.930> I'm<00:03:30.170> going<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:30.739> give<00:03:30.950> this

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
have an idea I'm going to give this

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.860 
have an idea I'm going to give this
tablet<00:03:31.640> to<00:03:31.820> you<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:32.120> I'm<00:03:32.180> just<00:03:32.329> gonna<00:03:32.450> go<00:03:32.660> sit

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
tablet to you and I'm just gonna go sit

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:34.660 
tablet to you and I'm just gonna go sit
down<00:03:32.930> on<00:03:33.079> the<00:03:33.350> couch<00:03:33.530> and<00:03:33.859> you<00:03:33.950> can<00:03:34.190> just<00:03:34.310> give

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
down on the couch and you can just give

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.640 
down on the couch and you can just give
it<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:34.880> me<00:03:35.000> whenever<00:03:35.299> you're<00:03:35.570> done<00:03:35.840> all<00:03:36.380> right

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
it to me whenever you're done all right

just went through is now completely in a

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.790 
just went through is now completely in a
game<00:03:53.270> that's<00:03:53.870> all<00:03:54.020> working<00:03:54.380> now<00:03:54.500> it<00:03:54.650> looks

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 
game that's all working now it looks

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.800 
game that's all working now it looks
great<00:03:55.040> I<00:03:55.280> think<00:03:55.610> I<00:03:55.850> just<00:03:55.880> discovered<00:03:56.600> today

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
great I think I just discovered today

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.560 
great I think I just discovered today
how<00:03:57.050> talented<00:03:57.650> I<00:03:57.770> am<00:03:57.800> at<00:03:58.100> game<00:03:58.340> making<00:03:58.819> all

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
how talented I am at game making all

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:02.170 
how talented I am at game making all
these<00:03:59.750> skills
