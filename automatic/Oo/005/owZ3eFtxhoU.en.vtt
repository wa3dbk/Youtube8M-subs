00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:15.379
 and come to this says new video is indeed stuck 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.379
 Today I want to show you a bit of the equestrian monument stress 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.399
 it still gives him the playful Sion 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.140
 Overall, that's right for education 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.089
 except that maybe one 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.089
 they track one that bothers a few 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.580
 The answers are made four games with a link over 50 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.580
 since they are very well laid out in my opinion 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.470
 you can see when zooming in. my opponent hits in his obituary lights up 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.740
 this is very helpful and useful, especially for beginners and 6 2 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.720
 besides, I can not believe you in the movie too big 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.300
 except some directly in front of the media 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.830
 despite the fact that he has tons of ears, he is dead right now 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.530
 You also should not have to brake over the more dead corner floorboard 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.980
 Cookies light gray helpful but because of that you should go anyway 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.570
 is uncool 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.970
 and again grab 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.380
 the community about how the zombies are watching the races and somehow always the 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.760
 Certainty with the knife to fruitless 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.270
 Luckily, I do not play at a competence test team at the pub 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.010
 Going fast is also an advantage if a good time is a hit through 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.530
 the bank shares came 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.970
 which is used by Alcan but mostly shamelessly 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.490
 because you can just hope that the opposing team fair play everything 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.870
 and the hedge kicks and cards are the world's 20 percent 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.960
 with one plays but also the three seconds spot regulation note 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.380
 but otherwise draws attention to the us requirement Traun meets light 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.840
 Meyer completely man and then he is dead himself 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.609
 Too big a team can give you the right scores if you are at Schalke 2 8 on one 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.769
 Page stands around and his opponent could be caught maneuvering because of this 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.549
 Achievements faster and faster 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.149
 and conceive themselves 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:34.259
 that promises boring malware on a bike or on Twitter but not 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:44.819
 and on again 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.349
 in the animal world 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.349
 when the orphan kicks 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:57.889
 worst of the polluter defect 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:02:58.409
