00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.100
 hello how I am marifÃ© mounts and you 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.680
 I speak from the club responsible for 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.779
 quality in this article that is going to be the 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.609
 first of a sequence of articles 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.840
 where will I be dealing with the differences or 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.630
 modifications that the new 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.100
 version of the iso9001 standard that will be 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.890
 published in 2015 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:30.190
 first of all tell you that the new 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.720
 version to contain seven chapters of 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:36.480
 requirements while the current 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.480
 version we have in effect the sb1070 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:41.860
 requirements chapters well in 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.870
 both versions the first three 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.180
 chapters are not really of requirements 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.010
 but they are rather informative as 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.850
 is the field of application the standards of 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.500
 references and definitions 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.789
 I want you to keep in mind that everything 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.350
 I 'm going to tell you so much in this 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.969
 article as in the following where 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.789
 we will see the different chapters 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.370
 is in the draft phase and is not a 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.290
 final version may suffer slight 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.509
 modifications along these almost 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.310
 two years left to publish the 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:12.120
 definitive version right now it 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.690
 find in state of consultation loeb 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.270
 to the consultation of the different countries 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.520
 besides that this draft is 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.900
 in version only in English version and 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.780
 good translations can also 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.550
 vary slightly as you are seeing in 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.380
 screen on screen 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.540
 this is the division of chapters that 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.280
 we have with the and survive a version 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.560
 2008 and the future version 2015 well 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.330
 you can see then that in the 2000 version 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.180
 2008 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.550
 We have chapter 4 management system 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.830
 quality chapter 5 responsibility of 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.290
 the management chapter 6 management of 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.840
 resources on 7 product planning 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.120
 and the 8 measurement analysis and improvement be 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.310
 a slight modification with respect to 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.070
 the version that we did not find deleted 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.900
 for the year 2015 the one that we have the 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.940
 Chapter 4 organization context 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.950
 this is true that it changes 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.960
 slightly because it's practically 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.200
 new 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.509
 direction planning support 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.660
 operations and evaluation of performance and 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.400
 improvement finally let's enter fully 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.310
 already to see 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.629
 Chapter 4 Description of system 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.629
 quality that would now become 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:28.150
 context of the organization this 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.010
 chapter has four clauses let's see 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.810
 a first that is to understand the 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.630
 organization and its contexts well 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.250
 here in this clause of this chapter 4 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.660
 Well, what the company has to do 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.820
 determined what will be the 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.010
 problems both external and internal 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.990
 because they are going to affect the results 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.970
 that they have planned within the 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.710
 quality management system how can 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.750
 be if we have cultural problems if 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.260
 we have technological legal problems 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.300
 economic etcetera then we have a 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.340
 second clause 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.220
 it would 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.010
 Point 42 understand the needs and 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.480
 expectations of interested parties 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.280
 here, what should be done is 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.989
 determine what the parties will be 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.060
 interested parties that influence the system 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.160
 of quality management as well as all 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.960
 requirements with these interested parties 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.580
 for example what would be 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.830
 with the suppliers with the customers 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.970
 subcontractors 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.950
 here in this chapter we saw 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.560
 we justify 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.680
 how these parts influence our 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.150
 practically new management system 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.290
 with respect to the version we have in 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.629
 vigor 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.030
 then we have a third clause that 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:38.250
 It is to determine the extent of system 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.090
 quality management this really is not 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.099
 nothing new 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.459
 currently you must determine the 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:46.640
 scope should not stop writing in 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.099
 the quality manual but here what is 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.760
 appears new or what is being done 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:57.290
 certain insert emphasis on doing it 9 is 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.719
 that the scope should it d 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.980
 we must define it based on what 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:02.840
 we have determined in the points 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.280
 previous is to say what we have 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.409
 seen that what will be our 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.209
 problems that may affect us 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:10.790
 our system so much external problems 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:14.209
 as inmates as well as the influence of 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.799
 those parts that we have interested 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.199
 within our management system 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.379
 and what of course, practically 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:24.199
 new in this has been defined with more 

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:27.419
 precision is that we must leave 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:29.879
 described in the scope both the points 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:32.360
 of exclusion from the norm as if we have 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:36.060
 parts of our process outsourced 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.650
 and finally last in the fourth clause of 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.080
 this chapter 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:42.270
 quality management system this one 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.360
 which coincides practically with the one 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.240
 currently it is clause 41 of the 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.690
 2008 version it is true that they have 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.210
 added three new requirements and in the 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.860
 draft as they appear that these new 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.020
 requirements would be first of all that 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.340
 we have to determine the risks that 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.889
 can affect the proper functioning 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.110
 of the system we also have to 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.090
 determine responsibilities and 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.039
 authorities for certain processes or 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:11.100
 set of processes here because you are 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:12.539
 it makes much more emphasis than in point 6 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.430
 of the norm resource management but 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.660
 that here already in the management system of 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.010
 we must determine all the 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.570
 responsible authority 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.780
 certain key processes of our 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.789
 company and as a last new requirement in 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.580
 this clause is to make sure that everything 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.439
 the new process 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.879
 a set of processes that have been 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:31.069
 revised as they continue to give 

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:34.750
 expected results and also 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:38.719
 satisfactory for good we have tried the 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:41.090
 Chapter 4 of the draft of ISO 9.001 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:43.250
 for your 2015 version of the year as you've 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.479
 seen by the slight modifications to 

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:47.449
 the first two clauses that are 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:48.740
 completely new the third with 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:51.139
 regarding the good scope it has 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.669
 some appreciations and the fourth one 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.960
 also with regard to the system of 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:56.780
 quality management because it also has 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:59.419
 some inclusions of new requirements 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.060
 Well, as you can see, there are not enough news 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.500
 yes there are some in the next article 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.140
 we will see the rest of the chapters 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:10.270
 of the draft of the iso9001 standard 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:12.190
 Meanwhile as we are still waiting 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:16.060
 of the official publication and using the 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:20.760
 current version of iso 9001-2008 as well 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.760
 that keeps doing things with quality
