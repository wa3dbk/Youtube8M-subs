00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
about the basics first so we need

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.089 
about the basics first so we need
redstone<00:00:24.600> tubes<00:00:24.930> we<00:00:25.199> need<00:00:25.350> red<00:00:25.529> stone<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.039> the

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
redstone tubes we need red stone and the

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.859 
redstone tubes we need red stone and the
time<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.580> I've<00:00:26.730> showed<00:00:27.210> you<00:00:27.480> how<00:00:27.599> to<00:00:27.630> make

seen<00:00:29.519> those<00:00:29.670> videos<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:31.199> redstone<00:00:31.859> tube<00:00:32.189> is

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
seen those videos the redstone tube is

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.090 
seen those videos the redstone tube is
this<00:00:32.640> redstone<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.600> pneumatic<00:00:33.989> tube<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.469> a

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
this redstone and a pneumatic tube and a

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.220 
this redstone and a pneumatic tube and a
pneumatic<00:00:35.460> tube<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.940> some<00:00:36.360> brass<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.989> glass

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
pneumatic tube is some brass and glass

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.220 
pneumatic tube is some brass and glass
and<00:00:37.670> brass<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.940> make<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.360> alloy<00:00:39.690> furnace

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
and brass you make in the alloy furnace

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.720 
and brass you make in the alloy furnace
with<00:00:40.980> some<00:00:41.160> tin<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.640> some<00:00:41.790> copper<00:00:43.340> so<00:00:44.340> easy

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
with some tin and some copper so easy

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.790 
with some tin and some copper so easy
very<00:00:45.480> easy<00:00:46.520> good<00:00:47.520> stuff<00:00:48.110> ok<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.440> when<00:00:49.590> you<00:00:49.649> have

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
very easy good stuff ok so when you have

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.860 
very easy good stuff ok so when you have
those<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.460> also<00:00:50.700> need<00:00:50.910> something<00:00:51.600> called<00:00:51.750> a

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
those we also need something called a

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.490 
those we also need something called a
block<00:00:52.199> breaker<00:00:53.719> now<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.050> red<00:00:55.289> power

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
block breaker now this is a red power

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.610 
block breaker now this is a red power
device<00:00:55.860> doesn't<00:00:56.309> use<00:00:56.520> any<00:00:56.780> any<00:00:57.780> blue<00:00:58.199> tricity

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
device doesn't use any any blue tricity

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.590 
device doesn't use any any blue tricity
it<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:58.980> uses<00:00:59.160> well<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.059> just<00:01:00.120> needs<00:01:00.420> a

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
it just uses well it just needs a

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.560 
it just uses well it just needs a
redstone<00:01:00.870> signal<00:01:01.910> so<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.030> make<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.300> with<00:01:03.480> an

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
redstone signal so you make this with an

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.969 
redstone signal so you make this with an
iron<00:01:03.660> pickaxe<00:01:04.369> cobblestone<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> sides<00:01:05.939> a

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
iron pickaxe cobblestone on the sides a

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.230 
iron pickaxe cobblestone on the sides a
piston<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.159> middle<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.610> some<00:01:08.820> red<00:01:08.970> so<00:01:09.119> in

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
piston in the middle and some red so in

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.609 
piston in the middle and some red so in
the<00:01:09.330> bottom<00:01:10.490> so<00:01:11.490> that's<00:01:11.670> fairly<00:01:12.000> easy<00:01:12.560> so<00:01:13.560> I'll

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
the bottom so that's fairly easy so I'll

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.010 
the bottom so that's fairly easy so I'll
just<00:01:13.710> spawn<00:01:14.130> for<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.820> show<00:01:15.330> me<00:01:15.479> shall<00:01:15.780> we<00:01:15.810> do

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
just spawn for in show me shall we do

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.620 
just spawn for in show me shall we do
that<00:01:16.229> nice<00:01:17.930> so<00:01:19.009> and<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.939> also<00:01:21.060> need<00:01:21.270> some<00:01:21.420> lava

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
that nice so and you also need some lava

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.440 
that nice so and you also need some lava
but<00:01:21.990> I'll<00:01:22.080> get<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.409> later<00:01:22.880> so<00:01:23.880> i'll<00:01:24.330> just

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
but I'll get that later so i'll just

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.020 
but I'll get that later so i'll just
make<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:24.840> single<00:01:25.200> one<00:01:25.500> at<00:01:25.740> start<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.759> what<00:01:26.880> you

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
make a single one at start so what you

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.460 
make a single one at start so what you
want<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.540> make<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:28.430> holes<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.729> that

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
want to do is you make a holes like that

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
you can keep this one to stem just dirt

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.310 
you can keep this one to stem just dirt
that's<00:01:34.079> fine<00:01:34.520> so<00:01:35.520> too<00:01:36.299> deep<00:01:36.570> one<00:01:36.840> deep<00:01:37.079> too

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
that's fine so too deep one deep too

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
that's fine so too deep one deep too
deep<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:38.030> then<00:01:39.030> you<00:01:39.150> put<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:40.130> block<00:01:41.130> breaker

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
deep and then you put the block breaker

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.910 
deep and then you put the block breaker
in<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.579> middle<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.560> all<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:43.740> need<00:01:43.890> a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
in the middle and all we need a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.090 
in the middle and all we need a
screwdriver

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.899 

now<00:01:49.100> I<00:01:49.130> showed<00:01:49.490> you<00:01:49.579> how<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:49.700> make<00:01:49.850> a

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
now I showed you how to make a

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.080 
now I showed you how to make a
screwdriver<00:01:50.149> as<00:01:50.450> well<00:01:50.689> earlier<00:01:51.229> but<00:01:51.969> just<00:01:52.969> in

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
screwdriver as well earlier but just in

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.550 
screwdriver as well earlier but just in
case<00:01:53.119> again<00:01:53.600> it's<00:01:53.810> just<00:01:53.990> some<00:01:54.109> iron<00:01:54.320> in<00:01:54.500> a

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
case again it's just some iron in a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.230 
case again it's just some iron in a
stick<00:01:54.939> it's<00:01:55.939> very<00:01:56.179> easy<00:01:57.189> so<00:01:58.189> we<00:01:58.610> use<00:01:58.759> this<00:01:59.000> to

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
stick it's very easy so we use this to

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.550 
stick it's very easy so we use this to
turn<00:01:59.450> this<00:01:59.600> around<00:01:59.750> so<00:01:59.990> that's<00:02:00.229> the<00:02:00.380> right

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
turn this around so that's the right

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.749 
turn this around so that's the right
position<00:02:01.039> it's<00:02:01.969> pointing<00:02:02.390> downwards<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:03.759> now

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
position it's pointing downwards and now

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.440 
position it's pointing downwards and now
we<00:02:05.060> need<00:02:05.179> to<00:02:05.210> get<00:02:05.450> some<00:02:05.689> lava<00:02:05.929> and<00:02:06.259> some<00:02:06.409> water

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
we need to get some lava and some water

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.339 
we need to get some lava and some water
so<00:02:08.450> let's<00:02:08.660> get<00:02:08.750> a<00:02:08.810> lava<00:02:09.019> bucket<00:02:09.580> lava<00:02:10.580> bucket

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
so let's get a lava bucket lava bucket

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.539 
so let's get a lava bucket lava bucket

let's get some water or a bucket now you

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.789 
let's get some water or a bucket now you
put<00:02:16.790> water<00:02:16.819> on<00:02:17.120> one<00:02:17.330> side<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.930> love<00:02:18.560> on<00:02:18.709> the

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:18.799 
put water on one side the love on the

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.940 
put water on one side the love on the
other<00:02:18.920> doesn't<00:02:19.489> matter<00:02:19.700> which<00:02:19.849> side<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.950> what

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
other doesn't matter which side and what

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.000 
other doesn't matter which side and what
this<00:02:22.069> does<00:02:22.130> is<00:02:22.519> this<00:02:22.549> water<00:02:22.910> will<00:02:23.030> go<00:02:23.180> down<00:02:23.390> and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
this does is this water will go down and

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.559 
this does is this water will go down and
the<00:02:25.010> lava<00:02:25.430> will<00:02:25.640> go<00:02:25.790> all<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.060> way<00:02:26.090> down<00:02:26.180> as

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
the lava will go all the way down as

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.080 
the lava will go all the way down as
well<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.079> as<00:02:27.860> soon<00:02:27.980> as<00:02:28.099> we<00:02:28.190> remove<00:02:28.489> this<00:02:28.730> block

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
well and as soon as we remove this block

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.000 
well and as soon as we remove this block
the<00:02:29.750> water<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.079> lava<00:02:30.230> will<00:02:30.530> come<00:02:30.680> together

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
the water and lava will come together

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.339 
the water and lava will come together
and<00:02:31.190> I'll<00:02:31.280> make<00:02:31.430> cobblestone<00:02:31.970> here<00:02:32.269> the<00:02:33.110> block

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:33.349 
and I'll make cobblestone here the block

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.229 
and I'll make cobblestone here the block
break<00:02:33.590> it<00:02:33.769> breaks<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.280> cobblestone<00:02:35.000> when<00:02:35.150> it

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
break it breaks the cobblestone when it

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.839 
break it breaks the cobblestone when it
gets<00:02:35.390> a<00:02:35.450> redstone<00:02:35.690> power<00:02:35.989> signal<00:02:36.410> and<00:02:36.849> again

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
gets a redstone power signal and again

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.610 
gets a redstone power signal and again
the<00:02:38.030> larvae<00:02:38.420> in<00:02:38.540> a<00:02:38.630> water<00:02:38.810> get<00:02:39.019> together<00:02:39.170> and

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
the larvae in a water get together and

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.160 
the larvae in a water get together and
again<00:02:39.829> a<00:02:39.860> cobblestone<00:02:40.220> generator<00:02:40.340> etc<00:02:41.170> so

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
again a cobblestone generator etc so

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.259 
again a cobblestone generator etc so
it's<00:02:42.319> sort<00:02:42.410> of<00:02:42.530> a<00:02:42.590> really<00:02:42.829> nice<00:02:43.040> and<00:02:43.370> easy<00:02:43.579> way

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
it's sort of a really nice and easy way

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.210 
it's sort of a really nice and easy way
of<00:02:44.299> getting<00:02:44.840> emc<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:45.530> I<00:02:45.590> like<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.069> better

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
of getting emc and I like you better

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.850 
of getting emc and I like you better
than<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:47.180> energy<00:02:47.329> collectors<00:02:47.989> just<00:02:48.590> because

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
than the energy collectors just because

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.000 
than the energy collectors just because
I<00:02:48.890> don't<00:02:49.220> know<00:02:49.280> somehow<00:02:49.670> more<00:02:50.650> it's<00:02:51.650> weird<00:02:51.889> to

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
I don't know somehow more it's weird to

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.430 
I don't know somehow more it's weird to
say<00:02:52.160> less<00:02:52.400> Chiddy<00:02:52.730> but<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.510> know<00:02:53.630> that's<00:02:54.230> sort

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
say less Chiddy but you know that's sort

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.479 
say less Chiddy but you know that's sort
of<00:02:54.639> what<00:02:55.639> I<00:02:55.670> figure<00:02:56.090> about<00:02:56.180> it<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:58.069> then<00:02:58.400> we

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
of what I figure about it and so then we

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.340 
of what I figure about it and so then we
need<00:02:58.639> to<00:02:58.730> put<00:02:58.910> this<00:02:59.060> in<00:02:59.329> a<00:02:59.420> do<00:02:59.540> our<00:02:59.660> chest<00:03:00.049> no

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
need to put this in a do our chest no

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.229 
need to put this in a do our chest no
spawn<00:03:01.340> in<00:03:01.459> a<00:03:01.489> chest<00:03:02.290> still<00:03:03.290> have<00:03:03.410> any<00:03:03.620> chests

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
nope nope so I chest hold down a joke

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.309 
nope nope so I chest hold down a joke
put<00:03:13.519> down<00:03:13.670> the<00:03:13.790> chest<00:03:14.000> there<00:03:14.299> and<00:03:14.600> then<00:03:15.230> we

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
put down the chest there and then we

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.110 
put down the chest there and then we
need<00:03:15.410> a<00:03:15.470> time<00:03:15.859> enough<00:03:16.250> sure<00:03:16.670> you<00:03:16.790> have<00:03:16.910> to<00:03:16.970> make

very cheap to make just looks very

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.750 
very cheap to make just looks very
complicated<00:04:06.349> so<00:04:07.349> you<00:04:07.410> plug<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:07.650> down<00:04:08.010> and

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
complicated so you plug that down and

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.100 
complicated so you plug that down and
you<00:04:08.849> can<00:04:09.000> see<00:04:09.150> it's<00:04:09.299> turning<00:04:09.660> and<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:09.840> sort

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
you can see it's turning and that sort

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.710 
you can see it's turning and that sort
of<00:04:10.170> turns<00:04:10.440> it<00:04:10.620> on<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:10.739> off<00:04:10.890> so<00:04:11.099> anytime<00:04:11.720> this

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
of turns it on and off so anytime this

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.690 
of turns it on and off so anytime this
fee<00:04:13.349> makes<00:04:13.709> a<00:04:13.799> circle<00:04:14.040> and<00:04:14.250> comes<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:14.580> the

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
fee makes a circle and comes to the

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.300 
fee makes a circle and comes to the
redstone<00:04:15.030> sort<00:04:15.299> of<00:04:15.360> top<00:04:15.840> of<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.019> torch<00:04:16.310> it'll

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
redstone sort of top of the torch it'll

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.020 
redstone sort of top of the torch it'll
light<00:04:17.850> off<00:04:18.000> a<00:04:18.180> redstone<00:04:18.690> signal<00:04:18.930> now<00:04:19.519> I'm<00:04:20.519> just

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
light off a redstone signal now I'm just

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:22.820 
light off a redstone signal now I'm just
going<00:04:21.329> to<00:04:21.359> power<00:04:21.630> this<00:04:21.810> with<00:04:22.049> normal<00:04:22.410> redstone

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
going to power this with normal redstone

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.820 
going to power this with normal redstone
it's<00:04:23.130> nicer<00:04:23.370> if<00:04:23.639> you<00:04:23.669> do<00:04:23.850> it<00:04:23.970> with<00:04:24.150> some<00:04:24.830> jacket

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
it's nicer if you do it with some jacket

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.650 
it's nicer if you do it with some jacket
wise<00:04:26.010> but<00:04:26.460> it's<00:04:26.669> it's<00:04:26.880> sort<00:04:27.180> of<00:04:27.240> not<00:04:27.419> in<00:04:27.540> this

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
wise but it's it's sort of not in this

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.250 
wise but it's it's sort of not in this
tutorial<00:04:27.810> so<00:04:28.380> oops<00:04:29.220> done<00:04:29.840> there<00:04:30.840> we<00:04:30.930> go<00:04:33.260> that's

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:34.260 
tutorial so oops done there we go that's

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.629 
tutorial so oops done there we go that's
it<00:04:36.169> so<00:04:37.169> if<00:04:37.560> we<00:04:37.650> go<00:04:37.770> in<00:04:37.919> here<00:04:38.100> you<00:04:38.190> can<00:04:38.340> see<00:04:38.490> it

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
it so if we go in here you can see it

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:41.540 
it so if we go in here you can see it
removes<00:04:39.060> it<00:04:39.200> cobblestone<00:04:40.200> cobblestone<00:04:40.889> and<00:04:41.160> a

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
removes it cobblestone cobblestone and a

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.770 
removes it cobblestone cobblestone and a
block<00:04:41.700> breaker<00:04:41.850> just<00:04:42.120> removes<00:04:42.419> you<00:04:42.540> know<00:04:42.630> this

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
block breaker just removes you know this

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.129 
block breaker just removes you know this
is<00:04:42.810> very<00:04:43.110> slow<00:04:43.910> so<00:04:44.910> we<00:04:45.120> can<00:04:45.270> make<00:04:45.419> this<00:04:45.600> a

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:46.139 
is very slow so we can make this a

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:47.600 
is very slow so we can make this a
little<00:04:46.350> bit<00:04:46.560> faster<00:04:47.010> you<00:04:47.100> do<00:04:47.190> it<00:04:47.220> about<00:04:47.340> right

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
little bit faster you do it about right

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.029 
little bit faster you do it about right
clicking<00:04:47.880> on<00:04:48.030> it<00:04:48.260> you<00:04:49.260> can<00:04:49.380> see<00:04:49.530> Tommy<00:04:49.770> until

00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 
clicking on it you can see Tommy until

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:53.420 
clicking on it you can see Tommy until
two<00:04:50.250> seconds<00:04:50.729> now<00:04:51.320> you<00:04:52.320> can<00:04:52.620> go<00:04:52.800> down<00:04:53.010> to<00:04:53.070> about

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
two seconds now you can go down to about

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.629 
two seconds now you can go down to about
point<00:04:53.789> three<00:04:54.150> I<00:04:54.180> think<00:04:54.510> but<00:04:55.070> for<00:04:56.070> safety<00:04:56.550> i'll

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
point three I think but for safety i'll

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.909 
point three I think but for safety i'll
go<00:04:56.789> 4.5<00:04:57.419> as<00:04:57.780> it<00:04:58.260> doesn't<00:04:58.470> really<00:04:58.710> make<00:04:58.860> any

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
go 4.5 as it doesn't really make any

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.010 
go 4.5 as it doesn't really make any
faster<00:04:59.639> video<00:04:59.880> fast<00:05:00.360> because<00:05:00.660> the<00:05:00.690> lava

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
faster video fast because the lava

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.659 
faster video fast because the lava
doesn't<00:05:01.229> flow<00:05:01.560> fast<00:05:01.830> enough<00:05:02.130> as<00:05:02.310> you<00:05:02.400> can<00:05:02.490> see

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
doesn't flow fast enough as you can see

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.070 
doesn't flow fast enough as you can see
it's<00:05:02.760> already<00:05:02.880> too<00:05:03.180> fast<00:05:05.330> so<00:05:06.330> let's<00:05:06.539> let's

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
it's already too fast so let's let's

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.730 
it's already too fast so let's let's
let's<00:05:07.500> show<00:05:07.950> you<00:05:07.979> how<00:05:08.729> it<00:05:08.880> looks<00:05:08.910> when<00:05:09.630> we<00:05:09.780> get

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:23.870 

ya<00:05:13.740> a<00:05:14.960> couple<00:05:15.960> of<00:05:16.169> these<00:05:16.289> going

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.510 

so<00:05:26.100> let<00:05:27.100> me<00:05:27.130> stop<00:05:27.430> the<00:05:27.580> rain<00:05:27.790> that's<00:05:28.000> annoying

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
so let me stop the rain that's annoying

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.460 
so let me stop the rain that's annoying
make<00:05:30.520> it<00:05:30.640> dawn<00:05:30.960> nice<00:05:31.960> cool<00:05:33.000> so<00:05:34.200> that's<00:05:35.200> two

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
make it dawn nice cool so that's two

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.930 
make it dawn nice cool so that's two
oldies<00:05:35.920> and<00:05:38.010> now<00:05:39.010> you<00:05:39.070> don't<00:05:39.430> have<00:05:39.520> to<00:05:39.670> use

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
oldies and now you don't have to use

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.970 
oldies and now you don't have to use
water<00:05:40.180> in<00:05:40.300> every<00:05:40.600> single<00:05:41.020> one<00:05:41.320> but<00:05:41.560> I<00:05:41.590> do<00:05:41.740> it

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:41.980 
water in every single one but I do it

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.290 
water in every single one but I do it
anyways<00:05:42.450> because<00:05:43.450> it<00:05:43.720> looks<00:05:43.930> better<00:05:45.030> the<00:05:46.030> same

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
anyways because it looks better the same

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:51.000 
anyways because it looks better the same
with<00:05:46.450> lava<00:05:47.790> nice<00:05:49.290> now<00:05:50.290> it's<00:05:50.470> very<00:05:50.650> easy<00:05:50.830> to

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
with lava nice now it's very easy to

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.970 
with lava nice now it's very easy to
hook<00:05:51.190> this<00:05:51.370> up<00:05:51.580> you<00:05:52.000> just<00:05:52.680> connect<00:05:53.680> these<00:05:53.770> all

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980 
hook this up you just connect these all

00:05:53.980 --> 00:06:03.420 
hook this up you just connect these all
over<00:05:54.960> there<00:05:55.960> we<00:05:56.050> have<00:05:56.200> it<00:06:01.860> and<00:06:02.860> this<00:06:03.010> is<00:06:03.160> this

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:03.430 
over there we have it and this is this

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:06.270 
over there we have it and this is this
is<00:06:03.550> reasonably<00:06:03.970> fast<00:06:04.210> you<00:06:04.510> know<00:06:04.630> in<00:06:05.380> my<00:06:06.070> house

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 
is reasonably fast you know in my house

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.530 
is reasonably fast you know in my house
in<00:06:06.490> my<00:06:06.520> playthrough<00:06:06.970> I've<00:06:07.150> got<00:06:07.330> about

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540 
in my playthrough I've got about

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.110 
in my playthrough I've got about
probably<00:06:07.870> 40<00:06:08.470> of<00:06:08.560> these<00:06:08.680> or<00:06:08.890> something<00:06:09.130> so

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
probably 40 of these or something so

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.120 
probably 40 of these or something so
I've<00:06:10.270> got<00:06:10.450> layer<00:06:10.750> upon<00:06:11.080> layer<00:06:11.140> upon<00:06:11.380> layer<00:06:11.710> and

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
I've got layer upon layer upon layer and

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.300 
I've got layer upon layer upon layer and
it's<00:06:12.730> pretty<00:06:13.090> cool<00:06:13.330> it's<00:06:13.600> not<00:06:14.440> as<00:06:14.650> fast<00:06:14.950> as<00:06:15.220> an

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
it's pretty cool it's not as fast as an

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.230 
it's pretty cool it's not as fast as an
NG<00:06:16.140> collector<00:06:17.610> but<00:06:18.610> it's<00:06:18.790> definitely<00:06:18.970> more

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
NG collector but it's definitely more

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.790 
NG collector but it's definitely more
fun<00:06:19.300> and<00:06:19.840> it<00:06:20.080> makes<00:06:20.230> a<00:06:20.320> hell<00:06:20.440> of<00:06:20.500> a<00:06:20.620> lot<00:06:20.770> more

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
fun and it makes a hell of a lot more

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.050 
fun and it makes a hell of a lot more
noises<00:06:21.310> huh<00:06:22.830> well<00:06:23.830> the<00:06:24.520> other<00:06:24.670> good<00:06:25.000> thing

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060 
noises huh well the other good thing

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.640 
noises huh well the other good thing
about<00:06:25.240> this<00:06:25.510> is<00:06:25.570> you<00:06:25.720> can<00:06:25.810> put<00:06:26.080> a<00:06:26.110> recycler

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
about this is you can put a recycler

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.400 
about this is you can put a recycler
here<00:06:26.860> for<00:06:27.010> example<00:06:27.130> and<00:06:27.610> it<00:06:28.210> just

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
here for example and it just

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:31.800 
here for example and it just
continuously<00:06:29.410> makes<00:06:29.710> crap<00:06:30.040> all<00:06:30.250> the<00:06:30.550> time<00:06:30.810> and

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
continuously makes crap all the time and

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:33.270 
continuously makes crap all the time and
you<00:06:31.870> don't<00:06:32.050> even<00:06:32.200> need<00:06:32.440> this<00:06:32.650> many<00:06:32.890> you<00:06:33.070> might

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:33.280 
you don't even need this many you might
