00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
to insert it you would find the exact

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.760 
to insert it you would find the exact
location<00:00:55.000> in<00:00:55.540> the<00:00:55.630> world<00:00:55.780> where<00:00:56.020> or<00:00:56.320> it<00:00:56.620> would

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
location in the world where or it would

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.920 
location in the world where or it would

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
we got the pin point of mainly the

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.260 
we got the pin point of mainly the
location<00:01:12.640> now<00:01:12.790> we're<00:01:12.940> going<00:01:13.030> to<00:01:13.090> go<00:01:13.180> to

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
location now we're going to go to

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.870 
location now we're going to go to
hijacked<00:01:13.840> see<00:01:14.530> on<00:01:14.799> hijacked<00:01:15.280> we're<00:01:15.670> going<00:01:15.760> to

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
hijacked see on hijacked we're going to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
what comes up this close to the same

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.430 
what comes up this close to the same
exact<00:01:20.920> number<00:01:21.430> meaning<00:01:21.700> that<00:01:21.940> basically<00:01:22.630> this

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
exact number meaning that basically this

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.890 
exact number meaning that basically this
map<00:01:23.710> was<00:01:23.979> built<00:01:24.310> right<00:01:24.640> around<00:01:24.970> hijacked

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
map was built right around hijacked

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.960 
map was built right around hijacked
which<00:01:26.020> is<00:01:26.170> actually<00:01:26.380> pretty<00:01:26.830> amazing<00:01:27.100> so<00:01:27.940> i

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
which is actually pretty amazing so i

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.670 
which is actually pretty amazing so i
wanted<00:01:28.479> to<00:01:28.540> put<00:01:28.720> in<00:01:28.840> perspective<00:01:28.990> just<00:01:29.530> to

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
wanted to put in perspective just to

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.050

commentators<00:01:34.740> people<00:01:35.740> have<00:01:35.890> made<00:01:36.040> it<00:01:36.220> but

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
commentators people have made it but

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.399 
commentators people have made it but
nothing<00:01:36.970> really<00:01:37.060> big<00:01:37.390> but<00:01:37.540> it's<00:01:37.689> very<00:01:37.960> cool<00:01:38.229> if
