 Hello dear viewers with you virus 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.619
 room in this video I will tell you about 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.590
 android emulator for backups 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.970
 called he start andy link to his 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.260
 the download will be as always in the description 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:31.449
 under the video and now I'm quick to you 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.449
 I'll show you what he can do 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.019
 but let me tell you how he is 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.769
 It works, that is, it is not a whole program 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:42.019
 it is installed by virtualbox 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:45.109
 virtual machine and over it 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:48.460
 installed android itself and download 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:48.460
 computer he will be to the fullest 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.789
 but in principle it works smartly I donâ€™t know 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.789
 how will it work now when recording 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.520
 that is, it is a full android possible 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:07.180
 connect camera webcam microphone 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.140
 his me he immediately connected to my 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.750
 Wi-Fi network 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.910
 Well, most likely I just connected to 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:18.960
 network and it is written that the wifi is connected 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.960
 let's wait for it to start 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.229
 and here we are running our android 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.229
 let's unlock 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.729
 yes lays out a recording here is our worker 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.729
 table can go to the menu 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.020
 and usually here 's android you can 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.020
 go to construction 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.870
 We see that allegedly connected with us on 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.330
 wifi 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.200
 the language we fly I have already put Russian 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.010
 but he flew off 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.670
 version android 4.2 pro update but not 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.670
 it turns out 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.470
 here we can go update the system and here 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.530
 already 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.840
 check well here it is checked a minute 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.790
 backwards 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.000
 but this is most likely an update from 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.920
 the developer of this particular emulator 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.510
 the rest is all as in the usual android 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:28.610
 there can we run any applications i 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.610
 tried to enter the browser 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:38.569
 when installing with it when you first start 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:43.950
 This emulator will require your 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:45.950
 your Google e-mail and password and further 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.080
 all as usual we can transfer to 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.980
 building from your usual phone on 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.140
 this emulator 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.690
 I have already tried to watch the video in 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.620

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.620
