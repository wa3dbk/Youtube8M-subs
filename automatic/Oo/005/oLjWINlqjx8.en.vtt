00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
you in your pocket or case and you don't

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.149 
you in your pocket or case and you don't
have<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.240> fear<00:01:21.630> anyone<00:01:22.170> stealing<00:01:22.920> all<00:01:23.130> that

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
have to fear anyone stealing all that

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.850 
have to fear anyone stealing all that
data<00:01:23.640> but<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> trick<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.750> remember<00:01:25.500> to

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
data but the trick is to remember to

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.090 
data but the trick is to remember to
take<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.490> out<00:01:27.229> when<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.350> leave<00:01:28.560> your<00:01:28.740> case<00:01:28.920> I

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
take this out when you leave your case I

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.499 
take this out when you leave your case I
think<00:01:29.130> they<00:01:29.460> should<00:01:29.640> have<00:01:29.729> had<00:01:29.909> some<00:01:30.210> kind<00:01:30.450> of

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
think they should have had some kind of

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.020 
think they should have had some kind of
a<00:01:30.600> locking<00:01:30.900> mechanism<00:01:31.619> here<00:01:31.650> or<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.909> know

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
a locking mechanism here or you know

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.359 
a locking mechanism here or you know
some<00:01:33.270> kind<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.659> key<00:01:34.020> lock<00:01:34.350> well<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.040> can't

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
some kind of a key lock well you can't

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.910 
some kind of a key lock well you can't
lock<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.119> if<00:01:36.329> you<00:01:36.630> do<00:01:36.900> forget<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.650> take<00:01:37.890> it

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
lock this if you do forget to take it

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.920 
lock this if you do forget to take it
out<00:01:38.220> when<00:01:38.520> you<00:01:38.610> get<00:01:38.790> up<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.210> when<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.689> leave

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.080 
out when you get up and when you leave
your<00:01:40.140> system<00:01:40.439> unattended<00:01:40.890> because<00:01:41.130> if<00:01:41.909> for

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
your system unattended because if for

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.780 
your system unattended because if for
example<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.990> forget<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.890> somebody<00:01:44.579> does

example you forget and somebody does

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.460 
example you forget and somebody does
take<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.420> they're<00:01:45.689> not<00:01:45.780> only<00:01:45.990> going<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.259> take

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
take it they're not only going to take

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.350 
take it they're not only going to take
your<00:01:46.710> drive<00:01:47.070> they're<00:01:47.670> going<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.939> take<00:01:48.090> all<00:01:48.299> of

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
your drive they're going to take all of

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.230

your<00:01:48.960> information<00:01:49.740> with<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.700> while<00:01:51.030> this

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
your information with it so while this

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.450 
your information with it so while this
is<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.479> great<00:01:51.869> feature<00:01:52.170> I<00:01:52.530> think<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.130> could<00:01:53.340> have

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
is a great feature I think it could have

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.670 
is a great feature I think it could have
been<00:01:53.490> improved<00:01:54.000> on<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.479> having<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.170> lock<00:01:55.380> here

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
been improved on and having a lock here

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.429 
been improved on and having a lock here
would<00:01:56.219> have<00:01:56.460> made<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.479> much<00:01:57.509> better<00:01:58.110> and

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
would have made it so much better and

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.319 
would have made it so much better and
note<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.729> clear<00:02:00.030> top<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.869> see<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.770> drive

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
note the clear top you can see the drive

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.940 
note the clear top you can see the drive
wouldn't<00:02:03.329> see<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.600> then<00:02:03.750> also<00:02:03.990> all<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.740> other

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950

connections here at the top I personally

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.600 
connections here at the top I personally
would<00:02:08.550> prefer<00:02:08.580> if<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.660> was<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.500> solid<00:02:10.860> casing

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
would prefer if this was a solid casing

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.530 
would prefer if this was a solid casing
instead<00:02:12.000> of

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
instead of
