00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
anyways let's get started first off

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.130 
anyways let's get started first off
learn<00:00:38.160> when<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.460> engage<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.239> monster<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.930> is

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
learn when to engage the monster it is

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.780 
learn when to engage the monster it is
super<00:00:40.680> tempting<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.309> shoot<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.670> monster

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
super tempting to shoot the monster

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.880 
super tempting to shoot the monster
every<00:00:42.420> time<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.809> see<00:00:43.050> it<00:00:43.140> at<00:00:43.320> long<00:00:43.530> range

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
every time you see it at long range

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.440 
every time you see it at long range
especially<00:00:44.160> if<00:00:44.640> you're<00:00:44.789> hot<00:00:45.000> on<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.270> trail

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
especially if you're hot on the trail

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.990 
especially if you're hot on the trail
and<00:00:45.809> ahead<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.620> rest<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:47.010> your<00:00:47.160> team<00:00:47.399> but

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
and ahead of the rest of your team but

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.450 
and ahead of the rest of your team but
it's<00:00:48.120> usually<00:00:48.360> not<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:49.050> good<00:00:49.079> idea<00:00:49.440> for<00:00:49.860> several

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
it's usually not a good idea for several

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.549 
it's usually not a good idea for several
reasons<00:00:50.879> for<00:00:51.510> starters<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.140> game<00:00:52.350> is

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
reasons for starters the game is

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.189 
reasons for starters the game is
centered<00:00:52.920> around<00:00:53.010> 4v1<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.270> reason<00:00:54.719> which

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
centered around 4v1 for a reason which

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.799 
centered around 4v1 for a reason which
is<00:00:55.230> why<00:00:55.500> hunters<00:00:56.039> will<00:00:56.340> lose<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> 1v1<00:00:57.239> match

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
is why hunters will lose a 1v1 match

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.439 
is why hunters will lose a 1v1 match
with<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.469> monster<00:00:58.890> every<00:00:59.309> single<00:00:59.640> time<00:00:59.879> so

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
with the monster every single time so

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.330 
with the monster every single time so
don't<00:01:00.690> try<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:00.989> engage<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.680> monster<00:01:02.100> without

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
don't try to engage the monster without

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.910 
don't try to engage the monster without
backup<00:01:02.910> now<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.750> can<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:03.960> tricky<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.589> sort<00:01:04.830> of

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
backup now this can be tricky to sort of

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.859 
backup now this can be tricky to sort of
keep<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.369> balancing<00:01:06.030> act<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.390> when<00:01:06.630> to

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
keep up that balancing act of when to

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.960 
keep up that balancing act of when to
engage<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.470> when<00:01:07.590> not<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.860> but<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.640> fact<00:01:08.790> to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
engage and when not to but the fact to

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.609 
engage and when not to but the fact to
remember<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.630> you<00:01:09.750> are<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.229> much<00:01:10.260> more

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
remember is that you are so much more

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.080 
remember is that you are so much more
useful<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.159> your<00:01:11.280> team<00:01:11.490> when<00:01:11.700> you're<00:01:11.820> alive

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
useful to your team when you're alive

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.270 
useful to your team when you're alive
than<00:01:12.450> when<00:01:12.630> you're<00:01:12.780> dead<00:01:13.080> even<00:01:13.890> if<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.130> have

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
than when you're dead even if you have

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.710 
than when you're dead even if you have
no<00:01:14.520> idea<00:01:14.850> what<00:01:15.060> you're<00:01:15.180> doing<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.600> you're

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
no idea what you're doing and you're

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.510 
no idea what you're doing and you're
just<00:01:15.900> starting<00:01:16.229> with<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.500> game<00:01:16.710> another

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
just starting with the game another

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.070 
just starting with the game another
reason<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.090> long<00:01:18.420> range<00:01:18.659> encounters

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
reason is that long range encounters

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.469 
reason is that long range encounters
will<00:01:19.470> rarely<00:01:19.770> do<00:01:20.159> much<00:01:20.400> damage<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.360> know

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
will rarely do much damage you know

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.450 
will rarely do much damage you know
that's<00:01:21.720> actually<00:01:21.930> useful<00:01:22.470> because<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
that's actually useful because the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.550 
that's actually useful because the
monster<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.030> usually<00:01:24.540> armored<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.229> if<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.409> get

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
monster is usually armored so if you get

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.649 
monster is usually armored so if you get
a<00:01:25.590> few<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:25.950> those<00:01:26.100> long<00:01:26.369> range<00:01:26.640> shots<00:01:26.970> in<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
a few of those long range shots in the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.600 
a few of those long range shots in the
monster<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.259> easily<00:01:28.740> replenish<00:01:29.220> its<00:01:29.369> health

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
monster can easily replenish its health

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.359 
monster can easily replenish its health
by<00:01:29.820> eating<00:01:29.850> more<00:01:30.390> wildlife<00:01:30.930> if<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.500> escapes<00:01:31.650> so

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
by eating more wildlife if it escapes so

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.609 
by eating more wildlife if it escapes so
really<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.360> only<00:01:33.390> time<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.110> should<00:01:34.140> shoot<00:01:34.530> a

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
really the only time you should shoot a

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.410 
really the only time you should shoot a
monster<00:01:34.979> at<00:01:35.159> long<00:01:35.369> range<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:36.060> if<00:01:36.240> you're<00:01:36.390> using

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
monster at long range is if you're using

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.899 
monster at long range is if you're using
something<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.259> track<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.860> or<00:01:37.979> slow<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.220> down<00:01:38.340> so

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
something to track it or slow it down so

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.749 
something to track it or slow it down so
for<00:01:39.180> example<00:01:39.600> Val's<00:01:40.259> tranq<00:01:40.799> gun<00:01:41.040> slows<00:01:41.520> down

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
for example Val's tranq gun slows down

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.240 
for example Val's tranq gun slows down
the<00:01:41.880> monster<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.479> aids<00:01:42.960> tracking<00:01:43.770> dart<00:01:44.009> will

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
the monster and aids tracking dart will

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.710 
the monster and aids tracking dart will
track<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.700> monster<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.240> you'll<00:01:45.360> know<00:01:45.509> where

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
track the monster so you'll know where

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.590 
track the monster so you'll know where
it<00:01:45.840> is<00:01:45.930> at<00:01:46.079> all<00:01:46.200> times<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:47.000> finally<00:01:48.000> when<00:01:48.479> you

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
it is at all times so finally when you

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.450 
it is at all times so finally when you
shoot<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.930> monster<00:01:49.290> from<00:01:49.590> long<00:01:49.890> range<00:01:49.920> you

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
shoot the monster from long range you

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.520 
shoot the monster from long range you
lose<00:01:50.700> any<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.360> all<00:01:51.600> element<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.320> surprise

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
lose any and all element of surprise

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.800 
lose any and all element of surprise
it's<00:01:53.070> possible<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.729> surprise<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.240> monster<00:01:54.630> as

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
it's possible to surprise the monster as

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.170 
it's possible to surprise the monster as
the<00:01:55.140> hunters<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.710> trap<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.070> down<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.700> that's

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
the hunters and trap it down and that's

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.450 
the hunters and trap it down and that's
a<00:01:57.360> really<00:01:57.630> fun<00:01:57.810> experience<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.799> lose<00:01:59.040> out<00:01:59.250> on

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
a really fun experience you lose out on

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.520 
a really fun experience you lose out on
that<00:01:59.670> if<00:01:59.850> you<00:02:00.090> don't<00:02:00.479> if<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.110> shoot<00:02:01.409> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
that if you don't if you shoot the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.109 
that if you don't if you shoot the
monster<00:02:01.829> at<00:02:01.920> long<00:02:02.040> range<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.610> alert<00:02:02.969> it

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
monster at long range and you alert it

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.569 
monster at long range and you alert it
so<00:02:03.360> it<00:02:03.719> knows<00:02:03.990> exactly<00:02:04.200> where<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.890> are<00:02:04.920> once

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
so it knows exactly where you are once

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.580 
so it knows exactly where you are once
you<00:02:05.670> shoot<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.600> there's<00:02:06.750> no<00:02:06.930> sneaking<00:02:07.290> up

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
you shoot it so there's no sneaking up

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.529 
you shoot it so there's no sneaking up
with<00:02:07.740> a<00:02:07.770> trapper<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.340> trap<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:08.970> actually

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.979 
trapper and allow the monster to get
away<00:02:35.489> I<00:02:35.519> mean<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:35.939> is<00:02:36.060> terrible<00:02:36.599> so<00:02:36.810> it's

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
away I mean that is terrible so it's

away I mean that is terrible so it's
probably<00:02:37.319> a<00:02:37.409> good<00:02:37.680> idea<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:38.069> kill<00:02:38.340> venom

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760

whether or not it's a good idea to kill
it<00:03:14.730> or<00:03:14.849> just<00:03:15.180> move<00:03:15.389> on<00:03:15.599> towards<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.109> monster

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620

my<00:03:17.010> last<00:03:17.219> tip<00:03:17.459> for<00:03:17.609> you<00:03:17.699> guys<00:03:17.729> in<00:03:18.000> this<00:03:18.090> video

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
my last tip for you guys in this video

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.839 
my last tip for you guys in this video
is<00:03:18.569> to<00:03:18.780> learn<00:03:18.989> how<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.290> effectively<00:03:19.919> use<00:03:20.129> your

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
is to learn how to effectively use your

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:23.960 
is to learn how to effectively use your
jetpack<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:21.900> let's<00:03:22.530> talk<00:03:22.739> about<00:03:22.799> jetpacks<00:03:23.639> all

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
jetpack so let's talk about jetpacks all

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.210 
jetpack so let's talk about jetpacks all
hunters<00:03:24.569> come<00:03:24.930> equipped<00:03:25.290> with<00:03:25.530> one<00:03:25.859> and<00:03:26.129> the

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
hunters come equipped with one and the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.520 
hunters come equipped with one and the
jet<00:03:26.459> pack<00:03:26.669> makes<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.180> possible<00:03:27.359> to<00:03:27.840> both<00:03:28.199> catch

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
jet pack makes it possible to both catch

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.039 
jet pack makes it possible to both catch
and<00:03:28.859> evade<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.579> monster<00:03:30.060> beyond<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.870> obvious

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
and evade the monster beyond the obvious

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.170 
and evade the monster beyond the obvious
here<00:03:31.709> are<00:03:31.799> some<00:03:31.979> very<00:03:32.250> important<00:03:32.729> lessons<00:03:33.120> to

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
here are some very important lessons to

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.089 
here are some very important lessons to
learn<00:03:33.449> you<00:03:33.989> know<00:03:34.079> to<00:03:34.169> actually<00:03:34.319> learn<00:03:34.829> how<00:03:34.859> to

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
learn you know to actually learn how to

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.789 
learn you know to actually learn how to
effectively<00:03:35.519> use<00:03:35.729> your<00:03:36.269> jetpack<00:03:36.599> so<00:03:37.169> the

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
effectively use your jetpack so the

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.830 
effectively use your jetpack so the
first<00:03:38.010> one<00:03:38.220> is<00:03:38.250> thrusting<00:03:39.120> forward<00:03:39.569> it's<00:03:39.780> the

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
first one is thrusting forward it's the

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.809 
first one is thrusting forward it's the
fastest<00:03:40.409> way<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.650> get<00:03:40.889> from<00:03:40.949> point<00:03:41.340> A<00:03:41.609> to<00:03:41.639> point

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
fastest way to get from point A to point

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.259 
fastest way to get from point A to point
B<00:03:42.829> regardless<00:03:43.829> I<00:03:43.979> mean<00:03:44.129> kyra<00:03:44.430> does<00:03:44.819> have<00:03:45.090> this

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
B regardless I mean kyra does have this

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.210 
B regardless I mean kyra does have this
acceleration<00:03:45.930> field<00:03:46.319> that's<00:03:46.560> an<00:03:46.769> exception

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
acceleration field that's an exception

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.369 
acceleration field that's an exception
but<00:03:47.370> for<00:03:47.549> everyone<00:03:47.790> else<00:03:48.060> point<00:03:48.900> A<00:03:48.959> to<00:03:48.989> point<00:03:49.109> B

but for everyone else point A to point B

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.439 
but for everyone else point A to point B
it's<00:03:49.739> thrusting<00:03:50.370> forward<00:03:50.579> over<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.209> over

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
it's thrusting forward over and over

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:53.149 
it's thrusting forward over and over
this<00:03:51.659> is<00:03:51.810> really<00:03:52.139> important<00:03:52.590> when<00:03:52.769> learning

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
this is really important when learning

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.490 
this is really important when learning
to<00:03:53.340> cut<00:03:53.609> off<00:03:53.759> the<00:03:53.939> monster<00:03:54.359> especially<00:03:55.319> as<00:03:55.470> a

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
to cut off the monster especially as a

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.379 
to cut off the monster especially as a
trapper<00:03:55.829> because<00:03:56.220> that's<00:03:56.459> your<00:03:56.699> job<00:03:56.939> to<00:03:57.000> trap

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
trapper because that's your job to trap

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.259 
trapper because that's your job to trap
the<00:03:57.569> monster<00:03:57.689> so<00:03:58.439> 5<00:03:58.829> forward<00:03:59.280> thrusts<00:03:59.849> covers

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
the monster so 5 forward thrusts covers

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.240 
the monster so 5 forward thrusts covers
a<00:04:00.419> ton<00:04:00.900> of<00:04:00.930> distance<00:04:01.470> probably<00:04:01.739> more<00:04:02.009> than<00:04:02.189> you

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
a ton of distance probably more than you

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.429 
a ton of distance probably more than you
realized<00:04:02.879> the<00:04:03.479> second<00:04:03.840> thing<00:04:03.989> is<00:04:04.169> you<00:04:04.290> can

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 
realized the second thing is you can

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:07.159 
realized the second thing is you can
still<00:04:04.769> gain<00:04:05.040> altitude<00:04:05.310> with<00:04:05.879> no<00:04:06.180> fuel<00:04:06.599> this<00:04:07.109> is

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
still gain altitude with no fuel this is

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:08.809 
still gain altitude with no fuel this is
something<00:04:07.650> that<00:04:07.680> I<00:04:07.769> bet<00:04:08.040> a<00:04:08.189> ton<00:04:08.489> of<00:04:08.519> people

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:08.819 
something that I bet a ton of people

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.539 
something that I bet a ton of people
either<00:04:09.180> gloss<00:04:09.629> over<00:04:09.959> in<00:04:10.319> the<00:04:10.560> hunter<00:04:11.009> tutorial

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
either gloss over in the hunter tutorial

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.309 
either gloss over in the hunter tutorial
or<00:04:11.939> didn't<00:04:12.359> even<00:04:12.389> realize<00:04:12.870> in<00:04:13.019> the<00:04:13.109> first

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
or didn't even realize in the first

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.170 
or didn't even realize in the first
place<00:04:13.560> when<00:04:14.099> you're<00:04:14.250> stuck<00:04:14.489> at<00:04:14.639> the<00:04:14.759> bottom<00:04:15.030> of

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
place when you're stuck at the bottom of

place when you're stuck at the bottom of
a<00:04:15.239> cliff<00:04:15.569> with<00:04:15.870> zero<00:04:16.650> fuel<00:04:17.070> in<00:04:17.250> your<00:04:17.280> tank<00:04:17.400> you

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
a cliff with zero fuel in your tank you

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.849 
a cliff with zero fuel in your tank you
can<00:04:18.180> still<00:04:18.479> hold<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.900> jetpack<00:04:19.320> button<00:04:19.680> and

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
can still hold the jetpack button and

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.009 
can still hold the jetpack button and
gain<00:04:20.099> altitude<00:04:20.370> up<00:04:20.909> the<00:04:21.180> cliff<00:04:21.449> you<00:04:21.599> just<00:04:21.840> kind

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
gain altitude up the cliff you just kind

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.750 
gain altitude up the cliff you just kind
of<00:04:22.049> have<00:04:22.169> to<00:04:22.289> kind<00:04:22.830> of<00:04:22.889> stick<00:04:23.219> to<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.460> cliff

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
of have to kind of stick to the cliff

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.790 
of have to kind of stick to the cliff
look<00:04:24.240> up<00:04:24.450> and<00:04:24.750> then<00:04:24.930> hold<00:04:25.139> that<00:04:25.320> button<00:04:25.650> and

look up and then hold that button and

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.280 
look up and then hold that button and
you'll<00:04:25.919> go

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:26.290 
you'll go

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:28.440 
you'll go
the<00:04:26.350> cliff<00:04:26.620> just<00:04:27.100> like<00:04:27.310> that<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:28.000> third<00:04:28.240> thing

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
the cliff just like that the third thing

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.390 
the cliff just like that the third thing
to<00:04:28.510> keep<00:04:28.750> in<00:04:28.870> mind<00:04:28.930> is<00:04:29.350> to<00:04:29.380> use<00:04:29.770> your<00:04:30.040> jetpack

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
to keep in mind is to use your jetpack

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.180 
to keep in mind is to use your jetpack
thrust<00:04:30.940> to<00:04:31.210> actually<00:04:31.660> evade<00:04:32.200> the<00:04:32.440> monster<00:04:32.890> so

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
thrust to actually evade the monster so

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.670 
thrust to actually evade the monster so
when<00:04:33.790> you're<00:04:34.000> in<00:04:34.210> open<00:04:34.690> combat<00:04:34.930> in<00:04:35.290> open

pack<00:04:38.230> is<00:04:38.590> now<00:04:38.860> repurposed<00:04:39.580> as<00:04:39.730> a<00:04:40.030> form<00:04:40.420> of

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
pack is now repurposed as a form of

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.330 
pack is now repurposed as a form of
defense<00:04:40.930> because<00:04:41.230> you<00:04:41.260> can<00:04:41.500> use<00:04:41.680> it<00:04:41.800> to<00:04:41.950> evade
