00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.150
 and welcomes everyone is tight seen 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.070
 we left for a video tutorials 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.809
 for rhj and laly crystal sure that the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.429
 heating clan you have to know that in two 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.859
 days I managed to arrive li 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.600
 crystal thanks to a strategy that is 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.199
 extremely simple so 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.699
 the latter is defined by a unit 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.369
 larcher level 3 you have a bow 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:31.769
 level 3 to see above you're ready 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.899
 ready to go in league crystal so 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.969
 the main goal is to look for 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.070
 villages where the town hall will be placed 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.050
 outside to prevent you 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.809
 to go steal resources 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.460
 so it's extremely simple 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.969
 just patience by clicking 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.570
 following 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.750
 next following there I will show you 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.940
 several videos a video showing you 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.199
 an attack never realized because it 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.510
 be aware that a defeat can you 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.309
 lose 30 points for saying that a 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.309
 victory will make you win only 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.229
 between 4 and 10 trophies so he will see 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.340
 it will take motivation and 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.610
 especially ben patience it's certain 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.880
 I am soon in him in the process of 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.930
 pass the line christal two so that's 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.030
 to tell you that this stratum 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.909
 still works started by the 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.740
 defeat so an attack never 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.690
 realized so when you see a 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.400
 mortar close 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.750
 near the town hall never 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.300
 attack because you have to know that the 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.430
 archives have tight sprayed that this is 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.160
 certain there is no things to 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.720
 do and his defenses there you see there 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.610
 because come out of the ground Thursday 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.010
 excuse me I never hold back the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.170
 term that gives dumps and ben on 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.050
 can anticipate them by simply doing a 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.190
 spacing around the hotel's stall 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.480
 of town 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.420
 almost every village I've been able to 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:56.200
 cross who had a spacing you 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:00.340
 find these crap around here is a 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.380
 assaulted attack realizes as I wanted 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.860
 says the goal is to find so well 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.380
 heard the city hall that is done 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.660
 outside I do not see how you 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.900
 explain otherwise than you say you 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.300
 get out archers and let you do 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.070
 on the other hand to be very careful and placed 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.830
 in the center so that the turrets 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:23.920
 come out of the ground and send you 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.740
 dumps what you need to use again 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.980
 a lot more unit lose a little bit of 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.980
 profitability 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.879
 we will accelerate to reach the end 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:40.560
 nothing complicated even strategy a 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.840
 village on the outside against here 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.900
 you see a detour they go out and 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.319
 it leaves no respite to my 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.299
 archives 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.069
 we had heard I continue to swoon 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.319
 take out the fashion archers the breil 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.360
 in attack we attack we attack and we 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.799
 attack and everything goes well but it 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.810
 could have gone very wrong what 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.510
 look if I had placed further left 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.489
 I would have brought out all the turrets 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.799
 and I do not think my asso would have 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.629
 been prolific so be careful 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:12.870
 pass well in the center to give 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:14.310
 no scope to this crap that we 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.140
 have come to the end of this little 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.150
 tutorial I hope you have liked 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.010
 you just saw that it's very easy 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.140
 to reach the christ alma what's the point 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.989
 that slab because you can not 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:27.660
 do nothing unless you like to play the 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.090
 trophy race like me so there my 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.970
 goal of reaching the 3000 points of 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:35.489
 do too much with this strategy 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.760
 I think it's not won but you 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.079
 will see this on the live go good end 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.989
 of the day at the end of the evening to all 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:45.620
 and thanks to you for watching the video 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.620
 bye
