00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
itself so how could we you know how

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.350 
itself so how could we you know how
could<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.220> do<00:01:29.369> something<00:01:29.610> special<00:01:29.939> with<00:01:30.150> that

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
could we do something special with that

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.870 
could we do something special with that
and<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:31.140> way<00:01:31.259> we<00:01:31.380> developed<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.490> thought

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
and the way we developed the thought

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.580 
and the way we developed the thought
process<00:01:33.299> line<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.750> was<00:01:33.869> really<00:01:34.259> there<00:01:34.409> two

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
process line it was really there two

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.240 
process line it was really there two
different<00:01:34.710> things

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
different things

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.390 
different things
so<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.030> first<00:01:36.299> first<00:01:36.780> floor<00:01:37.049> thing<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.650> a

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
so the first first floor thing is a

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.270 
so the first first floor thing is a
little<00:01:38.970> louder<00:01:39.150> music<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.840> lot<00:01:39.960> more<00:01:40.200> pop<00:01:40.799> music

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
here so I'm like that that's what we did

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.850
