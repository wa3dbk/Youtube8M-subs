like and decorate that out and as you
see<00:01:27.540> here<00:01:27.720> we<00:01:27.810> have<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.020> line<00:01:28.229> going<00:01:28.650> through

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
see here we have the line going through

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.800 
see here we have the line going through
the<00:01:29.040> skull<00:01:29.280> right<00:01:29.460> now<00:01:29.700> but<00:01:30.210> if<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.450> were<00:01:30.750> to

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
the skull right now but if we were to

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.100 
the skull right now but if we were to
actually<00:01:31.549> redo<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.790> skull<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.360> banner<00:01:33.840> it

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
actually redo the skull on the banner it

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.319 
actually redo the skull on the banner it
would<00:01:34.500> obviously<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:35.100> back<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.670> top<00:01:35.909> which<00:01:36.210> is

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
would obviously be back on top which is

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.140 
would obviously be back on top which is
another<00:01:36.659> cool<00:01:36.960> thing<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.740> they<00:01:38.070> did<00:01:38.340> add<00:01:38.790> or

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150

of<00:02:05.310> course<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.030> skulls<00:02:06.750> do<00:02:07.020> drop<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.970> survival

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
of course the skulls do drop in survival

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.400 
of course the skulls do drop in survival
now<00:02:09.090> now<00:02:09.300> they<00:02:09.450> did<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:09.810> they<00:02:10.229> already

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
implemented this on the xbox 360

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.880 
implemented this on the xbox 360
see<00:02:13.030> I<00:02:13.210> think<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:13.690> was<00:02:13.780> like<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:14.110> use<00:02:14.260> 16<00:02:14.740> or

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
see I think it was like to use 16 or

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.040 
see I think it was like to use 16 or
something<00:02:15.040> but<00:02:15.700> now<00:02:15.970> they<00:02:16.150> have<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.390> on<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:16.720> PC

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
something but now they have it on the PC

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.500 
something but now they have it on the PC
as<00:02:17.140> well<00:02:17.170> in<00:02:17.620> survival<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.340> can<00:02:18.610> get<00:02:18.760> creeper

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
as well in survival you can get creeper

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.600 
as well in survival you can get creeper
skulls<00:02:19.810> as<00:02:20.080> well<00:02:20.530> as<00:02:20.650> zombie<00:02:21.010> skulls<00:02:21.310> and
