 which results in who you should have with whom you are interested in the subject 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.560
 to do who responds or less so it seems that I do not think 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.960
 that people are going to like to see that they are going to be sensitized by this 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.070
 in the Senate book that has just been released by the photographer 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.580

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.220

 four days I was able to make the photo that is on the cover of the book the first photo 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.120
 in the world of the beast 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.880

 will be open only by photographers for diversity 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.359
 it was also a challenge 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.670
 your withdrawal 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.670
 so you have to have a little more sensitivity because you look 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:49.409
 for this purpose 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.470
 there was nothing 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.970
 we were not right with the few 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.740
 an hour goes by and you go to see that there will grow less seven months 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.740

 coastal environments the purpose of revitalizing photography with this 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.829
 moment of transformation 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.749
 and conservation 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:31.070
 even if you can not get people to look more advanced 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.690
