buy<00:04:00.950> this<00:04:01.010> smaller<00:04:01.489> size<00:04:01.820> or<00:04:02.120> I<00:04:02.150> did<00:04:02.900> see<00:04:03.080> one

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
buy this smaller size or I did see one

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
buy this smaller size or I did see one
time<00:04:03.470> at<00:04:03.560> Michael's<00:04:03.860> they<00:04:03.980> had<00:04:04.130> like<00:04:04.280> a

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
time at Michael's they had like a

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.120 
time at Michael's they had like a
gigantic<00:04:04.940> size<00:04:05.570> of<00:04:05.900> this<00:04:06.019> so<00:04:06.230> if<00:04:06.260> you<00:04:06.560> use<00:04:06.950> this

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.410 
gigantic size of this so if you use this
and<00:04:07.370> think<00:04:07.549> it<00:04:07.610> would<00:04:07.700> be<00:04:07.790> worth<00:04:07.940> it<00:04:08.150> for<00:04:08.180> me<00:04:08.330> to
