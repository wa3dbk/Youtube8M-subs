going<00:05:27.370> to<00:05:27.490> run<00:05:27.610> with<00:05:27.880> good<00:05:28.090> receivers<00:05:28.690> and

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
going to run with good receivers and

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.010

which I think helps them as far as

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.560 
which I think helps them as far as
developing<00:05:36.190> it<00:05:36.370> for<00:05:36.699> the<00:05:36.789> next<00:05:36.940> level<00:05:37.449> because

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
developing it for the next level because

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.060
