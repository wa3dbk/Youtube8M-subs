hit this week put them into the
calculator<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.210> go<00:00:54.570> for<00:00:54.960> 101<00:00:55.860> percent<00:00:56.579> of

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
calculator and go for 101 percent of

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.680 
calculator and go for 101 percent of
each<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.300> these<00:00:57.449> i<00:00:57.750> started<00:00:58.559> this<00:00:58.739> cycle<00:00:59.250> with

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
some fake numbers the actual numbers

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.490 
some fake numbers the actual numbers
that<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:05.220> training<00:01:05.729> max's<00:01:06.270> for<00:01:06.659> Windler<00:01:07.200> were

without<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.150> added<00:01:12.330> weight<00:01:13.070> which<00:01:14.070> were

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
without the added weight which were

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.030 
without the added weight which were
numbers<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.360> i<00:01:15.390> had<00:01:15.659> never<00:01:15.869> hit<00:01:16.170> before<00:01:16.409> and

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
still put that in and went for 101

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.300 
still put that in and went for 101
percent<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.960> number<00:01:22.320> which<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.130> why<00:01:23.250> you

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
percent of that number which is why you

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.080 
percent of that number which is why you
saw<00:01:23.700> me<00:01:23.880> fail<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.689> lot<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:25.020> my<00:01:25.140> top<00:01:25.409> singles<00:01:26.090> this
