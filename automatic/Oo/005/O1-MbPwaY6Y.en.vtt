00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
with the abscesses and the lesions that

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.000 
with the abscesses and the lesions that

are created in the mucous membranes from

are created in the mucous membranes from
breathing<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:26.580> fecal<00:02:26.849> particulate<00:02:27.299> dust

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
breathing in the fecal particulate dust

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.199 
breathing in the fecal particulate dust
all<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.200> time<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:29.610> of<00:02:29.760> course<00:02:29.940> then<00:02:30.060> when

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
all the time and of course then when

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.869 
all the time and of course then when
you're<00:02:30.330> done<00:02:30.890> eventually<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.310> have<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:32.489> go<00:02:32.580> in

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
you're done eventually you have to go in

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.789 
you're done eventually you have to go in
and<00:02:33.030> you<00:02:33.090> have<00:02:33.180> to<00:02:33.299> clean<00:02:33.599> out<00:02:33.840> all<00:02:34.170> that

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
and you have to clean out all that

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.619 
and you have to clean out all that
litter<00:02:35.099> in<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.400> manure<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.390> there's<00:02:36.569> a

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
litter in the manure so there's a

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.270 
litter in the manure so there's a
mechanical<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.440> with<00:02:37.680> energy<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.160> mechanical

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
mechanical in with energy and mechanical

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.880 
mechanical in with energy and mechanical
out<00:02:38.819> with<00:02:39.060> energy<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.660> of<00:02:40.379> course<00:02:40.590> all<00:02:40.769> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
out with energy and of course all the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.710 
out with energy and of course all the
time<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.310> birds<00:02:41.579> are<00:02:41.879> in<00:02:42.329> a<00:02:42.360> very<00:02:42.480> unhealthy

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
time the birds are in a very unhealthy

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.250 
time the birds are in a very unhealthy
environment<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.769> you<00:02:43.799> know<00:02:44.900> energy<00:02:45.900> doesn't

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
environment so you know energy doesn't

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.110 
environment so you know energy doesn't
win<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.709> farmer<00:02:47.069> doesn't<00:02:47.280> win<00:02:47.579> the<00:02:47.879> birds

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
win the farmer doesn't win the birds

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.410 
win the farmer doesn't win the birds
don't<00:02:48.390> win<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.769> eater<00:02:50.280> doesn't<00:02:50.879> win<00:02:51.120> you

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
don't win the the eater doesn't win you

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.830 
don't win the the eater doesn't win you
know<00:02:51.720> nobody<00:02:52.110> wins<00:02:52.349> in<00:02:52.560> that<00:02:52.709> system<00:02:53.160> you

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
know nobody wins in that system you

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.539 
know nobody wins in that system you
don't<00:02:54.840> have<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.230> be<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.890> don't<00:02:56.069> have<00:02:56.220> to<00:02:56.370> be<00:02:56.519> a

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
don't have to be you don't have to be a

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.430 
don't have to be you don't have to be a
rocket<00:02:56.940> scientist<00:02:57.629> to<00:02:57.690> just<00:02:57.959> look<00:02:58.140> at<00:02:58.290> this

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
rocket scientist to just look at this

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.839 
rocket scientist to just look at this
and<00:02:58.650> say<00:02:58.769> you<00:02:58.829> know<00:02:59.040> what<00:02:59.220> this<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.519> a<00:02:59.549> way<00:02:59.730> it

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
and say you know what this is a way it

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.750 
and say you know what this is a way it
ought<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.000> be<00:03:00.319> let's<00:03:01.319> here<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:02.459> one<00:03:02.609> of<00:03:02.700> the

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
ought to be let's here and one of the

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.890 
ought to be let's here and one of the
things<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.120> think<00:03:03.329> it's<00:03:03.450> important<00:03:03.810> to

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
things I think it's important to

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.400 
things I think it's important to
understand<00:03:04.379> here<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:04.680> it's<00:03:05.579> beautiful<00:03:06.450> you

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
understand here is it's beautiful you

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.940 
understand here is it's beautiful you
know<00:03:07.500> and<00:03:07.709> good<00:03:08.250> food<00:03:08.549> production<00:03:09.239> should<00:03:09.750> be

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
know and good food production should be

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.370 
know and good food production should be
aesthetically<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.209> aromatically<00:03:12.380> sensually

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
aesthetically and aromatically sensually

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.099 
aesthetically and aromatically sensually
romantic
