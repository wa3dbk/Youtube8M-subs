00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.420 
is so hot outside and I'm going to take
a<00:03:44.660> paper<00:03:44.900> towel<00:03:45.320> just<00:03:45.350> to<00:03:45.650> kind<00:03:45.890> of<00:03:45.920> speed<00:03:46.250> up

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
a paper towel just to kind of speed up

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:47.830 
a paper towel just to kind of speed up
the<00:03:46.550> process<00:03:47.000> you<00:03:47.180> can<00:03:47.210> always<00:03:47.540> use<00:03:47.810> a

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
the process you can always use a

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.040 
the process you can always use a
microfiber<00:03:48.410> towel<00:03:48.950> or<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.370> t-shirt<00:03:50.330> make<00:03:50.870> sure

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
microfiber towel or a t-shirt make sure

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.500 
microfiber towel or a t-shirt make sure
it's<00:03:51.170> 100%<00:03:51.500> cotton<00:03:51.830> or<00:03:52.459> a<00:03:52.520> paper<00:03:52.940> towel
