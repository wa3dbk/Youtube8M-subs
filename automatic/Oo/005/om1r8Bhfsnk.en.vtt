and my hair is dark so 30 should work on

whatever<00:02:25.900> color<00:02:26.290> hair<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.760> then<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.629> mix

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
whatever color hair and then you mix

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.080

until<00:02:31.540> it<00:02:32.379> becomes<00:02:33.450> thick<00:02:34.450> but<00:02:35.140> not<00:02:35.310> solid<00:02:36.310> so

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
until it becomes thick but not solid so

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.830

don't have anymore that in purple haze

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.460

and<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:12.639> purple<00:04:13.030> is<00:04:13.239> darker<00:04:13.780> so<00:04:14.019> I<00:04:14.049> would<00:04:14.290> put

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
and the purple is darker so I would put

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:16.110 
and the purple is darker so I would put
a<00:04:14.500> lot<00:04:14.739> more<00:04:14.919> of<00:04:14.979> the<00:04:15.159> pink<00:04:15.400> than<00:04:15.639> the<00:04:15.759> purple

a lot more of the pink than the purple

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.629 
a lot more of the pink than the purple
because<00:04:16.449> it<00:04:17.320> would<00:04:17.440> end<00:04:17.590> up<00:04:17.709> not<00:04:17.949> being<00:04:17.979> even

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
because it would end up not being even

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.279 
because it would end up not being even
or<00:04:18.789> just<00:04:18.970> being<00:04:19.120> way<00:04:19.329> too<00:04:19.359> purple<00:04:19.840> for<00:04:20.169> me

whenever<00:04:20.590> I<00:04:20.680> put<00:04:20.829> too<00:04:20.979> much<00:04:21.099> the<00:04:21.310> purple<00:04:21.549> haze

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
whenever I put too much the purple haze

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.120 
whenever I put too much the purple haze
so<00:04:22.449> you<00:04:22.509> have<00:04:22.599> to<00:04:22.690> pay<00:04:22.810> attention<00:04:22.840> to<00:04:23.440> what

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
so you have to pay attention to what

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.850 
so you have to pay attention to what
color<00:04:24.370> shape<00:04:24.759> it<00:04:25.120> like<00:04:25.720> which<00:04:26.199> is<00:04:26.380> darker

color shape it like which is darker

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.469 
color shape it like which is darker
because<00:04:27.070> even<00:04:27.400> though<00:04:27.460> it<00:04:27.550> may<00:04:27.610> look<00:04:27.940> evenly

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
because even though it may look evenly

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:30.360

two and a half weeks but at that point

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:06.690 
two and a half weeks but at that point
if<00:05:05.200> my<00:05:05.380> hair<00:05:05.560> was<00:05:05.590> ready<00:05:05.890> bleached<00:05:06.220> I<00:05:06.490> would

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
if my hair was ready bleached I would

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.300 
if my hair was ready bleached I would
just<00:05:06.900> mix<00:05:07.900> up<00:05:08.080> some<00:05:08.260> more<00:05:08.590> throw<00:05:09.010> it<00:05:09.070> on<00:05:09.190> my

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
just mix up some more throw it on my

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.490 
just mix up some more throw it on my
hair<00:05:09.580> leave<00:05:09.910> it<00:05:10.090> for<00:05:10.240> a<00:05:10.300> while<00:05:10.450> shower<00:05:10.840> and<00:05:11.110> be

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
hair leave it for a while shower and be

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.850 
hair leave it for a while shower and be
done<00:05:11.680> so<00:05:12.220> it<00:05:12.960> wasn't<00:05:13.960> that<00:05:14.230> high<00:05:14.410> maintenance

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
done so it wasn't that high maintenance

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.680 
done so it wasn't that high maintenance
it<00:05:15.070> can<00:05:15.310> get<00:05:15.520> kind<00:05:15.760> of<00:05:15.790> expensive<00:05:15.910> if<00:05:16.420> you<00:05:16.540> need

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
it can get kind of expensive if you need

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.330 
it can get kind of expensive if you need
to<00:05:16.780> keep<00:05:16.900> buying<00:05:17.200> these<00:05:17.410> and<00:05:17.710> keep<00:05:17.920> reapplying

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
to keep buying these and keep reapplying

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.090 
to keep buying these and keep reapplying
because<00:05:19.180> it<00:05:19.390> would<00:05:19.540> take<00:05:19.780> two<00:05:20.320> entire<00:05:20.650> tubs<00:05:20.950> of

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
because it would take two entire tubs of

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.640 
because it would take two entire tubs of
this<00:05:21.280> to<00:05:21.460> cover<00:05:21.670> my<00:05:21.880> entire<00:05:22.000> hair<00:05:22.540> so<00:05:23.350> it<00:05:23.530> got

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
this to cover my entire hair so it got

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.680 
this to cover my entire hair so it got
kind<00:05:23.980> of<00:05:24.070> expensive<00:05:24.730> but<00:05:25.120> other<00:05:25.420> than<00:05:25.600> that

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 
kind of expensive but other than that

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:27.720 
kind of expensive but other than that
it's<00:05:26.590> pretty<00:05:26.680> low-maintenance<00:05:27.040> unless

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
it's pretty low-maintenance unless

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.430 
it's pretty low-maintenance unless
you're<00:05:27.940> doing<00:05:28.090> little<00:05:28.480> sections<00:05:29.110> of<00:05:29.410> your

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 
you're doing little sections of your

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.170 
you're doing little sections of your
hair<00:05:29.590> then<00:05:30.070> it<00:05:30.160> gets<00:05:30.250> kind<00:05:30.550> of<00:05:30.670> complicated

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
hair then it gets kind of complicated

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.600 
hair then it gets kind of complicated
but<00:05:31.420> you<00:05:32.230> can<00:05:32.380> just<00:05:32.560> use<00:05:32.620> your<00:05:32.920> own<00:05:33.070> judgment

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
but you can just use your own judgment

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.300 
but you can just use your own judgment
for<00:05:33.790> that<00:05:33.910> one<00:05:34.360> last<00:05:34.840> thing<00:05:35.260> is<00:05:35.590> once<00:05:36.130> you've

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
pink hair because random spots a blonde

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.340 
pink hair because random spots a blonde
would<00:06:10.000> come<00:06:10.240> through<00:06:10.450> because<00:06:10.660> the<00:06:10.840> blonde<00:06:11.170> is

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
would come through because the blonde is

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:13.890 
would come through because the blonde is
so<00:06:11.500> strong<00:06:11.890> and<00:06:12.190> so<00:06:12.250> prominent<00:06:12.820> that<00:06:13.330> the

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 
so strong and so prominent that the

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.810 
so strong and so prominent that the
darker<00:06:14.350> color<00:06:14.530> will<00:06:14.770> actually<00:06:15.190> fade<00:06:15.490> and

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
darker color will actually fade and

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.760 
darker color will actually fade and
you're<00:06:16.570> going<00:06:16.720> to<00:06:16.780> get<00:06:16.870> light<00:06:17.080> hair<00:06:17.320> so<00:06:17.500> I<00:06:17.530> had

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
you're going to get light hair so I had

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.040 
you're going to get light hair so I had
blonde<00:06:18.190> hair<00:06:18.220> in<00:06:18.550> the<00:06:18.760> back<00:06:18.940> I<00:06:19.240> had<00:06:19.480> so<00:06:19.960> many

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
blonde hair in the back I had so many

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.330 
blonde hair in the back I had so many
different<00:06:20.290> color<00:06:20.530> so<00:06:20.740> I<00:06:20.770> just<00:06:20.920> have<00:06:21.040> to<00:06:21.160> keep

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
different color so I just have to keep

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.520 
different color so I just have to keep
dying<00:06:21.640> my<00:06:21.820> hair<00:06:21.850> until<00:06:22.300> the<00:06:22.930> blonde<00:06:23.200> just
