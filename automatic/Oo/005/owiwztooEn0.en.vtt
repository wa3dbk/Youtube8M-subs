00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
upgraded because we all know EA aren't

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.059 
upgraded because we all know EA aren't
necessarily<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:39.989> most<00:02:40.079> consistent<00:02:40.560> I'm

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
necessarily the most consistent I'm

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.860 
necessarily the most consistent I'm
reliable<00:02:41.819> when<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.120> comes<00:02:42.329> to<00:02:42.450> this<00:02:42.569> sort<00:02:42.750> of

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
reliable when it comes to this sort of

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.839 
reliable when it comes to this sort of
stuff<00:02:42.959> but<00:02:43.530> you<00:02:43.890> know<00:02:43.920> if<00:02:44.159> you<00:02:44.280> really<00:02:44.670> do

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
stuff but you know if you really do

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.160 
stuff but you know if you really do
think<00:02:45.090> a<00:02:45.209> certain<00:02:45.390> players<00:02:45.720> get<00:02:45.959> in<00:02:46.079> an

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
think a certain players get in an

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.930 
think a certain players get in an
upgrade<00:02:46.530> then<00:02:46.859> it's<00:02:47.010> probably<00:02:47.250> worth<00:02:47.640> buying

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
upgrade then it's probably worth buying

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.300 
upgrade then it's probably worth buying

upgrade<00:03:59.849> in<00:03:59.970> fact<00:04:00.150> i<00:04:00.299> think<00:04:00.329> is<00:04:00.629> gonna<00:04:00.780> be

moved<00:04:01.260> into<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.859> gold<00:04:02.129> section<00:04:02.699> of<00:04:02.790> ultimate

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
moved into the gold section of ultimate

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.629 
moved into the gold section of ultimate
team<00:04:03.419> that<00:04:04.139> means<00:04:04.440> his<00:04:04.680> silver<00:04:05.069> card<00:04:05.340> will<00:04:05.519> be

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
team that means his silver card will be

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.879 
team that means his silver card will be
no<00:04:05.849> longer<00:04:06.180> impact<00:04:06.510> therefore<00:04:07.290> his<00:04:07.409> car<00:04:07.709> will

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:07.889 
no longer impact therefore his car will

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.080 
no longer impact therefore his car will
be<00:04:08.010> worth<00:04:08.250> more<00:04:08.609> so<00:04:09.090> his<00:04:09.629> current<00:04:10.099> silver<00:04:11.099> card

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
be worth more so his current silver card

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.969 
be worth more so his current silver card
goes<00:04:12.329> for<00:04:12.510> quite<00:04:12.720> a<00:04:12.750> bit<00:04:12.959> but<00:04:13.290> i<00:04:13.319> do<00:04:13.409> think<00:04:13.620> if

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:13.979 
goes for quite a bit but i do think if

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:15.649 
goes for quite a bit but i do think if
he<00:04:14.099> gets<00:04:14.310> an<00:04:14.459> upgrade<00:04:14.579> and<00:04:14.879> he<00:04:14.970> does<00:04:15.180> get<00:04:15.359> moved

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:15.659 
he gets an upgrade and he does get moved

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:17.629 
he gets an upgrade and he does get moved
into<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:16.079> gold<00:04:16.320> section<00:04:16.829> which<00:04:17.280> i<00:04:17.519> personally

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
into the gold section which i personally

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.969 
into the gold section which i personally
think<00:04:18.329> will<00:04:18.630> happen<00:04:18.870> but<00:04:19.260> i<00:04:19.470> know<00:04:19.560> i<00:04:19.650> don't

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
think will happen but i know i don't

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.069 
think will happen but i know i don't
want<00:04:20.099> to<00:04:20.159> make<00:04:20.250> any<00:04:20.489> sort<00:04:20.760> of<00:04:20.880> you<00:04:21.659> know<00:04:21.719> any

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079
