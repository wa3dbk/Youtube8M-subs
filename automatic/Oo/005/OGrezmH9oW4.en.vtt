00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:11.000
 calmly calmly 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.750
 Do not play games 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:27.000

 officially for the extinct Cox 15 and 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.659
 then the audience went to the network

 globe on tv with pike being broadcast 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.239
 on TV for a long time because 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.239
 park 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.480
 as the series was in its prime because of 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.700
 producing toys and costumes albums 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.510
 of cards and the most fantastic of 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.250
 all 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.740
 The game that played this game knows the 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.170
 How incredible is it fun? 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:15.040
 really know how game brings that 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.040
 childhood taste 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.460
 developed by Rain and published by 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.060
 door there 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.460
 the game was released in 1994 in Japan came 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.580
 here in 1995 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.390
 We had other different versions of the game 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.460
 Serbian cedeu mega drive m boy but today 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.180
 I'm here to talk only about the version 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.180
 from super nintendo 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.300
 before the start of each phase 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.610
 you choose the rangers you want to play in 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.210
 if I chose most of the time 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.100
 black or red 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.170
 The game does not have much secrecy. 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:03.170
 it is a genre of action the secret of 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:05.570
 action is the blow on the enemies you 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.850
 It started in the form without being cheaper 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.160
 then you did not have guns is not so 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.020
 strong that you would fight on the platforms 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.970
 facing the enemy until it appeared 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:22.970
 that classic flash on the screen with the 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:26.959
 very common goal word in 2d games 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:35.060
 type in the middle of the phase that was 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:38.080
 the boss mor faep the goal in the 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:42.230
 first step in the case of the boss was this 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:46.910
 pirate hair and yero skull 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:49.070
 they were all there after dead fado 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.209
 40 became stronger 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:56.930
 to go each renders and was with a weapon 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.870
 different sword hut ax and center 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.659
 there after 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.730
 At the end of the first phase you faced 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:07.099
 pirate skull 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.819
 The cool thing is that the music of the 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.819
 changed 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:17.629
 It was very easy was only her but with 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:23.230
 claudinho cl ready was not it 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:23.230
 regenerates and without the arms boot knife 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.670
 the second phase you were going through a 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.519
 place that was kind of outside of a 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:35.859
 plant to reach halfway stage in 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.859
 time to morph and enter the plant 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:43.260
 It was cool, I had several gears. 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.290
 so many oil mechanics that you pick up 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:52.680
 the remedy adds the head of the phase was 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:56.810
 very rough this viking with the creep in the 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.810
 mon bitch who gave birth to snow 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:04.380
 the third phase was already full of 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:08.819
 ischemia this kind of thing place was 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:15.810
 every hour being extended by this 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:17.209
 Purple water oil so but nothing 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.820
 so scary 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:24.650
 Look, the boss of this phase has to 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.650
 and let it go 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.030
 the fourth phase was much of the time was half 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.210
 complicated too 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.190
 but it was more time than complicated to 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:40.500
 You were going to climb a building until you 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.410
 his terrace facing the boss was the 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.300
 team that looked like one of those crazy mice 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.160
 of father having more for mars 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.220
 He was already on the bike. 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.220
 nintendo 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.770
 After you defeat him, you leave. 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.090
 Who is the stage that was a strange place 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.919
 looks like a cave or maybe I do not know 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.840
 was a cave passing the 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.120
 player platforms and advancing to 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.080
 a place that looked like a laboratory 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.270
 secret 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.120
 So you met the boss. 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.389
 tac very time habit struggle with this 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.389

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:53.540
 was called multiple or greater and 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.060
 then it was the last battle of the game 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:06:00.380
 the fight was on the moon or at least I think 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:02.600
 Yes, I do know by now that the old man looks at the 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.030
 mega luck suit coming from aft 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.070
 fight with a guy in the middle of space 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.210

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:13.419
 secrets and such 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:13.419

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.500
