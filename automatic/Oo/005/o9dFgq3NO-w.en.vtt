propose<00:05:51.380> now<00:05:52.450> number<00:05:53.450> one<00:05:53.510> recommendations

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
propose now number one recommendations

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.960 
propose now number one recommendations
start<00:05:54.650> from<00:05:54.830> scratch<00:05:55.100> the<00:05:55.460> government<00:05:55.820> needs

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:55.970

what will be the USDA's response now

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.680 
what will be the USDA's response now
maybe<00:06:08.240> they'll<00:06:08.450> drop<00:06:08.960> another<00:06:09.350> memo<00:06:10.690> and

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690
