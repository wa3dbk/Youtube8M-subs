00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.060 
I only remove two of the screws at this
point<00:03:35.210> because<00:03:35.810> I<00:03:36.170> realized<00:03:36.710> that<00:03:36.860> the

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
point because I realized that the

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.760 
point because I realized that the
throttle<00:03:37.490> arm<00:03:37.640> is<00:03:37.910> still<00:03:38.180> connected<00:03:38.780> to<00:03:38.960> the

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
throttle arm is still connected to the

throttle arm is still connected to the
servo<00:03:40.370> arm<00:03:41.230> so<00:03:42.230> I<00:03:42.740> decide<00:03:43.370> to<00:03:43.400> go<00:03:43.580> ahead<00:03:43.610> and

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
servo arm so I decide to go ahead and

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:46.120 
servo arm so I decide to go ahead and
pop<00:03:43.970> that<00:03:44.240> off<00:03:44.420> before<00:03:44.780> I<00:03:44.810> go<00:03:44.990> any<00:03:45.170> further<00:03:45.260> the

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
pop that off before I go any further the

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.320 
pop that off before I go any further the
two<00:03:46.370> screws<00:03:46.670> would<00:03:46.790> be<00:03:46.910> coming<00:03:47.090> up<00:03:47.270> here

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330 
two screws would be coming up here

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.660 
two screws would be coming up here
pretty<00:03:47.870> quickly<00:03:48.170> this<00:03:48.920> is<00:03:49.100> my<00:03:49.220> first<00:03:49.520> time

engine<00:06:26.909> with<00:06:27.479> EZ<00:06:27.839> starts<00:06:28.769> so<00:06:29.509> um<00:06:32.359> yeah<00:06:33.359> I<00:06:33.389> think

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
engine with EZ starts so um yeah I think

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:35.239

00:06:41.179 --> 00:06:41.189 
actually when I get a put back on prop

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:43.219 
actually when I get a put back on prop
tips<00:06:41.399> go<00:06:41.579> through<00:06:41.609> retuning<00:06:42.389> it<00:06:42.659> again<00:06:42.989> I

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:43.229 
tips go through retuning it again I

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:47.149 
tips go through retuning it again I
would<00:06:43.649> imagine<00:06:43.859> but<00:06:44.599> yes<00:06:45.599> so<00:06:45.899> there's<00:06:46.889> that

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:47.159 
would imagine but yes so there's that

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:48.529 
would imagine but yes so there's that
there's<00:06:47.789> gonna<00:06:47.879> be<00:06:48.029> a<00:06:48.059> lot<00:06:48.239> of<00:06:48.269> trouble

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 
there's gonna be a lot of trouble

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:50.899 
there's gonna be a lot of trouble

00:06:50.899 --> 00:06:50.909 
probably putting it back in but I'll

00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:52.519 
probably putting it back in but I'll
give<00:06:51.119> you<00:06:51.149> guys<00:06:51.389> a<00:06:51.419> heads<00:06:51.719> up<00:06:51.899> on<00:06:52.079> what's<00:06:52.289> going

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:07.289 
this if you didn't catch it and just

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:09.439 
this if you didn't catch it and just
point<00:07:07.529> those<00:07:07.709> out<00:07:07.949> and<00:07:08.279> I'll<00:07:08.699> also<00:07:08.849> do<00:07:09.179> a<00:07:09.209> video
