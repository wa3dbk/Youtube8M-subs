hello everybody just wanted to quickly

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.270 
hello everybody just wanted to quickly
go<00:00:03.959> over<00:00:05.000> how<00:00:06.000> I<00:00:06.060> installed<00:00:06.600> a<00:00:07.040> fish<00:00:08.040> finder

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
go over how I installed a fish finder

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.509 
go over how I installed a fish finder
with<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.820> transducer<00:00:09.389> inside<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.380> hull<00:00:10.559> on<00:00:10.860> my

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
with a transducer inside the hull on my

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.700 
with a transducer inside the hull on my
new<00:00:11.700> canoe<00:00:12.030> so<00:00:12.990> I'm<00:00:13.110> just<00:00:13.290> going<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.500> quickly

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
new canoe so I'm just going to quickly

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.359 
new canoe so I'm just going to quickly
start<00:00:13.920> over<00:00:14.400> here<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.880> just<00:00:15.059> quickly<00:00:15.540> go<00:00:15.809> over

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
start over here and just quickly go over

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.200 
start over here and just quickly go over
this<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.750> piece<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.779> foam<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.320> I<00:00:19.350> used

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
this is the piece of foam that I used

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.330 
this is the piece of foam that I used
one<00:00:21.210> similar<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.750> this<00:00:21.900> I<00:00:22.170> just<00:00:22.890> traced<00:00:23.100> out

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
one similar to this I just traced out

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.450 
one similar to this I just traced out
the<00:00:23.490> transducer<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.800> basically<00:00:25.800> just<00:00:26.099> cut<00:00:26.340> it

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
the transducer and basically just cut it

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.689 
the transducer and basically just cut it
out<00:00:26.609> I<00:00:27.150> then<00:00:27.779> glued<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.289> down<00:00:28.590> inside<00:00:29.340> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
out I then glued this down inside the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.110 
out I then glued this down inside the
hull<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.710> new<00:00:31.710> canoe<00:00:32.009> it's<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.700> new<00:00:32.850> canoe

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
hull of the new canoe it's the new canoe

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.520 
hull of the new canoe it's the new canoe
itself<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.660> not<00:00:33.840> a<00:00:34.610> it's<00:00:35.610> not<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:36.230> frontier<00:00:37.230> it's

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
itself is not a it's not a frontier it's

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.970 
itself is not a it's not a frontier it's
a<00:00:37.649> twelve<00:00:37.920> foot<00:00:38.030> steel<00:00:39.030> door<00:00:39.329> style<00:00:39.890> and<00:00:40.890> I

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
a twelve foot steel door style and I

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.190 
a twelve foot steel door style and I
really<00:00:41.280> wanted<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:41.730> have<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.540> transducer

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
really wanted to have a transducer

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.340 
really wanted to have a transducer
inside<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.100> hull<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:45.059> what<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.629> did<00:00:46.110> was<00:00:46.289> I

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
inside the hull so what I did was I

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.389 
inside the hull so what I did was I
actually<00:00:46.649> cut<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> cut<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> hole<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.710> in

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
actually cut a cut a hole in in the in

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.639 
actually cut a cut a hole in in the in
the<00:00:50.610> boat<00:00:52.129> the<00:00:53.129> product<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.579> used<00:00:53.820> two

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
the boat the product I used two

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.470 
the boat the product I used two
adhesives<00:00:55.649> mean<00:00:56.100> goop<00:00:56.399> which<00:00:56.850> worked<00:00:57.239> really

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
adhesives mean goop which worked really

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.889 
adhesives mean goop which worked really
well<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.730> for<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.820> start<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.239> just

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
well so for the start I just

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.889 
well so for the start I just
I<00:01:00.930> glued<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.129> glued<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.879> piece<00:01:03.359> of<00:01:03.539> foam<00:01:03.690> in

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
I glued I glued the piece of foam in

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.719 
I glued I glued the piece of foam in
first<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.470> let<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.400> set<00:01:05.670> up<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.680> basically

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
first and let that set up and basically

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:15.050 
first and let that set up and basically
once<00:01:08.729> it<00:01:08.909> dried<00:01:09.500> then<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:11.600> submersed<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:14.060> piece

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
once it dried then I submersed the piece

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.649 
once it dried then I submersed the piece
of<00:01:15.240> foam<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.600> there<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.020> I<00:01:16.560> put<00:01:16.770> about<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:17.430> half

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
of foam in there and I put about a half

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.359 
of foam in there and I put about a half
halfway<00:01:18.659> up<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.290> three-quarters<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.250> way

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
halfway up to three-quarters of the way

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.760 
halfway up to three-quarters of the way
submerged<00:01:21.360> completely<00:01:21.570> with<00:01:22.080> with<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
submerged completely with with the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.100 
submerged completely with with the
marine<00:01:23.250> goop<00:01:23.490> then<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.210> took<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.540> transducer

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
marine goop then I took the transducer

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.170 
marine goop then I took the transducer
and<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.380> stuffed<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.890> in<00:01:26.040> there<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.430> completely

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
and I stuffed it in there and completely

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.399 
and I stuffed it in there and completely
some<00:01:27.840> submersed<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:29.780> I'll<00:01:30.780> move<00:01:30.930> over<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
some submersed it I'll move over to the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.410 
some submersed it I'll move over to the
boat<00:01:31.560> now<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.040> just<00:01:32.400> show<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:33.210> is<00:01:33.270> my
