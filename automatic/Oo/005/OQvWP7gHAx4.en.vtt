00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.960 

well<00:03:38.320> there's<00:03:38.560> the<00:03:38.650> pink<00:03:38.890> bullets<00:03:39.370> they<00:03:39.850> were

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
well there's the pink bullets they were

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.180 
well there's the pink bullets they were
talking<00:03:40.240> about<00:03:40.480> so<00:03:40.870> much<00:03:41.020> heat<00:03:41.710> bullets

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
talking about so much heat bullets

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.280 
talking about so much heat bullets
because<00:03:43.000> before<00:03:43.330> I<00:03:43.390> believe<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:43.960> bullets

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
because before I believe the bullets

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.260 
because before I believe the bullets
were<00:03:44.440> like<00:03:44.680> the<00:03:44.860> same<00:03:45.040> color<00:03:45.460> is<00:03:45.670> your<00:03:45.910> ship

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
were like the same color is your ship

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.630 
were like the same color is your ship
which<00:03:46.570> is<00:03:46.720> not<00:03:46.930> very<00:03:47.260> useful<00:03:47.830> because<00:03:48.310> then

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
which is not very useful because then

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.310 
which is not very useful because then
I'll<00:03:48.880> go<00:03:49.000> tell<00:03:49.240> which<00:03:49.390> is<00:03:49.420> which<00:03:49.570> exactly<00:03:50.260> the
