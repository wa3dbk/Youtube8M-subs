campus or for both to breed speakers in
each<00:00:15.180> one<00:00:15.389> it's<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.200> full<00:00:16.440> range<00:00:16.590> speaker

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
each one it's a full range speaker

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.300 
each one it's a full range speaker
but<00:00:18.750> each<00:00:18.869> one<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.140> two<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.500> separately<00:00:19.859> it

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
but each one is two and separately it

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.500 
but each one is two and separately it
has<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.520> same<00:00:21.060> six<00:00:21.510> presets<00:00:22.020> we<00:00:22.140> had<00:00:22.289> on<00:00:22.470> the

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
has the same six presets we had on the

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.020 
has the same six presets we had on the
I<00:00:23.600> décor<00:00:24.290> came<00:00:24.590> out<00:00:24.740> last<00:00:24.890> year<00:00:25.100> but<00:00:25.940> in

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.030 
I décor came out last year but in

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.660 
I décor came out last year but in
addition<00:00:26.090> we<00:00:26.390> now<00:00:26.570> have<00:00:27.400> two<00:00:28.400> acoustic

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
addition we now have two acoustic

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.220 
addition we now have two acoustic
presets<00:00:29.770> acoustic<00:00:30.770> simulator<00:00:31.280> presets<00:00:31.760> to

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
presets acoustic simulator presets to

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.380 
presets acoustic simulator presets to
erase<00:00:33.230> presets<00:00:33.860> once<00:00:34.100> a<00:00:34.220> plastic<00:00:34.640> one<00:00:34.850> is<00:00:35.030> like

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
erase presets once a plastic one is like

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.479 
erase presets once a plastic one is like
the<00:00:35.570> modern<00:00:35.870> bass<00:00:36.050> sound<00:00:36.320> we<00:00:36.680> also<00:00:36.830> have<00:00:37.160> the

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
the modern bass sound we also have the

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.010 
the modern bass sound we also have the
effects<00:00:37.820> have<00:00:37.940> been<00:00:38.000> modified<00:00:38.600> for<00:00:38.750> the<00:00:38.840> base

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
effects have been modified for the base

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.530 
effects have been modified for the base
for<00:00:39.410> example<00:00:39.800> we<00:00:40.309> have<00:00:40.460> a<00:00:40.489> overdrive<00:00:41.150> instead

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
for example we have a overdrive instead

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.950 
for example we have a overdrive instead
of<00:00:41.600> reverb<00:00:41.960> the<00:00:42.470> base<00:00:42.680> also<00:00:43.460> on<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.540> the

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
of reverb the base also on the the

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.060 
of reverb the base also on the the
modulation<00:00:45.530> section<00:00:45.680> we<00:00:46.430> replace<00:00:46.850> the

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
modulation section we replace the

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.160 
modulation section we replace the
planter<00:00:49.070> with<00:00:49.250> a<00:00:49.280> envelope<00:00:49.670> filter<00:00:50.030> so<00:00:50.900> it's

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
planter with a envelope filter so it's

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.360 
planter with a envelope filter so it's
kind<00:00:51.350> of<00:00:51.379> modified<00:00:51.739> to<00:00:51.800> make<00:00:51.920> the<00:00:52.010> base<00:00:52.160> out

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
kind of modified to make the base out

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.220 
kind of modified to make the base out
real<00:00:52.520> nice<00:00:52.640> in<00:00:53.239> addition<00:00:53.420> we<00:00:53.690> have<00:00:53.720> bluetooth

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
real nice in addition we have bluetooth

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.600 
real nice in addition we have bluetooth
now<00:00:54.440> Bluetooth<00:00:54.920> is<00:00:55.040> available

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.220 

so<00:01:00.610> you<00:01:00.670> have<00:01:00.820> Bluetooth<00:01:01.719> now<00:01:01.870> for<00:01:02.140> the

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
so you have Bluetooth now for the

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.109 
so you have Bluetooth now for the
amplifier<00:01:02.590> so<00:01:02.800> you<00:01:03.190> can<00:01:03.309> stream<00:01:03.520> it<00:01:03.579> back

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
amplifier so you can stream it back

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.450 
amplifier so you can stream it back
track<00:01:04.420> or<00:01:04.629> use<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.930> amplifier

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.590 

like

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
like

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.899 
like
and<00:01:09.049> is<00:01:09.229> there<00:01:09.439> like<00:01:09.740> a<00:01:09.770> control<00:01:10.400> interface

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
and is there like a control interface

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.090 
and is there like a control interface
via<00:01:11.210> bluetooth<00:01:11.689> as<00:01:11.869> well<00:01:12.049> right<00:01:12.770> now<00:01:12.799> is<00:01:13.070> just

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
via bluetooth as well right now is just

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.670 
via bluetooth as well right now is just
do<00:01:13.430> it<00:01:13.580> audio<00:01:13.939> streaming<00:01:14.270> yeah<00:01:14.570> okay<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:15.080> we

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
do it audio streaming yeah okay so we

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.810 
do it audio streaming yeah okay so we
have<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.890> same<00:01:16.100> sounds<00:01:16.490> we<00:01:16.610> have<00:01:16.700> before

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
have the same sounds we have before

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.120 
have the same sounds we have before
scoring<00:01:17.720> electric<00:01:18.200> but<00:01:18.500> now<00:01:18.590> we<00:01:18.650> also<00:01:18.890> have

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
scoring electric but now we also have

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.510 
scoring electric but now we also have
every<00:01:19.430> plugin<00:01:19.729> acoustic<00:01:20.119> room<00:01:20.270> for<00:01:20.450> you<00:01:20.780> yep

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
every plugin acoustic room for you yep

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.750 
every plugin acoustic room for you yep
it<00:01:23.939> has<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.299> presets<00:01:24.810> one<00:01:25.320> preset<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:26.039> the

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
it has to presets one preset is the

it has to presets one preset is the
kind<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.630> your<00:01:27.780> flat<00:01:28.050> response<00:01:28.260> acoustic

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
kind of your flat response acoustic

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:45.540 
kind of your flat response acoustic
sound<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:29.370> other<00:01:29.490> point<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.790> for<00:01:29.940> bank

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
note about include your volume down it's

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.720 
note about include your volume down it's
got<00:03:00.950> a
