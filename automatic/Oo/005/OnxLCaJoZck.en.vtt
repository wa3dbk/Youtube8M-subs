camera<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.480> a<00:00:39.750> significant<00:00:40.590> upgrade<00:00:40.710> over<00:00:41.190> its

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
camera is a significant upgrade over its

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.570 
camera is a significant upgrade over its
predecessors<00:00:42.120> now<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.739> 5200<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.890> takes<00:00:44.400> it

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
predecessors now the 5200 it takes it

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.660 
predecessors now the 5200 it takes it
from<00:00:44.730> 16<00:00:45.449> megapixel<00:00:46.080> up<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.410> 24<00:00:46.949> megapixel

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
from 16 megapixel up to 24 megapixel

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.210 
from 16 megapixel up to 24 megapixel
which<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.329> agree<00:00:48.629> not<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.079> many<00:00:49.260> people<00:00:49.710> need

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
which I agree not that many people need

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.649 
which I agree not that many people need
it<00:00:50.280> all<00:00:50.579> really<00:00:50.940> see<00:00:51.210> much<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.449> a<00:00:51.629> difference

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:51.659 
it all really see much of a difference

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:54.590 
it all really see much of a difference
but<00:00:52.440> there's<00:00:52.650> three<00:00:52.949> ways<00:00:52.980> where<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.730> 5200

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
but there's three ways where the 5200

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.290 
but there's three ways where the 5200
does<00:00:54.839> shine<00:00:55.489> looking<00:00:56.489> top<00:00:56.670> down<00:00:56.909> on<00:00:57.120> these

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
does shine looking top down on these

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.359 
does shine looking top down on these
guys<00:00:57.659> the<00:00:58.019> first<00:00:58.260> major<00:00:58.559> difference<00:00:59.159> is

00:00:59.359 --> 00:00:59.369 
guys the first major difference is

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:04.820 
guys the first major difference is
inside<00:01:00.860> the<00:01:01.860> 5200<00:01:02.850> now<00:01:03.030> has<00:01:03.299> a<00:01:03.330> 39<00:01:04.019> focus<00:01:04.559> point

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
inside the 5200 now has a 39 focus point

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.130 
inside the 5200 now has a 39 focus point
autofocus<00:01:05.070> system<00:01:05.610> instead<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> 11<00:01:06.930> of

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
autofocus system instead of the 11 of

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.399 
autofocus system instead of the 11 of
the<00:01:07.340> 5100<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.490> nine<00:01:09.180> of<00:01:09.450> them<00:01:09.630> an<00:01:09.840> hour<00:01:10.080> cross

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the 5100 and nine of them an hour cross

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.490 
the 5100 and nine of them an hour cross
point<00:01:10.710> compared<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.280> one<00:01:11.610> on<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.030> 5100<00:01:12.960> that

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
point compared to one on the 5100 that

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.190 
point compared to one on the 5100 that
translates<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.520> noticeably<00:01:15.390> faster<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.080> more

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
translates to noticeably faster and more

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.530 
translates to noticeably faster and more
accurate<00:01:16.590> auto<00:01:16.740> focus<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.369> my<00:01:17.909> testing<00:01:18.420> has

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
accurate auto focus and my testing has

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.140 
accurate auto focus and my testing has
been<00:01:18.720> bearing<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.200> out<00:01:19.380> for<00:01:19.710> sure<00:01:20.150> secondly

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
been bearing that out for sure secondly

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.780 
been bearing that out for sure secondly
is<00:01:21.390> speed<00:01:21.960> now<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.710> only<00:01:22.890> gone<00:01:23.130> up<00:01:23.159> from<00:01:23.400> four

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
is speed now it's only gone up from four

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.149 
is speed now it's only gone up from four
frames<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.270> second<00:01:24.600> 25<00:01:24.900> frames<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.350> second<00:01:25.710> but

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
frames a second 25 frames a second but

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.039 
frames a second 25 frames a second but
you<00:01:26.490> know<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:26.939> twenty-five<00:01:27.570> percent<00:01:27.750> of

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
you know that is twenty-five percent of

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.899 
you know that is twenty-five percent of
an<00:01:28.140> improvement<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
an improvement and that is the

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.669 
an improvement and that is the
difference<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.689> right<00:01:30.840> circumstances

00:01:31.669 --> 00:01:31.679 
difference in the right circumstances

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:34.039 
difference in the right circumstances
between<00:01:32.070> missing<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.729> getting<00:01:33.149> the<00:01:33.270> shot<00:01:33.539> so

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
between missing and getting the shot so

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.929 
between missing and getting the shot so
that<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:35.159> know<00:01:35.280> for<00:01:35.520> someone<00:01:35.549> who<00:01:35.909> just

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
that is you know for someone who just

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.849 
that is you know for someone who just
finds<00:01:36.689> for<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.109> little<00:01:37.229> bit<00:01:37.439> too<00:01:37.590> little

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:37.859 
finds for that little bit too little

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:40.489

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
video professionals if the only thing

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.490 
video professionals if the only thing
it's<00:02:18.030> lacking<00:02:18.180> now<00:02:18.569> is<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.959> headphone<00:02:19.319> out

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
it's lacking now is the headphone out

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.190 
it's lacking now is the headphone out
which<00:02:19.680> is<00:02:19.709> still<00:02:20.040> kind<00:02:20.730> of<00:02:20.819> a<00:02:20.940> big<00:02:21.120> one<00:02:21.330> okay<00:02:22.140> so

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
which is still kind of a big one okay so

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.600 
which is still kind of a big one okay so
let's<00:02:22.530> have<00:02:22.650> a<00:02:22.680> look<00:02:22.800> at<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.980> styling<00:02:23.520> of

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
let's have a look at the styling of

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.120 
let's have a look at the styling of
these<00:02:23.819> two<00:02:24.260> so<00:02:25.260> taking<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.740> look<00:02:25.770> at<00:02:26.010> these

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
these two so taking a look at these

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.730 
these two so taking a look at these
close-up<00:02:26.520> they<00:02:26.970> certainly<00:02:27.360> similar<00:02:28.200> in<00:02:28.440> looks

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
close-up they certainly similar in looks

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.070 
close-up they certainly similar in looks
aren't<00:02:29.100> they<00:02:29.340> which<00:02:29.640> one's<00:02:29.880> acts<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.270> 5200

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
aren't they which one's acts of 5200

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.589 
aren't they which one's acts of 5200
this<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.590> 5100<00:02:32.580> they<00:02:33.090> look<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.450> have<00:02:33.569> been

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
this is the 5100 they look to have been

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.929 
this is the 5100 they look to have been
designed<00:02:34.049> by<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.379> same<00:02:34.650> team<00:02:35.099> potentially

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939 
designed by the same team potentially

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.520 
designed by the same team potentially
with<00:02:36.120> a<00:02:36.150> piece<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.450> tracing<00:02:36.810> paper<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.500> a

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.440 
with a piece of tracing paper and a
pencil<00:02:37.769> because<00:02:38.610> they're<00:02:39.060> real

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
pencil because they're real

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.119 
pencil because they're real
is<00:02:39.629> not<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.870> whole<00:02:40.140> lot<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.349> difference<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.860> them

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
is not a whole lot of difference to them

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.369 
is not a whole lot of difference to them
some<00:02:41.700> different<00:02:42.150> styling<00:02:42.750> in<00:02:42.840> terms<00:02:43.080> of<00:02:43.260> the

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
some different styling in terms of the

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.140 
some different styling in terms of the
sweeping<00:02:43.890> aspect<00:02:44.370> on<00:02:44.489> this<00:02:44.670> front<00:02:44.940> section

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
sweeping aspect on this front section

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.540 
sweeping aspect on this front section
but<00:02:45.930> as<00:02:46.019> we<00:02:46.170> take<00:02:46.379> a<00:02:46.410> look<00:02:46.560> around<00:02:46.769> the<00:02:47.160> button

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
but as we take a look around the button

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.580 
but as we take a look around the button
layout<00:02:47.879> not<00:02:48.450> a<00:02:48.480> whole<00:02:48.690> lot<00:02:48.870> has<00:02:49.050> changed<00:02:49.470> but

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
layout not a whole lot has changed but

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.190 
layout not a whole lot has changed but
there<00:02:49.739> is<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.860> nice<00:02:50.160> little<00:02:50.459> addition<00:02:51.200> so

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
there is a nice little addition so

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.110 
there is a nice little addition so
looking<00:02:52.680> top<00:02:52.920> down<00:02:53.129> on<00:02:53.310> these<00:02:53.489> guys<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:53.970> can

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
looking top down on these guys you can

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.750 
looking top down on these guys you can
see<00:02:54.360> mode<00:02:54.750> dial<00:02:55.019> is<00:02:55.410> pretty<00:02:55.739> much<00:02:55.950> unchanged

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
see mode dial is pretty much unchanged

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.750 
see mode dial is pretty much unchanged
live<00:02:57.420> view<00:02:57.720> is<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.050> the<00:02:58.170> same<00:02:58.410> place<00:02:58.760> big

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
live view is in the same place big

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.699 
live view is in the same place big

except that the dial button now has

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.920 
except that the dial button now has
these<00:03:25.799> handy<00:03:26.160> little<00:03:26.340> cutouts<00:03:26.880> in<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.209> instead

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
these handy little cutouts in it instead

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.960 
these handy little cutouts in it instead
of<00:03:27.959> being<00:03:28.200> just<00:03:28.319> a<00:03:28.799> flat<00:03:29.069> one<00:03:29.280> on<00:03:29.579> the<00:03:29.849> other

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
of being just a flat one on the other

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.729 
of being just a flat one on the other
one<00:03:30.150> I<00:03:30.360> would<00:03:30.840> say<00:03:31.019> that<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:31.290> buttons<00:03:31.560> have<00:03:31.680> a

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
one I would say that the buttons have a

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.699 
one I would say that the buttons have a
nice<00:03:32.010> tactile<00:03:32.940> feel<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.720> them<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:34.049> little<00:03:34.470> bit

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
nice tactile feel to them a little bit

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.890 
nice tactile feel to them a little bit
different<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.549> original<00:03:36.000> but<00:03:36.510> nothing

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
different to the original but nothing

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.380 
different to the original but nothing
too<00:03:37.079> significant<00:03:37.739> really<00:03:38.180> looking<00:03:39.180> at<00:03:39.299> the

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
too significant really looking at the

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.960 
too significant really looking at the
connections<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.500> 5100<00:03:41.400> here<00:03:41.640> where<00:03:41.819> I've

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
connections the 5100 here where I've

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.420 
connections the 5100 here where I've
already<00:03:42.180> lost<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.720> door<00:03:42.930> has<00:03:43.620> all<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.280> same

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
already lost the door has all the same

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.610 
already lost the door has all the same
connections<00:03:44.970> as<00:03:45.120> a<00:03:45.150> 5200<00:03:46.109> just<00:03:46.380> set<00:03:46.530> the

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
connections as a 5200 just set the

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.740

microphone<00:03:47.250> has<00:03:47.609> been<00:03:47.850> swapped<00:03:48.209> that's

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
microphone has been swapped that's

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.180 
microphone has been swapped that's
actually<00:03:48.900> quite<00:03:49.230> handy<00:03:49.680> because<00:03:49.829> if<00:03:50.069> you're

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
actually quite handy because if you're

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.860 
actually quite handy because if you're
using<00:03:50.430> an<00:03:50.639> external<00:03:50.880> mic<00:03:51.269> it's<00:03:51.450> quite<00:03:51.690> often

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
using an external mic it's quite often

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.170 
using an external mic it's quite often
up<00:03:52.410> here<00:03:52.620> on<00:03:52.920> top<00:03:53.160> so<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.489> makes<00:03:53.639> sense<00:03:53.760> of<00:03:54.060> that

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
up here on top so it makes sense of that

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.590 
up here on top so it makes sense of that
one's<00:03:54.420> up<00:03:55.019> at<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.380> top<00:03:56.150> taking<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.209> look<00:03:57.329> on<00:03:57.510> the

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
one's up at the top taking a look on the

one's up at the top taking a look on the
bottom<00:03:57.750> of<00:03:58.019> each<00:03:58.200> one<00:03:58.470> they're<00:03:58.739> pretty<00:03:58.980> much

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
bottom of each one they're pretty much

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.190 
bottom of each one they're pretty much
identical<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.850> screw<00:04:00.120> Laird<00:04:00.480> has<00:04:00.660> changed

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
identical the screw Laird has changed

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.809

the<00:04:01.319> pattern<00:04:01.530> on<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.950> bottom<00:04:02.250> but<00:04:02.670> they're

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
the pattern on the bottom but they're

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.420 
the pattern on the bottom but they're
both<00:04:02.970> using<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.540> enal<00:04:04.109> 14<00:04:04.799> so<00:04:05.040> if<00:04:05.160> you<00:04:05.280> did

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
both using the enal 14 so if you did

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.670 
both using the enal 14 so if you did
happen<00:04:05.609> to<00:04:05.760> upgrade<00:04:06.120> from<00:04:06.389> the<00:04:06.660> 5100<00:04:07.470> to<00:04:07.590> the

happen to upgrade from the 5100 to the

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.890 
happen to upgrade from the 5100 to the

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
5200 for some reason you're not going to

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.539 
5200 for some reason you're not going to
need<00:04:10.019> to<00:04:10.200> change<00:04:10.500> your<00:04:10.590> spare<00:04:10.980> batteries<00:04:11.370> as

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
need to change your spare batteries as

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.340 
need to change your spare batteries as
well<00:04:11.579> ok<00:04:12.209> of<00:04:12.359> course<00:04:12.420> at<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.959> end<00:04:13.079> of<00:04:13.139> the<00:04:13.230> day

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
well ok of course at the end of the day

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.620 
well ok of course at the end of the day
comes<00:04:13.590> down<00:04:13.859> to<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.130> imaging<00:04:14.579> quality<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.299> I

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
comes down to the imaging quality and I

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.670 
comes down to the imaging quality and I
think<00:04:15.810> a<00:04:15.870> lot<00:04:15.900> of<00:04:16.049> people<00:04:16.139> are<00:04:16.410> going<00:04:16.500> to<00:04:16.590> be

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
think a lot of people are going to be

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.440 
think a lot of people are going to be
interested<00:04:17.039> in<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.220> high<00:04:17.370> ISO<00:04:17.910> performance

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
interested in the high ISO performance

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.750 
interested in the high ISO performance
the<00:04:18.510> 5100<00:04:19.320> for<00:04:19.530> its<00:04:19.620> day<00:04:19.859> was<00:04:20.160> pretty<00:04:20.489> good

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
the 5100 for its day was pretty good

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.060 
the 5100 for its day was pretty good
this<00:04:21.419> one<00:04:21.630> it's<00:04:22.169> a<00:04:22.289> year<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:22.590> a<00:04:22.620> half<00:04:22.650> newer

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
this one it's a year and a half newer

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.190 
this one it's a year and a half newer
but<00:04:23.370> it<00:04:23.490> is<00:04:23.789> fifty<00:04:24.720> percent<00:04:24.990> higher

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
but it is fifty percent higher

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.279 
but it is fifty percent higher
resolution<00:04:26.039> so<00:04:26.310> can<00:04:27.270> you<00:04:27.570> know<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.870> pixels

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
resolution so can you know the pixels

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.260 
resolution so can you know the pixels
are<00:04:28.440> that<00:04:28.590> much<00:04:28.770> smaller<00:04:29.190> so<00:04:29.760> let's<00:04:30.090> do<00:04:30.210> a

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
are that much smaller so let's do a

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.270 
are that much smaller so let's do a
little<00:04:30.389> higher<00:04:30.840> so<00:04:31.139> comparison<00:04:31.740> on<00:04:31.860> these<00:04:32.039> two

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
little higher so comparison on these two

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.800 
little higher so comparison on these two
throw<00:04:32.580> them<00:04:32.729> side<00:04:32.910> by<00:04:32.940> side<00:04:33.120> all<00:04:33.570> the<00:04:33.599> way

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
throw them side by side all the way

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.120 
throw them side by side all the way
through<00:04:34.110> their<00:04:34.260> range<00:04:34.470> and<00:04:34.650> see<00:04:34.800> how<00:04:34.979> they

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
through their range and see how they

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.690 
through their range and see how they
compare<00:04:36.260> okay<00:04:37.260> so<00:04:37.530> here's<00:04:37.889> the<00:04:38.039> full<00:04:38.250> scene<00:04:38.520> I

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
compare okay so here's the full scene I

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.370 
compare okay so here's the full scene I
set<00:04:38.940> up<00:04:39.030> to<00:04:39.180> do<00:04:39.300> the<00:04:39.450> sample<00:04:39.870> shots<00:04:40.080> I<00:04:40.260> was

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
set up to do the sample shots I was

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.860 
set up to do the sample shots I was
using<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:40.830> 70<00:04:41.160> to<00:04:41.310> 200<00:04:41.760> nikon<00:04:42.090> so<00:04:42.330> top<00:04:42.599> glass

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
using the 70 to 200 nikon so top glass

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.290 
using the 70 to 200 nikon so top glass
and<00:04:43.260> the<00:04:43.680> lens<00:04:44.010> was<00:04:44.250> on<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.490> tripod<00:04:44.729> so<00:04:45.180> the

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
and the lens was on the tripod so the

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.719 
and the lens was on the tripod so the
cameras<00:04:45.660> didn't<00:04:45.930> move<00:04:46.110> between<00:04:46.380> each<00:04:46.800> shot<00:04:47.130> so

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
cameras didn't move between each shot so

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.070 
cameras didn't move between each shot so
let's<00:04:47.909> jump<00:04:48.180> in<00:04:48.300> and<00:04:48.450> take<00:04:48.539> a<00:04:48.599> look<00:04:48.720> at<00:04:48.960> these

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
let's jump in and take a look at these

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.860 
let's jump in and take a look at these
there<00:04:49.349> they<00:04:49.500> are<00:04:49.530> at<00:04:49.830> iso<00:04:50.220> 200<00:04:50.970> and<00:04:51.120> as<00:04:51.690> you'd

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
there they are at iso 200 and as you'd

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.030 
there they are at iso 200 and as you'd
expect<00:04:51.990> they're<00:04:52.440> both<00:04:52.620> in

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
expect they're both in

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.500 
expect they're both in
you<00:04:53.670> know<00:04:53.790> clean<00:04:54.200> I<00:04:55.200> would<00:04:55.830> say<00:04:56.040> that<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.520> 5200

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
you know clean I would say that the 5200

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.620 
you know clean I would say that the 5200
does<00:04:58.110> seem<00:04:58.410> to<00:04:58.560> have<00:04:58.710> more<00:04:59.040> fine<00:04:59.790> definition

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
does seem to have more fine definition

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.870 
does seem to have more fine definition
there<00:05:00.870> and<00:05:01.710> these<00:05:01.860> are<00:05:02.040> both<00:05:02.190> on<00:05:02.370> the<00:05:02.490> standard

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
there and these are both on the standard

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.480 
there and these are both on the standard
settings<00:05:03.270> and<00:05:03.540> clearly<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.170> 5100<00:05:04.920> is<00:05:05.130> a<00:05:05.190> more

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
settings and clearly the 5100 is a more

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.910 
settings and clearly the 5100 is a more
saturated<00:05:06.180> look<00:05:06.540> there<00:05:07.350> at<00:05:07.500> four<00:05:07.740> hundred

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
saturated look there at four hundred

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.670 
saturated look there at four hundred
still<00:05:08.400> really<00:05:08.670> really<00:05:08.910> clear<00:05:09.330> and<00:05:09.570> no<00:05:10.410> noise

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
still really really clear and no noise

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.250 
still really really clear and no noise
really<00:05:11.040> coming<00:05:11.340> in<00:05:11.430> at<00:05:11.550> all<00:05:11.760> that<00:05:12.270> 5200<00:05:13.080> does

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
really coming in at all that 5200 does

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.500 
really coming in at all that 5200 does
seem<00:05:13.500> to<00:05:13.530> have<00:05:13.800> more<00:05:13.980> detail<00:05:14.550> especially<00:05:15.000> in

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
seem to have more detail especially in

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:18.350 
seem to have more detail especially in
the<00:05:15.630> weave<00:05:15.870> on<00:05:16.310> even<00:05:17.310> here<00:05:17.610> at<00:05:17.700> eight<00:05:17.880> hundred

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 
the weave on even here at eight hundred

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.090 
the weave on even here at eight hundred
and<00:05:18.510> of<00:05:18.810> course<00:05:19.050> these<00:05:19.260> were<00:05:19.440> all<00:05:19.530> taken<00:05:20.010> at

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
and of course these were all taken at

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.690 
and of course these were all taken at
the<00:05:20.190> same<00:05:20.400> settings<00:05:20.910> everything<00:05:21.510> like<00:05:21.720> that

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
the same settings everything like that

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.540 
the same settings everything like that
there<00:05:23.700> at<00:05:23.850> 1600<00:05:24.860> they're<00:05:25.860> still<00:05:26.070> holding<00:05:26.280> up

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
there at 1600 they're still holding up

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.990 
there at 1600 they're still holding up
both<00:05:26.760> pretty<00:05:27.030> well<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:28.310> it<00:05:29.310> doesn't<00:05:29.760> seem<00:05:29.910> to

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
both pretty well the it doesn't seem to

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.640 
both pretty well the it doesn't seem to
be<00:05:30.120> a<00:05:30.150> lot<00:05:30.360> of<00:05:30.420> noise<00:05:30.720> coming<00:05:31.170> in<00:05:31.260> at<00:05:31.350> all<00:05:31.470> in

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
be a lot of noise coming in at all in

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.290 
be a lot of noise coming in at all in
the<00:05:31.740> darks<00:05:32.040> all<00:05:32.190> the<00:05:32.340> highlights<00:05:32.550> just

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
the darks all the highlights just

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.870 
the darks all the highlights just
there<00:05:33.930> at<00:05:34.080> 3200<00:05:34.950> in<00:05:35.130> the<00:05:35.280> barrel<00:05:35.610> of<00:05:35.730> the<00:05:35.850> lens

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
there at 3200 in the barrel of the lens

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.210 
there at 3200 in the barrel of the lens

there<00:05:38.460> that<00:05:38.640> we're<00:05:38.730> focusing<00:05:39.150> on<00:05:39.240> you<00:05:39.420> can

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
there that we're focusing on you can

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.870 
there that we're focusing on you can
start<00:05:39.990> to<00:05:40.140> see<00:05:40.170> some<00:05:40.380> luminance<00:05:41.220> noise<00:05:41.430> coming

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
start to see some luminance noise coming

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.800 
start to see some luminance noise coming
in<00:05:42.060> at<00:05:42.800> 6,400<00:05:43.800> much<00:05:44.490> more<00:05:44.790> apparent<00:05:45.270> and<00:05:45.540> I

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
in at 6,400 much more apparent and I

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.140 
in at 6,400 much more apparent and I
would<00:05:46.020> say<00:05:46.260> though<00:05:47.190> that<00:05:47.220> they're<00:05:47.700> fairly

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
would say though that they're fairly

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.390 
would say though that they're fairly
close<00:05:48.600> on<00:05:48.840> par<00:05:49.170> wouldn't<00:05:49.710> put<00:05:49.890> one<00:05:50.070> ahead<00:05:50.220> of

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
close on par wouldn't put one ahead of

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.940 
close on par wouldn't put one ahead of
each<00:05:50.580> other<00:05:50.820> really<00:05:51.150> clearly<00:05:51.600> there<00:05:51.950> let's

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:52.950 
each other really clearly there let's

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.680 
each other really clearly there let's
take<00:05:53.100> a<00:05:53.160> look<00:05:53.340> at<00:05:53.400> 12<00:05:53.700> 8<00:05:54.230> there<00:05:55.230> again<00:05:56.690> still

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
take a look at 12 8 there again still

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.520 
take a look at 12 8 there again still
pretty<00:05:57.870> close<00:05:58.820> um-hmm<00:06:00.140> it's<00:06:01.140> a<00:06:01.200> bit<00:06:01.350> different

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
pretty close um-hmm it's a bit different

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.460 
pretty close um-hmm it's a bit different
there<00:06:01.890> seems<00:06:02.100> to<00:06:02.190> be<00:06:02.310> more<00:06:02.430> Cola<00:06:02.760> noise<00:06:03.030> on<00:06:03.330> the

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
there seems to be more Cola noise on the

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.920 
there seems to be more Cola noise on the
5100<00:06:04.470> there<00:06:05.130> are<00:06:05.310> at<00:06:05.510> twenty-five<00:06:06.510> thousand

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
5100 there are at twenty-five thousand

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.300 
5100 there are at twenty-five thousand
six<00:06:06.960> hundred<00:06:07.170> I<00:06:07.470> wouldn't<00:06:07.740> use<00:06:07.860> either<00:06:08.100> of

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
six hundred I wouldn't use either of

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.920 
six hundred I wouldn't use either of
them<00:06:08.580> but<00:06:08.700> I<00:06:08.760> would<00:06:09.030> say<00:06:09.210> they're<00:06:09.450> pretty<00:06:09.750> on

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
them but I would say they're pretty on

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.920 
them but I would say they're pretty on
par<00:06:10.460> still<00:06:11.460> the<00:06:11.640> 5200<00:06:12.390> does<00:06:12.570> seem<00:06:12.780> to<00:06:12.810> be

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
par still the 5200 does seem to be

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.090 
par still the 5200 does seem to be
retaining<00:06:13.410> the<00:06:13.620> detail<00:06:14.040> better<00:06:14.310> though<00:06:14.520> and

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.100 
retaining the detail better though and

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.350 
retaining the detail better though and
finally<00:06:17.100> let's<00:06:17.340> just<00:06:17.520> take<00:06:17.730> a<00:06:17.760> look<00:06:18.000> at<00:06:18.210> the

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
finally let's just take a look at the

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.510 
finally let's just take a look at the
5200<00:06:19.170> with<00:06:19.320> some<00:06:19.470> sample<00:06:19.860> shots<00:06:20.070> I've<00:06:20.250> taken

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
5200 with some sample shots I've taken

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.130 
5200 with some sample shots I've taken
whilst<00:06:20.850> I've<00:06:21.030> had<00:06:21.240> this<00:06:21.390> for<00:06:21.450> the<00:06:21.690> last<00:06:21.840> few

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
whilst I've had this for the last few

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.190 
whilst I've had this for the last few
days<00:06:22.730> ok<00:06:23.730> this<00:06:23.880> was<00:06:24.090> a<00:06:24.120> natural<00:06:24.600> light<00:06:24.780> shot

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 
days ok this was a natural light shot

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.980 
days ok this was a natural light shot
looking<00:06:25.650> straight<00:06:26.010> at<00:06:26.190> it<00:06:26.370> my<00:06:27.360> wife<00:06:27.570> took<00:06:27.780> this

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
looking straight at it my wife took this

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.950 
looking straight at it my wife took this
one<00:06:28.170> that's<00:06:28.470> at<00:06:28.680> about<00:06:28.890> 1.8<00:06:29.760> and<00:06:30.090> you<00:06:30.840> know

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
one that's at about 1.8 and you know

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.530 
one that's at about 1.8 and you know
there's<00:06:31.170> a<00:06:31.230> fair<00:06:32.190> amount<00:06:32.220> of<00:06:32.580> nice<00:06:32.970> contrast

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:33.540 
there's a fair amount of nice contrast

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.240 
there's a fair amount of nice contrast
in<00:06:33.690> there<00:06:33.840> again<00:06:34.110> this<00:06:34.260> was<00:06:34.470> at<00:06:34.620> the<00:06:34.770> natural

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
in there again this was at the natural

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.950 
in there again this was at the natural
settings<00:06:35.730> no<00:06:36.030> you<00:06:36.390> know<00:06:36.540> the<00:06:36.660> standard

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
settings no you know the standard

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.280 
settings no you know the standard
setting<00:06:37.500> and<00:06:37.680> he's<00:06:38.550> a<00:06:38.580> studio<00:06:39.150> shot<00:06:39.480> I<00:06:39.510> took<00:06:39.960> of

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:40.290 
setting and he's a studio shot I took of

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:42.320 
setting and he's a studio shot I took of
Tina<00:06:40.530> obviously<00:06:41.130> I<00:06:41.160> have<00:06:41.460> lit<00:06:41.730> that<00:06:41.970> so<00:06:42.270> you

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
Tina obviously I have lit that so you

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.940 
Tina obviously I have lit that so you
know<00:06:42.660> the<00:06:42.810> lighting<00:06:43.170> is<00:06:43.260> good<00:06:43.320> but<00:06:43.590> let's<00:06:43.740> go

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950 
know the lighting is good but let's go

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.710 
know the lighting is good but let's go
in<00:06:44.070> at<00:06:44.190> a<00:06:44.220> hundred<00:06:44.460> percent<00:06:44.640> and<00:06:45.270> you<00:06:45.390> can<00:06:45.540> see

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 
in at a hundred percent and you can see

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.720 
in at a hundred percent and you can see
there's<00:06:45.960> a<00:06:46.140> huge<00:06:46.590> amount<00:06:46.740> of<00:06:47.040> detail<00:06:47.490> there

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:47.730 
there's a huge amount of detail there

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:50.330 
there's a huge amount of detail there
this<00:06:48.270> 24<00:06:48.780> megapixel<00:06:49.380> sensor<00:06:49.740> is<00:06:49.860> no<00:06:50.040> toy

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:50.340 
this 24 megapixel sensor is no toy

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.060 
this 24 megapixel sensor is no toy
there's<00:06:50.730> really<00:06:51.630> really<00:06:52.140> a<00:06:52.170> lovely<00:06:52.530> lot<00:06:52.920> of

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:53.070 
there's really really a lovely lot of

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.890 
there's really really a lovely lot of
detail<00:06:53.460> there<00:06:53.700> especially<00:06:54.120> if<00:06:54.480> you<00:06:54.600> get<00:06:54.720> the

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:54.900 
detail there especially if you get the

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:57.800 
detail there especially if you get the
lighting<00:06:55.260> right<00:06:55.440> ok<00:06:56.040> so<00:06:56.100> the<00:06:56.400> 5200<00:06:57.180> I<00:06:57.270> do<00:06:57.330> think

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810 
lighting right ok so the 5200 I do think

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.620 
lighting right ok so the 5200 I do think
is<00:06:57.930> a<00:06:57.960> better<00:06:58.260> all-around<00:06:58.590> camera<00:06:59.630> huge

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:00.630 
is a better all-around camera huge

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.810 
is a better all-around camera huge
resolution<00:07:01.410> more<00:07:01.830> than<00:07:02.040> most<00:07:02.190> people<00:07:02.340> need

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:02.820 
resolution more than most people need

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.760 
resolution more than most people need

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 
with the you know the mirror up and it

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.740 
with the you know the mirror up and it
went<00:07:13.620> shooting<00:07:13.889> that<00:07:14.400> their<00:07:14.669> focus<00:07:15.150> is<00:07:15.240> a<00:07:15.300> lot

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:15.750 
went shooting that their focus is a lot

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.650 
went shooting that their focus is a lot
faster<00:07:16.289> more<00:07:16.470> responsive<00:07:16.620> than<00:07:17.160> the<00:07:17.660> 5100

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 
faster more responsive than the 5100

that's my experience using it and the

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.420 
that's my experience using it and the
video<00:07:21.539> controls<00:07:22.050> are<00:07:22.259> really<00:07:22.740> significant<00:07:23.340> if

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:23.430 
video controls are really significant if

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.980
