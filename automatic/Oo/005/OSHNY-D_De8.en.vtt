back<00:02:14.040> same<00:02:14.280> time<00:02:14.519> because<00:02:14.879> of<00:02:14.909> the<00:02:15.180> time

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
back same time because of the time

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.050 
back same time because of the time
difference<00:02:15.510> is<00:02:16.019> the<00:02:16.140> time<00:02:16.379> zones<00:02:16.680> but<00:02:17.370> I<00:02:17.610> don't

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
difference is the time zones but I don't

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.970 
difference is the time zones but I don't
think<00:02:18.239> it's<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.599> drastic<00:02:19.379> to<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.680> time

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
think it's that drastic to the time

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.520 
think it's that drastic to the time
zones<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.580> up<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:21.090> would<00:02:21.239> be<00:02:21.330> like<00:02:21.360> 12<00:02:21.989> days<00:02:22.290> I

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
zones that up it would be like 12 days I

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.490 
zones that up it would be like 12 days I
mean<00:02:22.680> wait<00:02:23.040> 11<00:02:23.430> days<00:02:24.110> 11<00:02:25.110> days<00:02:25.260> of<00:02:25.440> a

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
mean wait 11 days 11 days of a

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.440 
mean wait 11 days 11 days of a
difference<00:02:25.799> that<00:02:26.099> seems<00:02:26.430> really<00:02:26.940> ridiculous

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
difference that seems really ridiculous

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.410
