00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
their children die I think we should be

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.650 
their children die I think we should be
able<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.590> empathize<00:00:23.369> with<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.480> say

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
if we were in their situation we would

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.919 
if we were in their situation we would
want<00:00:27.119> someone<00:00:27.420> to<00:00:27.630> help<00:00:27.810> us<00:00:28.490> now<00:00:29.599> you<00:00:30.599> make<00:00:30.779> the

want someone to help us now you make the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.690 
want someone to help us now you make the

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
point that if people live they tend to

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.310 
point that if people live they tend to
have<00:00:35.850> children<00:00:36.270> themselves<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.809> population

have children themselves and population

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.810 
have children themselves and population
will<00:00:37.440> grow<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.920> accept<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.430> there<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.790> a

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
will grow and I accept that there is a

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.690 
will grow and I accept that there is a
real<00:00:39.120> point<00:00:39.629> here<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:40.020> has<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.290> be<00:00:40.410> met<00:00:40.700> we

real point here that has to be met we

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.630 
real point here that has to be met we
need<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.300> have<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:43.440> need<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.739> work<00:00:43.920> towards<00:00:44.489> a

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
need to have we need to work towards a

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.430 
need to have we need to work towards a
sustainable<00:00:45.030> population<00:00:45.719> worldwide<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:48.440> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
sustainable population worldwide and the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.950 
sustainable population worldwide and the
question<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:49.920> how<00:00:50.100> best<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.460> do<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.960> there's

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
question is how best we do that there's

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.479 
question is how best we do that there's
no<00:00:52.050> evidence<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.680> leaving<00:00:53.100> people<00:00:53.370> in

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
no evidence that leaving people in

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.510 
no evidence that leaving people in
poverty<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.090> going<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.110> stop<00:00:55.920> population

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
poverty is going to stop population

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.549 
poverty is going to stop population
growth<00:00:56.730> unless<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.510> course<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.930> are<00:00:57.960> prepared

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
growth unless of course you are prepared

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.849 
growth unless of course you are prepared
to<00:00:58.620> simply<00:00:59.039> allow<00:00:59.690> attrition<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.899> occur

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
to simply allow attrition to occur

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.799 
to simply allow attrition to occur
back<00:01:02.399> in<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.640> 1970s<00:01:03.090> Garret<00:01:03.660> Hardin

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
back in the 1970s Garret Hardin

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.140 
back in the 1970s Garret Hardin
suggested<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.680> he<00:01:04.890> said<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.460> number<00:01:06.000> of

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
suggested that he said that a number of

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.550 
suggested that he said that a number of
countries<00:01:06.360> were<00:01:06.689> over<00:01:07.080> there<00:01:07.200> carrying

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
countries were over there carrying

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.780 
countries were over there carrying
capacity<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.070> there<00:01:08.250> was<00:01:08.340> nothing<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.700> could

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
capacity and there was nothing we could

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.649 
capacity and there was nothing we could
do<00:01:09.030> for<00:01:09.060> them<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.659> we<00:01:10.170> should<00:01:10.229> simply<00:01:10.650> allow

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
do for them and we should simply allow

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.600 
do for them and we should simply allow
attrition<00:01:12.659> death<00:01:13.470> from<00:01:13.799> from<00:01:14.189> famine

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
attrition death from from famine

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.670 
attrition death from from famine
basically<00:01:15.090> he<00:01:15.210> was<00:01:15.299> predicting<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:16.350> bring

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
basically he was predicting to bring

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.080 
basically he was predicting to bring
their<00:01:16.890> population<00:01:17.430> down<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.759> carrying

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
their population down to carrying

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.760 
their population down to carrying
capacity<00:01:18.540> among<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.350> countries<00:01:19.680> he

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
capacity among the countries he

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.820 
capacity among the countries he
mentioned<00:01:20.130> was<00:01:20.250> Bangladesh<00:01:20.990> which<00:01:21.990> actually

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
mentioned was Bangladesh which actually

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.289 
mentioned was Bangladesh which actually
now<00:01:22.979> has<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.220> significantly<00:01:23.850> larger

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
now has a significantly larger

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.780 
now has a significantly larger
population<00:01:24.869> than<00:01:25.049> it<00:01:25.140> had<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.439> 1970s<00:01:26.220> but

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
population than it had in the 1970s but

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.539 
population than it had in the 1970s but
does<00:01:27.180> not<00:01:27.360> have<00:01:27.570> more<00:01:27.840> famine<00:01:28.530> than<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.400> had

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
does not have more famine than it had

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.660 
does not have more famine than it had
then<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.570> basically<00:01:31.049> probably<00:01:31.890> has<00:01:32.159> well

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
then and basically probably has well

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.039 
then and basically probably has well
definitely<00:01:32.970> has<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> smaller<00:01:33.360> proportion<00:01:33.570> of

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
definitely has a smaller proportion of

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.039 
definitely has a smaller proportion of
its<00:01:34.170> people<00:01:34.439> living<00:01:34.680> in<00:01:34.770> extreme<00:01:34.860> poverty<00:01:36.049> so

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
its people living in extreme poverty so

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.620 
its people living in extreme poverty so
I<00:01:37.710> think<00:01:37.979> some<00:01:38.340> predictions<00:01:38.880> have<00:01:39.030> been<00:01:39.060> too

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
I think some predictions have been too

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.630 
I think some predictions have been too
gloomy<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.619> think<00:01:40.860> there's<00:01:41.040> hope<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.460> if

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
gloomy and I think there's hope that if

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.139 
gloomy and I think there's hope that if
we<00:01:41.939> get<00:01:42.299> countries<00:01:42.840> up<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.590> better<00:01:43.860> level

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
we get countries up to a better level

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.060 
we get countries up to a better level
however<00:01:45.149> where<00:01:45.420> they<00:01:45.930> can<00:01:46.170> not<00:01:46.649> only<00:01:46.829> survive

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
however where they can not only survive

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.520 
however where they can not only survive
but<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.970> have<00:01:48.390> some<00:01:48.659> education<00:01:49.259> for<00:01:49.409> their

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
but can have some education for their

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.830 
but can have some education for their
children<00:01:50.000> one<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.210> things<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.600> clearly

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
children one of the things that clearly

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.819 
children one of the things that clearly
correlates<00:01:52.470> with<00:01:52.710> reduced<00:01:53.610> fertility

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
correlates with reduced fertility

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.230 
correlates with reduced fertility
inversely<00:01:55.829> correlates<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.520> should<00:01:56.670> say<00:01:56.850> is<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
inversely correlates I should say is the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.090 
inversely correlates I should say is the
number<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.540> years<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.869> education<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.560> girl<00:01:58.770> gets

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
number of years of education a girl gets

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.580 
number of years of education a girl gets
so<00:01:59.880> if<00:02:00.270> we<00:02:00.390> can<00:02:00.540> bring<00:02:00.750> countries<00:02:01.290> up<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.560> a

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
so if we can bring countries up to a

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.310 
so if we can bring countries up to a
level<00:02:01.770> where<00:02:02.070> they<00:02:02.189> can<00:02:02.219> educate<00:02:02.549> their<00:02:03.060> girls

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
level where they can educate their girls

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.749 
level where they can educate their girls
that<00:02:04.320> gives<00:02:04.560> us<00:02:04.680> some<00:02:04.860> hope<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.250> stabilizing

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
that gives us some hope of stabilizing

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.119 
that gives us some hope of stabilizing
their<00:02:06.000> population<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.689> of<00:02:06.840> course<00:02:07.079> we<00:02:07.979> can

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
their population and of course we can

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.680 
their population and of course we can
also<00:02:08.280> help<00:02:08.550> them<00:02:08.729> with<00:02:08.789> providing<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.420> means

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
also help them with providing the means

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.180 
also help them with providing the means
of<00:02:09.899> family<00:02:10.259> planning<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:10.770> think<00:02:10.800> that's

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
of family planning I think that's

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.150 
of family planning I think that's
perfectly<00:02:12.000> reasonable

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
perfectly reasonable

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.610 
perfectly reasonable
of<00:02:13.430> an<00:02:13.640> aid<00:02:13.760> package<00:02:14.030> so<00:02:14.930> I<00:02:14.960> think<00:02:15.200> we<00:02:15.440> need<00:02:15.470> a

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
of an aid package so I think we need a

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.370 
of an aid package so I think we need a
strategy<00:02:16.420> not<00:02:17.420> just<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.900> say<00:02:18.050> we're<00:02:18.230> going<00:02:18.320> to

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
strategy not just to say we're going to

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.480 
strategy not just to say we're going to
abandon<00:02:18.860> these<00:02:18.980> people<00:02:19.040> but<00:02:20.000> rather<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.690> say

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
abandon these people but rather to say

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.190 
abandon these people but rather to say
we<00:02:22.490> need<00:02:22.760> to<00:02:22.970> work<00:02:23.120> with<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:23.630> to<00:02:23.810> get<00:02:23.900> you<00:02:24.080> to

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
we need to work with you to get you to

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.250 
we need to work with you to get you to
the<00:02:24.290> point<00:02:24.470> where<00:02:24.770> you<00:02:25.220> can<00:02:25.960> reduce<00:02:26.960> fertility

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
the point where you can reduce fertility

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.440 
the point where you can reduce fertility
lose<00:02:27.980> fertility<00:02:28.460> reduce<00:02:28.700> population<00:02:29.240> growth

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
lose fertility reduce population growth

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.310 
lose fertility reduce population growth
and<00:02:29.690> end<00:02:30.020> up<00:02:30.140> with<00:02:30.290> a<00:02:30.320> stable<00:02:30.590> population
