wave on the second phase there's two and

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.160 
wave on the second phase there's two and
on<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:58.820> third<00:02:59.030> and<00:02:59.240> fourth<00:02:59.450> phase<00:02:59.750> there<00:03:00.020> are

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
straight through it even if there are

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.740 
straight through it even if there are
three<00:03:06.920> waves<00:03:07.190> you<00:03:07.670> just<00:03:07.910> have<00:03:08.090> to<00:03:08.120> get<00:03:08.330> lucky
