hi everyone what I have here is a
collected<00:00:09.190> Hollywood<00:00:09.670> juniper<00:00:10.210> if<00:00:10.510> I<00:00:10.600> dug<00:00:10.870> out

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.050 
collected Hollywood juniper if I dug out

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.830 
collected Hollywood juniper if I dug out
of<00:00:11.080> the<00:00:11.200> ground<00:00:11.260> about<00:00:11.800> two<00:00:12.070> years<00:00:12.280> ago<00:00:12.840> some

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
of the ground about two years ago some

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.510 
of the ground about two years ago some
of<00:00:13.870> you<00:00:14.020> may<00:00:14.200> remember<00:00:14.260> the<00:00:14.740> video<00:00:15.070> from<00:00:15.370> the

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:15.520 
of you may remember the video from the

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.310 
of you may remember the video from the
dig<00:00:15.760> where<00:00:16.030> we<00:00:16.150> talked<00:00:16.420> about<00:00:16.600> how<00:00:16.990> to<00:00:17.050> get

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
dig where we talked about how to get

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.320 
dig where we talked about how to get
really<00:00:17.740> great<00:00:17.950> bones<00:00:18.220> sign<00:00:18.520> material<00:00:19.119> for

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:19.330 
really great bones sign material for

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.590 
really great bones sign material for
free<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:20.560> this<00:00:21.310> is<00:00:21.610> one<00:00:21.910> of<00:00:21.940> the<00:00:22.090> junipers

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:22.600 
free and this is one of the junipers

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.350 
free and this is one of the junipers
that<00:00:22.810> I<00:00:22.900> dug<00:00:23.200> out<00:00:23.440> as<00:00:23.740> you<00:00:24.310> can<00:00:24.490> see<00:00:24.760> it's<00:00:24.970> quite

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
that I dug out as you can see it's quite

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.800 
that I dug out as you can see it's quite
large<00:00:25.660> and<00:00:26.370> also<00:00:27.370> very<00:00:27.850> thick<00:00:28.240> in<00:00:28.390> the<00:00:28.480> trunk

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
large and also very thick in the trunk

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.440 
large and also very thick in the trunk
base<00:00:29.080> and<00:00:29.980> it's<00:00:30.520> going<00:00:30.760> to<00:00:30.850> make<00:00:31.000> a<00:00:31.030> stunning

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:31.450 
base and it's going to make a stunning

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.780 
base and it's going to make a stunning
bone<00:00:31.780> side<00:00:32.110> but<00:00:32.529> it<00:00:32.649> needs<00:00:32.890> a<00:00:33.070> whole<00:00:33.309> lot<00:00:33.640> of

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:33.790 
bone side but it needs a whole lot of

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.259 
bone side but it needs a whole lot of
work<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:35.200> let's<00:00:35.559> get<00:00:35.770> started<00:00:36.339> here<00:00:39.269> problem

00:00:40.259 --> 00:00:40.269 
work so let's get started here problem

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:43.500 
work so let's get started here problem
with<00:00:40.449> a<00:00:40.480> tree<00:00:40.870> like<00:00:41.109> this<00:00:41.379> so<00:00:42.370> dense<00:00:42.760> we<00:00:43.210> can't

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
with a tree like this so dense we can't

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.290 
with a tree like this so dense we can't
really<00:00:43.980> proven<00:00:44.980> it<00:00:45.070> first<00:00:45.429> and<00:00:45.760> then<00:00:45.909> start

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
really proven it first and then start

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.450 
really proven it first and then start
wiring<00:00:46.629> because<00:00:47.230> I<00:00:47.320> don't<00:00:47.499> have<00:00:47.649> enough<00:00:47.710> hands

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
wiring because I don't have enough hands

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.399 
wiring because I don't have enough hands
to<00:00:48.519> hold<00:00:48.850> down<00:00:49.059> all<00:00:49.300> the<00:00:49.420> branches<00:00:49.960> to<00:00:50.109> figure

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:50.409 
to hold down all the branches to figure

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:52.380 
to hold down all the branches to figure
out<00:00:50.530> what<00:00:50.710> goes<00:00:50.920> where<00:00:51.309> so<00:00:52.089> we're<00:00:52.210> going<00:00:52.329> to

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
out what goes where so we're going to

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.750 
out what goes where so we're going to
start<00:00:52.629> wiring<00:00:53.170> down<00:00:53.350> branches<00:00:54.100> until<00:00:54.309> we<00:00:54.579> got

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
start wiring down branches until we got

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.389 
start wiring down branches until we got
a<00:00:54.789> sense<00:00:55.179> of<00:00:55.390> what<00:00:55.600> goes<00:00:55.629> where<00:00:56.289> then<00:00:57.159> we'll

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
a sense of what goes where then we'll

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.790 
a sense of what goes where then we'll
start<00:00:57.670> subtracting<00:00:57.969> out<00:00:58.629> branches<00:00:59.019> once<00:00:59.589> we

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
start subtracting out branches once we

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.709 
start subtracting out branches once we
get<00:01:00.010> them<00:01:00.190> all<00:01:00.370> wired<00:01:00.699> out<00:01:01.059> and<00:01:01.359> we'll<00:01:01.479> see

00:01:01.709 --> 00:01:01.719 
get them all wired out and we'll see

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.299 
get them all wired out and we'll see
what<00:01:01.960> fits<00:01:02.289> and<00:01:02.499> what<00:01:02.620> doesn't

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
what fits and what doesn't

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:04.740 
what fits and what doesn't
that<00:01:03.639> means<00:01:03.909> we're<00:01:04.120> going<00:01:04.210> to<00:01:04.269> have<00:01:04.330> to<00:01:04.570> cut

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
that means we're going to have to cut

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.810 
that means we're going to have to cut
some<00:01:05.019> wire<00:01:05.260> as<00:01:05.560> well<00:01:05.590> as<00:01:05.800> cutting<00:01:06.280> branches

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
some wire as well as cutting branches

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.990 
some wire as well as cutting branches
but<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:08.409> bone<00:01:08.710> sign<00:01:09.040> when<00:01:09.369> you're<00:01:09.520> working<00:01:09.850> on

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
but in bone sign when you're working on

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.539 
but in bone sign when you're working on
something<00:01:10.509> this<00:01:10.630> large<00:01:10.930> and<00:01:11.409> this<00:01:11.770> nice<00:01:12.070> you

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
something this large and this nice you

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:24.109 
something this large and this nice you
got<00:01:12.729> to<00:01:12.850> make<00:01:12.969> a<00:01:13.000> few<00:01:13.299> sacrifices<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.960> branch

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
got to make a few sacrifices a branch

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.990 
got to make a few sacrifices a branch
that<00:01:25.119> don't<00:01:25.450> work<00:01:26.009> then<00:01:27.009> we<00:01:27.219> go<00:01:27.430> to<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.640> six

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
that don't work then we go to the six

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.050 
that don't work then we go to the six
mill<00:01:28.360> and<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.500> way<00:01:29.649> this<00:01:29.829> is<00:01:30.039> feeling<00:01:30.579> I<00:01:30.789> think

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
mill and the way this is feeling I think

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.639 
mill and the way this is feeling I think
we're<00:01:31.210> gonna<00:01:31.329> have<00:01:31.570> to<00:01:31.780> go<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:34.140> save<00:01:35.140> the<00:01:35.350> five

00:01:35.639 --> 00:01:35.649 
we're gonna have to go to save the five

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:46.590 
we're gonna have to go to save the five
mill<00:01:35.979> for<00:01:36.539> smaller<00:01:37.539> benches

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:02:08.510 

you

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.230 

here<00:02:09.520> we<00:02:09.700> are<00:02:09.729> we<00:02:10.509> prove<00:02:10.869> we've<00:02:11.470> wired<00:02:12.210> done<00:02:13.210> a

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
here we are we prove we've wired done a

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.130 
here we are we prove we've wired done a
little<00:02:13.450> bit<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:13.720> grinding<00:02:14.320> and<00:02:15.570> at<00:02:16.570> 39<00:02:17.110> inches

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
little bit of grinding and at 39 inches

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.620 
little bit of grinding and at 39 inches
tall<00:02:17.800> this<00:02:18.100> is<00:02:18.160> I<00:02:18.520> think<00:02:18.580> the<00:02:18.940> largest<00:02:19.270> bones

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
tall this is I think the largest bones

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.590 
tall this is I think the largest bones
I've<00:02:20.110> ever<00:02:20.320> created<00:02:21.120> probably<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.450> largest

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
I've ever created probably the largest

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.880 
I've ever created probably the largest
what<00:02:23.050> I'm<00:02:23.170> ever<00:02:23.350> going<00:02:23.680> to<00:02:23.860> do<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:25.650> it's<00:02:26.650> well

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
what I'm ever going to do and it's well

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.440 
what I'm ever going to do and it's well
on<00:02:26.920> its<00:02:27.190> way<00:02:27.280> at<00:02:27.610> this<00:02:27.760> point

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
on its way at this point

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.170 
on its way at this point
the<00:02:29.110> one<00:02:29.290> thing<00:02:29.500> remaining<00:02:29.950> is<00:02:30.280> it's<00:02:30.820> been<00:02:31.060> in

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
the one thing remaining is it's been in

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.360 
the one thing remaining is it's been in
this<00:02:31.360> training<00:02:31.780> pot<00:02:32.140> for<00:02:32.470> two<00:02:32.500> years<00:02:33.040> since

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
this training pot for two years since

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.060 
this training pot for two years since
being<00:02:33.640> collected<00:02:34.410> still<00:02:35.410> has<00:02:35.620> some<00:02:35.920> of<00:02:36.010> the

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
being collected still has some of the

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.270 
being collected still has some of the
old<00:02:36.250> soil<00:02:36.670> on<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.320> so<00:02:38.320> it's<00:02:38.800> got<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.130> get

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
old soil on it so it's got to get

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.020 
old soil on it so it's got to get
repotted<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:41.110> only<00:02:41.380> question<00:02:41.890> now<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:42.430> can<00:02:42.459> we

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
repotted the only question now is can we

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.060 
repotted the only question now is can we
fit<00:02:43.270> this<00:02:43.420> in<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.690> bonsai<00:02:44.140> pot<00:02:44.530> or<00:02:44.709> is<00:02:44.800> it<00:02:44.950> gonna

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
fit this in a bonsai pot or is it gonna

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.949 
fit this in a bonsai pot or is it gonna

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
pot that's large enough so we're gonna

00:02:52.209 --> 00:03:02.000 
pot that's large enough so we're gonna
work<00:02:52.450> on<00:02:52.660> that<00:02:52.690> next

because<00:03:14.530> this<00:03:14.680> tree<00:03:14.980> is<00:03:15.099> so<00:03:15.340> big<00:03:15.610> and<00:03:15.640> massive

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
because this tree is so big and massive

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.839 
because this tree is so big and massive
it<00:03:16.480> took<00:03:16.750> two<00:03:17.470> people<00:03:17.739> to<00:03:17.950> do<00:03:18.220> everything<00:03:18.580> so

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
it took two people to do everything so

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.080 
it took two people to do everything so
my<00:03:19.810> camera<00:03:20.260> operator<00:03:20.440> was<00:03:21.069> very<00:03:21.370> involved<00:03:21.760> in

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
my camera operator was very involved in

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.110 
my camera operator was very involved in
this<00:03:22.269> particular<00:03:24.569> session<00:03:26.519> what<00:03:27.519> you<00:03:27.670> can<00:03:27.849> see

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
this particular session what you can see

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.030 
this particular session what you can see
here<00:03:28.480> is<00:03:28.840> a<00:03:29.290> classic<00:03:29.769> formal<00:03:30.760> upright<00:03:31.180> bonsai

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
here is a classic formal upright bonsai

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.280 
here is a classic formal upright bonsai
because<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.280> foliage<00:03:34.030> of<00:03:34.150> Hollywood<00:03:34.720> juniper

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
because the foliage of Hollywood juniper

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.740 
because the foliage of Hollywood juniper
is<00:03:35.920> a<00:03:36.250> little<00:03:36.519> similar<00:03:36.970> to<00:03:37.180> what<00:03:37.360> you<00:03:37.480> see<00:03:37.720> on

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
is a little similar to what you see on

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.960 
is a little similar to what you see on
giant<00:03:38.410> sequoia<00:03:38.860> is<00:03:39.010> out<00:03:39.250> in<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.400> forest

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
giant sequoia is out in the forest

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.610 
giant sequoia is out in the forest
that's<00:03:40.150> kind<00:03:40.510> of<00:03:40.599> look<00:03:40.900> that<00:03:41.049> we<00:03:41.230> were<00:03:41.380> going

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
that's kind of look that we were going

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.940 
that's kind of look that we were going
for<00:03:42.010> here<00:03:43.079> unfortunately<00:03:44.079> this<00:03:44.260> thing<00:03:44.530> is<00:03:44.680> so

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
for here unfortunately this thing is so

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.789 
for here unfortunately this thing is so
large<00:03:45.250> and<00:03:45.640> so<00:03:45.880> heavy<00:03:46.180> that<00:03:46.540> we<00:03:46.870> can't<00:03:47.170> do<00:03:47.470> the

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
large and so heavy that we can't do the

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.370 
large and so heavy that we can't do the
usual<00:03:48.150> 360<00:03:49.150> so<00:03:49.420> we're<00:03:49.599> just<00:03:49.630> going<00:03:49.930> to<00:03:49.959> run<00:03:50.200> the

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
usual 360 so we're just going to run the

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.979 
usual 360 so we're just going to run the
camera<00:03:50.860> on<00:03:51.099> it<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:51.430> you<00:03:52.209> know<00:03:52.329> look<00:03:52.660> at<00:03:52.810> it

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:52.989 
camera on it and you know look at it

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.930 
camera on it and you know look at it
nice<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.230> close<00:03:53.709> for<00:03:54.040> a<00:03:54.099> little<00:03:54.370> while<00:03:54.610> and

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
nice and close for a little while and

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.729 
nice and close for a little while and
try<00:03:55.180> to<00:03:55.239> take<00:03:55.540> in<00:03:55.780> everything<00:03:56.230> that's<00:03:56.319> going

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
try to take in everything that's going

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.470 
try to take in everything that's going
on<00:03:56.890> one<00:03:57.190> of<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.370> things<00:03:57.640> that<00:03:57.849> I<00:03:57.880> will<00:03:58.150> point

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
on one of the things that I will point

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.690 
on one of the things that I will point
out<00:03:58.690> is<00:03:58.750> that<00:03:59.079> the<00:03:59.349> branches<00:03:59.829> on<00:04:00.040> this<00:04:00.250> was<00:04:00.459> so

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
out is that the branches on this was so

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.509 
out is that the branches on this was so
thick<00:04:01.060> most<00:04:01.870> of<00:04:02.049> them<00:04:02.230> require<00:04:02.410> double<00:04:03.220> runs

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
thick most of them require double runs

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.940 
thick most of them require double runs
of<00:04:03.760> six<00:04:04.060> millimeter<00:04:04.599> wire<00:04:04.930> in<00:04:05.350> order<00:04:05.620> to<00:04:05.739> get

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
of six millimeter wire in order to get

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.650 
of six millimeter wire in order to get
them<00:04:06.190> to<00:04:06.220> go<00:04:06.549> down<00:04:06.790> into<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.239> proper

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
them to go down into the proper

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.229 
them to go down into the proper
positions<00:04:08.430> the<00:04:09.430> other<00:04:09.579> thing<00:04:09.850> that's<00:04:10.000> going

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
positions the other thing that's going

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.050 
positions the other thing that's going
on<00:04:10.569> is<00:04:10.630> this<00:04:11.410> was<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.950> kind<00:04:12.160> of<00:04:12.340> deal<00:04:12.579> where<00:04:12.880> we

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
on is this was the kind of deal where we

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.699 
on is this was the kind of deal where we
basically<00:04:13.239> had<00:04:13.810> to<00:04:13.959> anchor<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:14.470> wire

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
basically had to anchor the wire

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.710 
basically had to anchor the wire
wherever<00:04:15.250> we<00:04:15.489> could<00:04:15.790> in<00:04:15.970> order<00:04:16.209> to<00:04:16.299> get<00:04:16.479> enough

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
wherever we could in order to get enough

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.930 
wherever we could in order to get enough
leverage<00:04:17.019> to<00:04:17.260> get<00:04:17.560> the<00:04:17.709> branch<00:04:17.979> into<00:04:18.340> position

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
leverage to get the branch into position

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.320 
leverage to get the branch into position
and<00:04:19.650> there<00:04:20.650> will<00:04:20.859> definitely<00:04:21.039> be<00:04:21.430> some<00:04:21.639> fine

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
and there will definitely be some fine

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.469 
and there will definitely be some fine
work<00:04:22.630> and<00:04:22.960> some<00:04:23.200> Corrections<00:04:23.919> and<00:04:24.479> hopefully

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
work and some Corrections and hopefully

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:27.210 
work and some Corrections and hopefully
when<00:04:25.870> we<00:04:26.020> get<00:04:26.229> to<00:04:26.380> that<00:04:26.530> phase<00:04:26.919> the

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
when we get to that phase the

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.909 
when we get to that phase the
development<00:04:27.400> of<00:04:27.910> this<00:04:28.030> tree<00:04:28.470> since<00:04:29.470> it's<00:04:29.710> now

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
development of this tree since it's now

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.670 
development of this tree since it's now
a<00:04:30.250> bit<00:04:30.610> smaller<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.479> a<00:04:31.690> bit<00:04:31.930> a<00:04:31.960> lot<00:04:32.380> lighter

a bit smaller and a bit a lot lighter

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.909 
a bit smaller and a bit a lot lighter
than<00:04:32.919> it<00:04:33.220> originally<00:04:33.310> was<00:04:34.470> what<00:04:35.470> we<00:04:35.590> should<00:04:35.889> be

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:35.919 
than it originally was what we should be

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:39.240 
than it originally was what we should be
able<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:36.370> do<00:04:36.639> is<00:04:37.169> you<00:04:38.169> know<00:04:38.320> present<00:04:38.860> the<00:04:39.039> work
