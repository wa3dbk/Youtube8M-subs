00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
playing at centre attacking mid this

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.270 
playing at centre attacking mid this
front<00:04:54.630> free<00:04:54.840> are<00:04:55.020> really<00:04:55.349> good<00:04:55.470> together<00:04:55.590> but

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
front free are really good together but

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:59.060 
front free are really good together but
this<00:04:56.490> guy<00:04:56.669> as<00:04:56.880> I<00:04:56.910> said<00:04:57.030> he<00:04:57.360> brings<00:04:57.860> loads<00:04:58.860> of

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
this guy as I said he brings loads of

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.790 
this guy as I said he brings loads of
frets<00:04:59.310> in<00:04:59.460> the<00:04:59.550> form<00:04:59.820> of<00:05:00.030> Sheikh<00:05:00.300> Ali<00:05:00.509> and<00:05:00.810> I

frets in the form of Sheikh Ali and I

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.110 
frets in the form of Sheikh Ali and I
think<00:05:02.130> that's<00:05:02.250> marquinhos<00:05:02.669> who<00:05:02.970> actually

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
think that's marquinhos who actually

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.180 
think that's marquinhos who actually
managed<00:05:03.630> to<00:05:03.690> not<00:05:03.930> that<00:05:04.110> ball<00:05:04.320> home<00:05:04.560> by

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
managed to not that ball home by

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.740 
managed to not that ball home by
accident<00:05:05.639> I<00:05:05.669> think<00:05:05.880> that<00:05:05.970> was<00:05:06.060> a<00:05:06.090> first<00:05:06.330> touch

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
accident I think that was a first touch

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.480 
accident I think that was a first touch
that<00:05:06.990> actually<00:05:07.229> just<00:05:07.380> took<00:05:07.860> it<00:05:07.919> away<00:05:08.099> from<00:05:08.220> our

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
that actually just took it away from our

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.370 
that actually just took it away from our
defender<00:05:08.910> and<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.150> goalkeeper<00:05:09.599> so<00:05:09.720> he<00:05:10.169> was<00:05:10.289> an

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
defender and the goalkeeper so he was an

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:11.870 
defender and the goalkeeper so he was an
ultra<00:05:10.620> attack<00:05:10.830> he<00:05:11.039> wanted<00:05:11.370> to<00:05:11.490> get<00:05:11.580> back<00:05:11.639> into

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
ultra attack he wanted to get back into

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.820 
ultra attack he wanted to get back into
the<00:05:12.030> game<00:05:12.210> I<00:05:12.449> was<00:05:12.840> under<00:05:12.990> a<00:05:13.110> lot<00:05:13.229> of<00:05:13.500> pressure

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
the game I was under a lot of pressure

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.640 
the game I was under a lot of pressure
it's<00:05:14.190> 2-2<00:05:14.610> now<00:05:14.849> I<00:05:15.090> absolutely<00:05:16.080> have<00:05:16.380> to<00:05:16.530> get

it's 2-2 now I absolutely have to get

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.110 
it's 2-2 now I absolutely have to get
the<00:05:16.710> next<00:05:16.919> goal<00:05:17.099> wise<00:05:17.400> it's<00:05:17.580> going<00:05:17.699> to<00:05:17.759> be<00:05:17.880> a

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
the next goal wise it's going to be a

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.870 
the next goal wise it's going to be a

keep<00:05:43.229> the<00:05:43.349> ball<00:05:43.530> it's<00:05:43.889> the<00:05:44.130> 90th<00:05:44.550> minute<00:05:44.639> and

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
keep the ball it's the 90th minute and

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:46.610 
keep the ball it's the 90th minute and
you<00:05:45.240> know<00:05:45.330> he's<00:05:45.599> coming<00:05:46.139> through<00:05:46.169> he's

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
you know he's coming through he's

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.680 
you know he's coming through he's
getting<00:05:47.130> lucky<00:05:47.490> with<00:05:47.520> all<00:05:47.820> these<00:05:47.969> touches<00:05:48.270> but

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:48.690 
getting lucky with all these touches but

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.050 
getting lucky with all these touches but
you<00:05:49.050> know<00:05:49.169> we<00:05:49.380> take<00:05:49.620> him<00:05:49.800> out<00:05:49.919> and<00:05:50.159> somehow

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
you know we take him out and somehow

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.909 
you know we take him out and somehow
that<00:05:51.449> is<00:05:51.900> not<00:05:52.139> apparently<00:05:52.530> that<00:05:52.710> is<00:05:52.800> the

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
that is not apparently that is the

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.399 
that is not apparently that is the
biggest<00:05:53.159> look<00:05:53.610> we've<00:05:53.820> had<00:05:54.000> of<00:05:54.210> this<00:05:54.719> season<00:05:55.169> so

far any of the time against me
specifically<00:05:58.259> that<00:05:58.380> would<00:05:58.740> be<00:05:58.889> a<00:05:58.919> penalty<00:05:59.159> and

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
specifically that would be a penalty and

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.339 
specifically that would be a penalty and
I<00:05:59.820> would<00:06:00.210> have<00:06:00.419> my<00:06:00.630> fist<00:06:00.930> through<00:06:01.080> the

to<00:06:14.699> improve<00:06:15.090> the<00:06:15.330> team<00:06:15.539> by<00:06:15.780> getting<00:06:16.020> rid<00:06:16.110> of

00:06:16.159 --> 00:06:16.169 
to improve the team by getting rid of

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:18.379 
to improve the team by getting rid of
the<00:06:16.320> left<00:06:16.710> center<00:06:17.039> midfielder<00:06:17.699> and<00:06:17.909> the<00:06:18.120> left

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389 
the left center midfielder and the left

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:20.390 
the left center midfielder and the left
back<00:06:18.570> out<00:06:19.110> with<00:06:19.259> the<00:06:19.320> ratings<00:06:19.680> those<00:06:20.009> two<00:06:20.280> were

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
back out with the ratings those two were

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.980 
back out with the ratings those two were
pretty<00:06:20.550> much<00:06:20.669> the<00:06:20.940> worst<00:06:21.120> in<00:06:21.539> the<00:06:21.630> last<00:06:21.780> game

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
pretty much the worst in the last game

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.499 
pretty much the worst in the last game
