flat

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.510 

alright<00:01:45.799> here's<00:01:46.369> my<00:01:46.460> finished<00:01:46.909> anvil<00:01:47.420> I

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
alright here's my finished anvil I

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.270 
alright here's my finished anvil I
basically<00:01:49.520> just<00:01:50.229> took<00:01:51.229> cutoff<00:01:51.710> wheels<00:01:51.979> and

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
basically just took cutoff wheels and

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.100 
basically just took cutoff wheels and
cut<00:01:52.490> these<00:01:52.700> triangles<00:01:53.540> out<00:01:53.690> of<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.840> sides

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
cut these triangles out of the sides

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.290 
cut these triangles out of the sides
they're<00:01:54.590> sitting<00:01:54.950> right<00:01:54.979> here<00:01:55.369> I<00:01:55.580> cut<00:01:56.119> this

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
they're sitting right here I cut this

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.870 
they're sitting right here I cut this
triangle<00:01:56.869> out<00:01:57.020> right<00:01:57.500> here<00:01:57.890> it<00:01:58.190> took<00:01:58.520> six

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
triangle out right here it took six

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.540 
triangle out right here it took six
cutoff<00:01:59.330> wheels<00:01:59.600> to<00:01:59.990> do<00:02:00.140> that<00:02:00.380> well<00:02:01.159> there's<00:02:01.460> a

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
cutoff wheels to do that well there's a

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.430 
cutoff wheels to do that well there's a
I<00:02:01.850> couldn't<00:02:02.240> reach<00:02:02.479> back<00:02:02.750> in<00:02:02.990> here<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:03.320> get

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
I couldn't reach back in here and get

see we're on the very very end of that

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.590 
see we're on the very very end of that
where<00:02:11.660> it<00:02:11.750> broke<00:02:11.930> off<00:02:12.400> yeah<00:02:13.400> I<00:02:13.520> just<00:02:13.790> sanded<00:02:14.510> it

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
where it broke off yeah I just sanded it

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.350 
where it broke off yeah I just sanded it
all<00:02:14.750> there<00:02:15.020> I<00:02:15.170> shaped<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.770> horn<00:02:16.330> with<00:02:17.330> a

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
all there I shaped the horn with a

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.840 
all there I shaped the horn with a
grinding<00:02:17.810> wheel<00:02:17.989> and<00:02:18.260> then<00:02:18.800> I<00:02:18.830> sanded<00:02:19.459> it<00:02:19.700> all

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
grinding wheel and then I sanded it all

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.440 
grinding wheel and then I sanded it all
down<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.769> worked<00:02:21.769> my<00:02:21.980> way<00:02:22.160> up<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.550> 120<00:02:23.000> grit

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
down and worked my way up to 120 grit

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.650 
down and worked my way up to 120 grit
and<00:02:24.340> that's<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.489> finished<00:02:25.790> product<00:02:26.239> only

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
and that's the finished product only

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.150 
and that's the finished product only
thing<00:02:26.810> left<00:02:26.989> to<00:02:27.080> do<00:02:27.260> is<00:02:27.470> maybe<00:02:27.680> drill<00:02:28.010> a<00:02:28.040> couple

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
thing left to do is maybe drill a couple

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.750 
thing left to do is maybe drill a couple
holes<00:02:28.340> in<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.760> base<00:02:28.940> so<00:02:29.900> I<00:02:29.959> can<00:02:30.170> mount<00:02:30.290> it

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.180 

looks<00:02:34.760> pretty<00:02:35.030> good
