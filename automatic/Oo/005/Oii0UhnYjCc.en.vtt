00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790

of these two things the spin divided by
the<00:02:46.830> speed<00:02:48.410> mrs.<00:02:49.410> McGillicutty<00:02:50.070> always<00:02:50.400> told

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
the speed mrs. McGillicutty always told

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.100 
the speed mrs. McGillicutty always told
you<00:02:50.820> or<00:02:51.000> should<00:02:51.270> have<00:02:51.360> always<00:02:51.510> told<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:51.930> that

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
you or should have always told you that

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.780 
you or should have always told you that
if<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.710> carry<00:02:53.010> through<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.310> units<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.760> can

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
if you carry through the units you can

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.280 
if you carry through the units you can
get<00:02:54.060> some<00:02:54.240> insight<00:02:54.570> so<00:02:54.780> if<00:02:54.870> we<00:02:54.959> look<00:02:55.110> at<00:02:55.200> the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
get some insight so if we look at the

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.020 
get some insight so if we look at the
ratio<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.830> spin<00:02:56.070> to<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.310> speeds<00:02:56.610> been

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
ratio of the spin to the speeds been

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.360 
ratio of the spin to the speeds been
divided<00:02:57.450> by<00:02:57.480> speed<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.770> can<00:02:58.890> see<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.220> that

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
divided by speed you can see that that

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.730 
divided by speed you can see that that
is<00:02:59.430> measured<00:03:00.090> in<00:03:00.209> revolution<00:03:00.959> per<00:03:01.230> diamond<00:03:01.440> so

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
is measured in revolution per diamond so

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.260 
is measured in revolution per diamond so
how<00:03:01.860> many<00:03:02.010> revolutions<00:03:02.160> does<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.850> ball<00:03:03.000> take

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
how many revolutions does the ball take

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.330 
how many revolutions does the ball take
or<00:03:03.420> what<00:03:03.480> fraction<00:03:03.900> of<00:03:03.990> a<00:03:04.080> revolution<00:03:04.650> in<00:03:04.800> the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
or what fraction of a revolution in the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.490 
or what fraction of a revolution in the
last<00:03:05.550> time<00:03:05.760> traveled<00:03:06.330> before<00:03:06.900> hitting<00:03:07.170> the

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
last time traveled before hitting the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.590 
last time traveled before hitting the
cushion<00:03:08.070> that<00:03:08.610> is<00:03:08.670> what<00:03:09.090> determines<00:03:09.209> the

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
cushion that is what determines the

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.839 
cushion that is what determines the
action<00:03:09.959> off<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.260> rail

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:15.309 

so<00:03:13.849> the<00:03:13.970> spin<00:03:14.209> to<00:03:14.239> speed<00:03:14.569> ratio<00:03:15.019> is<00:03:15.200> actually

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
so the spin to speed ratio is actually

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.990 
so the spin to speed ratio is actually
what<00:03:15.650> most<00:03:15.769> players<00:03:16.069> mean<00:03:16.459> when<00:03:16.730> they<00:03:16.819> talk

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
what most players mean when they talk

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.509 
what most players mean when they talk
about<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.420> amount<00:03:17.659> of<00:03:17.750> spin<00:03:18.159> if<00:03:19.159> you<00:03:19.310> hit<00:03:19.430> with

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
about the amount of spin if you hit with

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.520 
about the amount of spin if you hit with
a<00:03:19.580> certain<00:03:19.879> offset<00:03:20.330> and<00:03:20.569> you<00:03:20.750> just<00:03:20.930> hit<00:03:21.080> harder

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
a certain offset and you just hit harder

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.500 
a certain offset and you just hit harder
what<00:03:21.830> you<00:03:21.920> do<00:03:22.069> is<00:03:22.159> you<00:03:22.280> increase<00:03:22.549> the<00:03:22.909> spin<00:03:23.209> can

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
what you do is you increase the spin can

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.300 
what you do is you increase the spin can
you<00:03:23.629> increase<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.140> speed<00:03:24.260> both<00:03:24.739> by<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.040> same

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
you increase the speed both by the same

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.589 
you increase the speed both by the same
amount<00:03:25.580> of<00:03:25.819> course<00:03:26.030> we<00:03:26.150> buy<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:26.330> same<00:03:26.540> amount

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
amount of course we buy the same amount

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.030 
amount of course we buy the same amount
and<00:03:26.959> you<00:03:27.019> don't<00:03:27.170> change<00:03:27.409> the<00:03:27.650> spin<00:03:27.860> speed

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
and you don't change the spin speed

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.039 
and you don't change the spin speed
ratio<00:03:28.580> if<00:03:29.030> you<00:03:29.150> want<00:03:29.330> to<00:03:29.390> change<00:03:29.569> the<00:03:29.720> spin<00:03:29.900> to

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
ratio if you want to change the spin to

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.589 
ratio if you want to change the spin to
speed<00:03:30.260> ratio<00:03:30.680> you<00:03:31.400> have<00:03:31.430> to<00:03:31.790> increase<00:03:32.239> the

speed ratio you have to increase the

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:34.600 
speed ratio you have to increase the
spin<00:03:33.140> without<00:03:33.379> a<00:03:33.530> commensurate<00:03:34.099> increase<00:03:34.220> in

here<00:03:53.599> if<00:03:53.750> we<00:03:53.900> can<00:03:54.079> reduce<00:03:54.410> the<00:03:54.950> speed<00:03:55.160> without

on<00:03:57.769> the<00:03:57.950> rail<00:03:59.319> these<00:04:00.319> two<00:04:00.530> ways<00:04:00.680> to<00:04:00.859> do<00:04:01.010> that

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
on the rail these two ways to do that

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.490 
on the rail these two ways to do that
one<00:04:01.430> is<00:04:01.579> to<00:04:01.700> hit<00:04:01.819> a<00:04:01.849> drag<00:04:02.209> or<00:04:02.510> a<00:04:02.569> drag<00:04:02.810> draw<00:04:03.170> shot

one is to hit a drag or a drag draw shot

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.559 
one is to hit a drag or a drag draw shot
where<00:04:03.680> you<00:04:03.709> hit<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:03.980> cue<00:04:04.160> ball<00:04:04.190> low<00:04:04.579> and<00:04:04.910> then

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
where you hit the cue ball low and then

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.240 
where you hit the cue ball low and then

bottom rail in a different way in a

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.510 
bottom rail in a different way in a
moment<00:04:36.950> you're<00:04:37.070> going<00:04:37.160> to<00:04:37.250> see<00:04:37.400> an

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
moment you're going to see an

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.830 
moment you're going to see an
interesting<00:04:37.970> effect<00:04:38.270> off<00:04:38.479> the<00:04:38.870> bottom<00:04:39.169> rail

interesting effect off the bottom rail

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.300 
interesting effect off the bottom rail
so<00:04:41.840> notice<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.260> path<00:04:42.440> into<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:42.740> bottom<00:04:43.070> rail

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
so notice the path into the bottom rail

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.070 
so notice the path into the bottom rail
is<00:04:43.610> exactly<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.360> same<00:04:44.539> as<00:04:44.660> it<00:04:44.750> was<00:04:44.870> before

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
is exactly the same as it was before

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.140 
is exactly the same as it was before
years<00:04:45.470> now<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.770> B<00:04:45.950> path<00:04:46.160> was<00:04:46.490> the<00:04:46.520> a<00:04:46.669> path<00:04:46.970> but

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
years now the B path was the a path but

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.060 
years now the B path was the a path but
it's<00:04:47.270> exactly<00:04:47.690> the<00:04:47.840> same<00:04:48.050> but<00:04:48.260> off<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.800> bottom

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
it's exactly the same but off the bottom
