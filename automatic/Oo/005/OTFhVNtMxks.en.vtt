00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
that a developer like epic actually

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.759 
that a developer like epic actually
knows<00:03:15.700> what<00:03:15.970> they're<00:03:16.150> doing<00:03:16.290> yeah<00:03:17.290> actually

and I think you'll get to see the
evidence<00:03:24.100> that<00:03:24.370> is<00:03:24.570> what<00:03:25.570> Epic<00:03:25.840> Games<00:03:25.870> brings

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
evidence that is what Epic Games brings

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.430 
evidence that is what Epic Games brings
to<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.680> table<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:27.660> I've<00:03:28.660> been<00:03:28.780> sort<00:03:29.019> of<00:03:29.110> I

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
to the table and I've been sort of I

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.650 
to the table and I've been sort of I
guess<00:03:29.470> talking<00:03:30.130> to<00:03:30.220> you<00:03:30.370> guys<00:03:30.519> about<00:03:30.820> you<00:03:31.540> know

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
guess talking to you guys about you know

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.050 
guess talking to you guys about you know
developers<00:03:32.320> these<00:03:32.650> days<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:33.220> how<00:03:33.310> games<00:03:33.700> just

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
developers these days and how games just

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.390 
developers these days and how games just
seem<00:03:34.269> stale<00:03:34.810> in<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.470> whole<00:03:35.590> shooter<00:03:35.920> market

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
seem stale in the whole shooter market

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.940 
seem stale in the whole shooter market
but<00:03:37.120> I<00:03:37.390> think<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.050> two<00:03:38.200> companies<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:38.830> are

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
but I think the two companies that are

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.259 
but I think the two companies that are
going<00:03:39.070> to<00:03:39.130> stand<00:03:39.430> out<00:03:39.550> are<00:03:39.730> going<00:03:39.850> to<00:03:39.910> be<00:03:40.030> dice

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
to find the balance between the I guess

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.000 
to find the balance between the I guess
a<00:03:57.550> gameplay<00:03:58.450> movement<00:03:59.019> of<00:03:59.140> the<00:03:59.170> first<00:03:59.560> gear

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
a gameplay movement of the first gear

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.120 
a gameplay movement of the first gear
gears<00:04:00.970> and<00:04:01.300> then<00:04:01.540> also<00:04:02.019> find<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.769> balance<00:04:02.920> in
