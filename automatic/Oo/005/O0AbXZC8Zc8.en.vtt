00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:11.739
 attention now begins the material should 

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:14.349
 via high school you will attend 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:16.509
 the screen is number 20 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:18.439
 good studies 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.439
 a good deed is not the mistake 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.039
 and Midle 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.210
 1 boy 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.210
 The lawyer 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.949
 O 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.310
 and I want success 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.190
 not 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.700
 that's why I like what happened 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.330
 It's not the moment 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.870
 saulo 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.280
 There was a way for the sociologist that you should not think of living underneath. 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.420
 of salt 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.870
 where do you take to the end of the show? 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.890
 the mother was short and thick 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.970
 still on sunday 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.179
 however do you find sunscreens suntan in the daytime? 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:04.600
 I'm the filter 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.149
 what each one has a foot and clarinet I'm afraid of the sun's rays 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.020
 if you use sunscreens the tan in day 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.190
 what option 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.990
 mo weight on the skin 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.600
 chocolate the cell phone 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.980
 the field will protect to pm 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.250
 and you have any idea how salt does our part 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.600
 they want to be 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.400
 and more will be that excess salt such a really problem of our skin 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.900
 to answer 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.390
 these and other questions on the screen today you will know the structure of the skin 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.590
 human will see the functions of each of its layers gets to know how social 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.590
 affects our land 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.480
 the skin is one of the biggest tormentors of the human being, weighing up to 16% of the 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.030
 our total piece 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.690
 for example a 70-pound person 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.240
 paige the matter that comes to weigh until about to being kilo but it will be that 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.890
 even he uses this invisible layer 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.310
 the attachment is made up of two layers to ibm 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:17.619
 the epidemic that layer that what we can improve but fine 

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:22.519
 and the brutality of staying one more day of mourning in the chamber but these but if you 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.919
 when you realize that the thickness of the skin varies greatly in the different 

00:02:27.919 --> 00:02:29.719
 body regions 

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.730
 with the thickest skin of the palm and arm 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.799
 an ankle palm 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.799
 there I think in the palm of the hand the date of the birth 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.719
 That's right up there from the palm of the hand is much more graceful than the arm 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:48.680
 In fact the epidermis can vary in thickness from 0 to 5 mm by 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.079
 4 millimeters 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:54.569
 depend on the region of the body a bm also varies in thickness depend on the 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.489
 body region 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.139
 but it is a given that your body 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.929
 at least with the boys 

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:05.309
 they were all born 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:08.639
 everything suggests that the tool 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:11.429
 today the city of escobar and nunes 

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:16.139
 she is my friend to kleber the current hard-working business prime minister 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:18.919
 time you do not know 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:21.430
 it is explained is a complete structure 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.990
 because they are directly linked covered of sanasa square pr 

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:31.359
 in the beginning the little ones the mother the rapporteur of the adi barash 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:35.649
 and they still have three more points she has helped me he will have the function of 

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:39.089
 investigating the fall since October 2001 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:43.710
 now that you already know what are the layers of skin attached structures 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.450
 let us know better the idea that it is formed by three low layers 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.909
 the cornelia chamber 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:52.839
 the spinous layer 

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:55.189
 and germ bedding 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:04:00.049
 the germinative layer is composed of players cells of the layers 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:05.559
 superior to the epidermis of the dermis, the desire formed by a line of 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:08.980
 cells with intense concerted diplomatic activity 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.069
 it is in constant cell division 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.829
 since its function is precisely to form the outermost layers of the epidemic 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.690
 each germ layer is so intense that 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.440
 idea and is renewed every 30 days, compensating for the constant 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.009
 horny layer 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:29.409
 that here 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:30.729
 grandson, is there 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.389
 water does not enter or leave the body for good skin inside the cut there is a lot of 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:40.610
 water that can only leave the epidermis through the birds of the glands of the 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.830
 solar 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.169
 from there it is that one of them came out of the water of the body 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.930
 also prevents many compounds from being put in first is the 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.680
 layer that the intermediate layer of the epidemic 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.389
 it is composed of living cells it produces impermeable substances in a 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.689
 when the water leaves the body 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:06.149
 the outermost horny layer of 2010 is composed of dead cells that it 

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:07.270
 reach areas 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:12.509
 even it has several functions one of them is protection against 30 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:17.319
 Imagine that you would hold this simple microphone if you did not have it 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:20.270
 The book comes from my hand. 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:24.530
 another function of tile protection against harmful radiation action 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:26.490
 ultraviolet sun 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.900
 and counts the loss of body fluids 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.520
 even he also participates in the production of vitamin d 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.629
 besides collaborating 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:38.979
 with body temperature control systems to perform all of these 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:40.189
 functions 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:43.249
 the epidermis has the child's open structures 

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:48.789
 as the recycling of East Asia cica sweat glands and hairs 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.789
 How do we do exercises for example? 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:56.960
 the sweat glands increased their activity avoiding the increase of 

00:05:56.959 --> 00:06:01.699
 body temperature knows how it happens when it reaches the surface of the 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:05.849
 skin the user gets off doing lower body temperature 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.580
 in turn functions as a body cooling system 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.979
 in addition to eliminating a small discrete amount as you have seen and another 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:16.050
 by class 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.999
 already the defender sebÃ¡ did normally are related to the first 

00:06:19.999 --> 00:06:24.169
 the secretion of these bands which is a greasy mixture has as functions 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:29.279
 protect the epidermis' against friction protect against excess of 

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:33.929
 peeling of the stratum corneum and still not beneficial in the planes avoiding that they 

00:06:33.929 --> 00:06:35.949
 want with ease 

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:40.389
 the sebaceous glands are distributed throughout the body part 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:43.619
 - in the palm of the hand on the sole of the feet 

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:45.010
 the industry passes 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:48.010
 colombia - stated the nose 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.580
 to achieve peak quality co olympiacos 

00:06:55.319 --> 00:06:58.319
 ps know what you're doing here in 

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:01.240
 it is not that the judge 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.240
 besides not letting the rapper eminem it is impossible 

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:08.749
 in the previous edition of the brand to increasingly hit 

00:07:09.999 --> 00:07:12.889
 Look at my city. 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:13.590
 single
