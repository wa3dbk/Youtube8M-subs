 affiliated with the w w since it has been 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.389
 discarded from the official roster and 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.000
 subsequently transferred to the section 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.920
 alumni to stay point and you are sure that 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.740
 the bread contract with the company 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.810
 would expire this month and next to this 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.990
 he also stated that it is unlikely that 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.000
 re-renew said contract although 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.160
 is eager to start a new 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.490
 chapter in his life and so he did know 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.170
 himself via twitter to his fans 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:35.250
 starting a band a podcast and a 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.780
 dismissal one of them is true good 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.930
 two 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.329

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:50.969
 platform www ccm punk posted a couple 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.479
 of messages on twitter regarding your 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.729
 situation I have blocked the negativity 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:01:01.049
 both in life and on twitter if not 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:03.600

 I do not know about you but I'm still 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.070
 thinking that I will pan that will come back in 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.440
 a future not too far from the company 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.750
 but already in another video I will speak more clearly 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.940
 about this matter and what I believe and it is not 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.280
 for holding on to me and not being able to stand 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.830
 punk will leave the company to give me what 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.720

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.350

 starting a band a podcast and a 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.640
