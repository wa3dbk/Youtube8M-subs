anything it is pretty bad and that's not
just<00:00:40.500> because<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.890> extended<00:00:41.280> mags<00:00:41.399> but

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
just because of the extended mags but

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.850 
just because of the extended mags but
also<00:00:41.730> for<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> couple<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.450> reasons<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.960> I<00:00:43.260> will

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.980 
your magazine and that does not give you
a<00:01:43.439> whole<00:01:43.680> lot<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.070> room<00:01:44.220> for<00:01:44.250> air<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.119> for<00:01:45.869> me

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
a whole lot of room for air so for me

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.749 
a whole lot of room for air so for me
personally<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.590> was<00:01:46.890> only<00:01:47.159> able<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.399> take<00:01:47.579> out

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
personally I was only able to take out

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.600 
personally I was only able to take out
two<00:01:48.299> targets<00:01:48.770> technically<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.220> take<00:01:50.430> out

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
two targets technically you can take out

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.880 
two targets technically you can take out
more<00:01:50.880> but<00:01:51.600> you're<00:01:51.689> gonna<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.049> be<00:01:52.439> very

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
more but you're gonna have to be very

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.410 
more but you're gonna have to be very
conservative<00:01:53.340> with<00:01:53.670> all<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.060> your<00:01:54.180> ammunition

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
conservative with all of your ammunition

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.170 
conservative with all of your ammunition
and<00:01:54.869> once<00:01:55.470> or<00:01:55.649> twice<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:56.159> was<00:01:56.430> able<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:56.850> take<00:01:57.000> out

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
and once or twice I was able to take out

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.990 
and once or twice I was able to take out
three<00:01:57.360> targets<00:01:57.840> with<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.770> one<00:01:59.009> magazine<00:01:59.280> of

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
three targets with just one magazine of

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.480 
three targets with just one magazine of
what<00:02:00.240> 20<00:02:00.570> bullets<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:01.170> not<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> lot<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.369> when

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
what 20 bullets is not a lot and when

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.859 
what 20 bullets is not a lot and when
you<00:02:02.549> get<00:02:02.640> into<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> tight<00:02:03.090> spot<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.689> are

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
you get into a tight spot and you are

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.389 
you get into a tight spot and you are
you<00:02:04.200> know<00:02:04.320> someone's<00:02:04.740> two<00:02:04.950> feet<00:02:05.159> away<00:02:05.280> from

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
you know someone's two feet away from

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.429 
you know someone's two feet away from
you<00:02:05.670> you<00:02:06.149> usually<00:02:06.390> want<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.869> make<00:02:07.020> sure<00:02:07.229> that

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
you you usually want to make sure that

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.960 
you you usually want to make sure that
the<00:02:07.560> target<00:02:07.740> is<00:02:07.950> dead<00:02:08.129> so<00:02:08.340> you'll<00:02:08.520> you'll

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
the target is dead so you'll you'll

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.190 
the target is dead so you'll you'll
squeeze<00:02:09.300> for<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.479> little<00:02:09.629> bit<00:02:09.720> longer<00:02:09.840> than<00:02:10.110> you

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
squeeze for a little bit longer than you

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.600 
squeeze for a little bit longer than you
normally<00:02:10.319> should<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.819> results<00:02:12.390> in

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
normally should and that results in

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:14.670 
normally should and that results in
you<00:02:12.760> know<00:02:12.880> less<00:02:13.360> time<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.960> take<00:02:14.290> someone<00:02:14.560> else

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
you know less time to take someone else

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.580 
you know less time to take someone else
out<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.160> so<00:02:15.430> this<00:02:15.610> results<00:02:16.150> in<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.600> lot<00:02:17.110> of

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
out and so this results in a lot of

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.580 
out and so this results in a lot of
reloading<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.670> while<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.480> pp-2000<00:02:20.380> doesn't

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
reloading and while the pp-2000 doesn't

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.820 
reloading and while the pp-2000 doesn't
have<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:21.670> worst<00:02:22.150> reload<00:02:22.690> time<00:02:22.960> it's<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.770> takes

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
have the worst reload time it's it takes

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.610 
have the worst reload time it's it takes
a<00:02:24.250> substantial<00:02:24.850> amount<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.780> short<00:02:26.110> reload<00:02:26.410> is

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
a substantial amount the short reload is

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.650 
a substantial amount the short reload is
two<00:02:26.920> point<00:02:27.250> four<00:02:27.550> five<00:02:27.880> seconds<00:02:28.420> but<00:02:28.510> it's

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
two point four five seconds but it's

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.050 
two point four five seconds but it's
long<00:02:28.900> reload<00:02:29.470> time<00:02:29.740> is<00:02:29.980> three<00:02:30.580> point<00:02:30.850> four

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
long reload time is three point four

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.360 
long reload time is three point four
five<00:02:31.240> which<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.720> was<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.320> really<00:02:32.950> really<00:02:33.220> bad

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
five which is was it really really bad

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.940 
five which is was it really really bad
and<00:02:33.580> so<00:02:33.670> what<00:02:34.270> I<00:02:34.300> found<00:02:34.720> during<00:02:35.110> my<00:02:35.680> play

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
and so what I found during my play

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.430 
and so what I found during my play
session<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.520> that<00:02:37.060> because<00:02:37.660> I<00:02:37.750> only<00:02:37.900> had<00:02:38.140> 20

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
session is that because I only had 20

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.560 
session is that because I only had 20
rounds<00:02:38.800> I<00:02:38.950> had<00:02:39.459> to<00:02:39.610> make<00:02:39.760> sure<00:02:39.790> that<00:02:40.000> every

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
rounds I had to make sure that every

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.540 
rounds I had to make sure that every
time<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:41.110> got<00:02:41.440> into<00:02:41.680> a<00:02:41.709> fight<00:02:42.010> I<00:02:42.160> was<00:02:42.310> always

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
time I got into a fight I was always

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.390 
time I got into a fight I was always
reloading<00:02:43.240> before<00:02:43.600> my<00:02:44.200> entire<00:02:44.530> magazine<00:02:44.920> was

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
reloading before my entire magazine was

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.970 
reloading before my entire magazine was
out<00:02:45.610> because<00:02:45.820> if<00:02:46.330> I<00:02:46.510> didn't<00:02:47.050> going<00:02:47.620> through

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
out because if I didn't going through

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
out because if I didn't going through
the<00:02:48.130> 3.4<00:02:48.820> 3.4<00:02:49.630> 5<00:02:49.930> seconds<00:02:50.440> took<00:02:50.950> forever<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:51.880> I

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
the 3.4 3.4 5 seconds took forever and I

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.600 
the 3.4 3.4 5 seconds took forever and I
was<00:02:52.120> leaving<00:02:52.450> myself<00:02:52.840> very<00:02:53.020> exposed<00:02:53.470> not<00:02:54.400> only

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
was leaving myself very exposed not only

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.430 
was leaving myself very exposed not only
that<00:02:54.820> but<00:02:55.060> another<00:02:55.300> reason<00:02:55.750> why<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:55.930> feel<00:02:56.380> like

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
that but another reason why I feel like

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.500 
that but another reason why I feel like
this<00:02:56.860> weapon<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.400> kind<00:02:57.610> of<00:02:57.700> held<00:02:57.880> back<00:02:58.060> is<00:02:58.300> that

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
this weapon is kind of held back is that

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.500 
this weapon is kind of held back is that
has<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.810> very<00:02:59.410> slow<00:02:59.800> rpm<00:03:00.300> personal<00:03:01.300> defense

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
has a very slow rpm personal defense

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.110 
has a very slow rpm personal defense
weapons<00:03:01.900> just<00:03:02.230> like<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.560> pp-2000<00:03:03.550> are<00:03:03.670> meant

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
weapons just like the pp-2000 are meant

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.699 
weapons just like the pp-2000 are meant
for<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.360> close-range<00:03:04.840> combat<00:03:04.959> and<00:03:05.530> when<00:03:05.650> you

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
for a close-range combat and when you

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.850 
for a close-range combat and when you
only<00:03:05.830> have<00:03:06.300> 650<00:03:07.300> rounds<00:03:07.690> per<00:03:07.900> minute<00:03:08.110> trying

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
only have 650 rounds per minute trying

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.260 
only have 650 rounds per minute trying
to<00:03:08.950> take<00:03:09.130> someone<00:03:09.430> out<00:03:09.550> when<00:03:09.760> they're<00:03:10.000> using

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
to take someone out when they're using

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.260 
to take someone out when they're using
the<00:03:10.540> f2000<00:03:11.320> or<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.530> AEK<00:03:12.040> can<00:03:12.730> be<00:03:12.940> a<00:03:12.970> little

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
the f2000 or the AEK can be a little

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.600 
the f2000 or the AEK can be a little
challenging<00:03:13.390> and<00:03:14.140> so<00:03:14.260> what<00:03:14.410> I<00:03:14.440> found<00:03:15.010> myself

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
challenging and so what I found myself

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.030 
challenging and so what I found myself
doing<00:03:15.910> was<00:03:16.810> kind<00:03:17.110> of<00:03:17.230> taken<00:03:17.560> things<00:03:17.739> a<00:03:17.920> little

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
doing was kind of taken things a little

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.130 
doing was kind of taken things a little
slow<00:03:18.430> I<00:03:18.459> I<00:03:18.700> had<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.239> take<00:03:19.390> it<00:03:19.540> slow<00:03:19.720> because<00:03:19.930> I

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
slow I I had to take it slow because I

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.420 
slow I I had to take it slow because I
could<00:03:20.290> only<00:03:20.440> take<00:03:20.620> out<00:03:20.799> a<00:03:20.830> couple<00:03:21.070> of<00:03:21.220> targets

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
could only take out a couple of targets

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.400 
could only take out a couple of targets
but<00:03:22.000> not<00:03:22.120> only<00:03:22.239> that<00:03:22.510> but<00:03:22.630> I<00:03:22.690> always<00:03:22.989> felt<00:03:23.290> like

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
but not only that but I always felt like

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.199 
but not only that but I always felt like
I<00:03:23.620> needed<00:03:24.040> to<00:03:24.190> know<00:03:24.400> where<00:03:24.580> the<00:03:24.670> target<00:03:25.030> was

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
I needed to know where the target was

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:26.820 
I needed to know where the target was
and<00:03:25.480> then<00:03:25.570> kind<00:03:25.750> of<00:03:25.810> take<00:03:26.019> them<00:03:26.200> by<00:03:26.350> surprise

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
and then kind of take them by surprise

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.770 
and then kind of take them by surprise
quickly<00:03:27.549> take<00:03:27.730> them<00:03:27.910> out<00:03:28.060> with<00:03:28.299> the<00:03:28.570> nice

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
quickly take them out with the nice

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.660 
quickly take them out with the nice
accuracy<00:03:29.410> of<00:03:29.500> I<00:03:29.560> mean<00:03:29.709> the<00:03:30.010> recoil<00:03:30.400> is<00:03:30.519> very

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
accuracy of I mean the recoil is very

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.460 
accuracy of I mean the recoil is very
manageable<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.299> it's<00:03:31.660> easy<00:03:31.959> to<00:03:32.140> get<00:03:32.260> headshots

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
manageable so it's easy to get headshots

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.470 
manageable so it's easy to get headshots
with<00:03:32.799> it<00:03:33.070> but<00:03:33.459> then<00:03:33.610> quickly<00:03:33.820> duck<00:03:34.150> behind

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
with it but then quickly duck behind

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.810 
with it but then quickly duck behind
cover<00:03:34.690> reload<00:03:35.230> again<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.769> then<00:03:35.920> go<00:03:36.190> about<00:03:36.549> my

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
cover reload again and then go about my

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.300 
cover reload again and then go about my
day<00:03:36.880> trying<00:03:37.360> to<00:03:37.510> find<00:03:37.840> my<00:03:38.140> next<00:03:38.380> target<00:03:38.620> but

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
day trying to find my next target but

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:41.520 
day trying to find my next target but
because<00:03:39.730> it<00:03:40.000> only<00:03:40.090> has<00:03:40.360> 650<00:03:41.200> rounds<00:03:41.350> per

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
because it only has 650 rounds per

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.530 
because it only has 650 rounds per
minute<00:03:41.739> there<00:03:42.310> were<00:03:42.519> so<00:03:42.760> many<00:03:42.880> situations

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
minute there were so many situations

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.390 
minute there were so many situations
that<00:03:43.600> I<00:03:43.690> was<00:03:43.810> like<00:03:43.930> if<00:03:44.049> I<00:03:44.080> was<00:03:44.470> using<00:03:44.890> any<00:03:45.220> other

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
that I was like if I was using any other

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.420 
that I was like if I was using any other
weapon<00:03:46.060> I<00:03:46.239> would<00:03:46.930> have<00:03:47.049> killed<00:03:47.230> them<00:03:47.470> no<00:03:48.070> you

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
weapon I would have killed them no you

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.550 
weapon I would have killed them no you
know<00:03:48.519> I<00:03:48.549> I<00:03:48.700> got<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.209> jump<00:03:49.540> but<00:03:49.810> simply<00:03:50.200> because

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
know I I got the jump but simply because

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.270 
know I I got the jump but simply because
they<00:03:51.130> were<00:03:51.190> using<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.880> f2000<00:03:52.630> they<00:03:53.200> won<00:03:53.830> that

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
they were using the f2000 they won that

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.800 
they were using the f2000 they won that
you<00:03:54.489> know<00:03:54.580> they<00:03:54.760> won<00:03:55.030> that<00:03:55.209> fight<00:03:55.450> and<00:03:55.660> that

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
you know they won that fight and that

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.009 
you know they won that fight and that
always<00:03:56.110> is<00:03:56.850> frustrating<00:03:57.850> but<00:03:58.510> but<00:03:58.810> don't

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
always is frustrating but but don't

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.289 
always is frustrating but but don't
don't<00:03:59.350> get<00:03:59.500> me<00:03:59.620> wrong<00:03:59.769> because<00:03:59.950> I<00:04:00.130> do<00:04:00.370> love<00:04:01.060> the

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
don't get me wrong because I do love the

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.840 
don't get me wrong because I do love the
pp-2000<00:04:02.230> it<00:04:02.380> is<00:04:02.500> a<00:04:02.530> lot<00:04:03.070> of<00:04:03.280> fun<00:04:03.489> to<00:04:03.670> use

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
pp-2000 it is a lot of fun to use

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.789 
pp-2000 it is a lot of fun to use
granted<00:04:04.660> there<00:04:04.840> are<00:04:04.989> some<00:04:05.230> things<00:04:05.440> holding<00:04:05.680> it

00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:05.799 
granted there are some things holding it

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:08.220 
granted there are some things holding it
back<00:04:05.950> it's<00:04:06.190> slow<00:04:06.549> rpm<00:04:07.060> the<00:04:07.330> fact<00:04:07.540> that<00:04:07.720> it<00:04:07.810> is<00:04:07.989> a

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
back it's slow rpm the fact that it is a

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.380 
back it's slow rpm the fact that it is a
close<00:04:08.500> encounter<00:04:08.680> weapon<00:04:09.250> that<00:04:09.670> combination

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
close encounter weapon that combination

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.600 
close encounter weapon that combination
really<00:04:10.720> doesn't<00:04:11.230> suit<00:04:11.500> itself<00:04:11.860> very<00:04:12.070> well<00:04:12.280> and

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
really doesn't suit itself very well and

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.190 
really doesn't suit itself very well and
the<00:04:12.970> fact<00:04:13.180> that<00:04:13.269> does<00:04:13.510> have<00:04:13.690> a<00:04:13.720> very<00:04:13.930> long

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
the fact that does have a very long

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.440 
the fact that does have a very long
reload<00:04:14.590> time<00:04:14.860> doesn't<00:04:15.700> make<00:04:15.850> things<00:04:16.090> great

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
reload time doesn't make things great

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.900 
reload time doesn't make things great
but<00:04:17.049> it<00:04:17.229> is<00:04:17.350> just<00:04:17.530> it's<00:04:17.859> a<00:04:17.979> fun<00:04:18.250> weapon<00:04:18.669> to<00:04:18.760> use

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
but it is just it's a fun weapon to use

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.250 
but it is just it's a fun weapon to use
and<00:04:19.120> one<00:04:19.239> of<00:04:19.299> the<00:04:19.390> things<00:04:19.570> I<00:04:19.660> like<00:04:19.900> about<00:04:19.930> it

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
and one of the things I like about it

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.810 
and one of the things I like about it
the<00:04:20.380> most<00:04:20.590> probably<00:04:21.039> and<00:04:21.250> I<00:04:21.280> know<00:04:21.370> this<00:04:21.520> may

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
the most probably and I know this may

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.790 
the most probably and I know this may
sound<00:04:22.000> a<00:04:22.090> little<00:04:22.120> silly<00:04:22.419> is<00:04:22.720> the<00:04:23.440> way<00:04:23.620> it

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
sound a little silly is the way it

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.050 
sound a little silly is the way it
sounds<00:04:24.460> and<00:04:24.610> battlefield<00:04:25.510> and

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
sounds and battlefield and

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.570 
sounds and battlefield and
nice<00:04:26.180> did<00:04:26.480> a<00:04:26.510> fantastic<00:04:27.260> job<00:04:27.889> with<00:04:27.950> the<00:04:28.160> audio

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
nice did a fantastic job with the audio

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.670 
nice did a fantastic job with the audio
especially<00:04:29.150> for<00:04:29.570> the<00:04:29.630> guns<00:04:29.810> in<00:04:29.960> this<00:04:30.050> game<00:04:30.260> but

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
especially for the guns in this game but

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.230 
especially for the guns in this game but
there<00:04:30.830> is<00:04:30.919> just<00:04:31.100> something<00:04:31.400> about<00:04:31.790> this

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
there is just something about this

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.870 
there is just something about this
weapon<00:04:32.510> that<00:04:32.960> resonates<00:04:33.470> me<00:04:33.590> I<00:04:34.010> love<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.730> way

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
weapon that resonates me I love the way

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.000 
weapon that resonates me I love the way
it<00:04:35.000> pops<00:04:35.270> it<00:04:35.600> just<00:04:36.110> it's<00:04:36.410> just<00:04:36.500> very

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
it pops it just it's just very

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:38.830 
it pops it just it's just very
satisfying<00:04:37.730> to<00:04:37.850> shoot<00:04:38.060> this<00:04:38.180> thing<00:04:38.240> and<00:04:38.570> to

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
satisfying to shoot this thing and to

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.470 
satisfying to shoot this thing and to
kill<00:04:39.050> people<00:04:39.230> so<00:04:39.770> you<00:04:40.070> know<00:04:40.190> yes<00:04:40.550> it<00:04:40.820> has<00:04:41.240> some

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
kill people so you know yes it has some

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.970 
kill people so you know yes it has some
things<00:04:41.690> holding<00:04:41.930> it<00:04:42.020> back<00:04:42.169> but<00:04:42.410> in<00:04:42.530> general

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
things holding it back but in general

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.129 
things holding it back but in general
this<00:04:43.190> setup<00:04:43.460> while<00:04:44.330> there<00:04:44.780> were<00:04:44.930> some

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:45.139 
this setup while there were some

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:46.690 
this setup while there were some
infuriating<00:04:45.800> moments<00:04:46.190> there<00:04:46.310> were<00:04:46.460> some

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
infuriating moments there were some

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.860 
infuriating moments there were some
times<00:04:46.910> where<00:04:47.090> I'll<00:04:47.150> just<00:04:47.270> like<00:04:47.450> come<00:04:47.660> on

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
times where I'll just like come on

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.010 
times where I'll just like come on
reload<00:04:48.380> faster<00:04:48.860> and<00:04:49.100> come<00:04:49.730> on<00:04:49.940> rpm<00:04:50.660> this<00:04:50.870> is<00:04:50.990> a

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
reload faster and come on rpm this is a

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.879 
reload faster and come on rpm this is a
little<00:04:51.260> ridiculous

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
little ridiculous

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.310 
little ridiculous
in<00:04:51.980> general<00:04:52.639> this<00:04:52.790> challenge<00:04:53.300> was<00:04:53.570> a<00:04:53.600> lot<00:04:54.169> of

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
in general this challenge was a lot of

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.470 
in general this challenge was a lot of
fun<00:04:54.470> and<00:04:54.710> I'm<00:04:54.800> glad<00:04:55.130> that<00:04:55.160> I<00:04:55.370> did<00:04:55.580> it<00:04:55.610> but<00:04:56.330> that

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
fun and I'm glad that I did it but that

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.930 
fun and I'm glad that I did it but that
is<00:04:56.690> about<00:04:56.870> it<00:04:57.050> for<00:04:57.230> today's<00:04:57.860> terrible<00:04:58.550> weapon
