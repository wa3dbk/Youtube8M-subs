they<00:02:17.830> were<00:02:17.950> rusted<00:02:18.340> in<00:02:18.460> there<00:02:18.580> pretty<00:02:18.760> damn

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
they were rusted in there pretty damn

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.750 
they were rusted in there pretty damn
well<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:20.040> these<00:02:21.040> a<00:02:21.130> little<00:02:21.280> too<00:02:21.370> much<00:02:21.520> force

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
well and these a little too much force

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.390 
well and these a little too much force
on<00:02:21.880> them<00:02:22.230> yeah<00:02:23.230> so<00:02:23.380> if<00:02:23.650> they<00:02:24.040> really<00:02:24.310> don't

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
on them yeah so if they really don't

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.660 
on them yeah so if they really don't
want<00:02:24.550> to<00:02:24.670> come<00:02:24.730> loose<00:02:25.020> it's<00:02:26.020> best<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.670> really

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
want to come loose it's best to really

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.390 
want to come loose it's best to really
not<00:02:27.790> touch<00:02:28.030> them<00:02:28.209> and<00:02:28.420> I'll<00:02:28.900> let<00:02:28.930> them<00:02:29.170> be<00:02:29.400> but

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
not touch them and I'll let them be but

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.430 
not touch them and I'll let them be but
so<00:02:31.270> now<00:02:31.480> we<00:02:31.780> run

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
so now we run

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.750 
so now we run
if<00:02:32.500> you're<00:02:32.740> lucky<00:02:32.860> again<00:02:33.070> just<00:02:33.370> pops<00:02:33.580> right

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
if you're lucky again just pops right

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.040 
if you're lucky again just pops right
off<00:02:33.990> this<00:02:34.990> one<00:02:35.610> looks<00:02:36.610> decent<00:02:36.850> enough<00:02:37.180> putting

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
off this one looks decent enough putting

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.590 
off this one looks decent enough putting
your<00:02:38.260> rotor<00:02:38.440> back<00:02:38.650> on<00:02:38.850> again<00:02:39.850> just<00:02:40.150> like<00:02:40.480> the

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
your rotor back on again just like the

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.260 
your rotor back on again just like the
Front's<00:02:40.900> you<00:02:40.990> want<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.230> go<00:02:41.320> ahead<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:42.270> clean

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
Front's you want to go ahead and clean

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.490 
Front's you want to go ahead and clean
off<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.420> oily<00:02:43.810> coating<00:02:44.140> that's<00:02:44.230> on<00:02:44.380> there

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
off the oily coating that's on there

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.800 
off the oily coating that's on there
otherwise<00:02:47.500> be<00:02:48.160> able<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.340> cry<00:02:48.600> let's<00:02:49.600> try<00:02:49.690> that

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
screw this piston back in you don't just

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.670 
screw this piston back in you don't just
push<00:03:41.819> it<00:03:41.940> in<00:03:42.000> like<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.239> Front's<00:03:42.569> what<00:03:43.410> you<00:03:43.530> do

push it in like the Front's what you do

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.140 
push it in like the Front's what you do
is<00:03:44.000> and<00:03:45.000> get<00:03:45.150> some<00:03:46.370> needle<00:03:47.370> nose<00:03:47.400> pliers<00:03:47.819> I

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
is and get some needle nose pliers I

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:49.370 
is and get some needle nose pliers I
don't<00:03:48.270> have<00:03:48.360> any<00:03:48.510> short<00:03:48.780> ones<00:03:48.930> here<00:03:49.140> for<00:03:49.260> some

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
don't have any short ones here for some

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.410 
don't have any short ones here for some
reason<00:03:49.680> some<00:03:49.800> musings<00:03:50.130> long<00:03:50.340> ones<00:03:50.520> and<00:03:51.060> you

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
reason some musings long ones and you

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.140 
reason some musings long ones and you
just<00:03:51.540> turn<00:03:51.750> it<00:03:51.870> this<00:03:51.959> calipers<00:03:52.380> seized<00:03:53.099> up<00:03:53.310> but

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
just turn it this calipers seized up but

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.720 
just turn it this calipers seized up but
you<00:03:54.510> stick<00:03:54.720> them<00:03:54.780> in<00:03:54.930> there<00:03:55.050> and<00:03:55.700> you<00:03:56.700> just

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
you stick them in there and you just

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.250 
you stick them in there and you just
rotate<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.360> piston<00:03:57.690> until<00:03:57.930> it<00:03:57.989> goes<00:03:58.080> in

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
rotate the piston until it goes in

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.580 
rotate the piston until it goes in
clockwise<00:03:59.810> until<00:04:00.810> it<00:04:00.989> fits<00:04:01.140> over<00:04:01.260> your<00:04:01.500> new

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
clockwise until it fits over your new

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.440 
clockwise until it fits over your new
pad<00:04:01.800> and<00:04:02.220> again<00:04:02.459> I'm<00:04:02.640> using<00:04:02.730> the<00:04:02.910> same<00:04:03.060> old<00:04:03.120> pad

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
pad and again I'm using the same old pad

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:11.710 
pad and again I'm using the same old pad
so<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.750> thickness<00:04:04.050> has<00:04:04.170> not<00:04:04.319> changed

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.840 

definitely<00:04:12.720> seized<00:04:12.959> up<00:04:13.140> you<00:04:14.100> put<00:04:14.340> it<00:04:14.430> back<00:04:14.670> in

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
definitely seized up you put it back in

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.150 
definitely seized up you put it back in
your<00:04:14.970> 14<00:04:15.390> millimeter<00:04:15.859> caliper<00:04:16.859> to<00:04:16.889> torque
