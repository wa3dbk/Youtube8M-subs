the<00:00:30.000> ipod<00:00:30.449> shuffle<00:00:30.900> i<00:00:31.050> guess<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
the ipod shuffle i guess this is the

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.080 
the ipod shuffle i guess this is the
fourth<00:00:31.830> generation<00:00:32.340> it<00:00:32.520> looks<00:00:32.730> similar<00:00:32.880> to

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
fourth generation it looks similar to

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.400 
fourth generation it looks similar to
the<00:00:33.180> second<00:00:33.480> generation<00:00:33.540> ipod<00:00:34.110> shuffle

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
the second generation ipod shuffle

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.930 
the second generation ipod shuffle
because<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.739> has<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:34.920> click<00:00:35.280> wheel<00:00:35.460> back<00:00:35.730> but

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
because it has that click wheel back but

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.310 
because it has that click wheel back but
now<00:00:36.120> it's<00:00:36.300> centered<00:00:36.660> instead<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.020> off-center

Apple TV that's pretty cool and the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
Apple TVs interface is not very

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.820 
Apple TVs interface is not very
different<00:03:16.930> than<00:03:16.990> what<00:03:17.140> it<00:03:17.230> used<00:03:17.260> to<00:03:17.530> be<00:03:17.560> it's

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
different than what it used to be it's

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.230 
different than what it used to be it's
somewhat<00:03:18.370> simplified<00:03:18.640> but<00:03:18.970> it's<00:03:19.120> still

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
somewhat simplified but it's still

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.820 
somewhat simplified but it's still
pretty<00:03:19.360> cool<00:03:19.600> but<00:03:19.990> personally<00:03:20.410> if<00:03:20.530> I<00:03:20.620> bought

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
pretty cool but personally if I bought

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.130 
pretty cool but personally if I bought
this<00:03:20.950> Apple<00:03:21.250> TV<00:03:21.490> which<00:03:21.670> I<00:03:21.910> might<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.360> probably

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
this Apple TV which I might I probably

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.810 
this Apple TV which I might I probably
be<00:03:23.470> streaming<00:03:23.800> all<00:03:24.010> my<00:03:24.130> content<00:03:24.460> from<00:03:24.640> my

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
be streaming all my content from my

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.220 
be streaming all my content from my
computer<00:03:25.240> because<00:03:25.420> you<00:03:25.660> knew<00:03:25.780> that<00:03:25.810> as<00:03:26.080> well

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
computer because you knew that as well

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.990 
computer because you knew that as well
so<00:03:26.260> you<00:03:26.440> can<00:03:26.560> actually<00:03:26.680> purchase<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.400> content

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
so you can actually purchase the content

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.360 
so you can actually purchase the content
and<00:03:28.090> then<00:03:28.450> stream<00:03:28.630> it<00:03:28.780> to<00:03:28.930> your<00:03:29.380> Apple<00:03:29.800> TV<00:03:29.830> our

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
and then stream it to your Apple TV our

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.470 
and then stream it to your Apple TV our
so<00:03:30.520> the<00:03:30.610> price<00:03:30.730> of<00:03:30.880> this<00:03:30.940> apple<00:03:31.240> TV<00:03:31.450> is

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
so the price of this apple TV is

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
so the price of this apple TV is
actually<00:03:31.810> quite<00:03:31.930> aggressive<00:03:32.380> they're

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
actually quite aggressive they're

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.650 
actually quite aggressive they're
actually<00:03:32.830> placing<00:03:33.130> it<00:03:33.220> at<00:03:33.310> $99<00:03:34.180> since<00:03:34.540> they

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
actually placing it at $99 since they

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.570 
actually placing it at $99 since they
originally<00:03:35.080> had<00:03:35.110> it<00:03:35.320> at<00:03:35.410> 299<00:03:36.010> people<00:03:36.460> thought

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
originally had it at 299 people thought

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.000 
originally had it at 299 people thought
that<00:03:36.640> was<00:03:36.820> too<00:03:36.940> aggressive<00:03:37.500> 199<00:03:38.500> which<00:03:38.710> people

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
that was too aggressive 199 which people

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.560 
that was too aggressive 199 which people
still<00:03:39.190> fighters<00:03:39.490> too<00:03:39.610> expensive<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.060> Apple<00:03:40.510> is

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
still fighters too expensive so Apple is

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.940 
still fighters too expensive so Apple is
dropped<00:03:40.780> it<00:03:40.900> right<00:03:41.020> down<00:03:41.170> to<00:03:41.380> ninety<00:03:41.800> nine

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
dropped it right down to ninety nine

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.470 
dropped it right down to ninety nine
dollars<00:03:42.250> which<00:03:42.610> i<00:03:42.670> think<00:03:42.730> is<00:03:42.880> pretty<00:03:43.090> cool<00:03:43.150> and

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
dollars which i think is pretty cool and

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.150 
dollars which i think is pretty cool and
I<00:03:43.840> will<00:03:44.050> probably<00:03:44.260> pick<00:03:44.530> one<00:03:44.770> up<00:03:44.890> for<00:03:45.040> myself

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160
