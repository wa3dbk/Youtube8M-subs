and so get away from that guys all I
basically<00:00:49.440> use<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.160> just<00:00:50.400> like<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> one<00:00:50.820> calorie

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120

other<00:01:34.770> sites<00:01:35.100> all<00:01:35.369> I'm<00:01:35.520> doing<00:01:35.790> I'm<00:01:35.880> just

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
other sites all I'm doing I'm just

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.510 
other sites all I'm doing I'm just
flattening<00:01:36.479> now<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.720> reason<00:01:37.200> why<00:01:37.619> we<00:01:38.010> do<00:01:38.220> this

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
flattening now the reason why we do this

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.390 
flattening now the reason why we do this
is<00:01:39.150> because<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.750> cook<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.530> lot<00:01:40.680> quicker<00:01:40.979> and

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
is because you cook it a lot quicker and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.060 
is because you cook it a lot quicker and
it<00:01:41.790> doesn't<00:01:42.119> actually<00:01:42.270> dry<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.560> fill<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:43.890> art

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
it doesn't actually dry the fill it art

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.130 
it doesn't actually dry the fill it art
