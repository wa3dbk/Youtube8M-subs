00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
can see big difference comes way up in

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.660 
can see big difference comes way up in
the<00:01:08.140> front<00:01:08.409> comes<00:01:08.740> up<00:01:08.890> on<00:01:09.040> the<00:01:09.159> sides<00:01:09.399> to

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
the front comes up on the sides to

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.719 
the front comes up on the sides to
protect<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.180> exhaust<00:01:11.219> goes<00:01:12.219> way<00:01:12.490> back

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
protect the exhaust goes way back

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.209 
protect the exhaust goes way back
further<00:01:13.060> and<00:01:14.579> look<00:01:15.579> at<00:01:15.670> the<00:01:15.729> dick<00:01:16.060> nasaan<00:01:16.479> this

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:17.219 
further and look at the dick nasaan this

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:23.160 
further and look at the dick nasaan this
this<00:01:18.219> compared<00:01:19.090> to<00:01:19.149> that<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:21.009> if<00:01:21.130> I<00:01:21.990> let's<00:01:22.990> just

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
this compared to that so if I let's just

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:32.469 
this compared to that so if I let's just
measure<00:01:23.409> it<00:01:24.990> got<00:01:25.990> this<00:01:26.200> calibrated

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:41.990 

okay<00:01:33.479> let's<00:01:33.810> measure<00:01:34.079> this

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:02:04.190 

just<00:01:44.540> 4.3

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:14.280 

two<00:02:05.200> point<00:02:05.590> five<00:02:06.750> it's<00:02:07.750> a<00:02:07.810> big<00:02:07.990> difference<00:02:13.290> all

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
two point five it's a big difference all

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.650
