and<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:54.230> 1800<00:00:55.230> I'm<00:00:55.739> not<00:00:55.980> sure<00:00:56.160> what<00:00:56.370> model

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
and the 1800 I'm not sure what model

and the 1800 I'm not sure what model
name<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.420> believe<00:00:57.480> that's<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.399> 110<00:00:59.399> I

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
name that is I believe that's the 110 I

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.959 
name that is I believe that's the 110 I
believe<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.050> then<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.379> s<00:01:01.559> 110<00:01:02.160> is<00:01:02.309> probably

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
believe and then the s 110 is probably

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.859 
believe and then the s 110 is probably
the<00:01:04.700> twelve<00:01:05.700> hundred<00:01:05.880> million<00:01:06.540> power<00:01:06.750> battery

the twelve hundred million power battery

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.109 
the twelve hundred million power battery
I<00:01:07.229> could<00:01:07.439> be<00:01:07.560> wrong<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:07.830> these<00:01:08.130> maybe<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.850> might

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
I could be wrong in these maybe I might

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.510 
I could be wrong in these maybe I might
put<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> correction<00:01:09.900> around<00:01:10.770> here<00:01:11.010> somewhere

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
put a correction around here somewhere

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.870

course you have to plug so that way this

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.050 
course you have to plug so that way this
piece<00:01:36.900> right<00:01:37.229> here<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.189> battery<00:01:38.640> well

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
piece right here and on the battery well

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.200 
piece right here and on the battery well
it's<00:01:40.049> make<00:01:40.619> contact<00:01:41.220> with<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.640> gold<00:01:41.939> point

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
right here so that way it'll start

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.740 
right here so that way it'll start
charging<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.549> then<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.119> course<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.479> just

over<00:02:01.290> here<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.530> actually<00:02:01.860> your<00:02:02.070> power

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
over here is actually your power

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.910 
over here is actually your power
connector<00:02:03.000> because<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.810> does<00:02:04.079> runs<00:02:04.469> on<00:02:04.710> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
connector because this does runs on the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.160 
connector because this does runs on the
wall<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:06.240> were<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.540> get<00:02:06.689> this<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:06.990> Amazon

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
wall and you were to get this on Amazon

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.940 
wall and you were to get this on Amazon
this<00:02:07.680> will<00:02:07.860> just<00:02:08.039> run<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.489> on<00:02:08.810> 18:11<00:02:09.830> but<00:02:10.830> if

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
this will just run you on 18:11 but if

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.430 
this will just run you on 18:11 but if
you<00:02:11.039> wanted<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.340> get<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:12.000> new<00:02:12.330> then<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.170> will<00:02:13.290> be

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
you wanted to get it new then it will be

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.730 
you wanted to get it new then it will be
$13.99<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.550> get<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> used<00:02:15.030> it<00:02:15.210> will<00:02:15.330> be<00:02:15.740> $19

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
$13.99 and to get a used it will be $19

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.830 
$13.99 and to get a used it will be $19
which<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:18.120> doesn't<00:02:18.390> make<00:02:18.450> sense<00:02:18.510> because

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
which that doesn't make sense because

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.900 
which that doesn't make sense because
use<00:02:19.560> parks<00:02:19.950> are<00:02:20.040> supposed<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.370> be<00:02:20.430> cheaper<00:02:20.640> but

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
use parks are supposed to be cheaper but

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.850 
use parks are supposed to be cheaper but
they're<00:02:21.120> actually<00:02:21.360> more<00:02:21.690> expensive<00:02:21.930> anyway<00:02:22.740> I

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
they're actually more expensive anyway I

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.810 
they're actually more expensive anyway I
don't<00:02:23.040> know<00:02:23.100> how<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.250> pricing<00:02:23.580> works<00:02:23.730> on

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
don't know how the pricing works on

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.320 
don't know how the pricing works on
Amazon<00:02:24.210> so<00:02:25.100> this<00:02:26.100> is<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> really<00:02:26.730> nice<00:02:26.880> battery

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
Amazon so this is a really nice battery

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.180 
Amazon so this is a really nice battery
charger<00:02:27.720> because<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.170> remember<00:02:28.500> when<00:02:28.740> I<00:02:28.770> was

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
charger because I remember when I was

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.510 
charger because I remember when I was
using<00:02:29.970> this<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.840> charge<00:02:31.140> this<00:02:31.470> now<00:02:32.070> I<00:02:32.100> got<00:02:32.490> a

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
using this to charge this now I got a

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.300 
using this to charge this now I got a
faster<00:02:32.940> charge<00:02:33.210> time<00:02:33.450> out<00:02:33.630> of<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.900> when<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.650> was

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
faster charge time out of it when I was

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.420 
faster charge time out of it when I was
just<00:02:35.610> using<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:37.080> regular<00:02:37.680> charger<00:02:38.160> right

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
just using the regular charger right

paper and crap on my desk right here
when<00:02:44.490> I<00:02:44.520> was<00:02:44.730> using<00:02:44.970> this<00:02:45.240> regular<00:02:45.660> charger

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
when I was using this regular charger

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.470 
when I was using this regular charger
right<00:02:46.230> here<00:02:46.530> this<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:47.130> a<00:02:47.160> regular<00:02:47.700> charger<00:02:48.090> you

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
right here this is a regular charger you

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.420 
right here this is a regular charger you
know<00:02:48.600> this<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:49.020> like<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.200> two<00:02:49.920> thousand

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
know this is like a two thousand

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.690 
know this is like a two thousand
milliamp<00:02:51.060> hour<00:02:51.480> AC<00:02:51.900> adapter<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:53.250> know<00:02:53.340> just<00:02:53.610> a

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
milliamp hour AC adapter you know just a

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.600 
milliamp hour AC adapter you know just a
regular<00:02:54.030> charger<00:02:54.240> that<00:02:54.570> came<00:02:54.750> with<00:02:54.810> my<00:02:54.930> PSP

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
regular charger that came with my PSP

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.690 
regular charger that came with my PSP
1000<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:56.960> hmm<00:02:57.960> that<00:02:58.380> thing<00:02:58.590> as<00:02:58.770> he<00:02:58.920> charges<00:02:59.550> a

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
1000 and hmm that thing as he charges a

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.670 
1000 and hmm that thing as he charges a
little<00:03:00.150> bit<00:03:00.270> slower<00:03:00.600> than<00:03:00.780> this<00:03:01.170> thing<00:03:01.440> right

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
little bit slower than this thing right

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.930 
little bit slower than this thing right
here<00:03:01.920> so<00:03:02.100> this<00:03:02.250> thing<00:03:02.460> you<00:03:02.580> won't<00:03:02.790> get<00:03:02.910> a

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
here so this thing you won't get a

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.660 
here so this thing you won't get a
faster<00:03:03.390> charge<00:03:03.660> time<00:03:03.930> on<00:03:04.140> here<00:03:04.410> so<00:03:04.890> that's<00:03:05.370> its

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
faster charge time on here so that's its

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.280 
faster charge time on here so that's its
purpose<00:03:06.060> for<00:03:07.610> this<00:03:08.610> device<00:03:09.060> right<00:03:09.330> here<00:03:09.390> now

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
purpose for this device right here now

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.070 
purpose for this device right here now
you're<00:03:10.920> good<00:03:11.210> when<00:03:12.210> you<00:03:12.420> get<00:03:12.570> your<00:03:12.750> device

actually folding a piece of paper and

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.360 
actually folding a piece of paper and
this<00:03:26.100> is<00:03:26.160> actually<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.590> user's<00:03:28.590> manual<00:03:29.100> for

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
the battery charger itself as well as a

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.110 
the battery charger itself as well as a
power<00:03:31.950> cord<00:03:32.280> now<00:03:32.400> you<00:03:32.459> won't<00:03:32.730> be<00:03:32.850> getting<00:03:33.090> a

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
power cord now you won't be getting a

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.490 
power cord now you won't be getting a
rubber<00:03:33.330> band<00:03:33.510> I<00:03:33.660> just<00:03:33.810> put<00:03:33.989> that<00:03:34.020> there<00:03:34.170> so

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
rubber band I just put that there so

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.210 
rubber band I just put that there so
it'll<00:03:35.190> stay<00:03:35.580> clean<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.180> won't<00:03:36.930> be<00:03:37.680> tangled

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
many feet this cable is but you can see

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.300 
many feet this cable is but you can see
this<00:03:42.420> is<00:03:42.540> a<00:03:42.570> regular<00:03:43.050> power<00:03:43.320> cord<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:43.920> then

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
this is a regular power cord and then

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.870 
this is a regular power cord and then
this<00:03:44.700> piece<00:03:45.239> right<00:03:45.450> here<00:03:45.510> is<00:03:45.750> to<00:03:46.700> plug<00:03:47.700> into

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
this piece right here is to plug into

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.640 
this piece right here is to plug into
this<00:03:48.239> part<00:03:48.600> of<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.840> battery<00:03:49.170> right<00:03:49.290> here<00:03:49.500> so

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
and now when I put that battery in pay

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.780 
and now when I put that battery in pay
attention<00:04:01.380> to<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.680> indicator<00:04:02.250> light<00:04:02.580> so

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
attention to the indicator light so

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.370 
attention to the indicator light so
here's<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.209> charge<00:04:03.510> indicator<00:04:03.690> right<00:04:04.140> here

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
here's the charge indicator right here

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.320 
here's the charge indicator right here
and<00:04:04.560> then<00:04:04.920> here's<00:04:05.160> my<00:04:05.310> battery<00:04:05.760> that<00:04:05.970> I'm<00:04:06.120> just

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
and then here's my battery that I'm just

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.600 
and then here's my battery that I'm just
going<00:04:06.420> to<00:04:06.510> put<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:06.989> in<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.380> then<00:04:08.010> it<00:04:08.370> should

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 
going to put it in and then it should

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:10.420 
going to put it in and then it should
turn<00:04:08.820> orange<00:04:09.150> so<00:04:09.540> as<00:04:09.660> you<00:04:09.780> can<00:04:09.900> see<00:04:09.959> it

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
turn orange so as you can see it

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.220 
turn orange so as you can see it
illuminates<00:04:11.430> orange<00:04:11.880> right<00:04:12.090> here<00:04:12.120> now<00:04:12.750> here's

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
illuminates orange right here now here's

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.290 
illuminates orange right here now here's
how<00:04:13.470> it<00:04:13.590> works<00:04:13.800> so<00:04:13.980> that<00:04:14.190> illuminates<00:04:14.970> orange

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
how it works so that illuminates orange

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.120 
how it works so that illuminates orange
that<00:04:15.420> means<00:04:15.630> it's<00:04:15.780> charging<00:04:16.169> when<00:04:16.620> it's<00:04:16.890> not

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
that means it's charging when it's not

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.550 
that means it's charging when it's not
illuminating<00:04:17.850> orange<00:04:18.209> so<00:04:18.450> it's<00:04:18.720> just<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:19.049> blank

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
illuminating orange so it's just a blank

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.300 
illuminating orange so it's just a blank
light<00:04:20.040> like<00:04:20.340> it's<00:04:20.580> black<00:04:20.970> well<00:04:22.100> then<00:04:23.100> that

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
light like it's black well then that

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.219 
light like it's black well then that
means<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.640> battery<00:04:24.060> is<00:04:24.210> completely<00:04:24.539> charged

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
means the battery is completely charged

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.090 
means the battery is completely charged
now<00:04:25.470> what<00:04:25.770> if<00:04:25.890> it<00:04:26.070> was<00:04:26.250> blinking

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.100 
now what if it was blinking

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.920 
now what if it was blinking
then<00:04:27.250> either<00:04:27.880> there's<00:04:28.240> something<00:04:28.600> wrong<00:04:28.780> with

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
then either there's something wrong with

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.630 
then either there's something wrong with
the<00:04:29.050> battery<00:04:29.470> charger<00:04:29.920> itself<00:04:30.220> or<00:04:30.460> there's

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
the battery charger itself or there's

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.250 
the battery charger itself or there's
something<00:04:30.910> wrong<00:04:31.240> with<00:04:31.450> the<00:04:31.690> battery<00:04:32.050> pack

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
something wrong with the battery pack

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.380 
something wrong with the battery pack
you<00:04:32.290> are<00:04:32.500> they're<00:04:33.220> trying<00:04:33.250> to<00:04:33.670> charge<00:04:34.060> for

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
you are they're trying to charge for

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.750 
you are they're trying to charge for
example<00:04:34.480> my<00:04:35.290> 1800<00:04:36.010> milliamp<00:04:36.460> hour<00:04:36.640> battery

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
example my 1800 milliamp hour battery

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.720 
example my 1800 milliamp hour battery
that<00:04:37.390> thing<00:04:37.690> got<00:04:37.870> defected<00:04:38.710> meaning<00:04:39.310> it<00:04:39.550> would

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
that thing got defected meaning it would

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.330 
that thing got defected meaning it would
just<00:04:39.970> run<00:04:40.840> on<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.140> power<00:04:41.350> after<00:04:41.650> 10<00:04:42.070> minutes

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
just run on the power after 10 minutes
