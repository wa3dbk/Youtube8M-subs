19<00:00:06.560> V<00:00:06.950> 11<00:00:07.399> now<00:00:07.819> let's<00:00:08.029> make<00:00:08.180> an<00:00:08.360> assumption

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:08.690 
19 V 11 now let's make an assumption

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.330 
19 V 11 now let's make an assumption
here<00:00:08.929> that<00:00:09.139> we've<00:00:09.349> divided<00:00:09.740> our<00:00:09.920> group<00:00:10.190> up

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
point on every rally that they win so it

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.970 
point on every rally that they win so it
starts<00:00:41.510> off<00:00:41.600> with<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:41.840> serve<00:00:42.079> so<00:00:42.769> you<00:00:42.829> can

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
starts off with the serve so you can

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.549 
starts off with the serve so you can
serve<00:00:43.219> there<00:00:43.820> on<00:00:43.940> 11<00:00:44.329> there<00:00:44.600> are<00:00:44.690> 19<00:00:45.140> and<00:00:45.260> it's
