00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.250
 now candles that show today 

00:00:03.209 --> 00:00:08.370
 I'm going to show you how to save a 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.090
 processor that is stuck without breaking it 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.820
 if a processor is stuck you can not 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.640
 install on a computer or not 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.910
 it's useless one of the reasons why 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.170
 which sticks the processor is because 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.840
 has an excess of silicone grease 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:31.500
 this is the case see all the surplus 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.440
 he has around to be able to take off 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.680
 we only need a dryer 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.380
 of hair and a very flat screwdriver 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.950
 fine the first thing we will do is warm 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:48.379
 for a few seconds the heatsink to not 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.379
 overheat the processor 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:59.829
 as we go heating up we 're going to 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:03.090
 apply a slight force to be able to take 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.090
 the process below 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.100
 and that is the result 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.380
 remember that I send you many greetings and 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.770
 kisses to the new subscribers of the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.770
