00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
of the heel that's where all the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
pressure needs to stay on your foot if

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.430 
pressure needs to stay on your foot if

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
pressure shifts to the toe then I

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.810 
pressure shifts to the toe then I
guarantee<00:02:33.830> if<00:02:33.950> you<00:02:34.070> look<00:02:34.190> at<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.400> top<00:02:34.670> the

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
guarantee if you look at the top the

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.060 
guarantee if you look at the top the
knees<00:02:34.970> have<00:02:35.120> come<00:02:35.300> forward<00:02:35.570> just<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:36.830> the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
knees have come forward just the the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.070 
knees have come forward just the the
quads<00:02:37.580> end<00:02:37.820> up<00:02:37.910> doing<00:02:38.120> most<00:02:38.240> of<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.480> work<00:02:38.540> so

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
quads end up doing most of the work so

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.020 
quads end up doing most of the work so
it's<00:02:39.890> very<00:02:40.160> very<00:02:40.460> important<00:02:40.790> to<00:02:40.880> maintain

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
it's very very important to maintain

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.450 
it's very very important to maintain
that<00:02:41.240> lateral<00:02:41.780> pressure<00:02:42.140> all<00:02:42.890> the<00:02:43.190> way<00:02:43.280> from

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
that lateral pressure all the way from

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.210 
that lateral pressure all the way from
picking<00:02:43.820> up<00:02:43.910> the<00:02:43.970> bar<00:02:44.300> to<00:02:44.660> squatting<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:45.920> even

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
picking up the bar to squatting to even

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.370 
picking up the bar to squatting to even
racking<00:02:46.640> it<00:02:46.760> as<00:02:47.300> long<00:02:47.510> as<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.750> hip<00:02:47.930> takes<00:02:48.170> most

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
racking it as long as the hip takes most

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.900 
racking it as long as the hip takes most
of<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.590> pressure<00:02:48.800> everything<00:02:49.280> works<00:02:49.700> in<00:02:49.850> the

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
of the pressure everything works in the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.090 
of the pressure everything works in the
integral<00:02:50.210> unit<00:02:50.540> so<00:02:51.170> this<00:02:51.380> is<00:02:51.590> dominant

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
integral unit so this is dominant

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.790 
integral unit so this is dominant
everything<00:02:52.970> works<00:02:53.210> if<00:02:53.960> something<00:02:54.380> else<00:02:54.500> takes

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
everything works if something else takes

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.760 
everything works if something else takes
it<00:02:55.010> it's<00:02:55.520> isolated<00:02:56.270> and<00:02:56.480> an<00:02:56.870> isolated<00:02:57.050> squat

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
it it's isolated and an isolated squat

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.060 
it it's isolated and an isolated squat
equals<00:02:58.220> high<00:02:58.370> injury<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:59.120> bad<00:02:59.300> form<00:02:59.770> the<00:03:00.770> next

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
equals high injury and bad form the next

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.010 
equals high injury and bad form the next
big<00:03:01.220> key<00:03:01.430> is<00:03:01.640> most<00:03:02.120> of<00:03:02.300> you<00:03:02.390> guys<00:03:02.540> will<00:03:02.900> not

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
big key is most of you guys will not

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.950 
big key is most of you guys will not
have<00:03:03.490> the<00:03:04.490> ability<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:04.940> have<00:03:05.150> a<00:03:05.180> mono<00:03:05.570> lip<00:03:05.840> to

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
have the ability to have a mono lip to

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.020 
have the ability to have a mono lip to
squat<00:03:06.260> so<00:03:06.770> it's<00:03:06.920> going<00:03:07.010> to<00:03:07.070> be<00:03:07.190> impossible<00:03:07.460> or

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
squat so it's going to be impossible or

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.060 
squat so it's going to be impossible or
pretty<00:03:08.750> much<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:09.110> waste<00:03:09.350> of<00:03:09.500> time<00:03:09.650> for<00:03:09.710> me<00:03:09.920> to

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
pretty much a waste of time for me to

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.470 
pretty much a waste of time for me to
teach<00:03:10.220> you<00:03:10.280> how<00:03:10.580> this<00:03:10.790> thing<00:03:11.000> works

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
teach you how this thing works

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.600 
teach you how this thing works
because<00:03:12.440> if<00:03:12.560> you<00:03:12.650> don't<00:03:12.740> have<00:03:12.890> access<00:03:13.250> to<00:03:13.310> it

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
because if you don't have access to it
