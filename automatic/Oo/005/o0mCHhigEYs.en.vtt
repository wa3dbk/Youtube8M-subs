00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
draw a line this is a guide line right

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.479 
draw a line this is a guide line right
across<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.140> middle<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:03.979> find<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.280> middle

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
across the middle and find the middle

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.830 
across the middle and find the middle
there<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.210> then<00:01:06.990> break<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.439> up<00:01:07.500> into<00:01:07.830> three

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
there and then break this up into three

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.289 
there and then break this up into three
kind<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:09.900> like<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.710> then<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.790> line

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
kind of like that and then on this line

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.469 
kind of like that and then on this line
here<00:01:13.610> take<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> line<00:01:14.909> down<00:01:15.229> this<00:01:16.229> line<00:01:16.470> here

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
here take a line down this line here

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.469 
here take a line down this line here
take<00:01:18.479> a<00:01:18.509> line<00:01:18.810> all<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.259> way<00:01:19.290> down<00:01:19.409> like<00:01:20.009> that

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
take a line all the way down like that

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.990 
take a line all the way down like that
and<00:01:21.479> then<00:01:21.659> you<00:01:21.930> got<00:01:22.080> there<00:01:22.920> there<00:01:23.280> there<00:01:23.700> and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
and then you got there there there and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.789 
and then you got there there there and
double<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.479> again<00:01:24.840> too<00:01:25.200> which<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.590> going<00:01:25.710> to

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
double that again too which is going to

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.890 
double that again too which is going to
be<00:01:25.890> about<00:01:26.159> there<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.930> then<00:01:28.850> draw<00:01:29.850> for<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.570> point

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
be about there and then draw for a point

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.170 
be about there and then draw for a point
there<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.799> will<00:01:31.950> be<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.189> bottom<00:01:32.520> jaw<00:01:32.820> and

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
there so this will be the bottom jaw and

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.690 
there so this will be the bottom jaw and
and<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.409> basically<00:01:34.650> it<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.189> this<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
and that is basically it so this is the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.999 
and that is basically it so this is the
brain<00:01:36.060> box<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.689> your<00:01:37.020> mouth<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.920> the

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
brain box and this is your mouth and the

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.390 
brain box and this is your mouth and the
jaw<00:01:38.189> down<00:01:38.490> here<00:01:38.869> now<00:01:39.869> fit<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.799> eyes<00:01:40.979> use

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
jaw down here now fit in the eyes use

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.560 
jaw down here now fit in the eyes use
the<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:42.060> line<00:01:42.210> across<00:01:42.509> there<00:01:43.490> and<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:45.240> kind

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
the the line across there and it's kind

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.179 
the the line across there and it's kind
of<00:01:45.659> circles<00:01:46.079> but<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.290> want<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.619> kind<00:01:46.799> of<00:01:46.920> cut

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
of circles but you want to kind of cut

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.810 
of circles but you want to kind of cut
the<00:01:47.369> cut<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.390> corners<00:01:48.810> off<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.110> circles<00:01:49.820> and

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
the cut the corners off the circles and

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.389 
the cut the corners off the circles and
so<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:51.990> little<00:01:52.350> kind<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:52.890> aviator

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
so that little kind of like aviator

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.969 
so that little kind of like aviator
glass<00:01:54.049> aviator<00:01:55.049> style<00:01:57.770> sunglasses<00:01:58.770> don't

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
cranium on the top like that and there

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:18.270 
cranium on the top like that and there
is<00:05:12.790> your<00:05:13.690> basic<00:05:13.930> very<00:05:14.860> basic<00:05:14.919> kinda<00:05:17.280> sculpt

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540
