favorite animation out of all of these

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.120 
favorite animation out of all of these
you<00:05:30.750> can<00:05:30.930> speed<00:05:31.230> it<00:05:31.260> up<00:05:31.440> and<00:05:31.620> you<00:05:31.740> can<00:05:31.770> also

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
you can speed it up and you can also

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.430 
you can speed it up and you can also
slow<00:05:32.550> down<00:05:32.760> the<00:05:32.940> animation<00:05:33.570> speed<00:05:34.020> if<00:05:34.260> you

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
slow down the animation speed if you

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.410 
slow down the animation speed if you
want<00:05:34.710> so<00:05:34.980> it<00:05:35.070> can<00:05:35.220> be<00:05:35.340> a<00:05:35.370> faster<00:05:35.790> animation<00:05:36.300> it

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
want so it can be a faster animation it

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.240 
want so it can be a faster animation it
could<00:05:36.540> be<00:05:36.660> a<00:05:36.690> slower<00:05:37.020> animation<00:05:37.620> so<00:05:38.010> you<00:05:38.100> can

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
could be a slower animation so you can

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.980 
could be a slower animation so you can
go<00:05:38.370> ahead<00:05:38.430> and<00:05:38.550> choose<00:05:38.850> your<00:05:38.910> speed<00:05:39.420> that<00:05:39.750> you

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
go ahead and choose your speed that you

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.590 
go ahead and choose your speed that you
want<00:05:40.230> for<00:05:40.530> your<00:05:40.680> card<00:05:41.010> animation<00:05:41.790> finally<00:05:42.360> and

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
want for your card animation finally and

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.780 
want for your card animation finally and
next<00:05:42.900> up<00:05:43.050> is<00:05:43.200> your<00:05:43.350> card<00:05:43.740> effects<00:05:44.220> what<00:05:44.700> this

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:44.790 
next up is your card effects what this

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.430 
next up is your card effects what this
does<00:05:45.000> is<00:05:45.150> just<00:05:45.300> give<00:05:45.510> you<00:05:45.630> a<00:05:45.660> cards<00:05:46.020> a<00:05:46.110> nice

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
does is just give you a cards a nice

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.740 
does is just give you a cards a nice
effect<00:05:46.740> whenever<00:05:47.430> you<00:05:47.880> open<00:05:48.270> them<00:05:48.420> and<00:05:48.450> the

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
effect whenever you open them and the

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.810 
effect whenever you open them and the
way<00:05:48.900> they<00:05:49.080> look<00:05:49.110> whenever<00:05:49.710> they<00:05:50.040> open<00:05:50.070> so<00:05:50.670> my

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
way they look whenever they open so my

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.360 
way they look whenever they open so my
current<00:05:51.210> option<00:05:51.630> is<00:05:51.780> the<00:05:51.900> 3d<00:05:52.200> translation<00:05:53.160> so

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
current option is the 3d translation so

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.160 
current option is the 3d translation so
if<00:05:53.490> I<00:05:53.670> go<00:05:54.000> in<00:05:54.090> here<00:05:54.270> you<00:05:54.420> can<00:05:54.600> see<00:05:54.750> all<00:05:54.780> the
