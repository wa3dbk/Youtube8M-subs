00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 we continue the cycle of stories devoted 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.560
 engine oil and today in more detail 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.960
 dwell on a full cycle oil change 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.759
 in the car engine 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.280
 so how are we starting the replacement 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.800
 oils in our car first stage 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.529
 car oil change 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.939
 is flushing the oil system 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.949
 car for this we will be with you 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.570
 use wash fluid i 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.730
 personally faced such a problem that 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.410
 I changed the oil at the station without using 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.289
 washing fluid is correct for this 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.969
 in fact all motor manufacturers 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.050
 oils recommended to use 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.090
 washing liquid 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.399
 I hope again there is one more 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.260
 delusion since there are two kinds 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.840
 industrial liquids do industrial 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.760
 liquid 5 liters or 4 liter 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.660
 canisters there are so-called 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.620
 five minutes 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.690
 so here is the main misconception is 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.760
 use of industrial fluids 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.940
 large canisters when oil is drained 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.379
 the flushing fluid is filled again 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.270
 washed it again merges pour 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.460
 fresh butter why is it a misconception 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.379
 because 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.549
 this type of flushing fluid 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.430
 all this 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.619
 high in alkali and 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.720
 depending on the engine design all 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.460
 this liquid is up to ten percent and and 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.770
 stays in the engine when it 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.220
 mixed with new oil is given 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.500
 oil comes imbalance so better 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.170
 recommend using five minutes or 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.939
 15 minutes and where both calls calling 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.799
 example go up to our car and 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.420
 show how to properly wash 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.420
 engine let's go 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.580
 add there flushing fluid but 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.260
 here again there are a couple of moments in 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.540
 first flushing fluid 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:51.320
 be sure to add warmed up 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.510
 already the engine which is prepared is worth 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.580
 already stationary for oil change 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.830
 because afterwards when we add 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.880
 liquid car should work on 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:05.200
 idle for 5-15 minutes tell me what 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.670
 same basic properties of this fluid 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.830
 flushing fluid there are two 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:15.350
 main functions the first moment is 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.280
 flushing the engine oil system from 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:22.130
 nagara which is formed in any case 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.590
 no matter what quality 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.610
 oil head and second function 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.590
 about which few people know it 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.060
 neutralizing the acidic environment of the engine and 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.150
 because while the engine is running 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.030
 oil is oxidized and if not used 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.620
 flushing fluid then new oil 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.260
 gets into acidic environment loses part 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.720
 our functions for this we use 5 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.050
 minutes well here we are for a separate liquid 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.180
 then let's 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.610
 until our engine is washed I wanted 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.060
 to find out if there is a certain nuance when choosing 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.810
 flushing fluid is up to you at the very 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.490
 There is indeed a main point in 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.840
 tom that 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.760
 flushing fluid need to use 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.810
 the same manufacturers than butter 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.440
 I'll put it 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.720
 its because manufacturers are cleaning 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.550
 additive package just so that they 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.569
 between themselves interactions because 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.810
 as I already said 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.780
 end dependencies 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.920
 percent washing liquid lemon 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.020
 key astana 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.080
 so that the oil is not ordered 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.410
 balance apply reference liquid 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.410
 same manufacturer 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.430
 five minutes have passed what are we doing next 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:34.910
 turn off the car and drain the oil 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.910
 liquids 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.670
 there is such a belief motorists 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.680
 what if the waste oil is black 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.570
 color means the oil is properly working 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.340
 yes it is the correct opinion if the oil 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.530
 after it was merged we see that 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.720
 it is dark which means oil on 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.120
 actually worked even while working 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.610
 when we take out the bill see that oil 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.280
 dark is a good sign we have oil 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:10.960
 workers are good but it all merged and 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.700
 now we need to pour new oil 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.500
 right yes now we will change the filter 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.989
 filter element of the oil system and 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.420
 will be poured new oil pics too 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.910
 important factor filter replacement then 

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:28.030
 I know that before when I have 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.650
 priest was a penny and filter and oil it 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.990
 it was a wonder that is, he 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.110
 Marlechka filtered oil and filter 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:39.540
 I spent spent it no filter should 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.540
 change with every oil change 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.310
 and most importantly after you merged 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.240
 waste oil do not forget to tighten 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.260
 drain plug 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.780
 yes it is true there were cases I forgot 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.080
 well let's start to replace the filter 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.820
 how is it done 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.500
 turn off the old filter and set 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.270
 Whether new to this need some 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.670
 special adaptations mode can 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.500
 unscrew just hands 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:09.580
 various adaptations exist but 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.580
 we will manage with our hands 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.650
 when changing the old filter do not forget 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.380
 use gloves as filter 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.180
 hot here we removed the old filter 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.370
 give put a new one but i think that 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.890
 here, too, have some nuances yes 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.700
 there is a nuance here 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:32.040
 and it is that before 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:37.290
 put a new filter in place 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:39.120
 lubricate this edict and riga we 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:41.460
 changed the filter and now it has become the most 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.980
 simple is to fill in fresh clean new 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.540
 oil for this we will use 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.540
 no oil funnel 

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:57.699
 and remember that the oil change frequency 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.059
 in our conditions is not more than 10 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:03.099
 thousand kilometers 

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:03.550
 my advice to you does not seem to be motorized 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:05.800
 oil 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:09.569
 otherwise cheap low-quality oil may 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.569
 cause engine failure
