“Some hackers managed to get
into the system and take control of…” 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.500
It's a nightmare. It' can't be true.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.900
We're in trouble. The world's in trouble.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.900
We're at War.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.000
It's odd!
Everything’s so weird!

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.600
What happened so far is a clear message.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.600
What do they want?

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.800
When you’re looking for an answer
it doesn’t matter what you find out. 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.000
Everything can enlighten you like a bolt…

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.400
In the deep night.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.800
- Hello!
- Nintendo!

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
- What!?
- It's fucking Nintendo!

Shut up! You must listen to me!

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.600
- You’re mad!
And I am more since I’m still answering you!

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.800
"And now the shit is gonna hit the fan."

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.400
I lived in the darkness of my shelter searching for an answer.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.400
Alone. Lost.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.400
[Planet of the Apes]

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.600
Far away from everyone.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I remember when I was a child
and didn’t need any connection.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.100
Our fantasy was enough.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.000
Without being addicted to communities,
rankings, updates, DLCs.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.500
They screwed us up. They screwed us all!

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.500
- Please, help me!

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.600
- WTF! You’re obsessive! So, do this…

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.000
- No.. I can’t! It’s what they want!

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.100
- Why you can’t do it? What’s the matter, try it at least.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.500
- NOO!!

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.800
- I WON'T NEVER EVER GET A XBOX!!

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.800
I just wanted to play Call of Duty

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.800
And I couldn’t.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.200
I couldn’t do it anymore!

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.000
This is my story.
