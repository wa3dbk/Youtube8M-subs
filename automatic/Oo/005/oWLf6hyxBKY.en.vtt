00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
is because of that and he doesn't really

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.149 
is because of that and he doesn't really
think<00:01:50.880> she<00:01:51.240> has<00:01:51.360> anything<00:01:51.659> a<00:01:51.899> war<00:01:52.110> for<00:01:52.350> note<00:01:52.590> to

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
should have been somewhat punished for

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.360 
should have been somewhat punished for
doing<00:02:34.730> what<00:02:34.849> they<00:02:34.879> did<00:02:35.000> and<00:02:35.510> so<00:02:36.079> Zinn<00:02:36.950> Nitin

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
doing what they did and so Zinn Nitin

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.099 
doing what they did and so Zinn Nitin
really<00:02:37.760> want<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.180> punish<00:02:38.420> him<00:02:38.599> so<00:02:38.810> he<00:02:38.959> got

punished<00:02:39.590> because<00:02:40.400> of<00:02:40.760> him<00:02:40.879> and<00:02:41.150> so<00:02:41.870> he<00:02:41.900> lost

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
punished because of him and so he lost

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.910 
punished because of him and so he lost
jurisdiction<00:02:43.010> over<00:02:43.969> the<00:02:44.540> entire<00:02:45.049> fort<00:02:45.680> to

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
jurisdiction over the entire fort to

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.289 
jurisdiction over the entire fort to
where<00:02:46.069> he<00:02:46.220> can't<00:02:46.459> watch<00:02:46.639> over<00:02:46.819> them<00:02:47.090> so<00:02:47.209> that's

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
where he can't watch over them so that's

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:48.699 
where he can't watch over them so that's
kind<00:02:47.569> of<00:02:47.629> what's<00:02:47.810> going<00:02:47.959> on<00:02:48.139> right<00:02:48.349> now<00:02:48.379> with

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
kind of what's going on right now with

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.129

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:51.139 
this episode of Academy a very

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.770 
this episode of Academy a very

should even be together because I've

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:27.390 
should even be together because I've
seen<00:03:25.159> this<00:03:25.310> situation<00:03:25.879> quite<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:26.209> lot<00:03:26.599> in<00:03:26.900> other

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:38.979 
the symbolism I mentioned a couple
episodes<00:03:37.370> ago<00:03:37.729> is<00:03:38.030> kind<00:03:38.329> of<00:03:38.389> playing<00:03:38.599> true

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
episodes ago is kind of playing true

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.080 
episodes ago is kind of playing true
with<00:03:39.620> this<00:03:39.799> week's<00:03:40.010> episode<00:03:40.190> but<00:03:40.819> I<00:03:40.849> still

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
with this week's episode but I still

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.699 
with this week's episode but I still
think<00:03:41.299> there<00:03:41.389> might<00:03:41.479> be<00:03:41.540> more<00:03:41.690> to<00:03:41.900> it<00:03:42.319> later<00:03:42.620> on

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
think there might be more to it later on

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.830 
think there might be more to it later on
down<00:03:42.919> the<00:03:42.979> road<00:03:43.099> but<00:03:43.849> for<00:03:43.879> now<00:03:44.239> though<00:03:44.540> the

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
down the road but for now though the

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.830 
down the road but for now though the
episode<00:03:45.669> it<00:03:46.669> was<00:03:46.849> kind<00:03:47.060> of<00:03:47.209> like<00:03:47.329> an<00:03:47.479> episode

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
episode it was kind of like an episode

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.809
