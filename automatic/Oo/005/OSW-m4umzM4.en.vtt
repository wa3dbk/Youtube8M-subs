there's<00:01:23.119> a<00:01:23.210> couple<00:01:23.479> of<00:01:23.540> features<00:01:23.899> I'd<00:01:23.990> like<00:01:24.020> to

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
there's a couple of features I'd like to

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.469 
there's a couple of features I'd like to
show<00:01:24.439> you<00:01:24.500> so<00:01:24.799> let's<00:01:24.979> get<00:01:25.460> a<00:01:25.640> little<00:01:26.299> looking

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
show you so let's get a little looking

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.840 
show you so let's get a little looking
at<00:01:26.720> those<00:01:28.149> get<00:01:29.149> rid<00:01:29.299> of<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.479> get<00:01:30.110> rid<00:01:30.229> of<00:01:30.320> the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
at those get rid of the get rid of the

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.190 
at those get rid of the get rid of the
analog<00:01:31.850> input<00:01:32.330> and<00:01:32.479> go<00:01:32.570> back<00:01:32.780> to<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.080> digital

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
analog input and go back to the digital

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.830 
analog input and go back to the digital
input<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:34.189> here<00:01:35.000> I<00:01:35.060> have<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:35.240> digital<00:01:35.420> track

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
input so here I have a digital track

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.929 
input so here I have a digital track
play<00:01:36.080> and<00:01:36.350> there's<00:01:36.530> a<00:01:36.560> mode<00:01:36.770> called<00:01:36.799> flux<00:01:37.399> here

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
play and there's a mode called flux here

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.330 
play and there's a mode called flux here
now<00:01:38.689> flux<00:01:39.140> mode<00:01:39.289> is<00:01:39.470> best<00:01:39.740> demonstrated

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
now flux mode is best demonstrated

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.730 
now flux mode is best demonstrated
rather<00:01:40.729> than<00:01:41.030> rather<00:01:41.659> than<00:01:41.780> spoken<00:01:42.289> about<00:01:42.530> so

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
rather than rather than spoken about so

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.740 
rather than rather than spoken about so
I'll<00:01:42.830> turn<00:01:42.979> it<00:01:43.159> on<00:01:43.250> but<00:01:44.000> I'll<00:01:44.119> put<00:01:44.330> some<00:01:44.539> loops

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
I'll turn it on but I'll put some loops

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:52.370 
I'll turn it on but I'll put some loops
on

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.090 

so

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.539 

hopefully<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:56.939> can<00:01:57.030> hear<00:01:57.270> that

filter here and the macro effects work a

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.400 
filter here and the macro effects work a
little<00:02:44.940> bit<00:02:45.120> like<00:02:45.270> that<00:02:45.300> this<00:02:45.660> knob<00:02:45.930> here<00:02:45.960> is

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
little bit like that this knob here is

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.620 
little bit like that this knob here is
also<00:02:46.770> like<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:46.980> filter<00:02:47.310> in<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.060> middle<00:02:48.330> nothing

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
also like a filter in the middle nothing

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.420 
also like a filter in the middle nothing
happens<00:02:51.080> but<00:02:52.080> in<00:02:52.200> each<00:02:52.350> direction<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:53.070> effect

I'm<00:03:46.090> metallo's<00:03:46.450> are<00:03:46.659> those<00:03:46.780> to<00:03:46.930> play<00:03:47.109> with<00:03:47.319> so

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
I'm metallo's are those to play with so

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.410 
I'm metallo's are those to play with so
the<00:03:48.310> other<00:03:48.489> thing<00:03:48.700> to<00:03:48.819> point<00:03:48.849> out<00:03:49.090> about<00:03:49.209> the

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
the other thing to point out about the

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.479 
the other thing to point out about the
mixer<00:03:49.689> now<00:03:49.810> we're<00:03:49.989> looking<00:03:50.109> closely<00:03:50.769> at<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.219> is

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
mixer now we're looking closely at it is

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.559 
mixer now we're looking closely at it is
that<00:03:51.819> these<00:03:52.209> buttons<00:03:52.629> here<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.849> cues<00:03:54.849> loops

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:55.569 
that these buttons here the cues loops

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.720 
that these buttons here the cues loops
and<00:03:55.870> feedback<00:03:56.709> from<00:03:56.890> the<00:03:56.950> sample<00:03:57.310> decks<00:03:57.519> are

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
and feedback from the sample decks are

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.170 
and feedback from the sample decks are
actually<00:03:58.390> color-coded<00:03:59.379> so<00:03:59.620> this<00:04:00.099> blue<00:04:00.670> beads

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
actually color-coded so this blue beads

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.640 
actually color-coded so this blue beads
that<00:04:01.299> you've<00:04:01.420> got<00:04:01.510> a<00:04:01.540> cue<00:04:01.780> point<00:04:02.019> set<00:04:02.290> let's

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
that you've got a cue point set let's

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.960 
that you've got a cue point set let's
get<00:04:02.799> a<00:04:02.829> loop<00:04:03.040> going<00:04:06.329> okay<00:04:07.329> say<00:04:08.230> I<00:04:08.260> like<00:04:08.560> I<00:04:08.970> like

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
get a loop going okay say I like I like

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.000 
get a loop going okay say I like I like
that<00:04:10.120> loop<00:04:10.299> there<00:04:10.329> I<00:04:10.540> want<00:04:10.750> to<00:04:10.810> keep<00:04:10.930> it<00:04:11.170> the

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
that loop there I want to keep it the

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.520 
that loop there I want to keep it the
loops<00:04:12.219> will<00:04:12.430> be<00:04:12.459> green<00:04:12.819> so<00:04:13.599> my<00:04:13.750> son<00:04:13.959> my<00:04:14.200> cues

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
loops will be green so my son my cues

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.439 
loops will be green so my son my cues
are<00:04:14.680> blue<00:04:14.859> and<00:04:15.099> my<00:04:15.310> loops<00:04:15.549> are<00:04:15.700> green<00:04:15.909> so

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
are blue and my loops are green so

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.089 
are blue and my loops are green so
that's<00:04:16.570> a<00:04:16.750> nice<00:04:16.930> bit<00:04:17.169> of<00:04:17.199> feedback<00:04:17.500> there<00:04:17.859> also

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099 
that's a nice bit of feedback there also

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:19.830 
that's a nice bit of feedback there also
it's<00:04:18.579> even<00:04:18.820> better<00:04:19.030> when<00:04:19.269> you<00:04:19.329> switch<00:04:19.599> to<00:04:19.630> the

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
it's even better when you switch to the

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.860 
it's even better when you switch to the
remix<00:04:20.410> decks<00:04:20.680> because<00:04:21.549> then<00:04:21.789> you<00:04:22.240> get<00:04:22.419> the<00:04:22.479> top

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
remix decks because then you get the top

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.810 
remix decks because then you get the top
sample<00:04:23.560> on<00:04:23.680> each<00:04:23.800> of<00:04:24.009> these<00:04:24.099> from<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.460> remix

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
sample on each of these from the remix

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.219 
sample on each of these from the remix
decks<00:04:25.060> so<00:04:25.360> in<00:04:25.449> that<00:04:25.509> way<00:04:25.660> it's<00:04:25.810> a<00:04:25.840> bit<00:04:26.050> like<00:04:26.199> a

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
decks so in that way it's a bit like a

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:28.020 
decks so in that way it's a bit like a
cross<00:04:26.530> between<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.889> sample<00:04:27.340> decks<00:04:27.550> and<00:04:27.789> the

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
cross between the sample decks and the

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.909 
cross between the sample decks and the
remix<00:04:28.389> decks<00:04:28.630> you<00:04:28.840> don't<00:04:29.139> get<00:04:29.259> access<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.650> all

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
remix decks you don't get access to all

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.249 
remix decks you don't get access to all
the<00:04:30.460> samples<00:04:30.849> lower<00:04:31.030> down<00:04:31.270> you<00:04:31.509> need<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.870> f1

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:32.259 
the samples lower down you need the f1

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.050 
the samples lower down you need the f1
for<00:04:32.470> that<00:04:32.590> but<00:04:33.009> you<00:04:33.280> get<00:04:33.430> access<00:04:33.580> to<00:04:33.759> the<00:04:33.940> top

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
for that but you get access to the top

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.820 
for that but you get access to the top
sample<00:04:34.449> and<00:04:34.570> you<00:04:34.660> see<00:04:34.900> its<00:04:35.050> color<00:04:35.259> on<00:04:35.500> here<00:04:35.680> as

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
sample and you see its color on here as

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.310 
sample and you see its color on here as
well<00:04:35.860> which<00:04:36.580> is<00:04:36.699> a<00:04:36.729> nice<00:04:36.910> touch<00:04:37.270> also<00:04:38.080> nice

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
well which is a nice touch also nice

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.439 
well which is a nice touch also nice
feedback<00:04:38.710> comes<00:04:39.340> in<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:39.580> shape<00:04:39.759> of<00:04:40.000> this

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:40.449

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
button here this led here which shows

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.020 
button here this led here which shows
you<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:43.870> loop<00:04:44.800> length<00:04:45.099> so<00:04:45.699> that<00:04:45.729> you<00:04:45.910> know

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
you the loop length so that you know

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.610 
you the loop length so that you know
exactly<00:04:46.300> what<00:04:46.630> size<00:04:46.659> loop<00:04:47.080> you've<00:04:47.349> programmed

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
exactly what size loop you've programmed

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:48.930 
exactly what size loop you've programmed
so<00:04:47.979> again<00:04:48.159> you<00:04:48.250> don't<00:04:48.400> have<00:04:48.490> to<00:04:48.580> look<00:04:48.699> at<00:04:48.820> the

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
so again you don't have to look at the

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.760 
so again you don't have to look at the
screen<00:04:49.180> to<00:04:49.389> see<00:04:49.419> that<00:04:49.750> this<00:04:50.169> makes<00:04:50.380> for<00:04:50.590> more

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
can't say been using big venues and so

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.460 
can't say been using big venues and so
on<00:05:22.120> they're<00:05:22.270> just<00:05:22.300> everyone<00:05:22.720> wants<00:05:22.960> a<00:05:23.020> pioneer

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
on they're just everyone wants a pioneer

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.710 
on they're just everyone wants a pioneer

or an Allen &amp; Heath in those situations
but<00:05:26.500> primarily<00:05:26.800> I<00:05:27.099> think<00:05:27.370> the<00:05:27.490> home<00:05:27.669> user<00:05:27.940> who

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
but primarily I think the home user who

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:30.029 
but primarily I think the home user who
wants<00:05:28.570> to<00:05:28.690> have<00:05:28.840> a<00:05:28.870> hybrid<00:05:29.169> setup<00:05:29.650> like<00:05:29.800> this

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 
wants to have a hybrid setup like this

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:32.100

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
mix it hasn't got that I hasn't it's

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.470 
mix it hasn't got that I hasn't it's
just<00:05:59.990> not<00:06:00.140> so<00:06:00.290> tightly<00:06:00.860> tied<00:06:01.310> to<00:06:01.550> chapter<00:06:02.000> this

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480 
just not so tightly tied to chapter this

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.150

one<00:06:02.660> is<00:06:02.810> of<00:06:02.960> course<00:06:02.990> this<00:06:03.260> comes<00:06:03.530> from<00:06:03.710> Native

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
one is of course this comes from Native

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.680 
one is of course this comes from Native
Instruments<00:06:04.280> so<00:06:04.700> it<00:06:04.790> would<00:06:04.970> be<00:06:05.180> but<00:06:05.570> then

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
Instruments so it would be but then

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:06.970 
Instruments so it would be but then
again<00:06:05.810> the<00:06:06.020> Pioneer<00:06:06.410> one's<00:06:06.560> a<00:06:06.620> little<00:06:06.860> bit

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:06.980 
again the Pioneer one's a little bit

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.100 
again the Pioneer one's a little bit
cheaper<00:06:07.370> so<00:06:07.760> definitely<00:06:08.600> worth<00:06:08.690> comparing

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
cheaper so definitely worth comparing

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.890 
cheaper so definitely worth comparing
