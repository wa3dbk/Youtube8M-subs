00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.509
 80 million tons of sand were heaped to it now 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:07.460
 Construction vehicles can drive was before water here is the new 

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:12.920
 Containerterminal arise that EurOmax later when it is finished the velvety 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.179
 cleared to expose the fairway 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:18.269
 Project Manager Jan Simon 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:19.179
 and his team 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:20.369
 build on St 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.369
 that sounds deserved, it is common 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:31.690
 Kleve RP we are very happy with the St he is very stable so wild 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.970
 Primus from so great construction on it called 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.290
 easy to move 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.700
 exactly calculable and very sustainable 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.300
 Overall, if you use its properties an optimal Baumann 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.000
 The schedule is extremely tight 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 Steam year should be able to create the first ships here 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.520
 a two kilometer long no farmer a gigantic construction project 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.300
 and this time not as usual made of steel but concrete much more elaborate 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.300
 but she does not spit it out 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.360
 we would be responsible for the concrete wall the 34 meters into the earth 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.040
 goes down 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.810
 Insurances come percent bonuses everything here is for Hinduism 50 years 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:20.600
 has existed 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.259
 Of course it's great that my children and later my grandchildren too 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.329
 Show as they say I was doing Rheinfelden is born 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.040
 because the company Rillen works with his team at the same time at the 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.219
 upper quay wall 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.520
 the construction site is 21 with him 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.130
 Split sections 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.530
 To adhere to the schedule must be such a section every three days 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.420
 be tired 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.290
 several teams are working in parallel at different places 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.290
 because all work steps must mesh perfectly 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.320
 a part of the wall is already finished and already has glitches like 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.980
 the new terminal should look like later 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.980
 a complex planning that has worked so far 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.669
 to 4 0 

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:11.369
 and that's what all of them do 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:15.309
 because its underground wall is the support of the quay wall and from here 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:17.939
 hang all further steps 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.790
 The special excavators are therefore constantly lifting 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.790
 that's where the concrete came from later on 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:29.909
 but suddenly an excavator comes to a standstill 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.219
 the shovel is not working properly 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.799
 Simone and act react immediately 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.249
 Now it's time to keep cool where the mistake lies 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:42.799
 Leighton controls systematically 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.029
 After a few minutes the problem had been a small one 

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:48.939
 decisive meter has broken off 

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.719
 it measures red cards exactly 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:54.439
 without it, the work must stand still 

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:56.329
 because no slate shaft 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.759
 a crooked quay wall 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.249
 Wild accidents is feverishly based on a replacement part so the breakdown is not 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:06.449
 also delayed the other construction phases 

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:09.979
 because at the other end of the construction site, the dredger already has its work 

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:11.179
 recorded 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:12.750
 on finished building sections 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.909
 it sucks the sand and releases the waterway for the ships 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:24.679
 These 55 meter long steel girders will stabilize the quay wall 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:29.969
 The foreman carefully directs them into a special color which they later use 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:32.969
 Argon Adelboden is driving 

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:38.169
 the men were in a hurry to move on 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.769
 they want to take advantage of the favorable weather 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.010
 before school strikes and endanger the work 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.469
 Dobrindt, above all, it is quite bad for us 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.549
 it is by this machine he can only be four workers up to wind force 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:57.549
 above that we are fooling everything 

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:00.339
 with ten tons approx 

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:04.309
 per stroke, the monstrous drives Eigler into the sand 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.849
 there is only one attempt 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:14.889
 something goes wrong now until the steel girder lost the impossible 

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:17.209
 to pull out of the ground again 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.590
 fast are 31 meters 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.189
 everything is going as planned 

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:25.519
 but 140 piers are still standing and the autumn with its storm is ahead of 

00:04:25.519 --> 00:04:26.620
 door 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.310
 Willow JÃ¼rgen is still looking for the spare parts finally 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.310
 has r 

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:39.979
 now comes the spare part from France it will be half a day 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.509
 take it until it is here 

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.870
 the work of the other sections will not affect that 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.680
 the upper no farmer can now be cast with 90 truckloads affected 

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:57.409
 Hohenwart usually concretes only near the ground and later then the 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.979
 tape 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.180
 but we have to do it in one day that's the challenge 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.499
 begin 

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:06.960
 Almost a quarter of the quay wall has already been completed by the construction team 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:07.919
 not yet 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.770
 perfect on schedule 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.419
 In just a few weeks, the first location cranes will be set up here and soon 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.370
 to dissolve the congestion on the North Sea 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.500
 at least 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.950
 temporarily
