00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.730
 only in cycling especially in 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.730
 document with Minsk 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:16.869
 goals such track bikes 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.730
 they can be paid if 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.439
 choose someday 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.199
 and on TV 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.609
 what 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.829
 wheels 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.729
 Herman is nothing 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:34.040
 not with needles 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.040
 which we are used to 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.370
 where is everyone concentrated 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.370
 in public not only to individuals 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.840
 turns them 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.010
 to work 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.710
 instead of knitting do 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.469
 carbonic croc 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:56.820
 we will not be its top mass here 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.880
 concentration 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.510
 all and wheel planes 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.850
 this is explained on the one hand 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.510
 aerodynamics spitsyn place even though they 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.420
 thin start point 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.170
 on the flow resistance 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.170
 bento at high speeds 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.070
 here 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.460
 no such effect 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.950
 and second 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.550
 explanation 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.450
 who found on the Internet and what we have 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.550
 stress 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.900
 increased inertia this is written now 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.150
 we will discuss this issue in detail 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.570
 there we consider the moment of inertia 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.900
 storm dispute 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.770
 discs 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.770
 moment of inertia 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.280
 we can 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.280
 inertia 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.530
 indian 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.530
 and hoop 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.510
 cars 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.330
 and the game to the Germans 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.759
 se 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.060
 domain sound 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.279
 everything else 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:14.789
 neglecting one with aids filmed in knocks 

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:16.929
 before which than it could very easily 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:18.899
 calculated on Russia 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:21.059
 passing through the center of mass 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:23.959
 it turns out that all the oils on the faces of m 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:24.969
 periphery 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.519
 and fraud examples of such a student 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.169
 here we have a cylinder is not the moment of inertia 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:33.169
 it turns out prime 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:35.519
 a disk 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.519
 on this hoop 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.029
 two times less 

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:43.389
 how to invest money 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:46.419
 so here the moment of inertia is less 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:49.419
 why do you need it 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:51.859
 competitions which is called 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.309
 egypt with a place that is konkin speed 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:59.009
 thousands of kilometers for men 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:00.389
 thousands of meters 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:02.189
 for men pass 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.569
 no speeding up zero speed 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.599
 in which case you can quickly straighten 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:09.669
 vegetation with 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:12.539
 August 3 and the same 

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:14.520
 torque which 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.520
 there is a forget racer 

00:03:18.399 --> 00:03:20.479
 margins went to the main law 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:23.479
 speakers basically 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:25.829
 according to law 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.459
 in rotational dynamics 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.719
 movements 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.719
 shchepkin dynamics 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.439
 basic law count 

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:45.430
 which is amazing 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.700
 moment of inertia return goal to me 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.259
 probably not 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:51.609
 could handle the news 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.929
 earlier moment of force 

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:54.909
 which 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:56.459
 hijacker will be the same in both 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:57.949
 cases 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.569
 I think it will be extremely difficult for him here 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.569
 second it gives 

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:06.789
 here we will write changes alas 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:08.309
 by speed 

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:09.789
 wheel rotation 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:12.239
 and here we will and anyone may not be 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.369
 fine 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:16.859
 this is the best 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.859
 disk 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.389
 just m brick square feet idol 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:26.529
 probably this and so 

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:27.960
 a hoop 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.960
 i.e. a spoke wheel 

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:36.430
 in which case the accident will be less 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.430
 spring write only 3 1 flowers therefore 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.430
 if they are held in another point of Russia 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:49.740
 so far away he is supposedly a friend of speed goals 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.270
 they will be equal to each other first 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.440
 speed because casually starts 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.680
 increase 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.139
 aircraft 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.300
 but obviously it will be less obvious 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.999
 wherever you litvinovtsami machines 

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:05.999
 so drives 

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:08.069
 behind 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:10.800
 less him 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.710
 we believe 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.759
 delta ca 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.169
 racer 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.169
 accelerates 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.479
 house 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.699
 then by mode 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.699
 speeds 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.940
 mango
