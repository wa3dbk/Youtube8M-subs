00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 what youtube i am sure the brand and 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.509
 we have thursday morning i am 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.280
 just got up and now you do 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.809
 Let's have a quick meal because today 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.420
 it has been noticed that is already coming 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.740
 smoke next week 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.440
 I would have suppressed that somehow thought 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.900
 that still takes a bit but that 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.520
 I'm okay now at the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.960
 Time that a little something over it 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.820
 I do not want to tell you what 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.130
 everything in it is big because I think so 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.119
 I do not know everything myself 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.730
 probably have more information 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.810
 as me and besides that's everyone 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.320
 others probably better 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.079
 after higher and readable than me there 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.790
 I just do not feel so energetic right now 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.160
 this video will be stuck here 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.360
 to inform you here 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.420
 just present mine like that 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.050
 my expectations and so to announce 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.149
 So to speak, it's just like that 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.800
 little bit looked at 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.360
 heard of course and a few things 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.690
 I think really cool things have one 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.690
 a bit shocked 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.899
 Straight to what I find the hottest 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.260
 so I heard there are dedicated ones 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.780
 server 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.280
 does not mean very good system 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.900
 On the other hand, I have read that you 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.150
 somehow doing a bit of a mission like that 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.400
 how it will affect later 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.630
 we will see 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.939
 i just hope that the connection 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.420
 by stable becomes that the host no 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.820
 that has always been in or before 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.720
 where there are simply no more 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.640
 of course if there are any servers 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.140
 there are people sitting there and different 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.909
 far away from the server there are also 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.890
 again different pings and that should be 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.869
 course also lead to fluctuations 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.990
 but he is that sometimes surprising and 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.939
 Whatever the best I am on everyone 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.570
 very curious and I hope that 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.340
 To increase our experience extremely 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.360
 becomes 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:49.439
 yes, what else is there, yes, I have that 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.170
 on the xbox 360 and on the ps3 it 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.700
 no new against still in the ground like 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.570
 will give but that only for the 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.390
 new generation 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.390
 the new controls and so on the 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.580
 new consoles will be hyper when i am 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.440
 pretty much so I do not really have any 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.300
 buck more immediately to shop for an xbox 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.679
 I have to go back now 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.360
 students are and just the carbonic acid 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.280
 equal to a bit cool somewhere 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.680
 on the side but I would like then 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.330
 plug in directly and middle east this 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.310
 just have to buy inspection with it 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.780
 can now play ground war and which 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.480
 fat scores to not tear the 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.540
 pretty much aasee and I think so 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.920
 can solve any other way 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.380
 that bothers me a bit 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.790
 then you do not have to enter a cinema mode 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.350
 You have to go to the hall before he does that anyway 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.220
 Zicken makes running all the time 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.380
 to let 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.630
 i want to consider other capture card 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:40.959
 but we all go looking for 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.200
 this year and yes as I said still 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.520
 many students are missing games and there 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.260
 just the coal so if you have one 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.390
 of you somehow possibilities 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.940
 cheap new captain to come to that 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.010
 knowledge 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.230
 and yes solar offers solution tracking 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:03.489
 it's clear, but he has the last one 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:05.200
 times on the ps3 that only made me what 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.239
 already thought when the game is 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.160
 I come out for the old consoles 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.709
 I have always looked at the requirements 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.540
 what the pc has higher in any case 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:15.820
 and actually , that's the new one too 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.280
 generation I have programmed 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.200
 Real concerns about the performance 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.049
 the old consoles are up so 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:27.070
 the xbox 360 just run badly 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:29.170
 fps will break in that's just not 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.150
 good not good and fluently playable 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.579
 So from me, you could all graphic 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.900
 raushauen details 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.489
 I do not need any light effects anymore 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.230
 As a matter of fact I do not care 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.540
 play fluent but I have yes 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.600
 already my thoughts what the colleagues 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.860
 will make 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:48.140
 I'm also very curious 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:52.250
 We also see that it is a new one 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.900
 mode is new old anyway now 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.270
 forget that from the zombie mode only 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.890
 against aliens he determines some today 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.750
 like to find it 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.840
 I never know the big combo mode 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.030
 player is perhaps this mode what 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.590
 other a bit and corresponds to the 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.720
 not have fun with it 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.390
 but that we see here in any case 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.980
 Also there very excited on it a few 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:17.270
 things already seen looks interesting 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:20.810
 out but very likely yes 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.770
 what I am looking for in the multiplayer is what I am looking for 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.600
 Definitely try it out 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:28.310
 I also want something really cool from this 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.960
 short yes actually can create well 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.780
 where he actually is the bag if such a 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.790
 bit replaced where you spot against 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.550
 can play squash and so on 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.970
 cool in any case I 'm buck 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.440
 I'm on it in any case bock on it 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.200
 I'm curious how this short 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.360
 Compensable are against it I have 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.160
 already in the comments for flame that 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.420
 I do not know about it but here 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.110
 just other things so lately 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.810
 in the head had 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.240
 which game is out there so i think 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.790
 I'm not so much looking for the mega 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.960
 They know about everything because of it 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.080
 There are a few other things that are more 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:06.260
 make fun as should and also 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.670
 more important are partly though 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:12.770
 important and fun sometimes not quite 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:15.530
 but are consistent no matter what it is 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.600
 because I still have the game to say 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.460
 probably not this one already 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.230
 Saturdays war or friday dismissed 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.180
 hoped that but from next week 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:27.250
 I could howl I'm really holdings 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:31.910
 that 's so bitter it sucks 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:34.220
 main against those of my trust 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.290
 disappointed me very disappointed 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.510
 in that there are any holidays 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.750
 are meant as well 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.890
 That will not be this weekend 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.520
 probably only on monday or 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.960
 tuesday I do not even bock 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.540
 to wait so long 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.640
 especially as I said students and then 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.170
 must probably be guilty of suffering 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.030
 depending on how class works write 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:06:01.810
 or not one or the other 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:01.810
 schultag probably not a bit 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:09.650
 secretly com 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:11.450
 so everything is made out of solution 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.250
 All in all, I 'm fine with that 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.590
 on a few trailer looks cool so 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.380
 I like the graphics to see the weapons 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:19.070
 cool out so what a recall and say 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.900
 my game 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.040
 The sector looked really fat 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.640
 vector with muffler and the 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:27.500
 theology taken away boah crass is me 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.300
 really curious if I'm looking forward to it 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.710
 but so incredibly and it annoys me so 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:36.080
 very much that I am currently so bad 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:37.490
 but I hope to play the best that was 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.870
 I'll talk to you a lot 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.030
 You can only leave more about it 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:42.980
 shit looking forward to have cheaper 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:44.570
 and we only help talk something 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.370
 this weekend is coming too 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.130
 cellar duel against burschen then up here 

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.500
 facebook already knows that 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:54.020

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.970
 followed her on facebook if thats you 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.850
 I did not like the video 

00:06:55.970 --> 00:07:01.940
 has a carpenter because he is for less 

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:03.680

 but I have information 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:10.370
 not to stress me sometime 

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.110
 How should you know me?

 Subscribe favored heal a picture 

00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:27.590
 paint the school hanging with the saying

 sgr subscribes to it that's how it must be 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.150
 So today cleaning market around who 

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:34.120
 now to look because you can always 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:35.919
 say I have this black border 

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:39.520
 Once I left it that way 

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:40.930
 better like is stylish out could 

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:41.820
 sign him as well as I should 

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:44.650
 to drift so 

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:47.550
 so stretched the whole picture 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.550
 that was it
