 from the classic colors that were 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:16.159
 released in eighty sixth year 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.869
 color worthy of a very big 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.999
 attention but we all know yes what 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.310
 almost all the colors of classic 

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:23.600
 Jordans whom the basketball player played in 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.600
 team chicago bulls 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.469
 they were white red sometimes black 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.299
 color principle is nothing extra to white 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:34.520
 practically sneakers with small 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.369
 red such introductions well and 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.950
 small black stripes classic o 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.079
 which you can not speak much except 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.359
 stories that I already win well plus more 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:48.049
 small such a moment yes it's a snake 

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:50.689
 the skin here is not yet there is no such 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:54.200
 the famous elephant print that is 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:57.229
 sneakers with leather under the skin of an elephant 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.630
 but there is already such reptile skin too 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.840
 which for italian george 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.840
 it is another reprint this second 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.390
 jordan and called infrared 23 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.429
 infrared is another classic possible 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.280
 say canonical colors for nike 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.170
 coloring in which came out 90 airmaksa 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.319
 and which will almost always be 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.330
 You can say a win-win 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.610
 for any sneakers for any retro 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.150
 sneakers new may not always be but 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.880
 decided 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.620
 infra next to do and second jordan and 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.630
 what is such infrared inform 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.989
 this is such a red light 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.270
 a little bit unusual close to reason 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.790
 necessarily black necessarily gray 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.100
 why 23 why not just called them 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.260
 infrared because all the same jordin yes 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.970
 could not help but add something for 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.700
 this model and added 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.980
 It is such a blob of gray 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.410
 asphalt as you call it 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.310
 black smooth gray smooth skin with 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.500
 black dots are also very interesting 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.350
 the model is also very good calm 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.290
 coloring we all remember yes that sometimes 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.390
 playing colors is not always helpful but here 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.880
 such a classic color she will 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.360
 always interesting it will be popular 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.390
 is always 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.640
 and what you don't like about elephant skin 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:16.489
 the bit seems to be a very good expression 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.489
 time is short again 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.489
 let's continue 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.200
 the next sneakers about which you want 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:27.150
 tell and this is 6 jordan and practically 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.519
 about all the classic models in which 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.109
 spoke michael jordan can say 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.420
 something interesting can say something 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.579
 terrific the same can be said and 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.040
 about 6 and george well yes everyone has said 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.959
 about the fact that their backdrop is similar to the back 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.120
 like his porsche car and and generally 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.420
 partially 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.950
 designers 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.780
 inspired by the silhouette 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.480
 classic porsche sports cars and 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.140
 creating models and since it still 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.900
 called 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.709
 plus this is the first jordan in which michael 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.220
 Jordan won the title 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.290
 national basketball association 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.930
 many of you probably remember this 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:07.030
 picture where this bald and at the same time 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:10.660
 great athlete hugs nb cup and 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:13.390
 crying very strong in composition very 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.220
 strong on expression 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.070
 picture that many lovers 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.070
 basketball know and there were even a few 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.139
 such as they are now called photoshop 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.630
 or fotozhab when michael jordan 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:27.280
 lies and cries and hugs he is not this 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.350
 cup namely the sixth jordan and 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.870
 sneakers in which he and this cup 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.419
 won the most interesting thing is not that 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.340
 colors in which he won but this 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.080
 classic colors sport blue 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.050
 which was not reprinted 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:43.840
 already 23 years to think about it 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.389
 sneakers 23 years and 23 years ago 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.610
 one of the colors that came out was exactly 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.940
 such is white and blue called sport 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.530
 blue 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.990
 when the news came that this 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.060
 coloring will reissue naturally online 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.870
 to the head and the world were incredibly happy 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.910
 and waited for reissues waited and waited 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.590
 get these classic sneakers and 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.690
 one more sneakers in which 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.640
 there is a color sport blue 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.410
 namely such blue color why it still 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.630
 love george this light is his 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.700
 University of North Carolina I'm not 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:16.090
 once told that Jordan began his 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.520
 university basketball career 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.950
 exactly north carolina and it was her 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.419
 the colors are such a blue color but 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.910
 decided to reprint 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.320
 and the first sneakers are not exactly the colors 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.820
 north carolina because she's all 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.729
 it was still with white and here it is 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:34.060
 silver gray but one more 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:36.700
 wonderful calm silhouette first 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.669
 Jordan who will never be superfluous 

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:42.250
 in the collection will never be superfluous on 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.950
 legs of the present grandfather's head on his feet 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:48.010
 lover of sneakers so our split 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.080
 they could not not present here such 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.909
 here is a little to the dispute roger 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.580
 data as you noticed them now 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:57.129
 transmitted is not a lot of it 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.389
 calm before the oncoming storms or 

00:05:57.129 --> 00:05:59.770
 maybe on the contrary they will 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:01.900
 transmitted less and less and 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.539
 less and less and generally they will descend on 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:06.370
 no who knows but less will go down 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:07.599
 No, I think this will not happen because 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:09.909

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:12.969
