00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:07.680
 this is a 416 hp strong 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.120
 two and a half tons full-size SUV 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.400
 that's it inside where they are 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.590
 have figured this out at 14% tax 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.150
 addition to driving is certainly one 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.180
 client with friends percent addition 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.949
 he exists and is called cayenne s hybrid it 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.580
 secret the same as the panamera's 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.920
 e-hybrid 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.080
 it is a plug-in hybrid that means 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.210
 that according to europe it only 79 grams of CO2 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.590
 per kilometer, therefore, emissions are good 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.199
 40 percent additional tax 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.610
 is around 25,000 euros cheaper than one 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.320
 ordinary calientes then he becomes 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.309
 probably incredibly popular in us 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.690
 country 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.760
 well an us to look for me or all that 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.469
 nice numbers are really true too 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.070
 this car still had secretly heavily on 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.070
 the press budget 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.360
 yes the same attention line as in the 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.740
 panamera's e-hybrid 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.200
 and for those who are not familiar with that 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.740
 they have 3 liter v6 compressor engine with 333 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.630
 pk 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.010
 and then comes an electric motor 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.770
 95 hp 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.870
 and then the system also reaches 416 hp and 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.940
 also not unimportant 590 now 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.200
 torque and both engines so the 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.760
 electric motor as the combustion engine 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.080
 they are in front of the eight-speed automatic 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.550
 That means is that he always switches 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.080
 so even if you only drive electrically 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.030
 well that is a funny experience in itself 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.320
 But the also means that you get that maximum 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.250
 couple that you have in each of your 8 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.920
 gears 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.200
 between 1250 and 4,000 revs well then have 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.759
 so you have a very nasty attention line that 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.470
 behind it automatically builds to us 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.119
 offer between very powerful slurry of 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.350
 torque and power 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.610
 it is very pleasant in practice 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.560
 the work nicely together you notice there 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.729
 nothing really very smooth 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.380
 smooth 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.030
 You were allowed to do a lot and then 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.509
 know the second half with more energy 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.290
 see 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.290
 really pretty fast 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.220
 oh , of course, it's all about now 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.050
 the consumption what you finally buy 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.430
 and bid for 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.140
 well what can you get with these s 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.060
 e-hybrid well if you know the battery 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.180
 completely full throws 10.8 kilowatt hours 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.320
 in it you can follow the nrdc 36 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.390
 kilometers of electric driving 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.370
 You won't save that if you are very calm 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.160
 does about 100 maximum runs then 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.350
 you can now do it 20 maybe 22km 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.700
 fully electric driving 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.350
 so that's not very much though 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.790
 well after that the client was going to be like 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.260
 normal hybrid that serves the step 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.030
 electric motor as support for the 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.380
 combustion engine and depending on you 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.120
 right foot and the charge status for 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.890
 You can still take a course package until 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.640
 about 60 to 70 kilometers per hour 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.640
 electric driving 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.420
 yes what does he use in practice 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.860
 well that's a bit tricky with one 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.840
 plug-in hybrid because it is strong 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.370
 depending on how your mileage is 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.050
 a small piece then riders 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.850
 relatively much electric very much 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.360
 economical but how long is the pieces 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.260
 to become 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.170
 the smaller the number of electrics 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.240
 mileage and how economical is still 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.460
 To give an idea, I'll soon 75 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.489
 km traveled and the consumption was 1 on 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:50.650
 15.6 if you are there at 20 km electric 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.890
 to fail then you come to a practice 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:58.530
 use of the rebreather part of 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.840
 drum roll drum roll one at 11.6 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.000
 And the good news is that it is more economical 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.950
 then a normal client but yes if 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.239
 everyone's capital from a prius to t 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.790
 nec hi-bit then guess the 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.540
 air quality in practice is not 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.540
 will really improve 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.939
 from the further notes at this canyon high 

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:35.379
 bear compared to normal times that is 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:37.180
 it nevertheless considerable weight 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.980
 that battery team is against quite a bit 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.609
 this test is also on the back 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.680
 winter tires 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.180
 so that of course does not help you either 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.590
 certainly notices if you first have a thing 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.390
 longer rotations to the right 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.220
 should then think forward to the left then 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.310
 notice your other a lot of weight 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.590
 it must really be an obese car 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.030
 and despite the fact that you have winter tire 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.010
 state must say it remains one 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.049
 whole achievement because of your air suspension 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.430
 in comfort set is really very comfortable 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.650
 seat more sport or sport plus than must 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.000
 ie noticeably tighter and even noticeable 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.459
 with winter tires when those things run out 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.139
 speed limit the turn 0 comes year and 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.819
 has a bit like being an elephant 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.639
 cord dancing it is very contradictory 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.930
 but it still happens for the rest 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:15.669
 it just once and that means whole 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.109
 which is nice to the free work of the whole 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:19.320
 well together and if you have gas once 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.320
 gives 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.130
 firstly, that of 60 sounds pretty nice 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:28.030
 and it goes very, very, very bad 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:29.680
 quickly there for that concerns yes it is 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.520
 not the prime of this car but I can 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.950
 it all 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.420
 and precisely that so I once thought he 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.690
 can do it all 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:40.020
 economical fast comfortable actually what 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.020
 you want 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.000
 for the we our portia importer is the 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.449
 client via hi-bit a great fun 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.560
 car 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.480
 because it means the client 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.949
 more affordable, more economical and fiscal 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.690
 becomes more attractive than he once was 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:58.090
 and for the rest this just remains one 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.380
 client yes he is less sharp but 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.820
 for the rest it is just awful 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.280
 strong all-rounder 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:04.540
 certainly with that air suspension is air suspension 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.310
 then of course already optional again 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.199
 it's a lot of other things on this one 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:10.030
 times and that means starting from price 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.310
 from 84 half a thousand euros 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.540
 again very soon and then it can be 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.020
 he remains taxable for a very long time 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.699
 interesting 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.080
 yes 40 percent addition means that 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.060
 He then still just love it just as much 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.950
 pay if let say a bit 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.540
 dressed up a6 with a 20% addition 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.310
 does of course mean who for this 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.720
 company must work with you and tom late 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.520
 break up on a car 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.630
 but good for this client is you 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.630
 case the trouble of asking where 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.210
 the
