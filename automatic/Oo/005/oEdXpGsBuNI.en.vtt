00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 This is it, guys, what you're talking about is a 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.620
 hobby one and this time I'm bringing 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.910
 one more video and in today's video will be 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.150
 a shorter video that I want 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.040
 explain to you again some 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.960
 design tips for those not 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.670
 getting to do the classes 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.160
 I heard some comments from the talking guys 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.350
 that was very difficult can not 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.269
 draw nothing then let's start from 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.590
 At first I think I've even said it. 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.199
 This is a video but anyway 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.580
 come on 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.330
 first of all before you start to 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.160
 to draw 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.140
 I do not know naruto a famous person, right? 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.500
 have to start with something else 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.600
 easy then puts in your head the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.120
 that you need to build the 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.250
 character shapes for example 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.090
 to draw the whole stick character 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.469
 world has done this when I was a child or 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:56.780
 when you have to say something 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.109
 thing and ends up doing it is not 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.609
 like this 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:06.510
 right or more winged yet you do 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.360
 That's normal, so let's start. 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.420
 to train instead of doing the 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.170
 character this way will do here 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.720
 different and so build a head 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.470
 make a ball nÃ© 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.210
 There you will pull down here square 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.210
 can thus pull up leaving space in the 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.869
 space to pull the line that is the neck 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.880
 your legs are fine, are you going to do one? 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.430
 business just a little bigger than 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.710
 square size plus one line 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.990
 okay then another line here in the arm 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.240
 ready now that you have to do this 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.000
 here it will serve you as a model 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.420
 to make the eyebrow as it haunts 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.939
 scene of a character of this size who 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.820
 It will depend on the style, actually. 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.250
 but let's try to do a very simple 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.500
 for everyone to do will make a 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.479
 Here the square a rectangle of a 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.909
 rectangle zin 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.629
 if you do not know where to put this 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:12.239
 eyebrow as it is divided here as 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.450
 I know the right time for poets will do 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:20.610
 this line 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.610
 a line of this color here more or less 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:31.330
 here and in the middle of the ball just do another 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.420
 line as soon as that line 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.250
 She will mark where you have to 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.730
 drawing is right in the middle 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.549
 only as rohs had turned to 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.360
 Okay, then what is it's eyes are fine? 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:46.709
 here o 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.660
 The eye will only make a beautiful yes. 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:54.519
 and the mouth down here can have a nose 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.980
 or not here French as said goes 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.819
 make a rectangle will make on top of the 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.500
 eye so is if you want to leave 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:04.569
 angry character 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.190
 you put your brow you higher up 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.620
 doing a 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.319
 if you want to leave a sad character 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:18.069
 can it be like this 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:22.299
 surprised eyebrow as if seen gives 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:24.040
 face of sad face and if you want a 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:25.690
 normal face as soon as it is 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:31.239
 calm 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:34.480
 Then your daughter, she may be a little bit 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:37.810

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:42.310
 we were so well is the guy's 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.350
 alright, alright 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.620
 In this very simple way you are 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.170
 drawing a character she had 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.769
 Then you can start filling it out. 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.329

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.340
 palette doll just that we take a 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.599
 improved it as we will 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.910
