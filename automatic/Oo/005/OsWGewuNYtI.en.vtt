stack it on top of that marshmallow on

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.920 
stack it on top of that marshmallow on
the<00:02:28.310> inside<00:02:28.610> you<00:02:28.760> can<00:02:28.790> use<00:02:29.150> an<00:02:29.270> extra<00:02:29.540> cupcake

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
the inside you can use an extra cupcake

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.540 
the inside you can use an extra cupcake
for<00:02:30.140> the<00:02:30.200> inside<00:02:30.530> but<00:02:30.800> I<00:02:30.980> like<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.280> look<00:02:31.400> of

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
for the inside but I like the look of

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.220 
for the inside but I like the look of
beer<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:32.060> inside<00:02:32.420> beats<00:02:32.690> being<00:02:32.900> a<00:02:32.960> little<00:02:33.140> bit

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
beer the inside beats being a little bit

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.440 
beer the inside beats being a little bit
smaller<00:02:33.530> a<00:02:33.890> little<00:02:34.460> bit<00:02:34.700> more<00:02:34.850> frosting<00:02:35.300> on

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
smaller a little bit more frosting on

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.840 
smaller a little bit more frosting on
that<00:02:35.630> one<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:37.010> those<00:02:37.100> ones<00:02:37.370> are<00:02:37.490> ready<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.760> go

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
that one and those ones are ready to go

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.010 
that one and those ones are ready to go
that's<00:02:38.030> just<00:02:38.300> going<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.600> stop<00:02:38.810> them<00:02:38.990> from

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
that's just going to stop them from

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.650 
that's just going to stop them from
moving<00:02:39.320> around<00:02:39.560> with<00:02:40.400> my<00:02:40.670> Twizzlers<00:02:41.390> down

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
moving around with my Twizzlers down

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.050 
moving around with my Twizzlers down
here<00:02:41.930> I<00:02:42.050> actually<00:02:42.500> tore<00:02:42.890> my<00:02:43.130> twizzler<00:02:43.580> in<00:02:43.790> half

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
here I actually tore my twizzler in half

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.120 
here I actually tore my twizzler in half
so<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.390> got<00:02:44.600> two<00:02:44.900> stems<00:02:45.230> from<00:02:45.530> each<00:02:45.709> twizzler

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
so I got two stems from each twizzler

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.980 
so I got two stems from each twizzler
they<00:02:46.580> do<00:02:46.640> tear<00:02:47.000> quite<00:02:47.209> easily<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:47.840> can

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
they do tear quite easily and you can

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.199 
they do tear quite easily and you can
also<00:02:48.170> cut<00:02:48.560> them<00:02:48.680> if<00:02:48.860> you<00:02:49.010> like<00:02:49.190> but<00:02:49.790> basically

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
also cut them if you like but basically

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.060 
also cut them if you like but basically
I<00:02:50.300> just<00:02:50.600> tore<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:50.990> twizzler<00:02:51.380> in<00:02:51.500> half<00:02:51.709> and

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
I just tore the twizzler in half and

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.380 
I just tore the twizzler in half and
gave<00:02:53.000> it<00:02:53.150> a<00:02:53.180> little<00:02:53.330> twist<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:55.850> spirit<00:02:56.209> leaves

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
gave it a little twist the spirit leaves

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.600 
gave it a little twist the spirit leaves
speak<00:02:56.660> for<00:02:56.840> themselves<00:02:57.200> so<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.739> attach<00:02:58.340> the

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
speak for themselves so to attach the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.580 
speak for themselves so to attach the
Twizzlers<00:02:59.000> it's<00:02:59.420> really<00:02:59.840> just<00:03:00.050> as<00:03:00.170> simple<00:03:00.470> as

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
Twizzlers it's really just as simple as

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.470 
Twizzlers it's really just as simple as
a<00:03:00.739> little<00:03:00.980> bit<00:03:01.070> more<00:03:01.220> frosting<00:03:01.640> just<00:03:01.670> a<00:03:02.150> really

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
a little bit more frosting just a really

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.479 
a little bit more frosting just a really
little<00:03:02.600> bit<00:03:02.870> on<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.770> back<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.160> you<00:03:04.250> can<00:03:04.280> also

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489
