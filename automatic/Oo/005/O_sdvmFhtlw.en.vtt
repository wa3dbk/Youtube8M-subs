with<00:01:11.900> a<00:01:11.930> sighting<00:01:13.270> window<00:01:15.190> you've<00:01:16.190> got<00:01:16.400> a<00:01:16.780> SMB

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
with a sighting window you've got a SMB

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.940 
with a sighting window you've got a SMB
and<00:01:19.120> you've<00:01:20.120> got<00:01:20.300> some<00:01:20.480> line<00:01:20.780> with<00:01:21.620> a<00:01:21.650> weight

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
and you've got some line with a weight

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.270 
and you've got some line with a weight
and<00:01:22.310> a<00:01:23.090> clip<00:01:23.420> we<00:01:24.320> just<00:01:24.350> have<00:01:24.620> a<00:01:24.680> closer<00:01:24.920> look<00:01:25.040> at

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
and a clip we just have a closer look at

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.730 
and a clip we just have a closer look at
the<00:01:25.370> SMB<00:01:25.850> then<00:01:26.120> right<00:01:26.420> just<00:01:27.020> unwind<00:01:27.470> it<00:01:29.560> as<00:01:30.560> you

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
the SMB then right just unwind it as you

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.940 
the SMB then right just unwind it as you
can<00:01:30.830> see<00:01:30.890> delayed<00:01:31.460> SMB<00:01:32.410> it's<00:01:33.410> an<00:01:33.500> unsealed

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
can see delayed SMB it's an unsealed

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.620 
can see delayed SMB it's an unsealed
version<00:01:34.490> but<00:01:34.610> it<00:01:34.700> is<00:01:34.730> weighted<00:01:35.300> you've<00:01:35.450> got

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
version but it is weighted you've got

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.230 
version but it is weighted you've got
four<00:01:35.900> little<00:01:36.340> lumps<00:01:37.340> of<00:01:37.460> lead<00:01:37.640> weight<00:01:38.000> down

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
four little lumps of lead weight down

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.720 
four little lumps of lead weight down
the<00:01:38.330> bottom<00:01:38.600> here<00:01:38.780> to<00:01:38.810> stop<00:01:39.050> it<00:01:39.080> toppling<00:01:39.560> over

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
the bottom here to stop it toppling over

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.580 
the bottom here to stop it toppling over
good<00:01:40.730> clip<00:01:40.970> on<00:01:41.150> the<00:01:41.270> end<00:01:41.300> nice<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:42.470> high

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
good clip on the end nice and high

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.800 
good clip on the end nice and high
visibility<00:01:42.800> send<00:01:43.610> that<00:01:43.760> up<00:01:43.910> certainly<00:01:44.690> people

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
visibility send that up certainly people

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.660 
visibility send that up certainly people
are<00:01:44.930> going<00:01:45.020> to<00:01:45.110> see<00:01:45.320> it<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:45.680> the<00:01:46.310> fact<00:01:46.520> it

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
are going to see it and the fact it

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.540 
are going to see it and the fact it
won't<00:01:46.820> fall<00:01:47.000> over<00:01:47.030> is<00:01:47.330> great<00:01:48.250> obviously<00:01:49.250> you

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
won't fall over is great obviously you

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.540 
won't fall over is great obviously you
can<00:01:49.670> clip<00:01:49.820> it<00:01:49.940> on<00:01:50.350> using<00:01:51.350> your<00:01:51.470> line<00:01:51.680> and<00:01:52.070> you

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
can clip it on using your line and you

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.920 
can clip it on using your line and you
got<00:01:52.640> your<00:01:52.760> lid<00:01:52.909> weight<00:01:53.120> there<00:01:53.360> so<00:01:53.840> you<00:01:53.900> just

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
got your lid weight there so you just

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.330 
got your lid weight there so you just
hold<00:01:54.230> it<00:01:54.380> around<00:01:54.530> your<00:01:54.710> hand<00:01:54.830> remember<00:01:55.250> this

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
hold it around your hand remember this
