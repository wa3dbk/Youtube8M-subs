canoe these were my most used handhelds
and<00:01:52.549> anyway<00:01:53.549> long<00:01:53.970> story<00:01:54.000> short<00:01:55.670> I<00:01:56.670> was<00:01:57.450> using

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
and anyway long story short I was using

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.039 
and anyway long story short I was using
that<00:01:58.259> I'd<00:01:58.829> actually<00:01:59.040> relocated<00:01:59.610> this<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:01.020> a

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
that I'd actually relocated this to a

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.380 
that I'd actually relocated this to a
lower<00:02:01.380> shelf<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.189> was<00:02:02.369> quite<00:02:02.790> close<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
lower shelf that was quite close to the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.469 
lower shelf that was quite close to the
ground<00:02:03.530> actually<00:02:04.880> figuring<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.090> know<00:02:06.119> this

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
ground actually figuring you know this

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.749 
ground actually figuring you know this
will<00:02:06.659> be<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.840> safer<00:02:07.590> place<00:02:07.770> for<00:02:07.890> me<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.310> keep<00:02:08.580> it

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
will be a safer place for me to keep it

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.420 
will be a safer place for me to keep it
and<00:02:08.959> then<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:09.989> was<00:02:10.349> shredding<00:02:10.739> some<00:02:10.920> papers

of it sideways and I saw this and I was
like<00:03:17.199> oh<00:03:17.500> no<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:19.090> I<00:03:19.750> realized<00:03:20.379> what<00:03:20.889> had

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
like oh no and I realized what had

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.879 
like oh no and I realized what had
happened<00:03:21.489> was<00:03:21.549> the<00:03:21.909> the<00:03:22.449> shredder<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.650> heavy

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:23.889 
happened was the the shredder the heavy

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.729 
happened was the the shredder the heavy
part<00:03:24.010> of<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.459> shredder<00:03:24.819> must<00:03:25.629> have<00:03:25.840> impacted

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
part of the shredder must have impacted

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.589 
part of the shredder must have impacted
this<00:03:26.919> it<00:03:27.129> wasn't<00:03:27.430> from<00:03:27.549> the<00:03:27.669> fall<00:03:27.879> because<00:03:28.479> it

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599 
this it wasn't from the fall because it

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.629 
this it wasn't from the fall because it
was<00:03:28.720> only<00:03:28.810> a<00:03:28.930> foot<00:03:29.229> off<00:03:29.349> the<00:03:29.379> ground<00:03:29.639> carpeted

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
was only a foot off the ground carpeted

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:36.129 
floor bought during the fall the

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.460 
floor bought during the fall the
obviously<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.269> you<00:03:37.629> know<00:03:37.750> the<00:03:37.900> edge<00:03:38.049> of<00:03:38.290> the

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
obviously the you know the edge of the

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.280 
obviously the you know the edge of the
shredder<00:03:38.829> or<00:03:38.979> the<00:03:39.189> top<00:03:39.459> of<00:03:39.639> the<00:03:39.729> shredder

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
shredder or the top of the shredder

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.599 
shredder or the top of the shredder
impacted<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.409> screen<00:03:41.769> like<00:03:42.040> it<00:03:42.220> probably

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
impacted the screen like it probably

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.999 
impacted the screen like it probably
impacted<00:03:43.389> bounced<00:03:44.079> off<00:03:44.199> and<00:03:44.530> everything<00:03:44.859> was

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:45.009 
impacted bounced off and everything was

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:47.280 
impacted bounced off and everything was
lying<00:03:45.280> on<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.489> ground<00:03:45.790> and<00:03:46.150> because<00:03:47.049> i<00:03:47.079> had

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
lying on the ground and because i had

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.520 
lying on the ground and because i had
only<00:03:47.409> seen<00:03:47.739> it<00:03:47.949> head<00:03:48.669> on<00:03:49.049> basically<00:03:50.049> like<00:03:50.259> that

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
only seen it head on basically like that

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.170 
only seen it head on basically like that
i<00:03:50.799> didn't<00:03:51.129> notice<00:03:51.250> there<00:03:51.579> was<00:03:51.639> anything<00:03:51.879> wrong

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
i didn't notice there was anything wrong

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.499 
i didn't notice there was anything wrong
so<00:03:53.109> i<00:03:53.139> noticed<00:03:53.590> these<00:03:53.739> cracks<00:03:54.129> I<00:03:54.609> thought<00:03:55.180> oh

00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:55.509 
so i noticed these cracks I thought oh

00:03:55.509 --> 00:03:58.679 
so i noticed these cracks I thought oh
man<00:03:56.290> and<00:03:56.979> then<00:03:57.099> I<00:03:57.129> hope<00:03:57.400> that<00:03:57.609> first<00:03:57.970> I<00:03:58.329> know

00:03:58.679 --> 00:03:58.689 
man and then I hope that first I know

00:03:58.689 --> 00:04:00.210 
man and then I hope that first I know
it's<00:03:58.900> crazy<00:03:59.079> but<00:03:59.290> I<00:03:59.439> thought<00:03:59.650> maybe<00:03:59.889> it's<00:04:00.129> just

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
it's crazy but I thought maybe it's just

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.119 
it's crazy but I thought maybe it's just
is<00:04:00.579> it<00:04:00.729> like<00:04:00.849> a<00:04:00.879> screen<00:04:01.389> protector<00:04:01.659> and<00:04:02.319> you

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
is it like a screen protector and you

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.420 
is it like a screen protector and you
know<00:04:03.220> I<00:04:03.250> peeled<00:04:03.669> the<00:04:03.819> edge<00:04:03.939> and<00:04:04.180> I<00:04:04.269> noticed<00:04:05.430> it

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
know I peeled the edge and I noticed it

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.699 
know I peeled the edge and I noticed it
does<00:04:06.669> come<00:04:06.879> off<00:04:07.030> like<00:04:07.269> that<00:04:07.530> but<00:04:08.530> then<00:04:08.680> I

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
does come off like that but then I

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.589 
does come off like that but then I
looked<00:04:08.949> underneath<00:04:09.250> and<00:04:09.639> you<00:04:09.759> can<00:04:09.909> see<00:04:10.239> it's

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599 
looked underneath and you can see it's

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:13.219 
looked underneath and you can see it's
the<00:04:10.780> glass<00:04:11.049> on<00:04:11.379> the<00:04:11.409> cracked<00:04:11.829> screen<00:04:12.220> itself

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:13.229 
the glass on the cracked screen itself

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:17.759 
the glass on the cracked screen itself
and<00:04:14.229> I<00:04:14.500> thought<00:04:14.769> well<00:04:15.099> okay<00:04:15.340> it<00:04:16.090> sucks<00:04:16.810> that

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
and I thought well okay it sucks that

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.890 
and I thought well okay it sucks that
the<00:04:17.949> screen<00:04:18.250> is<00:04:18.310> cracked<00:04:18.820> like<00:04:19.120> that<00:04:19.449> but

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
the screen is cracked like that but

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.100 
the screen is cracked like that but
maybe<00:04:20.349> hopefully<00:04:20.859> maybe<00:04:21.519> if<00:04:21.789> I<00:04:21.969> you<00:04:22.690> know<00:04:22.719> turn

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
maybe hopefully maybe if I you know turn

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.710 
maybe hopefully maybe if I you know turn
it<00:04:23.260> on<00:04:23.849> see<00:04:24.849> if<00:04:24.880> I<00:04:25.029> ok

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
it on see if I ok

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.390 
it on see if I ok
it<00:04:25.870> turns<00:04:26.140> on<00:04:26.320> still<00:04:26.770> I<00:04:27.180> thought<00:04:28.180> well<00:04:29.400> you

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
it turns on still I thought well you

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.660 
it turns on still I thought well you
know<00:04:30.430> I'm<00:04:30.790> broken<00:04:31.240> out<00:04:31.570> of<00:04:31.600> work<00:04:31.960> and<00:04:32.640> you<00:04:33.640> know

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
know I'm broken out of work and you know

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.850 
know I'm broken out of work and you know
just<00:04:34.090> not<00:04:34.240> had<00:04:34.450> a<00:04:34.480> lot<00:04:34.660> of<00:04:34.690> great<00:04:35.290> luck<00:04:35.590> lately

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
just not had a lot of great luck lately

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.880 
just not had a lot of great luck lately
so<00:04:36.640> I<00:04:36.670> thought<00:04:36.790> well<00:04:37.180> maybe<00:04:37.240> still<00:04:37.990> at<00:04:38.620> least

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
so I thought well maybe still at least

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.590 
so I thought well maybe still at least
with<00:04:39.070> the<00:04:39.190> screen<00:04:39.460> you<00:04:39.730> know<00:04:39.880> what<00:04:40.210> still

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
with the screen you know what still

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.070 
with the screen you know what still

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.760 
worked but as you can see I can't even
unlock<00:04:44.320> it<00:04:44.770> because<00:04:45.130> the<00:04:45.400> touch<00:04:46.140> the<00:04:47.140> top<00:04:47.380> the

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
unlock it because the touch the top the

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.260 
unlock it because the touch the top the
touch<00:04:48.010> function<00:04:48.550> is<00:04:48.670> not<00:04:48.820> even<00:04:49.060> working

touch function is not even working

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.540 
touch function is not even working
anymore<00:04:49.540> now<00:04:50.350> it<00:04:50.500> keeps<00:04:50.650> going<00:04:50.920> timing<00:04:51.460> out

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
anymore now it keeps going timing out

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.090 
anymore now it keeps going timing out
because<00:04:52.000> it's<00:04:52.510> not<00:04:52.750> sensing<00:04:53.260> any<00:04:53.410> touch<00:04:53.740> and

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
because it's not sensing any touch and

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.180 
because it's not sensing any touch and

so the the screen dimmer is kicking in

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.910 
so the the screen dimmer is kicking in
automatically<00:04:57.760> and<00:04:58.140> this<00:04:59.140> is<00:04:59.320> the<00:04:59.620> crazy
