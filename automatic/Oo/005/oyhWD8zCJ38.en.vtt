 Tariffs also throw mobile phone simple 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.830
 on 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.089
 The End 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:24.119
 the mobile Internet increasingly popular decline of Nokia continues Samsung 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.329
 continue in the fast lane and telekom- customers should be wrong bills 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:29.499
 got 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:33.540
 And there's a lot more in our new Insight phone - Flesh 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.540
 I am worth Alexander Kain 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.290
 Every third person would like to surf the internet on the internet 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.110
 Increasing interest in the use of the mobile Internet after a survey of the 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.830
 Bundesverband für digitale Wirtschaft already over 33 percent of the 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.019
 German citizens wish 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.790
 Surf the web from everywhere on the internet 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.310
 The interest in the mobile Internet is mainly with the younger users 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.860
 strong 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.690
 Of the 16 to 24-year-old users, 65 percent want the Mobile Internet 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.730
 use 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.730
 among users aged 25 to 34, it is still 47 percent 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.800
 the older the German citizen the lower his interest in the mobile 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.659
 Internet 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.979
 only 17 percent of people over the age of 55 want to use the mobile phone in the 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.080
 Surf Internet 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.760
 These figures clearly reflect the terminal penetration in the 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.910
 Population again 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.160
 moreover, the higher the social status is 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.409
 Household net income the higher the interest in mobile surfing 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.640
 as much as 49 percent and thus almost half of the higher-earning users 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.149
 more about a net income of more than 4000 euros a month 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:43.799
 rely on the use of mobile Internet among users with one 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.329
 Net income below two and a half thousand euros, however, they only 27% the needs of 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:52.329
 mobile internet 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.060
 Nokia continues on a downhill cigar long spoiled by success it runs for the 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.280
 The world's largest mobile phone maker Nokia currently downright miserable 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.050
 For the second quarter of 2011, the company again had a falling 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.299
 Sales figures and a loss of 368 million euros 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.780
 In total, Nokia has 88 million mobile phones 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.790
 20 percent fewer units than in the previous year 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.440
 In particular, the smartphone sales dropped dramatically 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.070
 The Finns sold 24 decimal 2 million devices in the first quarter 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.759
 between April and June there were only 16 comma 7 million 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:35.979
 but also the sales of the classic mobile phones have become less with 

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:40.989
 The commons lost fifteen percent compared to 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.099
 2010 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.779
 so Nokia should be the first place among the largest mobile phone manufacturers 

00:02:45.779 --> 00:02:49.400
 as Weeze almost lost the group has been fighting for some time 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.489
 with falling market shares 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.189
 Earlier this year, nokia-chef Stephen Elop announced a new one 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:56.360
 Strategy 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.550
 Since then, the focus of the Finns has been on various austerity measures 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.740
 quite on the cooperation with Microsoft the delivery of the first Nokia 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.500
 Models with Windows Phone should follow this year and the long-awaited 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.500
 Turnaround bring 

00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.859
 The Koreans, on the other hand, are quite different from the past year 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.409
 For Samsung more than successful and the current should be even better 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:24.219
 Samsung wants to sell 300 million mobile phones this year 

00:03:24.219 --> 00:03:26.509
 in an interview with the South Korean news agency 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:31.809
 Yonhap gave the samsung boss for Mobber Communiqué Schinz I hung Junction's 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:36.509
 Goals of the electronics company are known to be in 2011 overall around is 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:41.349
 sell tens of millions of smartphones and 240 million classic cell phones 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.659
 at least the smartphone number of the previous year would be significantly exceeded 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:48.540
 Although the mobile phone sales of the South Koreans was last year with 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.450
 280 million higher than the 2011 planned 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:53.950
 however, Mann brought up 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.499
 only 25 million smartphones 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:04:00.199
 a large part of this year's success is the current clearly 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:03.399
 Sales racers contribute to the Galaxy s2 

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:06.729
 In addition, there are still some smartphones with the in-house for this year 

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:09.729
 Operating system Bada in planning 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:17.630
 a stalemate loses 35 percent of Android has as Apple after its record numbers 

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:21.680
 for the past quarter was submitted, among other things, clear that the iPad 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.580
 2 could make a big contribution to the high profit but the 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.870
 Competition does not sleep 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.480
 According to statistics from Strategy Analytics, Apple's tablet market share in 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:35.370
 just one year from just under 95 percent to 60 percent 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.150
 Overall, Herbert Markt is steadily growing 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.560
 In the second quarter of 2010, just three and a half million devices were connected to the 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.260
 Man brought 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.410
 of which three comma 3 million iPad only one year later officially the number on 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.280
 grown over 15 million 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.509
 that makes a plus of 331 percent 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:55.770
 thanks to the upcoming release of Aloys 5 and 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.559
 Google's existing and mature android versions Hanni is likely to come 

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:02.559
 the number continues to rise 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:07.939
 Telekom should have cheated millions of customers, the German Telekom should loud 

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:10.939
 a report of the mirror consumers and customers with double bills 

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:12.250
 have cheated 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.270
 in total, it should be a three-digit million amount 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:20.089
 zig the magazine on a criminal complaint the with the public prosecutor's office Bonn 

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:21.279
 was submitted 

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:24.879
 the Telekom, meanwhile, rejected the allegations back the two should 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:29.020
 Founder of various information services Klaus Harisch and Peter Wünsch reimbursed 

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:32.779
 have already had several civil proceedings against Telekom in the past 

00:05:32.779 --> 00:05:34.129
 have denied 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:37.909
 while the group is to repay more than 80 million euros 

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:39.259
 have been convicted 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.469
 According to the mirror, the Telekom has repayable costs for the construction and 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:46.990
 The care of their customer databases can be refunded twice 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.759
 the connection fees are on the one hand on millions of customers have been passed 

00:05:50.759 --> 00:05:51.339
 his 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:54.609
 At the same time, the telecommunications company also has 

00:05:54.609 --> 00:05:58.439
 the contributions from competitors let those pay for their business on data 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:01.439
 the telecom are dependent 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.369
 and from the front Mango is Dreieich 

00:06:05.369 --> 00:06:08.939
 Microsoft has announced the completion of Windows Phone Mango 

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:12.849

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.340
 bring 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.040
 With the market holds next to the long-awaited multitasking also for 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:38.279
 Smartphones optimized Internet Explorer 9 on the phone 

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:41.899
 Microsoft has also improved the e-mail and message functions 

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:45.719
 In addition, the micro-blogging service Twitter with just as deep into the system 

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:46.819
 integrated 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:49.819
 this is already the case on Facebook 

00:06:51.499 --> 00:06:55.069
 I came across her out of court with Apple 

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:59.250
 Only recently, Apple called for a ban on imports of all they came across 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:03.139
 and adjourned the Taiwanese due to several patent infringements 

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:06.770
 As the news portal Bloomberg reports GDL now pushed them to the

 Californians too and wants to out of court Dieter Wanner 

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:14.919
 For too long, the conditions should be fair and appropriate for too long 

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:18.400
 In addition, both companies should already have a solution before 

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.409
 have negotiated 

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:23.009
 the talks are but for a long time on ice Apple wanted to but

 according to Bloomberg not comment on it 

00:07:25.059 --> 00:07:28.400
 Apple has already achieved a partial success against EHEC 

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.100
 according to the American International Trade Commission 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.720
 Cliché the Taiwanese smartphone maker violates at least two

 Apple patents after further cases the CITC's allegations 

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.460
