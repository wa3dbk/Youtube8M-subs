00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 good afternoon guys came back again 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.730
 How do you know about the videos I made? 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.519
 wine where sam meet the seven ripper 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.130
 of the other cars I have I love 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.560
 test buy novelty see if it works 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.210
 same as same thing I did not find 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.140
 anyone who has yet to use 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:25.320
 To test this happened a lot in the river and I 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.460
 I came to do one of these things today. 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.039
 this here 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.769
 can see that it is an original part of the 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:38.129
 traxx or even the number is here is 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:41.910
 6 is focused on the number 6469 is a 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.079
 a very suggestive number but what 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.160
 serving it here 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:51.360
 here are these pieces where are you going? 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.190
 this is where rex is the hobby will 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.969
 And you actually call it here. 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.859
 here is the cabinet or 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.410
 you like it more so 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.229
 What is the difference between this one and 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.200
 original thing to see is precisely this 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:11.970
 space here there is more to focus again 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.500
 What's happening is that there's more going on. 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.030
 will only leave a little 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.950
 further out 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.170
 only I was not sure if this here 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.960
 to run in the semifinal because that is 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.330
 made for sex trafficking and there 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.750
 I did bought anyway to protest and 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.060
 worked thank god'll show 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.970
 you the difference between one and another 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.329
 Look at this one on the left and tried 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.570
 manually finalizing new here 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:42.240
 ready and left is original and if 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.829
 on the right is the ex or am on the 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.729
 the height difference will not get you 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.060
 In the hand that you see, position yourself 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.060
 on here 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.560
 I went to make it go back to where 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.140
 I was back to where the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.439
 the left or the left 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.429
 right are well're right 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.270
 or is going to have this space here for more 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.549
 nothing out 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.980
 I confess it's not a lot of people 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.049
 is to ask for anything by a centimeter 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.090
 but I want this one centimeter 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:19.660
 the plus is one centimeter more than 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.970
 will probably help in stability 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.220
 of my environment is not going to be a 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.739
 great progress but it already helps 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.620
 especially for those who use some 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:35.290
 another tire without being original or even 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:36.190
 this my picking of laet hpi what 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.349
 happens 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.200
 Can you happen to the wheel that is 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:45.250
 how to raise the suspension pick up the bubble in the 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:48.129
 if he does not take the hpi or formal here 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.959
 looking out the bubble slope but 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.799
 depending on the model of the 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:56.739
 tire and with that I got better 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:03:00.310
 bring more change before it means 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:04.209
 now and then there is also the difference 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.700
 this difference the beauty guys just more 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.810
 a novelty to show you 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.459
 it works like that sir 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.569
 you can see that the back here 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:16.959
 which is where the axis enters the same 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:22.599
 size then comes either perfect and 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:25.630
 The rate moths are here also reach the 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.430
 had to look for this to happen 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.319
 Why did you get fucked up believe me? 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.530
 or not good that did not come just that nor 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.690
 some other things but I 've already seen 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.160
 in the hour for you how are you 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.160
 This is it people, bye, bye.
