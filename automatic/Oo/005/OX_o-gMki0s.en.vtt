00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 healthy to all with you channel maximum games 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.690
 my name is max and today we finally 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:14.660
 We'll be testing with you and like 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.220
 game from the developers you are a member of which 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.380
 developed on the chrome game engine 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:25.019
 engine 6 and judging by this game this engine 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.449
 gives you an incredible picture in 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.929
 In general, this is a complete next-gen game 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.390
 and today we will test it 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.090
 let's see what it shows in general 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.460
 You can already see which vps game 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.320
 shows me in the game I picked up more 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.899
 is a busy place where we can 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.610
 fps sink these very critical in 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.100
 Generally, if you look at these houses 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.940
 along with the zombars the game shows me 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.920
 about 35 fps on average and if 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.480
 turn back there to other places here 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.940
 we already have 40 fps 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.190
 well, so the game behaves pretty 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.299
 not bad and you can see that fps 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.150
 it sinks at no less than 29 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:14.119
 ok and now i'll show you on what 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:16.650
 graphics settings i play in general 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.140
 I have such graphics settings 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.590
 vertical sync naturally 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.259
 texture quality is off me 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.650
 high shadow map size medium 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.810
 high foliage quality and range 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.400
 I have a review worth a little less than half 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:37.110
 I'll tell you what this function is enough 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.360
 gluttonous and let me give you this now 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.990
 demonstrate set and it's all on 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.000
 maximum of and now you will see which in 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.979
 press the game will show in general 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.439
 FPS 20-22 but when moving fps will be more 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.110
 squander more I'll tell you this feature 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.560
 especially not what does not affect even if 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.380
 us put this feature completely on 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.659
 at least we are practically apart from the detail 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.020
 the world is such a trifle 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.289
 see nothing more 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:13.020
 In principle, everything is the same but small 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.900
 details that were far away they just 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.150
 disappeared because we have them in general 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.160
 disconnected but I have FPS right here 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:25.620
 began to show 4040 well, and 37 to 40 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.720
 let's return everything as it was in general 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.510
 you can rewind if video and 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.760
 see what this function gives and what not 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.670
 gives and principle here on such settings 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.099
 I'm very comfortable to play if 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.790
 turn off the record then play something here 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:45.120
 show about 35-40 fps in this 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.970
 busy place and this is us gene game i 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.470
 I'll tell you very optimized yes 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.290
 here the nissan texture is not super high 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.970
 permissions but the game is so 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:59.580
 detailed and so here everything is 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.459
 quality is made that really on her 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.730
 nice to watch here all done 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.890
 very high level let's go back 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.810
 to the graphics settings and see what 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.680
 us further 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.480
 lunch from levshins this crap is shorter 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.750
 adds a slight shading to such 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.970
 places like corners and either something else but i 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:24.060
 I turned off this function because I'm on those 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:26.190
 I do nâ€™t like to watch the game 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.190
 I'm going to play and not admire super 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.500
 realistic shadows but i will say that this 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:36.659
 game well, the maximum if she eats something 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:39.299
 12 fps and affects the graphics card and that 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:42.750
 plus as you can remember by mine 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:45.750
 I also disable the last video because 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:50.250
 it just adds 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:53.129
 more shading for shadows and me 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.230
 here are enough ordinary shadows and more 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.209
 do not need anything 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.909
 stirring do not know how to stress 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.489
 but this crap 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:04.830
 turns on motion blur in general 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:06.870
 then when turning you see how the game 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.970
 starts behaving smarter fps noticeably 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.360
 starts to sink because of this crap 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.370
 so I turned it off and I do not know why 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.270
 fps starts to sink but without it 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.420
 much take 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:21.090
 do not play in general, everything is clearly visible I 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.480
 I do not know if someone can do better with this 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.870
 crap play but me personally so very and 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:30.690
 not bad to play smoothing at me 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.330
 also disabled but I'll tell you guys what 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.240
 smoothing here is just great 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.840
 this anti-aliasing removes all bumps 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.110
 on objects smoothing performed here 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.060
 just at the highest level 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.750
 I have nowhere for nowhere such a smoothing 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:51.090
 met but also this smoothing 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.890
 zamylaivaet picture and but I would not say 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.970
 what is this anti-aliasing personally on my 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.110
 video card 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:05:00.330
 lives some resources but i play without 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.670
 smoothing because i like 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.220
 when the picture looks clear and I would not 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.130
 said that they play without smoothing 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.010
 so striking with his 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.710
 ladders in general, then there is not everything here and so 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.230
 looks pretty good here no 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.840
 such serious big ladders let's 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.660
 we'll go over in general, then you already 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.090
 managed to notice what graphics settings 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.670
 I stand and look here when running 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.380
 in this city until the game is a little frisit 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.220
 but I hope it with patches all 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.160
 get well 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:36.660
 Here, while running, the game behaves according to 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:39.720
 shows 27 28 fps in general 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:42.060
 I want to tell you that I tried 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.720
 select such graphics settings to 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:49.920
 FPS did not fall less than 30 but how can we 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:52.050
 see on record the game while moving in 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.400
 such busy places like this here 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.440
 look at how many objects here 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:00.140
 how many zombies are there 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:05.010
 while all the game sags a maximum of 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:08.720
 27 fps in general, then the game I will tell you very much 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:11.760
 and very well optimized in terms of 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.610
 video cards for nvidia because here 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:17.130
 buns for invaders of video cards i'm not 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:19.530
 I know how the game will behave on radeon 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.140
 Kohno seems to me that everything will be worse 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.360
 This business look in general then you write 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:27.449
 in comments who Rodion ki how goes 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.309
 behaves the game can also be 

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:31.379
 to be worse because I heard that 

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:33.270
 optimization is more better done for 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:37.289
 cards from invidia 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:41.550
 I have an intel core i3 2120 

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:42.900
 4 line dual core 33 GHz per 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:47.969
 core and 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:50.449
 and nvidia jetics jifors 760 with two 

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:53.339
 memory you see how the game we have 

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:57.210
 sags when zombies start to attack 

00:06:53.339 --> 00:07:00.150
 Well, in general, this is a matter more often and here we are 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:03.629
 it will not go and I have 8 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:06.029
 gigabytes of ram in general 

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:08.699
 that's all i wanted to say and say 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:11.180
 boldly who has average cars like u 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:15.029
 me but i know that most already 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:18.300
 intel core i5 costs at a minimum and in fact 

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:20.699
 cards are good but the game requires 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.710
 I have enough video cards 

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:25.770
 but if not to use all these 

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:27.779
 like Ashby's buns, but this function is there 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:30.870
 still which shadow adds more 

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:33.330
 realistic she the fuck does not need to 

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:36.449
 In general, this is how the game behaves quite 

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:40.199
 not bad here when cornering happens fps 

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:43.069
 sags to 26 25 but for a second 

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:45.719
 and no more in general, that 's all 

00:07:43.069 --> 00:07:47.759
 subscribe to the channel put likes with
