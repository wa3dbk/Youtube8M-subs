one and the LG g3 so let's start off

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.620 
one and the LG g3 so let's start off
here<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:07.710> shaking<00:00:08.429> them<00:00:08.580> off<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:09.179> little<00:00:09.450> bit

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
here and shaking them off a little bit

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.749 
here and shaking them off a little bit
so<00:00:10.340> let's<00:00:11.340> begin<00:00:11.730> here<00:00:12.150> so<00:00:12.630> to<00:00:12.690> start<00:00:12.990> off<00:00:13.049> here

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:13.759 
so let's begin here so to start off here

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:16.670 
so let's begin here so to start off here
one<00:00:14.759> has<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.059> quad<00:00:15.299> HD<00:00:15.389> display<00:00:15.660> here<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.230> LG<00:00:16.440> g3

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
one has a quad HD display here the LG g3

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.040 
one has a quad HD display here the LG g3
so<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.279> can<00:00:17.430> see<00:00:17.630> extremely<00:00:18.630> high<00:00:18.840> resolution

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
so you can see extremely high resolution

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.800 
so you can see extremely high resolution
text<00:00:20.060> you<00:00:21.060> really<00:00:21.300> need<00:00:21.449> it

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
text you really need it

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.070 
text you really need it
probably<00:00:22.199> not<00:00:22.439> because<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.080> high

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
probably not because it is so high

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.040 
probably not because it is so high
resolution<00:00:26.150> but<00:00:27.150> it's<00:00:27.269> pretty<00:00:27.390> cool<00:00:27.660> to<00:00:27.930> have

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
resolution but it's pretty cool to have

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.990 
resolution but it's pretty cool to have
it<00:00:28.080> because<00:00:28.769> not<00:00:28.949> all<00:00:29.189> smartphones<00:00:29.609> at<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
it because not all smartphones at the

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.120 
it because not all smartphones at the
moment<00:00:30.269> have<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.679> probably<00:00:31.679> pretty<00:00:31.830> awesome

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
moment have that probably pretty awesome

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.810 
moment have that probably pretty awesome
for<00:00:32.250> reading<00:00:33.710> versus<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.800> 1080p<00:00:35.250> display<00:00:35.370> here

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820
