00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.950
 hello I hope you are quite well and 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.799
 we are with a new gameplay of this 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.690
 ship the truth I really liked that it 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:11.799
 flame killzone bishop of we can ' so 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:13.780
 the player calls anyway 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.180
 I will obviously put in the title 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.630
 and well I wanted to bring a little more 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.060
 variety and still to see we go down tantito 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.070
 the volume and still we're still 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.200
 with our dear friend Steve here 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.820
 we can have it and much more 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.509
 customization I think that out there too 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.509
 there is the link 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.000
 here is perfect but good they say no 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.130
 we are going to use it right now we are going to use 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.980
 steve and well you have to try this game 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.660
 Well, maybe some of you already know it and 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.290
 If not then they should know it because 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:49.040
 it's pretty cool and ok it 's like the 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.900
 type call of duty black ops' zombies are 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.870
 I could say I do not know why that came out 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.890
 advertising I never left and then try 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.500
 to survive 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.720
 waves of zombies what we already have 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.239
 firing the controls as they are very 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.400
 simple but at the same time there are times 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.860
 comes to complicate the game is quite 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.110
 great there is a huge variety of weapons 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.850
 even out there there's a megaman cannon 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.570
 I do not know if many know about mega bad 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.460
 because they are somewhat young but I do 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.490
 I know him so 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.580
 very well we kill these ok as they can 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.020
 see let's put together money and we can 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.200
 for example activate this part here 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.920
 we go up we go up and we can buy this 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.159
 buy a rifle and so this 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.720
 we kill faster even though they go 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:37.550
 having much more life as they go 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.130
 advancing the waves one coming a 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.380
 stowaway stowaway Drop Dead Drop Dead 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.290
 ok also we take this is what it does 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.720
 Well, as if you're cutting them up there 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.350
 it's perfect perfect I'll put something in 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.590
 the great face ok we also have a 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.300
 good syringe that injection that makes 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.289
 shoot much faster just like 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.630
 we reload we are in round 6 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.009
 perfect children of parents I do not know why 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.380
 that who happens to enter a 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.709
 police station where all the 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.450
 doors are closed and there is a 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.170
 zombie invasion is a little clumsy for 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.150
 part of steve but good 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.310
 that does not matter in these games that does not 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.890
 matter the logic here no no no no no 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.500
 ok does not exist to see 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:27.060
 we shoot because perfect 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.920
 and even though it looks very simple 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.740
 game is very addictive good the truth I 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.630
 lately I've been playing it and for 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.300
 I bring them perfect, come on 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.280
 killing let's see if later and also 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:40.460
 something great here in round 8 already 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.050
 they opened the doors so we did not spend 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.050
 to open it is here for example and 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.860
 we have here another weapon that would be a uci 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:53.090
 there it is and we can shoot the heads 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.090
 they give more points so 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.160
 try to do it that way very well 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:03.470
 good if they play it perfect what 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:06.510
 dismembered and here still does not open 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.660
 let's see on this side of this side of 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.600
 this side and the key 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.150
 we open a way around here ray rays 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.050
 Rice does not matter nothing happens there ergo no 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.910
 there is nothing very good and two are missing 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.670
 understands in the upper left 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.040
 shows us how many enemies there are though 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.020
 then they come out more and they're going to 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.500
 kill me they will choose no no no no no no 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:33.350
 we do not shoot that less than perfect weapon 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:37.190
 there is great blood headshot headshot 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:39.910
 headshot done was already a 9 and we still 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.490
 the boss leaves because then a voice comes out 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:47.360
 and he is pretty choteado but quite 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:49.550
 great to have perfect blood for all 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.020
 sides blood everywhere, even 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.450
 It can also be removed so that 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:57.530
 there is not so much blood or so but good 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.390
 joke and andy sessions but they are 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.800
 violent games and that does not stay and 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.200
 come on, it's just a game there 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.380
 we activate this 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.760
 I want to go up or to have more rank 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.370
 perfect 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.370
 we kill we kill we kill and those those those 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:18.250
 those that go crazy here comes another 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:22.760
 no no no no no no that kills me kills me 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:27.320
 rays or so much publicity that the 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:30.169
 fraud is thrown this can see 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.320
 again another another game slow street 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:35.720
 It is very good and when I want them 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.510
 turn this game that the truth to me 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.540
 I like a lot is what is playing 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.250
 lately and I also suppose that 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:46.280
 I will also put it in the title I do not know 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.160
 and also for this video it's a bit 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.830
 try because because I'm recording in 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.810
 what is my cell phone not on the tablet in 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.990
 Annex 7 I'm recording what it is 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.580
 my motor or the moto gea and the truth that 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.789
 it's like he's recording me I'm 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.580
 playing normal and even told me 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:06.260
 monsters that are supposed to this phone 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.650
 is better with the tablet and you see ideas to 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:12.949
 rays and I liked it much cheaper and everything 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:15.639
 but well it does not matter to see we go up 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:19.550
 here and if it's a kind of test 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:20.990
 because yesterday who knows 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.490
 fight I'm going to do many things that 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.080
 by the way many asked hey how 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:27.140
 the challenges and I want to defeat the child or 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.500
 something like that so every device is 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.150
 different each one has the way of 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:36.170
 surround yourself so I can not tell you and I 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:42.190
 you can be scared of that guy so not 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:42.190
 insist me die great west-east 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.800
 very good and nothing in itself is this was all 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:53.040
 what I want to share with you 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:54.630
 later upload a mod that already has as 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.419
 two weeks there on my tablet and that nothing 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.790
 I do not upload anymore, some will already have 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:02.070
 uploaded I suppose yes I think yes already 

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.380
 went up even monster but well that what 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.660
 it matters so nothing in itself 

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.370
 this would be all of this video later 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.070
 upload a mod and good some 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:12.900
 they asked a lot of what happened to the 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.460
 series of craft motorcycles because the truth is not 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.520
 I had time to prepare it because 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.710
 obviously to prepare it not only 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.690
 I say a must record I feel and we're going 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.820
 to use because there should be should I 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:25.949
 know at least what I'm going to do in the 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.990
 video so I do not expect anything 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:31.050
 liked do not forget to subscribe yet not what 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.729
 they have made a comment and see you 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.460
 the seven videos by the way also 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:37.520
 I have this katana although it does not work very 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.520
 all right 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.790
 they all killed me silly publicity to 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:44.480
 through 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.480
 see you later
