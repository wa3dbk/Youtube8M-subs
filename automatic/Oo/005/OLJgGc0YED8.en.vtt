00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:09.730 
picture and it is very very simple to

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.580 
picture and it is very very simple to
set<00:00:10.059> up<00:00:10.090> your<00:00:10.299> camera<00:00:10.539> to<00:00:10.959> take<00:00:11.170> the<00:00:11.410> best

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590 
set up your camera to take the best

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.049 
set up your camera to take the best
quality<00:00:12.100> picture<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:13.570> seems<00:00:13.900> complicated<00:00:14.410> but

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
quality picture it seems complicated but

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.029 
quality picture it seems complicated but
I'm<00:00:16.059> gonna<00:00:16.240> use<00:00:16.449> the<00:00:16.660> manual<00:00:17.050> mode<00:00:17.260> so<00:00:17.830> turn

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
I'm gonna use the manual mode so turn

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.600 
I'm gonna use the manual mode so turn
your<00:00:18.160> mode<00:00:18.340> dial<00:00:18.580> to<00:00:18.700> manual<00:00:19.560> M<00:00:20.560> stands<00:00:21.490> for

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
your mode dial to manual M stands for

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.550 
your mode dial to manual M stands for
manual<00:00:21.880> and<00:00:22.270> this<00:00:22.480> will<00:00:22.690> give<00:00:22.870> me<00:00:23.230> full

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
manual and this will give me full

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.220 
manual and this will give me full
control<00:00:23.710> over<00:00:24.640> both<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:25.090> shutter<00:00:25.420> and<00:00:25.660> the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
control over both the shutter and the

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.010 
control over both the shutter and the
aperture<00:00:26.530> and<00:00:27.330> again<00:00:28.330> this<00:00:28.539> may<00:00:28.750> seem<00:00:28.810> a

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 
aperture and again this may seem a

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.020 
aperture and again this may seem a
little<00:00:29.110> bit<00:00:29.350> too<00:00:29.470> much<00:00:29.860> but<00:00:30.250> it's<00:00:30.580> very<00:00:30.789> very

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.030 
little bit too much but it's very very

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.270

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:47.289 
to flash off and hit set now my ISO I

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.319 
to flash off and hit set now my ISO I
want<00:00:47.679> to<00:00:47.769> keep<00:00:47.920> that<00:00:48.129> at<00:00:48.280> 80<00:00:48.489> this<00:00:48.850> is<00:00:48.999> going<00:00:49.210> to

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
want to keep that at 80 this is going to

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.200 
want to keep that at 80 this is going to
be<00:00:49.449> a<00:00:49.479> very<00:00:49.809> very<00:00:50.019> long<00:00:50.379> exposure<00:00:50.859> so<00:00:51.699> it<00:00:52.030> has

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
be a very very long exposure so it has

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.809 
be a very very long exposure so it has
to<00:00:52.329> be<00:00:52.449> 80<00:00:52.719> ISO<00:00:53.319> to<00:00:53.800> maintain<00:00:54.190> the<00:00:54.399> cleanest

possible image my white balance I want

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.259 
possible image my white balance I want
to<00:00:58.300> set<00:00:58.479> this<00:00:59.069> appropriately<00:01:00.069> to<00:01:00.489> the<00:01:00.940> light

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
to set this appropriately to the light

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.119 
to set this appropriately to the light

something<00:01:03.399> like<00:01:03.489> that<00:01:03.549> I'll<00:01:04.210> set<00:01:04.449> it<00:01:04.479> to

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
something like that I'll set it to

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.260 
something like that I'll set it to

now I want to set my shutter speed and

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.370 
now I want to set my shutter speed and
the<00:01:29.950> aperture<00:01:30.520> now<00:01:31.360> you<00:01:31.450> can<00:01:31.600> see<00:01:31.750> over<00:01:31.870> here

the aperture now you can see over here

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.950 
the aperture now you can see over here
is<00:01:32.530> a<00:01:33.190> little<00:01:33.520> light<00:01:33.730> meter<00:01:33.970> right<00:01:34.600> now<00:01:34.750> my

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
is a little light meter right now my

exposure compensation is set to zero you

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.110 
exposure compensation is set to zero you
can<00:01:37.690> see<00:01:37.990> that<00:01:38.170> by<00:01:38.410> the<00:01:38.440> little<00:01:38.560> green<00:01:38.980> -<00:01:39.220> but

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 
can see that by the little green - but

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.270 
can see that by the little green - but
this<00:01:40.270> little<00:01:40.420> red<00:01:40.720> dash<00:01:40.960> is<00:01:41.290> where<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:41.980> actual

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
this little red dash is where the actual

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.180 
this little red dash is where the actual
image<00:01:42.760> exposure<00:01:43.180> is<00:01:43.480> currently<00:01:44.320> at<00:01:44.500> and

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
image exposure is currently at and

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.680 
image exposure is currently at and
that's<00:01:45.280> because<00:01:45.610> I<00:01:45.670> have<00:01:45.820> a<00:01:45.850> very<00:01:46.060> very<00:01:46.300> fast

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
that's because I have a very very fast

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.260 
that's because I have a very very fast
shutter<00:01:47.470> speed<00:01:47.800> with<00:01:48.280> a<00:01:48.310> very<00:01:48.640> very<00:01:48.880> small

shutter speed with a very very small
aperture<00:01:49.900> setting<00:01:50.280> what<00:01:51.280> you<00:01:51.430> want<00:01:51.640> is<00:01:51.820> to

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
aperture setting what you want is to

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.450 
aperture setting what you want is to

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
maintain that small aperture setting to

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.360 
maintain that small aperture setting to
keep<00:01:55.270> everything<00:01:55.660> in<00:01:55.900> focus<00:01:56.080> so<00:01:57.070> I'm<00:01:57.160> going<00:01:57.310> to

I'm<00:02:16.930> gonna<00:02:17.049> try<00:02:17.379> 10<00:02:17.620> seconds<00:02:18.129> and<00:02:18.370> then<00:02:19.150> if

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
I'm gonna try 10 seconds and then if

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.570 
I'm gonna try 10 seconds and then if
this<00:02:19.450> is<00:02:19.569> too<00:02:19.750> bright<00:02:20.019> or<00:02:20.049> too<00:02:20.260> dark<00:02:20.379> I<00:02:20.890> can<00:02:21.340> see

later in the LCD screen after I've taken
the<00:02:24.909> picture<00:02:25.180> then<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:26.200> can<00:02:26.650> choose<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.220> reduce

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
the picture then I can choose to reduce

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.610 
the picture then I can choose to reduce
that<00:02:27.909> or<00:02:28.060> not<00:02:28.150> currently<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.110> can<00:02:29.260> see<00:02:29.440> that

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
my screen is completely white and that

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.390 
my screen is completely white and that
is<00:02:31.420> because<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:31.870> have<00:02:32.170> much<00:02:32.530> more<00:02:32.560> light<00:02:33.099> in

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
is because I have much more light in

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.119 
is because I have much more light in
here<00:02:33.750> than<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.930> will<00:02:35.110> out<00:02:35.379> when<00:02:36.010> you're

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
distance to place your focusing Square

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.319

over<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:10.930> focus<00:03:11.650> but<00:03:11.980> we<00:03:12.609> are<00:03:12.760> using<00:03:12.940> a<00:03:13.090> tripod

be as still as possible before that
shutter<00:04:54.640> is<00:04:54.910> released<00:04:55.260> so<00:04:56.260> there<00:04:56.740> is<00:04:56.920> as

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.720 
set to 10 seconds this is kind of a lot
but<00:05:20.350> it's<00:05:20.620> really<00:05:20.800> quite<00:05:21.100> simple<00:05:21.130> once<00:05:21.580> you

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730 
but it's really quite simple once you

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.570 
but it's really quite simple once you
get<00:05:21.910> used<00:05:22.090> to<00:05:22.210> it<00:05:22.860> once<00:05:23.860> everything<00:05:24.250> is<00:05:24.340> set<00:05:24.550> up

get used to it once everything is set up

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.660 
get used to it once everything is set up
again<00:05:25.300> the<00:05:25.690> camera<00:05:25.870> should<00:05:26.140> be<00:05:26.290> on<00:05:26.380> a<00:05:26.410> tripod

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
again the camera should be on a tripod

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.090

way and after 2 seconds the picture will

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.950 
way and after 2 seconds the picture will
be<00:05:35.080> taken<00:05:35.470> now<00:05:36.280> just<00:05:36.760> so<00:05:36.880> you<00:05:36.910> know<00:05:37.150> after<00:05:37.510> 10

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
be taken now just so you know after 10

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.600 
be taken now just so you know after 10
seconds<00:05:38.410> the<00:05:38.530> picture<00:05:38.800> is<00:05:38.890> done<00:05:39.070> because<00:05:39.400> we

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
seconds the picture is done because we

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.940 
seconds the picture is done because we
have<00:05:39.790> our<00:05:40.000> shutter<00:05:40.720> speed<00:05:40.810> set<00:05:41.290> to<00:05:41.380> 10<00:05:41.530> seconds

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
have our shutter speed set to 10 seconds

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.240 
have our shutter speed set to 10 seconds
and<00:05:42.100> then<00:05:42.940> it'll<00:05:43.300> take<00:05:43.840> a<00:05:44.050> while<00:05:44.410> for<00:05:44.830> that

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
and then it'll take a while for that

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.010 
and then it'll take a while for that
image<00:05:45.670> to<00:05:45.700> process<00:05:46.300> because<00:05:46.720> it's<00:05:46.870> such<00:05:46.990> a

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
image to process because it's such a

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.320 
image to process because it's such a
long<00:05:47.230> exposure<00:05:47.650> it<00:05:48.340> takes<00:05:48.550> a<00:05:48.670> lot<00:05:48.880> longer<00:05:49.120> for

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
long exposure it takes a lot longer for

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.510 
long exposure it takes a lot longer for
the<00:05:49.510> picture<00:05:49.810> to<00:05:49.900> process<00:05:50.320> so<00:05:50.980> just<00:05:51.010> be

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
the picture to process so just be

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.610 
the picture to process so just be
patient<00:05:51.700> once<00:05:52.600> it's<00:05:52.750> done<00:05:52.900> it<00:05:53.110> only<00:05:53.230> takes<00:05:53.500> a

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
patient once it's done it only takes a

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:55.980 
patient once it's done it only takes a
few<00:05:53.650> seconds<00:05:54.190> then<00:05:54.820> you'll<00:05:55.330> see<00:05:55.600> your<00:05:55.720> image

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
few seconds then you'll see your image
