00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.730
 hi everyone so today a review the lieutenant vote 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:06.170
 controversial bus stay 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.059
 so we will start with the modeling 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.059
 so that gives what is a record of super titi 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:14.829
 zigic with a bonanza of donka instead of his macabre 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:17.829
 cape 40 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:21.050
 seized up eclipsed their site 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.039
 so that gives a similar pattern 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.390
 in which he was three centimeters to a gram 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.769
 it is to them 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:29.099
 it's the heavy 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.509
 if the heavier than the organic category 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:34.590
 so for us 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.890
 then does not change recognized eyes simply because their feet 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.810
 so 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.210
 the winner of the wake game nicknamed the kiss 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.390
 2009 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.140
 also word under no you are 128 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.290
 and of course cute sin 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.750
 for 100 m 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.930
 but 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.860
 are not just spin-offs that make Africa come to an end with it 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.860
 example some acts 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.310
 japanese spinner 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.050
 or even jean peres du psp 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.090
 So, he's really not interested in the bust of artprice 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.040
 it is especially for a 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.640
 gold that leaves that has style 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.910
 so 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.830
 so here it is done we blame it is that behind price karting uses 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.530
 better 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.890
 it may very well not be in talks for me that for 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.720
 others or 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.850
 more post 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.920
 if she knows what she's serving a versatile model you can not do everything 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.509
 with a year saft group ga has no problem the site do stuff a little 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.520
 not very strong in melee 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.160
 apparently also in hyper versatile mode we can put everything to 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.160
 the asset and upstream no problem for speed up 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.970
 troadec 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.790
 malaria 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.850
 so it may be a bit long for some we are many me 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.270
 personally who spine not very very long 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.140
 the idea of ​​a good size 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.360
 the weight is very well distributed so there is no problem 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.730
 good if not I advise against 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.579
 about keeping up 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:12.559
 but already if you do not like white or if you have a problem with the 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:15.599
 white or if you simply come from the ps tlf psp 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:20.219
 there you can change body embrapa ans who had created the price to see her 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.689
 or you have colored strings 

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.120
 it's exactly the same as super kitsch but all 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:28.079
 colors 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:31.779
 then you can have ideas at a train station a mom room 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.689
 Bouygues simply db color to change ideas 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.069
 of color for the four tonga islands 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.469
 so for them 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:42.700
 you can even put tracks on which the globe of 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:47.019
 frankly chatterton a book as customizable you really are not 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.629
 obliged to take it in blank 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.119
 it's not an obligation 

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:53.249
 although I find that the 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:55.090
 my goal is to fit well 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.639
 the rendering of lions 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.639
 all in white 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.539
 so for beginners I think it can be a good mode while 

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:04.099
 suspicion 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.479
 at 10 euros to 5 or 10 0 out of 6 

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:09.589
 it's not very very expensive 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:12.759
 he likes it makes it possible to progress quickly so here it is a mode 

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:14.859
 as many say 

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:16.249
 after and in euros 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:19.599
 if you really want maquis marquis taken over 14% 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.559
 do not do bertrix jacques bertrix 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:25.669
 One thing is a word of all kinds 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:28.270
 stand out anyway because the posterior if the sermon the 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.069
 think or fashion 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.799
 in any case not one of the most used words 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.079
 and then teaser and we see the most and it's really not no not a club 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.589
 back more than the delay of stay 

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:42.649
 it's the online bet 

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:45.999
 we have I think I have gone around 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:48.109
 thrush was everything so that's it 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.439
 thank you for listening
