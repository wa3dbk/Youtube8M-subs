to show you a new technique I went

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.549 
to show you a new technique I went
through<00:00:38.430> YouTube<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:39.059> looked<00:00:39.329> at<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.809> whole

through YouTube I looked at a whole
bunch<00:00:40.800> of<00:00:40.890> different<00:00:40.980> techniques<00:00:41.460> by<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> whole

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
bunch of different techniques by a whole

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.940 
bunch of different techniques by a whole
bunch<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.420> people<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.840> y'all<00:00:43.110> really<00:00:43.590> really

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.790 
bunch of people and y'all really really
helped<00:00:44.160> me<00:00:44.219> out<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.399> lot<00:00:44.760> um<00:00:45.320> for<00:00:46.320> real<00:00:46.530> for<00:00:46.770> real

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
helped me out a lot um for real for real

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.450 
helped me out a lot um for real for real
but<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.489> dilemma<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.090> had<00:00:48.360> was<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.870> couldn't<00:00:49.460> get

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
but the dilemma I had was I couldn't get

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.180 
but the dilemma I had was I couldn't get
the<00:00:50.910> roots<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.539> stay<00:00:51.840> like<00:00:52.230> what<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.980> like

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
the roots to stay like what is it like

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.000 
the roots to stay like what is it like
what<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:53.879> right<00:00:54.270> here<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:54.780> not<00:00:55.710> right

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
what is this right here like not right

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.209 
what is this right here like not right
so<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:57.559> started<00:00:58.559> playing<00:00:58.680> around<00:00:58.920> with<00:00:59.039> some

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
so I started playing around with some

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.880 
so I started playing around with some
different<00:00:59.489> ideas<00:00:59.550> that<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.000> got<00:01:00.710> one<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.800> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
different ideas that I got one of the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.800 
different ideas that I got one of the
ideas<00:01:02.270> is<00:01:03.739> of<00:01:04.739> course<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:06.150> interlocking

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
ideas is of course the interlocking

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.030 
ideas is of course the interlocking
method<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:08.119> really<00:01:09.119> like<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.510> idea<00:01:10.040> because

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
method I really like that idea because

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.679 
method I really like that idea because
you're<00:01:11.520> creating<00:01:11.970> new<00:01:12.210> knots<00:01:14.479> but<00:01:15.479> at<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
you're creating new knots but at the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.130 
you're creating new knots but at the
same<00:01:15.900> time<00:01:16.640> I<00:01:17.640> was<00:01:18.180> really<00:01:18.420> concerned<00:01:18.930> about

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
same time I was really concerned about

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.020 
same time I was really concerned about
keeping<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.159> thickness<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:22.070> of<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.729> dread

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
keeping the thickness of of the dread

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.539 
keeping the thickness of of the dread
like<00:01:24.330> throughout<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.750> whole<00:01:25.020> thing<00:01:25.549> because

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
like throughout the whole thing because

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.480 
like throughout the whole thing because
my<00:01:26.850> problem<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.479> my<00:01:27.630> hair<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.799> little<00:01:29.369> bit

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
my problem is my hair is a little bit

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.920 
my problem is my hair is a little bit
thinner<00:01:31.430> so<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.729> developed<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.780> little

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
thinner so I developed a little

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.700 
thinner so I developed a little
technique<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.439> combines<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.220> two<00:01:35.430> together

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
technique that combines the two together

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.380 
technique that combines the two together
as<00:01:37.710> far<00:01:38.009> as<00:01:38.130> I've<00:01:38.280> seen<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.610> YouTube<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.240> ain't

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
as far as I've seen on YouTube I ain't

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.780 
as far as I've seen on YouTube I ain't
seen<00:01:39.570> nobody<00:01:39.780> do<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:42.710> so<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:44.130> mean<00:01:44.640> I'm

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
seen nobody do this so I mean I'm

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.910 
seen nobody do this so I mean I'm
claiming<00:01:45.060> it<00:01:45.360> right<00:01:45.600> now<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:46.200> know<00:01:46.229> I'm

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
claiming it right now you know I'm

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.560 
claiming it right now you know I'm
claiming<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.670> somebody<00:01:47.939> can<00:01:48.149> tell<00:01:48.390> me

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
claiming it so somebody can tell me

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.590 
claiming it so somebody can tell me
otherwise<00:01:48.979> alright<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.640> I'm<00:01:51.240> gonna<00:01:51.360> show<00:01:51.540> you

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
of course this is the interlocking

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.380 
of course this is the interlocking
method<00:01:55.740> right<00:01:55.890> here<00:01:56.219> I'm<00:01:56.820> gonna<00:01:57.000> take<00:01:57.180> this

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
method right here I'm gonna take this

gonna split it you're gonna part it into

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.229 
gonna split it you're gonna part it into
two<00:02:07.049> right<00:02:07.500> here<00:02:07.740> then<00:02:08.670> when<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.090> that

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
two right here then when you do that

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.740 
two right here then when you do that
you're<00:02:09.479> going<00:02:09.629> to<00:02:09.899> flip<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.800> dread<00:02:11.099> down

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
you're going to flip the dread down

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.470 
you're going to flip the dread down
into<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.230> hole<00:02:12.880> and<00:02:13.880> you're<00:02:14.270> going<00:02:14.420> to

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
into the hole and you're going to

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.840 
into the hole and you're going to
continue<00:02:14.630> to<00:02:15.020> do<00:02:15.200> that<00:02:15.230> both<00:02:15.800> going<00:02:16.190> down<00:02:16.460> and

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
continue to do that both going down and

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.530 
continue to do that both going down and
then<00:02:17.060> splitting<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.750> going<00:02:18.440> this<00:02:18.800> way<00:02:19.040> and

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
then splitting it going this way and

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.380 
then splitting it going this way and
then<00:02:20.540> doing<00:02:21.050> it<00:02:21.260> sideways<00:02:21.740> and<00:02:22.400> putting<00:02:23.240> the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
then doing it sideways and putting the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.330 
then doing it sideways and putting the
dread<00:02:23.660> in<00:02:23.870> sideways<00:02:24.860> and<00:02:25.130> you're<00:02:25.220> gonna

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
dread in sideways and you're gonna

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.130 
dread in sideways and you're gonna
repeat<00:02:25.670> this<00:02:25.820> process<00:02:26.330> in<00:02:26.510> different<00:02:26.630> parts

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
repeat this process in different parts

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.570 
repeat this process in different parts
make<00:02:27.380> sure<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:27.590> don't<00:02:27.770> keep<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.040> same<00:02:28.070> part

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
make sure you don't keep the same part

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.520 
make sure you don't keep the same part
you<00:02:29.180> want<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.480> switch<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:30.110> this<00:02:30.170> is<00:02:30.350> called

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
you want to switch it and this is called

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.380 
you want to switch it and this is called
interlocking<00:02:31.310> somebody<00:02:31.880> taught<00:02:32.060> me<00:02:32.240> that

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
interlocking somebody taught me that

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.950 
interlocking somebody taught me that
thank<00:02:32.750> you

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.530 

let's<00:02:35.960> see<00:02:36.110> here<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.700> lot<00:02:37.700> of<00:02:37.730> different<00:02:38.360> ways

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
let's see here a lot of different ways

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.120 
let's see here a lot of different ways
to<00:02:38.720> interlock<00:02:39.110> but<00:02:39.440> this<00:02:39.590> is<00:02:39.740> the<00:02:39.860> one<00:02:40.010> that

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
to interlock but this is the one that

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.700 
to interlock but this is the one that
made<00:02:40.340> most<00:02:40.610> sense<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:41.030> me<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:42.200> was<00:02:42.470> best

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
made most sense to me and was best

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.390 
made most sense to me and was best
explained<00:02:43.220> on<00:02:43.520> a<00:02:43.550> YouTube<00:02:43.940> video<00:02:44.270> so<00:02:45.170> I<00:02:45.980> really

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
explained on a YouTube video so I really

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.949 
explained on a YouTube video so I really
like<00:02:46.580> that<00:02:46.610> idea<00:02:46.970> so<00:02:47.450> you're<00:02:47.570> gonna<00:02:47.660> create

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
like that idea so you're gonna create

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.800 
like that idea so you're gonna create
some<00:02:48.170> new<00:02:48.350> knots<00:02:48.590> just<00:02:49.120> keep<00:02:50.120> repeating<00:02:50.420> the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
some new knots just keep repeating the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.390 
some new knots just keep repeating the
same<00:02:50.870> process<00:02:51.260> different<00:02:52.010> parts<00:02:52.280> you're

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
same process different parts you're

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.850 
same process different parts you're
gonna<00:02:52.520> do<00:02:52.690> horizontal<00:02:53.690> and<00:02:53.930> vertical<00:02:54.620> so

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
gonna do horizontal and vertical so

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.100 
gonna do horizontal and vertical so
you're<00:02:55.459> not<00:02:55.580> just<00:02:55.790> gonna<00:02:55.880> part<00:02:56.240> it<00:02:56.330> going<00:02:56.630> this

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
you're not just gonna part it going this

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.350 
you're not just gonna part it going this
way<00:02:57.410> but<00:02:58.190> you're<00:02:58.310> also<00:02:58.430> gonna<00:02:58.700> part<00:02:59.030> it<00:02:59.090> going

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
way but you're also gonna part it going

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.270 
way but you're also gonna part it going
this<00:02:59.780> way<00:03:00.020> too<00:03:00.080> you<00:03:00.500> want<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.740> make<00:03:00.860> sure<00:03:01.010> that

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
this way too you want to make sure that

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.800 
this way too you want to make sure that
it<00:03:01.550> is<00:03:02.060> round<00:03:02.510> and<00:03:02.870> it's<00:03:03.080> not<00:03:03.230> flat<00:03:03.620> you<00:03:03.920> know

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
it is round and it's not flat you know

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.990 
it is round and it's not flat you know
so<00:03:05.810> this<00:03:05.959> is<00:03:06.020> gonna<00:03:06.260> give<00:03:06.530> you<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:07.550> roundness

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
so this is gonna give you the roundness

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.170 
so this is gonna give you the roundness
a<00:03:08.540> little<00:03:09.380> bit<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:09.770> as<00:03:10.220> you<00:03:10.280> can<00:03:10.520> see<00:03:10.700> see<00:03:11.000> how

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
a little bit and as you can see see how

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.300 
a little bit and as you can see see how
I'm<00:03:11.480> creating<00:03:12.080> new<00:03:12.260> knots<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.770> can<00:03:12.950> see<00:03:13.160> the

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
I'm creating new knots you can see the

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.560 
I'm creating new knots you can see the
new<00:03:13.430> Knights<00:03:13.700> that<00:03:13.820> are<00:03:14.000> developing<00:03:14.420> right

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
new Knights that are developing right

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.479 
new Knights that are developing right
here<00:03:14.870> I've<00:03:15.170> still<00:03:15.620> got<00:03:15.769> a<00:03:15.800> little<00:03:15.980> bit<00:03:16.220> of<00:03:16.340> root

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
here I've still got a little bit of root

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.130 
here I've still got a little bit of root
so<00:03:16.640> I'm<00:03:16.790> gonna<00:03:16.880> keep<00:03:17.060> what<00:03:17.720> I'm<00:03:17.840> going<00:03:17.989> to<00:03:18.019> do

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
so I'm gonna keep what I'm going to do

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.360 
so I'm gonna keep what I'm going to do
is<00:03:18.260> I'm<00:03:18.380> gonna<00:03:18.500> keep<00:03:18.680> working<00:03:19.220> until<00:03:21.160> it<00:03:22.160> get

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
is I'm gonna keep working until it get

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.130 
is I'm gonna keep working until it get
as<00:03:22.519> close<00:03:22.820> to<00:03:23.060> the<00:03:23.150> scalp<00:03:23.420> as<00:03:23.600> I<00:03:23.690> can<00:03:23.870> get<00:03:24.019> it

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
as close to the scalp as I can get it

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.009 
as close to the scalp as I can get it
without<00:03:24.290> being<00:03:24.650> too<00:03:24.920> painful<00:03:25.489> here<00:03:26.019> I'm

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
without being too painful here I'm

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:30.040 
without being too painful here I'm
tender-headed<00:03:27.500> right<00:03:27.860> here<00:03:28.160> um<00:03:28.690> most<00:03:29.690> people

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
tender-headed right here um most people

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:33.640 
tender-headed right here um most people
are<00:03:30.200> but<00:03:30.760> I'm<00:03:31.760> gonna<00:03:31.910> keep<00:03:32.060> working<00:03:32.420> on<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:32.650> so

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
are but I'm gonna keep working on it so

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.259 
are but I'm gonna keep working on it so
after<00:03:33.800> the<00:03:34.010> interlocking<00:03:34.580> pretty<00:03:34.850> much<00:03:35.060> what

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
after the interlocking pretty much what

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:36.699 
after the interlocking pretty much what
you're<00:03:35.390> gonna<00:03:35.540> do<00:03:35.780> once<00:03:36.019> you've<00:03:36.230> gotten<00:03:36.440> it<00:03:36.560> to

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:36.709 
you're gonna do once you've gotten it to

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.190 
you're gonna do once you've gotten it to
a<00:03:36.739> happy<00:03:37.550> place<00:03:37.580> which<00:03:38.180> let<00:03:38.630> me<00:03:38.720> just<00:03:38.930> try<00:03:39.110> to

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
a happy place which let me just try to

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.840 
a happy place which let me just try to
get<00:03:39.350> that<00:03:39.470> loop<00:03:39.709> out<00:03:39.920> real<00:03:40.130> quick<00:03:40.400> and<00:03:40.549> do<00:03:40.730> it

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
get that loop out real quick and do it

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.910 
get that loop out real quick and do it
one<00:03:40.970> more<00:03:41.000> time<00:03:43.780> then<00:03:44.780> I'll<00:03:44.930> take<00:03:45.140> a<00:03:45.170> comb<00:03:45.470> and

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
one more time then I'll take a comb and

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.410 
one more time then I'll take a comb and
I<00:03:46.100> do<00:03:46.160> what<00:03:46.459> most<00:03:46.610> people<00:03:46.940> do<00:03:47.090> when<00:03:47.299> they're

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
I do what most people do when they're

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.720 
I do what most people do when they're
starting<00:03:48.080> it<00:03:48.260> right<00:03:50.049> that's<00:03:51.049> like<00:03:51.290> a<00:03:51.410> comb<00:03:51.730> and

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
starting it right that's like a comb and

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.430 
starting it right that's like a comb and
I<00:03:52.910> do<00:03:53.090> a<00:03:53.120> little<00:03:53.480> bit<00:03:53.600> of<00:03:53.690> this<00:03:53.840> action<00:03:54.350> I'm

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
I do a little bit of this action I'm

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.620 
I do a little bit of this action I'm
sure<00:03:54.650> we're<00:03:54.830> all<00:03:54.980> familiar<00:03:55.010> with<00:03:55.489> it<00:03:55.760> but<00:03:56.390> take

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
sure we're all familiar with it but take

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.530 
sure we're all familiar with it but take
a<00:03:56.660> comb<00:03:56.930> starting<00:03:57.410> in<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.530> middle<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:01.540> you're

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
a comb starting in the middle and you're

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.220 
a comb starting in the middle and you're
gonna<00:04:02.630> pull<00:04:03.019> toward<00:04:03.500> the<00:04:04.780> toward<00:04:05.780> the<00:04:05.900> scalp

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
gonna pull toward the toward the scalp

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.759 
gonna pull toward the toward the scalp
this<00:04:07.040> might<00:04:07.640> hurt<00:04:07.850> a<00:04:08.000> little<00:04:08.150> bit<00:04:08.769> only

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
this might hurt a little bit only

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.740 
this might hurt a little bit only
because<00:04:10.190> you're<00:04:10.310> pulling<00:04:10.760> nuts<00:04:10.970> directly<00:04:11.570> to

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
because you're pulling nuts directly to

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.220 
because you're pulling nuts directly to
the<00:04:11.870> scalp<00:04:12.200> so<00:04:13.000> in<00:04:14.000> a<00:04:14.720> place<00:04:14.900> where<00:04:15.110> I'm

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
the scalp so in a place where I'm

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.750 
the scalp so in a place where I'm
tender-headed<00:04:15.709> it's<00:04:16.340> gonna<00:04:16.459> be<00:04:16.609> a<00:04:16.640> little

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
tender-headed it's gonna be a little

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.030 
tender-headed it's gonna be a little
sensitive<00:04:16.970> and<00:04:17.450> as<00:04:17.870> you<00:04:18.019> can<00:04:18.169> see<00:04:18.229> now<00:04:18.650> I've

from<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.419> root<00:04:29.599> my<00:04:30.379> biggest<00:04:30.620> concern<00:04:31.129> is

00:04:31.149 --> 00:04:31.159 
from the root my biggest concern is

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:36.159 
from the root my biggest concern is
washing<00:04:32.150> them<00:04:32.270> when<00:04:32.509> I<00:04:32.599> wash<00:04:32.840> them<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:35.169> it's

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
washing them when I wash them the it's

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.719 
washing them when I wash them the it's
like<00:04:36.229> the<00:04:36.440> roots<00:04:36.680> get<00:04:36.979> all<00:04:37.069> wavy<00:04:37.340> and<00:04:37.639> curly

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
like the roots get all wavy and curly

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.790 
like the roots get all wavy and curly
because<00:04:38.150> my<00:04:38.360> hair<00:04:38.509> is<00:04:38.539> naturally<00:04:38.900> curly<00:04:38.930> um

my last video and take the ends with the
crochet<00:05:45.680> needle<00:05:46.120> and<00:05:47.169> get<00:05:48.169> the<00:05:48.319> ends<00:05:48.620> to<00:05:48.740> look

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
crochet needle and get the ends to look

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.640 
crochet needle and get the ends to look
more<00:05:49.130> round<00:05:49.430> so<00:05:49.819> I<00:05:49.849> can<00:05:50.180> accomplish<00:05:50.509> more<00:05:51.469> of

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
more round so I can accomplish more of

more round so I can accomplish more of
this<00:05:51.889> look<00:05:52.870> versus<00:05:53.870> this<00:05:54.110> look<00:05:54.379> right<00:05:54.590> here
