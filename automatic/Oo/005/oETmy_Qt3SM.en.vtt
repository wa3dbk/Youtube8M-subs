car<00:00:41.700> based<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.480> thirteen<00:00:42.870> hundred<00:00:43.079> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
car based so it's thirteen hundred and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.319 
car based so it's thirteen hundred and
fifty<00:00:43.500> kilograms<00:00:43.739> ooh<00:00:44.129> they<00:00:44.670> gather<00:00:44.969> speed

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
fifty kilograms ooh they gather speed

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.610 
fifty kilograms ooh they gather speed
very<00:00:45.570> quickly<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.930> have<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.140> slow<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.469> car

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
very quickly you have to slow the car

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.190 
very quickly you have to slow the car
down<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:47.280> good<00:00:47.550> time<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.690> then<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.079> have

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
down in good time and then you just have

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.900 
down in good time and then you just have
to<00:00:49.320> protect<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.860> rear<00:00:50.010> tires<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.489> bit<00:00:50.670> from<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
to protect the rear tires a bit from the

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.619 
to protect the rear tires a bit from the
from<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.480> extra<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.530> talk<00:00:53.149> no<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:54.480> just

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
from the extra the talk no it's just

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.420 
from the extra the talk no it's just
every<00:00:54.930> car<00:00:55.170> has<00:00:55.199> its<00:00:55.710> own<00:00:55.890> particular<00:00:56.250> way<00:00:57.030> and

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
every car has its own particular way and

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.250 
every car has its own particular way and
strengths<00:00:59.430> our<00:00:59.550> weaknesses<00:00:59.579> so<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.899> takes<00:01:01.109> a

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
strengths our weaknesses so it takes a

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.950 
strengths our weaknesses so it takes a
little<00:01:01.410> time<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.739> mean<00:01:02.300> normally<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.780> know<00:01:03.899> to

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
little time I mean normally you know to

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.320 
little time I mean normally you know to
do<00:01:04.229> such<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> fast<00:01:05.489> car<00:01:05.729> normally<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.240> would

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
do such a fast car normally you would

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.690 
do such a fast car normally you would
need<00:01:06.479> more<00:01:06.780> time<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.830> get<00:01:08.010> used<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.549> but

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
need more time to get used to it but

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.080 
need more time to get used to it but
this<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.850> quite<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.450> confidence-inspiring<00:01:10.260> car

nerve-wracking<00:02:29.910> because<00:02:30.120> it's<00:02:30.810> worth<00:02:30.960> what

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
nerve-wracking because it's worth what

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.410 
nerve-wracking because it's worth what
four<00:02:31.470> hundred<00:02:31.740> thousand<00:02:32.130> euros<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.240> go

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
four hundred thousand euros and you go

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.210 
four hundred thousand euros and you go
out<00:02:33.600> onto<00:02:33.810> a<00:02:33.990> high-speed<00:02:34.440> track<00:02:34.770> anything

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
out onto a high-speed track anything

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.440 
out onto a high-speed track anything
what<00:02:35.520> I<00:02:35.550> don't<00:02:35.820> know<00:02:35.880> what<00:02:36.030> it's<00:02:36.150> going<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.330> do

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
what I don't know what it's going to do

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.790 
what I don't know what it's going to do
I<00:02:36.480> don't<00:02:36.660> know<00:02:36.720> how<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.840> make<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.170> function<00:02:37.650> I

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
I don't know how to make it function I

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.500 
I don't know how to make it function I
mean<00:02:38.250> ten<00:02:38.459> minutes<00:02:38.730> before<00:02:38.820> I<00:02:39.000> got<00:02:39.209> in<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.420> I

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
mean ten minutes before I got in it I

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:40.850 
mean ten minutes before I got in it I
didn't<00:02:39.720> even<00:02:39.810> know<00:02:39.959> how<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.050> start<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.470> engine

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
didn't even know how to start the engine

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.740 
didn't even know how to start the engine
but<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:41.670> have<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:41.940> push<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.360> need<00:02:42.510> brake

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
but you have to push you need brake

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.030 
but you have to push you need brake
temperature<00:02:43.200> entire<00:02:43.470> temperature<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:43.980> you

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
temperature entire temperature so you

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.070 
temperature entire temperature so you
have<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.310> get<00:02:44.490> on<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:44.880> so<00:02:45.720> you're<00:02:45.990> looking

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
have to get on it and so you're looking

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.020 
have to get on it and so you're looking
for<00:02:46.260> early<00:02:46.800> signs<00:02:47.070> of<00:02:47.250> confidence<00:02:47.850> and

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
for early signs of confidence and

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.140 
for early signs of confidence and
predictability<00:02:48.240> which<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.050> car<00:02:49.260> does

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
predictability which this car does

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.190 
predictability which this car does
driving<00:02:51.150> on<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.360> left-hand<00:02:51.630> side<00:02:51.810> is<00:02:51.930> not<00:02:52.170> a

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
driving on the left-hand side is not a

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.229 
driving on the left-hand side is not a
problem<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.680> mean<00:02:52.890> we<00:02:53.190> get<00:02:53.370> in<00:02:53.489> a<00:02:53.580> rented<00:02:53.940> car<00:02:53.970> at

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
problem I mean we get in a rented car at

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.580 
problem I mean we get in a rented car at
Frankfurt<00:02:54.660> Airport<00:02:54.750> you<00:02:55.170> don't<00:02:55.350> need<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.530> be

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
Frankfurt Airport you don't need to be

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.080 
Frankfurt Airport you don't need to be
nervous<00:02:55.620> of<00:02:56.100> us<00:02:56.220> even<00:02:56.430> though<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.700> same<00:02:56.880> ones

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
nervous of us even though the same ones

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.820 
nervous of us even though the same ones
on<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.360> other<00:02:57.390> side<00:02:57.780> especially<00:02:58.620> with<00:02:58.709> the

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
on the other side especially with the

on the other side especially with the
paddle<00:02:59.100> shift<00:02:59.310> if<00:02:59.430> we<00:02:59.520> had<00:02:59.610> to<00:02:59.760> shift<00:03:00.090> gear

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
paddle shift if we had to shift gear

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.479 
paddle shift if we had to shift gear
like<00:03:00.600> this<00:03:00.840> even<00:03:01.620> that's<00:03:01.890> not<00:03:02.100> such<00:03:02.280> a<00:03:02.310> problem

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
like this even that's not such a problem

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.340 
like this even that's not such a problem
because<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.060> old<00:03:03.090> days<00:03:03.480> in<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:03.840> Formula<00:03:04.320> One
