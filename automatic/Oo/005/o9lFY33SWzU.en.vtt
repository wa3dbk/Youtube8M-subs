00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.400
 true 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:19.750
 in a hotel room hugging the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:31.740
 pillow 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:38.900
 I the emotion of the happiest silver 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.900
 had to say that he always knew 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.460
 you were afraid it was a dangerous change 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:50.220
 mirtha if a little it is easy to be wrong 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.370
 but if you are responding from 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.540
 really heart what you feel and see it 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.880
 So safe 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:01.410
 I was 2a but I saw him sure that 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.370
 They are waiting for we have already resolved 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.940
 life from Monica and framework 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:11.320
 until all at once 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.900
 what happens is that 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.440
 if at a time when it happens with books 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.440
 or I said no 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:24.500
 it was because you have another past eight years 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.470
 it is definitely not the same on 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.500
 feeling we have come back to see 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.670
 again we have talked and it is a great 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.560
 woman is a very good person then 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.049
 that's why the change was not why 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.259
 I said because suddenly one does not know what 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.490
 which will happen later then to 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:50.610
 say do not imagine happens I do not know then five 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.230
 months whatever in time 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.420
 who knows what can happen suddenly 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.670
 why why close the door to 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.250
 portal way so definitive 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.100
 surely but 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.170
 it's more than all that's why the change was 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.960
 because he is a very good person 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.890
 'We have the time we had together that 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.040
 It was not much but we get along very well 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.959
 so do not rule out anything like 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.050
 Do you think she will be receiving it? 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:24.990
 is watching on TV and also something 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:27.000
 similar as I have not heard you and has 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.050
 said many we are friends I too 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.100
 I think we are very good friends now and 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.470
 suddenly change that's hard to lose 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.260
 the friendship that we have suddenly returned to 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.830
 have not lose it but not this 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.450
 risking being there again must be of 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.520
 suddenly it gets complicated things come back 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.340
 risk ogando and surely that's why 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.920
 I said yes because I do not rule out 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.900
 because Monica is a very good person and 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.110
 I think I know her well then this one 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.120
 it's more that the whole issue is who knows if 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.160
 which will fall in love with her I do not know 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.500
 but 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.820
 it's funny you're not the first person 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.530
 that I saw in this program and it ends 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.960
 saying who do you know I turn to 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.300
 fall in love 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.300
 and he said that I can not tell you 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.550
 well you have finished level 5 and you have 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.550
 earned 25 thousand soles 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:33.670
 you are a question of winning the 50 thousand 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:36.670
 to a question you already answered 20 only 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:39.269
 missing one there is no like there is no longer as 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.269
 They say they will exhaust the last to 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.269
 blow 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:56.340
 seems easy is one more question but what 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.130
 you risk absolutely everything so in 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.410
 this moment the crossroads is 25 thousand 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:04.440
 50 thousand suns 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.410
 for nothing that looks after all 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.390
 the hours that have waited for you and is 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:11.390
 designated would be downright pathetic 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.290
 now the question that surely about 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.290
 dorita 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.220
 I can not do it, I can not tell you 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.760
 tafalla 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.830
 never the 21 is easy that Juan knows 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.090
 who has been here too 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:37.950
 what does it say come back from cabinet 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:41.660
 what do we want to do let's start with eduardo 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.660
 suddenly we did 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:51.270
 That 's right 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.380
 mirtha what do you say 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.590
 I believe that 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:05:02.700
 you're in a good deal and you have to 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:07.090
 think it well by mile I said enough 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:10.600
 the serene and sensible advice 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:14.770
 he tells you the black of my life 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:19.289
 you hear well run candid good since 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:21.839
 I know the truth about katy dorita network 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:30.889
 and I'm happy because you're getting married 

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:30.889
 with me he asks me I think not 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.630
 is he wants to have read the last question 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:39.940
 that's why he does it 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:44.009
 good is already 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:47.129
 the advice has been said 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:50.449
 I know that greed is always not good 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:50.449
 it eats your head a little 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:58.940
 if the final decision is yours more than 

00:05:55.140 --> 00:06:01.950
 all and if I came here is for was for 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.800
 make clear what is what 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:08.030
 it happened 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:10.400
 to deny so much that was said and 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:14.300
 remove the mask of saints that they had 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:17.690
 several people and I think I've already 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:20.840
 done I think I've already done this this is not what 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:23.259
 I did so much for the money so I 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.259
 I stay here 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:28.650
