the lines you've got a double
fisherman's<00:00:53.969> knot<00:00:54.390> on<00:00:55.019> one<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:56.030> we're<00:00:57.030> going

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
fisherman's knot on one in we're going

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.910 
fisherman's knot on one in we're going
to<00:00:57.179> do<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> same<00:00:58.579> on<00:00:59.579> the<00:01:00.449> other<00:01:00.649> two<00:01:01.649> loops

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
to do the same on the other two loops

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.820 
to do the same on the other two loops
back<00:01:04.920> through<00:01:05.159> both<00:01:05.400> loops<00:01:06.470> get<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.560> pulled

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
back through both loops get it pulled

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.090 
back through both loops get it pulled
tight<00:01:10.790> and<00:01:11.790> when<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.450> pull<00:01:12.720> each<00:01:13.140> end<00:01:13.649> it's<00:01:14.009> a

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
tight and when you pull each end it's a

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.109 
tight and when you pull each end it's a
jam<00:01:14.430> not<00:01:15.409> those<00:01:16.409> two<00:01:16.649> knots<00:01:17.810> jam<00:01:20.000> against<00:01:21.000> each

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
jam not those two knots jam against each

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.120 
jam not those two knots jam against each
other<00:01:23.540> super<00:01:24.540> strong<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.409> we've<00:01:25.560> got<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> loop

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
other super strong so we've got a loop

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.399 
other super strong so we've got a loop
tied<00:01:26.430> with<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.670> double<00:01:27.000> fisherman's<00:01:27.240> knot<00:01:27.630> now

we've got to tie the prusik loop onto
our<00:01:30.810> static<00:01:31.259> line<00:01:32.180> you<00:01:33.180> bring<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.479> loop

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
our static line you bring the loop

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.240 
our static line you bring the loop
behind<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.140> static<00:01:34.560> line<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.950> take<00:01:35.100> this

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
behind the static line and take this

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.850 
behind the static line and take this
knot<00:01:35.520> pull<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.509> down<00:01:36.689> just<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:37.020> little<00:01:37.049> bit<00:01:37.320> you

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.910 
in as you can tell the location that
knot<00:02:26.280> means<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.330> beaner<00:02:27.540> will<00:02:27.870> ride<00:02:28.140> in<00:02:28.500> a

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
knot means the beaner will ride in a

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.590 
knot means the beaner will ride in a
loop<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.340> not<00:02:29.640> on<00:02:29.850> top<00:02:30.030> of<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.209> knot<00:02:30.390> which

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
loop and not on top of that knot which

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.250 
loop and not on top of that knot which
is<00:02:30.630> important

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
is important

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.699 
is important
now<00:02:31.980> you<00:02:32.040> just<00:02:32.250> grasp<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:33.150> prusik<00:02:33.390> as<00:02:33.870> high<00:02:34.650> as

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
now you just grasp the prusik as high as

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.650 
now you just grasp the prusik as high as
you<00:02:34.890> can<00:02:34.920> go<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.520> if<00:02:35.640> you<00:02:35.730> were<00:02:35.850> to<00:02:36.030> fall<00:02:36.300> look

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
you can go and if you were to fall look

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.390 
you can go and if you were to fall look
here

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
here

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.910 
here
it<00:02:38.400> completely<00:02:38.850> catches<00:02:39.390> me<00:02:39.620> but<00:02:40.620> then<00:02:40.740> if<00:02:40.830> I

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
it completely catches me but then if I

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.590 
it completely catches me but then if I
need<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.160> come<00:02:41.340> down<00:02:41.580> just<00:02:41.850> reach<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.300> up<00:02:42.420> and

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
need to come down just reach it up and

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.380 
need to come down just reach it up and
pull<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:43.560> right<00:02:43.740> down<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.490> need<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.730> tie<00:02:44.940> one

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
pull it right down you need to tie one

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.090 
pull it right down you need to tie one
of<00:02:45.420> these<00:02:45.600> static<00:02:46.050> lines<00:02:46.290> with<00:02:46.470> a<00:02:46.500> prusik<00:02:46.800> loop

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
of these static lines with a prusik loop

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.559 
of these static lines with a prusik loop
on<00:02:47.250> every<00:02:47.580> one<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.730> your<00:02:47.940> tree<00:02:48.120> stands<00:02:48.390> and

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
on every one of your tree stands and

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.180 
on every one of your tree stands and
just<00:02:48.690> leave<00:02:48.989> it<00:02:49.020> there<00:02:49.200> for<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.560> season<00:02:50.010> I

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
just leave it there for the season I

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.510 
just leave it there for the season I
mean<00:02:50.580> it's<00:02:50.730> just<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.970> simple<00:02:51.300> matter<00:02:51.450> of

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
mean it's just a simple matter of

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.780 
mean it's just a simple matter of
climbing<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:58.440> as<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.739> can<00:02:58.860> tell<00:02:58.920> I'm<00:02:59.340> never

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
climbing and as you can tell I'm never

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:08.950 
climbing and as you can tell I'm never
without<00:03:00.000> protecting

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.020
