it feels good in the hand and that was

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.390 
it feels good in the hand and that was
definitely<00:01:49.240> something<00:01:49.540> that<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.780> designers

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
definitely something that the designers

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.680 
definitely something that the designers
put<00:01:51.400> into<00:01:51.640> that<00:01:51.670> based<00:01:52.060> on<00:01:52.180> the<00:01:52.330> consumer

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690
