00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.629
 a german woman 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.779
 the profile secretary 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.119
 We're going to make it more or less hard. 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:16.740
 so you can 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.329
 learn too 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:22.160
 the date even plays with her do is highlights he 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.680
 We did not make day cloth so you can also learn the rules of 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.679
 Traffic 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.980
 but I'll do my best here 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.190
 Why do you have hallucinations years coming in that you have minute notion 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.789
 and will spend the whole month 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:47.090
 the concept 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.180
 not 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.440
 with more however would be 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.620
 the product mixture 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.730
 and none but clear that it would be almost white 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.910
 you go 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.420
 if you put the middle ground 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.580
 What are you going to do 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.840
 the base 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.690
 79 min 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.690
 but they did not know 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.370
 I'll make the psd transparent 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.540
 only before making the fabric to do the work that lies 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.770
 a camerata sorocaba 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.530
 for here 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.530
 So let's put the funnel and they'll do it. 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.250
 I'm going to work with the elderly - half bacteria bacteria are yes 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.440
 and irony 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.160
 as I said 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.590
 timid 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.980
 on the other hand said the team knows 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.430
 we pressed 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.340
 dr 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.229
 Danilo 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.409
 I do not dedicate myself since then to another side of marine life 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.480
 Norman 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.830
