this<00:02:08.700> kit<00:02:08.879> like<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.149> said<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.420> geared<00:02:09.660> towards

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
this kit like I said is geared towards

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.110 
this kit like I said is geared towards
the<00:02:10.110> off-road<00:02:10.500> driver<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:11.879> what<00:02:12.030> we

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
the off-road driver and so what we

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.680 
the off-road driver and so what we
included<00:02:12.480> was<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.629> Wilson<00:02:12.900> flex

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
included was a Wilson flex

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.870 
included was a Wilson flex
aunt<00:02:13.810> Anna<00:02:14.050> now<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:15.040> Wilson<00:02:15.370> flex<00:02:15.580> antenna

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
aunt Anna now the Wilson flex antenna

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.450 
aunt Anna now the Wilson flex antenna
differs<00:02:16.360> from<00:02:16.540> most<00:02:16.750> normal<00:02:17.140> antennas<00:02:17.620> most

fibreglass<00:02:21.640> antennas<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:22.270> in<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.600> fact<00:02:22.810> that

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
fibreglass antennas and in the fact that

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.870 
fibreglass antennas and in the fact that
it's<00:02:23.470> much<00:02:23.710> more<00:02:23.980> as<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.520> name<00:02:24.640> implies

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
it's much more as the name implies

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.270 
it's much more as the name implies
flexible<00:02:25.660> than<00:02:25.810> all<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.080> other<00:02:26.230> antennas<00:02:26.740> now

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
flexible than all the other antennas now

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.060 
flexible than all the other antennas now
it's<00:02:27.490> probably<00:02:27.670> about<00:02:28.140> 80<00:02:29.140> printed<00:02:29.740> probably

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
it's probably about 80 printed probably

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.190 
it's probably about 80 printed probably
70%<00:02:30.430> thinner<00:02:30.970> than<00:02:31.270> all<00:02:31.450> other<00:02:31.630> antennas<00:02:32.050> out

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
70% thinner than all other antennas out

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.080 
70% thinner than all other antennas out
there<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:32.920> actually<00:02:33.280> has<00:02:33.610> it's<00:02:33.940> so

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
there and it actually has it's so

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.910 
there and it actually has it's so
flexible<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.570> can<00:02:34.660> bend<00:02:34.960> it<00:02:35.110> into<00:02:35.260> a<00:02:35.410> u-shape

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
flexible you can bend it into a u-shape

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.370 
flexible you can bend it into a u-shape
now<00:02:36.580> this<00:02:37.120> is<00:02:37.240> the<00:02:37.330> benefit<00:02:37.690> is<00:02:37.810> if<00:02:38.020> you<00:02:38.200> do

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
now this is the benefit is if you do

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.830 
now this is the benefit is if you do
catch<00:02:38.650> your<00:02:38.830> antenna<00:02:39.190> on<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.670> branch<00:02:40.270> or<00:02:40.600> on<00:02:40.720> an

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
catch your antenna on a branch or on an

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.410 
catch your antenna on a branch or on an
obstruction<00:02:41.440> or<00:02:41.670> if<00:02:42.670> you're<00:02:42.850> your<00:02:43.030> buddy<00:02:43.210> just

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
obstruction or if you're your buddy just

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.880 
obstruction or if you're your buddy just
ends<00:02:43.570> up<00:02:43.630> slamming<00:02:44.080> into<00:02:44.260> it<00:02:44.380> it's<00:02:44.740> gonna

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
ends up slamming into it it's gonna

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.940 
ends up slamming into it it's gonna
provide<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.370> great<00:02:45.820> deal<00:02:45.850> of<00:02:46.330> flexibility<00:02:47.080> and

swivel hood kit so as you can see here

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.580 
swivel hood kit so as you can see here
this<00:04:22.210> channel<00:04:22.570> right<00:04:22.720> here<00:04:22.900> goes<00:04:23.080> into<00:04:23.500> the

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
this channel right here goes into the

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.740 
this channel right here goes into the
hood<00:04:23.830> and<00:04:24.010> sits<00:04:24.640> in<00:04:24.789> the<00:04:24.880> hood<00:04:25.060> channel<00:04:25.419> the

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
hood and sits in the hood channel the

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.330 
hood and sits in the hood channel the
hood<00:04:25.930> would<00:04:26.050> close<00:04:26.229> right<00:04:26.500> along<00:04:26.680> the<00:04:26.830> side

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
hood would close right along the side

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.010 
hood would close right along the side
and<00:04:27.430> this<00:04:27.880> would<00:04:28.030> be<00:04:28.060> above<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.449> roofline<00:04:28.780> and

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
and this would be above the roofline and

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.680 
and this would be above the roofline and
it<00:04:29.470> actually<00:04:29.620> has<00:04:29.889> a<00:04:29.919> swivel<00:04:30.430> right<00:04:30.910> here<00:04:31.180> to

it actually has a swivel right here to

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.300 
it actually has a swivel right here to
adjust<00:04:31.810> for<00:04:32.290> the<00:04:32.380> hood<00:04:32.560> tilt<00:04:32.770> so<00:04:32.949> this<00:04:33.130> will

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
adjust for the hood tilt so this will

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.340 
adjust for the hood tilt so this will
swivel<00:04:33.550> up<00:04:33.760> and<00:04:33.940> if<00:04:34.030> your<00:04:34.150> hood<00:04:34.360> is<00:04:34.570> slanted
