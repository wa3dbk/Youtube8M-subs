we got copy of a copy of a copy we went

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.729 
we got copy of a copy of a copy we went
up<00:02:47.000> to<00:02:47.030> number<00:02:47.359> eight<00:02:47.599> it<00:02:47.840> didn't<00:02:48.140> work<00:02:48.260> seven

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
up to number eight it didn't work seven

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.619 
up to number eight it didn't work seven
was<00:02:48.920> really<00:02:49.189> tight<00:02:49.459> eight<00:02:50.030> didn't<00:02:50.329> work<00:02:50.480> at

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:50.629 
was really tight eight didn't work at

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.119 
was really tight eight didn't work at
all<00:02:50.689> and<00:02:50.930> this<00:02:51.230> is<00:02:51.319> why<00:02:51.439> you<00:02:51.500> run<00:02:51.680> across<00:02:51.769> key

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
all and this is why you run across key

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:53.530 
all and this is why you run across key
sometimes<00:02:52.549> where<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:52.790> can't<00:02:53.030> get<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.180> key<00:02:53.390> to

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
sometimes where you can't get a key to

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.630 
sometimes where you can't get a key to
cut<00:02:53.900> properly<00:02:54.409> because<00:02:54.829> you're<00:02:55.040> cutting<00:02:55.430> a

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
cut properly because you're cutting a

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.240 
cut properly because you're cutting a
copy<00:02:56.000> of<00:02:56.239> a<00:02:56.269> copy<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.750> a<00:02:56.840> copy<00:02:56.989> try<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:58.010> get<00:02:58.159> the

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
copy of a copy of a copy try to get the
