00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.639
 hello staff is a little distant to 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.889
 Speak of the catch to today I came to speak of sbk 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:14.820
 2.0 is in beta exclusively for users 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.430
 android up for publishing issues 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:21.420
 to apply everything is easier, not to 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.090
 people to release and not talk in blood 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.710
 Too bad the apple does not let you stand 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.340
 outside applications 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.540
 as long as you make the break one day 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:37.050
 good what changed in version 2.0 the first 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.480
 thing you need to know is if you 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.809
 You want to do this test it's beta version 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.289
 totally beto exists in several bugs 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.020
 with respect to the housing e.g. 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:52.410
 if you hold the back button of your 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.930
 foot push hold the button on the back of the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.170
 I'll get it off and I will not say 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.039
 think that a problem already in version 1.3 and 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.760
 that we have 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.320
 he holds in the two seconds it 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.590
 off in any of the buttons do not 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.960
 go back up and down selection 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.439
 this interface to bid're you might 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.799
 already debating and silence in version 1.1 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:21.630
 but what has changed is specifically not 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:24.270
 who I was version 1.13 until I did 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.549
 this beta test you need to have 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.259
 to actually download http time together 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.960
 with other apps 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.000
 so here is the passion of the caught in my 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.180
 then without getting a connection from the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.420
 ATP time and among other applications 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.310
 you can do the management there is version 2 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.200
 0 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.400
 it will only allow you to have the 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.540
 fire app from the get 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:55.240
 So cloud it, would not you? 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:58.720
 bid application configuration 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:03.010
 now you do not get caught in your 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.120
 clock interface is not even for 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.910
 show you what it really is 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:10.149
 different you come here to download 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:15.990
 it speaks applications to version 2.0 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:19.030
 It's not the same version you have there. 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.490
 putting the cnaa in the interface that changed 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.850
 you now have this cycle of 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:28.060
 it's fit so, for example, I downloaded it 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:31.900
 this tz interface 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.030
 This one from the top and zé she brings to you 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.860
 are in different zones are here in 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.959
 clock has automatically changed is 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.130
 say that there are 10 and 15 in the 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.130
 local time 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.900
 and I left pre-selected new york 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:46.420
 Grandson, he brings me here in the corner. 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.110
 You can not read, I can only draw near. 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.640
 for you it brings there - 5 is what is the 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.870
 gmt 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:58.750
 you can define other cities as 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:03.310
 around the world just by clicking the world 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.350
 here unintentionally I selected is a soul 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.060
 If I had to save 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:09.220
 he will throw this information here 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.980
 I do not need to stay on my cell phone. 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.760
 customs loved by outside or select 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.340
 chicago and I'm going to send chicago here 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.340
 - know is made the selection and asks to 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.070
 you go back in the selection and then you click 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.320
 again but your setting only only 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:29.319
 to exemplify the operation 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:33.249
 of this new sdk 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:36.189
 It's good that it's changed more than 

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:40.769
 to this in addition to the fact that you do not have to 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:43.599
 to download a series of applications 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.209
 the idea of ​​peba that now in the 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:50.290
 version 2.0 already has a bukit foot, right? 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.969
 access via http using your 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.590
 local data network 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:58.859
 if it's downloading it's plugins these are there 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:02.139
 one very important thing to say is that 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:05.290
 these applications for example if the 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:08.530
 that they used it, right? 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.810
 it will not work any more with aa 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.430
 version 2.0 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.980
 precisely because it is totally 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.870
 one incompatible applications of silica 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:22.509
 for two they have changed a lot 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:24.610
 structure to the background we have the 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:27.759
 version 2.0 that I will put the link in 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.880
 description of this video where they 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:32.139
 emphasize that the use is only for 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.870
 android 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:39.060
 something that is very important for 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:41.229
 to say is that you the user to 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.680
 Android, you do not have to pay much 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:48.669
 attention to us the android but how to 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.849
 apple you need to pay attention to 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:54.280
 question of your serial on then here you 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:56.139
 has an appliance serial number if 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.610
 it starts with letters or numbers 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:02.849
 this information is important to you 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:06.970
 download the movie version not to 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:12.009
 to play or not to be quoted 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:13.599
 break your device is at it's 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:15.460
 making it clear here was what I 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:18.130
 said at the beginning of the video is the limited 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:21.130
 only for users, not for users 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.139
 android or android developers is well 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.300
 interesting after you if you have 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:27.370
 Curiosity you are a developer, right? 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.310
 someone in the community has already 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.169
 an emulator for windows is in 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:36.969
 applications for you to test before 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:38.860
 Turn on your good foot, yeah, it was not the team. 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:42.190
 of the catch that developed a simulator 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.870
 so soon was a someone in the community 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.320
 the most important part I said 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.570
 for it was this here in opa 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.000
 I think my mother has too much then 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:55.300
 saying so followed his serial number 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.460
 of the foot I will start with the number is this 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.460
 frame that has to go down in this cold for 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.650
 here if it starts with what ever 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.430
 download this here it is important to think 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:08.140
 much attention in this information made 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.420
 download you will in the application itself 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:13.960
 of pacaembu and does the loading 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:16.180
 in it 's it does the good update to 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:20.710
