for North York Moors they think there
might<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.390> few<00:00:54.930> more<00:00:55.170> James<00:00:56.100> McConnell

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670

and Hannah Henshaw are trying to find
them<00:00:59.370> at<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.090> moment<00:01:00.510> though<00:01:00.660> they're

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
them at the moment though they're

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.039

struggling to find their own cameras so

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.600 
struggling to find their own cameras so
I<00:01:04.080> think<00:01:04.409> it's<00:01:04.559> just<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.890> little<00:01:05.189> bit<00:01:05.309> further

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
I think it's just a little bit further

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.710 
I think it's just a little bit further
off<00:01:05.700> there<00:01:06.119> we<00:01:06.869> should<00:01:07.049> spy<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.590> second

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
off there we should spy it in a second

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.440 
off there we should spy it in a second
they<00:01:09.720> set<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.290> series<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.920> traps<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.760> prime<00:01:12.420> a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
from earlier does this match is this

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.880

your shoes first pine marten for a
hundred<00:01:53.399> years<00:01:53.899> apparently<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.350> shot<00:01:55.680> is

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
hundred years apparently this shot is

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.179 
hundred years apparently this shot is
inconclusive<00:01:56.719> we've<00:01:57.719> quite<00:01:58.229> blurry<00:01:58.829> and

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
inconclusive we've quite blurry and

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.450 
inconclusive we've quite blurry and
shadowy<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.530> we<00:02:01.530> just<00:02:01.649> want<00:02:01.829> 200<00:02:02.250> percent

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
shadowy so we just want 200 percent

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.539 
shadowy so we just want 200 percent
positive<00:02:02.729> really<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.170> found<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.439> poop<00:02:04.649> we

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
positive really and you found a poop we

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:06.500 
positive really and you found a poop we
think<00:02:05.820> so

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
think so

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.410 
think so
scat<00:02:07.100> yeah<00:02:08.100> we<00:02:08.280> think<00:02:08.460> so<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:09.119> gone<00:02:09.300> off<00:02:09.390> for

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
scat yeah we think so it's gone off for

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.540 
scat yeah we think so it's gone off for
DNA<00:02:09.960> testing<00:02:11.210> Fox<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:13.260> PI<00:02:13.860> mine<00:02:14.040> are<00:02:14.220> fairly

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
DNA testing Fox and PI mine are fairly

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.210 
DNA testing Fox and PI mine are fairly
similar<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.590> it's<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.830> difference<00:02:17.160> between

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
similar so it's the difference between

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.810 
similar so it's the difference between
them<00:02:17.910> are<00:02:18.030> quite<00:02:18.180> subtle<00:02:18.480> so<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:20.430> doesn't<00:02:20.760> need

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
them are quite subtle so it doesn't need

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.900 
them are quite subtle so it doesn't need
