know drop threes and this is a 34 I

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.370 
know drop threes and this is a 34 I
normally<00:00:26.250> swing<00:00:26.490> with<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.640> 32<00:00:27.359> or<00:00:27.630> 33<00:00:27.930> and

normally swing with the 32 or 33 and
this<00:00:29.130> feels<00:00:29.550> about<00:00:29.820> anywhere<00:00:30.689> from<00:00:31.219> anywhere

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
this feels about anywhere from anywhere

this feels about anywhere from anywhere
I<00:00:32.399> don't<00:00:32.669> know<00:00:32.730> 28<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.329> 30<00:00:33.510> ounces<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.170> it's

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
I don't know 28 to 30 ounces so it's

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.520 
I don't know 28 to 30 ounces so it's
kind<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.100> heavy<00:00:35.280> but<00:00:35.610> it's<00:00:35.910> not<00:00:36.149> as<00:00:36.480> heavy<00:00:37.260> as

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
kind of heavy but it's not as heavy as

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.830 
kind of heavy but it's not as heavy as
it's<00:00:37.800> supposed<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.280> be<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:39.120> comparison<00:00:39.690> to

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
it's supposed to be in comparison to

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.630 
it's supposed to be in comparison to
your<00:00:40.290> regular<00:00:40.710> back<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.219> course<00:00:41.460> that's

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
your regular back and of course that's

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.700 
your regular back and of course that's
you<00:00:42.000> know<00:00:42.059> because<00:00:42.300> its<00:00:42.480> bamboo<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.140> it

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
you know because its bamboo and it

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.510 
you know because its bamboo and it
doesn't<00:00:44.280> have<00:00:44.399> as<00:00:44.520> much<00:00:45.050> wood<00:00:46.050> on<00:00:46.079> it<00:00:46.230> has<00:00:47.100> a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
doesn't have as much wood on it has a

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.970 
doesn't have as much wood on it has a
wood<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.180> would<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:49.050> construction<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.800> it

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
wood that would the construction of it

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.290 
wood that would the construction of it
if<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.520> if<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.270> see<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.690> it's<00:00:53.239> kind<00:00:54.239> of

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
if you if you see it it's kind of

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.459 
if you if you see it it's kind of
interesting<00:00:54.629> Lee<00:00:55.670> assembled<00:00:56.670> it's<00:00:57.350> it's<00:00:58.350> like

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
interesting Lee assembled it's it's like

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.400 
interesting Lee assembled it's it's like
a<00:00:58.559> cross<00:00:58.770> pattern<00:00:59.129> on<00:00:59.969> here<00:01:00.239> it's<00:01:00.899> not<00:01:01.140> a

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
a cross pattern on here it's not a

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.640 
a cross pattern on here it's not a
straight<00:01:01.890> wood<00:01:02.190> bat<00:01:02.719> and<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.840> think<00:01:04.110> part<00:01:04.530> of

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
straight wood bat and I think part of

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.859 
straight wood bat and I think part of
that<00:01:04.710> has<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.369> with<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.610> fact<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.939> you're

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
that has to do with the fact that you're

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.440 
that has to do with the fact that you're
able<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.140> swing<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:08.070> all<00:01:08.250> sides<00:01:08.580> of<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.939> it's

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
able to swing with all sides of it it's

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.690 
able to swing with all sides of it it's
a<00:01:09.600> great<00:01:09.780> bat<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.229> use<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.680> would<00:01:10.799> say<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.130> grip

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
a great bat to use I would say the grip

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.570 
a great bat to use I would say the grip
tape<00:01:11.909> itself<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> little<00:01:12.960> interesting<00:01:13.740> I

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
tape itself is a little interesting I

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.789 
tape itself is a little interesting I
probably<00:01:15.030> take<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.659> off<00:01:15.780> it's<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.530> already

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
probably take it off it's it's already

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.440 
probably take it off it's it's already
starting<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.340> come<00:01:17.670> off<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.000> I've<00:01:18.090> only<00:01:18.210> use

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
starting to come off and I've only use

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.990 
starting to come off and I've only use
this<00:01:18.600> for<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> cages<00:01:19.290> again<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:20.189> is<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.460> 34

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
this for the cages again this is a 34

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.070 
this for the cages again this is a 34
inch<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:22.070> I<00:01:23.150> would<00:01:24.150> definitely<00:01:24.270> recommend<00:01:24.570> it

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
I've used it for live batting practice

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.719 
I've used it for live batting practice
in<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.420> cages<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.200> yeah<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.250> great<00:01:29.490> for

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
in the cages and yeah it's great for

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.840 
in the cages and yeah it's great for
well<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:31.049> skill<00:01:31.439> says<00:01:31.759> you<00:01:32.759> know

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.640 
well like like skill says you know
hand-eye<00:01:33.180> coordination<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.020> it's<00:01:34.500> already

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
hand-eye coordination so it's already

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.160 
hand-eye coordination so it's already
got<00:01:34.860> scuff<00:01:35.100> marks<00:01:35.369> but<00:01:35.549> I<00:01:35.579> go<00:01:35.700> ahead<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.270> way

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
got scuff marks but I go ahead the way

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.870 
got scuff marks but I go ahead the way
it's<00:01:37.320> designed<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:38.009> know<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:38.579> going<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.759> get

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
it's designed you know it's going to get

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.620 
it's designed you know it's going to get
roughed<00:01:39.270> up<00:01:39.450> but

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
roughed up but

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.030 
roughed up but
yeah<00:01:40.780> definitely<00:01:41.350> recommend<00:01:41.799> it<00:01:41.860> if<00:01:42.009> you're

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
yeah definitely recommend it if you're

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.100 
yeah definitely recommend it if you're
looking<00:01:42.490> you<00:01:42.880> know<00:01:42.909> for<00:01:43.689> hand-eye

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
looking you know for hand-eye

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.319 
looking you know for hand-eye
coordination<00:01:44.500> drills<00:01:44.829> you<00:01:45.340> can<00:01:45.610> also<00:01:45.820> use

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
coordination drills you can also use

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:48.480 
coordination drills you can also use
willfffle<00:01:46.869> balls<00:01:46.899> with<00:01:47.229> this<00:01:47.439> and<00:01:47.740> because

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
willfffle balls with this and because

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.090 
willfffle balls with this and because
it's<00:01:48.640> you<00:01:48.789> know<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:49.090> thinner<00:01:49.329> barrel<00:01:49.750> and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
it's you know the thinner barrel and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.370 
it's you know the thinner barrel and
also<00:01:51.100> smaller<00:01:52.000> like<00:01:52.270> mini<00:01:52.509> wiffle<00:01:52.869> balls<00:01:53.049> to

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
also smaller like mini wiffle balls to

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.319 
also smaller like mini wiffle balls to
hit<00:01:53.829> with<00:01:53.950> this<00:01:54.100> as<00:01:54.310> well<00:01:54.460> so<00:01:55.030> that<00:01:55.060> way<00:01:55.270> you

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
hit with this as well so that way you

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:56.370 
hit with this as well so that way you
definitely<00:01:55.869> improve<00:01:56.140> your<00:01:56.289> hand-eye

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380
