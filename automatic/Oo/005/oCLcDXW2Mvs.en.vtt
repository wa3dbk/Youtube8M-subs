00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.129

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.279
 mobile congress 2015 again pavilion 8 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.140
 this time we are the secure stand 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.210
 a Brazilian city that brought 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.770
 this device maybe you can 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.810
 recognize this is a prototype based 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.669
 on a link 5 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:30.700
 but this is not the important thing is called 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.950
 granit phone and is a platform for 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.630
 secure communications 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.470
 what does encrypted calls mean? 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.940
 best protection messages 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.440
 possible protection or at least that 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.740
 they can offer a product 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.270
 interesting that comes from a service 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.820
 desktop and is already existing there 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.680
 secure platform already existed based 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:56.020
 on windows it is transferred to the phone 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.020
 for the first one that is really armored 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.850
 heavily armored, there is no store 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:03.520
 there is no download application 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.220
 sync with nothing but 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.689
 with the windows platform for sure e 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.549
 just to synchronize contacts 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:14.740
 existing is a product of appearance 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.770
 the fact that they are extremely solid 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.820
 among other things present and active in Brazil 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:24.670
 helps the most attentive because they are not 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.350
 bound to part of the united states 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.960
 here is the interface as you see it was 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.120
 revised the base is android 5.0 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.790
 lollipop but it was completely 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.460
 magazine here we have the information of 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.770
 basis 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.140
 this interface calls here we have 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.140
 the of mail 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.290
 messages we can choose whether to do one 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.009
 encrypted call or not 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.659
 same applies to messages between respect 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.250
 black with a model that came out the year 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.229
 last among other things have just come out 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.960
 they too with a new model this is 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.600
 yes but it is much more closed less flexible 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.110
 it's not like you said you can't room v 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.970
 the play store or download an apk no there 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.760
 these four that secure conditions 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.630
 blocked as nothing else is born 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.220
 nothing less 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.950
 should arrive on the market in 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.150

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.250

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.040
 shipped worldwide if you buy it 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.799
 a couple you can tell me 1 you and at 1 a 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.019
 your heart friend to your mind 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:34.140
 to your accomplice and stay more or less 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:35.610
 sure that the call is protected as 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.950
 as usual I do not recommend decorating life 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.630
 legal also as a gender expert for 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.930
