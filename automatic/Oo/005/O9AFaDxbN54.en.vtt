00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
the running of the country up until then

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.359 
the running of the country up until then
it<00:01:36.049> was<00:01:36.170> very<00:01:36.380> important<00:01:36.830> in<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.040> running<00:01:37.280> of

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
it was very important in the running of

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.880 
it was very important in the running of
a<00:01:37.549> lot<00:01:37.700> of<00:01:37.729> countries<00:01:37.939> and<00:01:38.299> in<00:01:39.259> this<00:01:39.380> country

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
a lot of countries and in this country

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.710 
a lot of countries and in this country
is<00:01:39.950> where<00:01:40.280> the<00:01:40.400> state<00:01:40.670> became<00:01:41.030> more<00:01:41.240> important

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
is where the state became more important

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.440 
is where the state became more important
after<00:01:41.990> Becket<00:01:42.500> in<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:43.159> running<00:01:43.460> of<00:01:43.610> the

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
after Becket in the running of the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.090 
after Becket in the running of the
affairs<00:01:44.900> of<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.110> country<00:01:45.259> as<00:01:45.680> opposed<00:01:45.950> to<00:01:46.009> the

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
affairs of the country as opposed to the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.620 
affairs of the country as opposed to the
church<00:01:46.340> so<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:46.880> church<00:01:47.030> lost<00:01:47.299> a<00:01:47.420> lot<00:01:47.570> of

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
church so the church lost a lot of

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.700 
church so the church lost a lot of
influence<00:01:47.990> when<00:01:48.650> we<00:01:48.950> moved<00:01:49.159> in<00:01:49.400> we<00:01:49.990> wanted<00:01:50.990> to

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
influence when we moved in we wanted to

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.859 
influence when we moved in we wanted to
