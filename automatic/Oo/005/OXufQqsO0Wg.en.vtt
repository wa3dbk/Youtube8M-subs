semi-annually<00:00:07.149> on<00:00:07.390> the<00:00:07.450> Green<00:00:07.660> River<00:00:07.840> we<00:00:08.200> look

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:08.650 
semi-annually on the Green River we look

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.360 
semi-annually on the Green River we look
at<00:00:08.969> the<00:00:09.969> fish<00:00:10.629> in<00:00:10.900> in<00:00:11.320> the<00:00:11.500> river<00:00:11.709> itself<00:00:12.040> looks

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:12.370 
at the fish in in the river itself looks

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.890 
at the fish in in the river itself looks
at<00:00:12.520> lengths<00:00:12.850> and<00:00:12.969> weights<00:00:13.150> and<00:00:13.449> we're<00:00:13.539> also<00:00:13.629> in

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
at lengths and weights and we're also in

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.800 
at lengths and weights and we're also in
putting<00:00:14.650> tags<00:00:15.219> in<00:00:15.459> these<00:00:15.610> fish<00:00:15.879> so<00:00:16.630> that<00:00:16.750> we

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
putting tags in these fish so that we

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.120 
putting tags in these fish so that we
can<00:00:16.930> track<00:00:17.170> their<00:00:17.350> growth<00:00:17.590> over<00:00:17.890> several

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
can track their growth over several

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.300 
can track their growth over several
years<00:00:19.050> this<00:00:20.050> has<00:00:20.109> been<00:00:20.500> happening<00:00:20.680> for

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.310 
years this has been happening for

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:23.370 
years this has been happening for
approximately<00:00:21.939> 25<00:00:22.390> years<00:00:22.689> now<00:00:22.960> so<00:00:23.169> we've<00:00:23.259> got

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
approximately 25 years now so we've got

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:26.159 
approximately 25 years now so we've got
real<00:00:23.589> good<00:00:23.740> data<00:00:23.919> on<00:00:24.039> the<00:00:24.160> river<00:00:24.369> and<00:00:25.169> will

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:26.169 
real good data on the river and will

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:27.689 
real good data on the river and will
continue<00:00:26.439> to<00:00:26.589> collect<00:00:26.830> this<00:00:27.009> information<00:00:27.189> in

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:27.699 
continue to collect this information in

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.999 
continue to collect this information in
the<00:00:27.789> future<00:00:28.179> to<00:00:28.449> get<00:00:29.289> an<00:00:29.380> idea<00:00:29.650> of<00:00:29.710> what<00:00:29.919> the

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
the future to get an idea of what the

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.470 
the future to get an idea of what the
fishery<00:00:30.339> is<00:00:30.429> looking<00:00:30.789> like<00:00:30.970> health-wise<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
fishery is looking like health-wise the

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.840 
fishery is looking like health-wise the
book<00:00:35.290> would<00:00:35.380> actually<00:00:35.770> sets<00:00:35.980> up<00:00:36.130> a<00:00:36.250> field<00:00:36.489> of

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
book would actually sets up a field of

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.760 
book would actually sets up a field of
electricity<00:00:37.420> between<00:00:37.780> the<00:00:38.140> electrodes<00:00:38.590> that

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:38.770 
electricity between the electrodes that

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.230 
electricity between the electrodes that
stick<00:00:39.010> out<00:00:39.100> and<00:00:39.280> from<00:00:39.490> the<00:00:39.610> boat<00:00:39.790> in<00:00:40.030> the<00:00:40.060> boat

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.240 
stick out and from the boat in the boat

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.660 
stick out and from the boat in the boat
itself<00:00:40.450> so<00:00:41.440> up<00:00:41.770> in<00:00:41.800> front<00:00:42.100> of<00:00:42.220> the<00:00:42.310> boat<00:00:42.490> you

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
itself so up in front of the boat you

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.700 
itself so up in front of the boat you
have<00:00:42.820> a<00:00:42.850> field<00:00:43.240> of<00:00:43.480> electricity<00:00:44.380> that

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
have a field of electricity that

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.150 
have a field of electricity that
actually<00:00:45.070> stuns<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.610> fish<00:00:46.890> makes<00:00:47.890> it<00:00:48.010> so

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
actually stuns the fish makes it so

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.190 
actually stuns the fish makes it so
basically<00:00:48.520> paralyzes<00:00:49.450> and<00:00:49.570> they<00:00:49.660> do<00:00:49.840> the<00:00:50.020> same

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
basically paralyzes and they do the same

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.630 
basically paralyzes and they do the same
thing<00:00:50.410> to<00:00:50.440> you<00:00:50.680> if<00:00:50.890> you<00:00:51.010> dropped<00:00:51.250> in<00:00:51.400> the<00:00:51.490> water

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
thing to you if you dropped in the water

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.430 
thing to you if you dropped in the water
it's<00:00:52.030> just<00:00:52.270> a<00:00:52.420> lot<00:00:52.630> of<00:00:52.660> electricity<00:00:53.080> going

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
it's just a lot of electricity going

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.080 
it's just a lot of electricity going
through<00:00:53.560> wasn't<00:00:54.400> actually<00:00:54.640> harming<00:00:54.970> the<00:00:55.060> fish

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
through wasn't actually harming the fish

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.540 
through wasn't actually harming the fish
they<00:00:55.450> can<00:00:55.570> recover<00:00:55.930> from<00:00:56.170> it<00:00:56.380> but<00:00:57.130> it<00:00:57.280> stuns

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
they can recover from it but it stuns

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.040 
they can recover from it but it stuns
them<00:00:57.730> so<00:00:57.880> that<00:00:57.910> we<00:00:58.120> have<00:00:58.150> the<00:00:58.300> opportunity<00:00:59.020> to

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.050 
them so that we have the opportunity to

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.800 
them so that we have the opportunity to
net<00:00:59.560> them<00:00:59.740> and<00:01:00.040> select<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:01.060> fish<00:01:01.330> that<00:01:01.750> we

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:01.810 
net them and select the fish that we

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.490 
net them and select the fish that we
want<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.820> an<00:01:04.089> evening<00:01:04.360> will<00:01:04.780> typically<00:01:05.199> work

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
want in an evening will typically work

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.739 
want in an evening will typically work
between<00:01:05.799> 600<00:01:06.460> and<00:01:06.490> 800<00:01:06.640> fish<00:01:07.210> net<00:01:07.990> pens<00:01:08.320> on<00:01:08.560> the

00:01:09.739 --> 00:01:09.749 
between 600 and 800 fish net pens on the

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:12.120 
between 600 and 800 fish net pens on the
stretch<00:01:10.749> of<00:01:10.929> river<00:01:11.109> that<00:01:11.320> we're<00:01:11.469> looking<00:01:11.740> at<00:01:11.859> a

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
stretch of river that we're looking at a

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.919 
stretch of river that we're looking at a
below<00:01:12.579> the<00:01:12.759> dam<00:01:12.939> there's<00:01:13.270> a<00:01:13.329> few<00:01:13.539> more<00:01:13.659> fish<00:01:13.899> in

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:13.929 
below the dam there's a few more fish in

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:15.630 
below the dam there's a few more fish in
there<00:01:14.229> are<00:01:14.380> down<00:01:14.560> up<00:01:14.679> little<00:01:14.950> bowls<00:01:15.130> we<00:01:15.399> end<00:01:15.520> up

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
there are down up little bowls we end up

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.270 
there are down up little bowls we end up
usually<00:01:16.149> work<00:01:16.479> in<00:01:16.570> 100<00:01:16.990> to<00:01:17.200> 150<00:01:17.710> more<00:01:18.009> fish

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
usually work in 100 to 150 more fish

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.190 
usually work in 100 to 150 more fish
below<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.060> dam<00:01:19.240> than<00:01:19.479> we<00:01:19.570> do<00:01:19.689> a<00:01:19.719> little<00:01:19.990> hole

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
below the dam than we do a little hole

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.429 
below the dam than we do a little hole
little<00:01:21.009> capture<00:01:21.429> fish<00:01:21.729> goes<00:01:22.090> away<00:01:22.270> from<00:01:22.810> four

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
little capture fish goes away from four

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.690 
little capture fish goes away from four
inches<00:01:23.920> up<00:01:24.189> to<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:26.170> know<00:01:26.259> ten<00:01:26.499> pound<00:01:26.770> fish<00:01:27.039> the

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
inches up to you know ten pound fish the

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.550 
inches up to you know ten pound fish the
larger<00:01:28.179> fish<00:01:28.329> are<00:01:28.479> pretty<00:01:28.689> rare<00:01:28.899> just<00:01:29.350> because

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
larger fish are pretty rare just because

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.349 
larger fish are pretty rare just because
they<00:01:29.590> can<00:01:29.859> typically<00:01:30.189> feel<00:01:30.460> the<00:01:30.640> electric

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
they can typically feel the electric

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:33.209 
they can typically feel the electric
field<00:01:31.569> coming<00:01:31.990> at<00:01:32.140> them<00:01:32.319> so<00:01:32.859> they<00:01:32.979> can<00:01:33.130> get

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219 
field coming at them so they can get

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:34.649 
field coming at them so they can get
away<00:01:33.340> a<00:01:33.460> little<00:01:33.670> faster<00:01:34.119> than<00:01:34.149> the<00:01:34.359> smaller

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
away a little faster than the smaller

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.539 
away a little faster than the smaller
fish<00:01:34.899> but<00:01:35.439> the<00:01:35.530> small<00:01:35.770> fish<00:01:35.979> is<00:01:36.130> really<00:01:36.399> what

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
fish but the small fish is really what

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.309 
fish but the small fish is really what
we're<00:01:36.670> trying<00:01:36.789> to<00:01:36.909> look<00:01:37.060> at<00:01:37.299> the<00:01:37.780> growth<00:01:38.020> is<00:01:38.289> a

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
we're trying to look at the growth is a

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:39.989 
we're trying to look at the growth is a
lot<00:01:38.560> we<00:01:38.979> can<00:01:39.100> determine<00:01:39.369> the<00:01:39.549> growth<00:01:39.759> on<00:01:39.969> the

00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:39.999 
lot we can determine the growth on the

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.590 
lot we can determine the growth on the
fish

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
fish

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.780 
fish
and<00:01:40.720> they<00:01:41.170> also<00:01:41.350> have<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.250> toughest<00:01:42.610> time

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
and they also have the the toughest time

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.490 
and they also have the the toughest time
surviving<00:01:43.150> in<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.540> river<00:01:43.720> so<00:01:43.930> if<00:01:43.990> we<00:01:44.170> get<00:01:44.290> good

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
surviving in the river so if we get good

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.560 
surviving in the river so if we get good
survival<00:01:45.490> of<00:01:45.580> our<00:01:45.700> young<00:01:45.880> fish<00:01:46.150> that<00:01:46.390> means

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
survival of our young fish that means

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.080 
survival of our young fish that means
we're<00:01:47.110> doing<00:01:47.320> well<00:01:47.500> and<00:01:47.680> for<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:48.759> resource

rainbows<00:02:22.600> below<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.140> dam<00:02:23.319> and<00:02:23.530> as<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.739> get

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
rainbows below the dam and as you get

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.199 
rainbows below the dam and as you get
closer<00:02:24.190> down<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.580> little<00:02:24.850> hole<00:02:24.970> where

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
closer down the little hole where

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.530 
closer down the little hole where
actually<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.810> percentage<00:02:26.800> goes<00:02:26.980> up<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.370> 80<00:02:28.000> 20

changed over the last 10 years or so and
we're<00:02:34.120> not<00:02:34.209> sure<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:35.049> what<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.920> cause<00:02:36.220> of

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
we're not sure and what the cause of

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.809 
we're not sure and what the cause of
that<00:02:36.489> is<00:02:36.790> but

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
that is but

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.839 
that is but
we're<00:02:39.239> looking<00:02:39.510> at<00:02:39.629> trying<00:02:39.930> to<00:02:40.049> figure<00:02:40.319> out
