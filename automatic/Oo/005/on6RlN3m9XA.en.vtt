00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:02.050
 I felt that the main player 

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.050
 it's the crowd 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:09.769
 remember that the attack 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.769
 this shit 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.100
 exactly 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.500
 just to congratulate this performance was created the prize twisted 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.440
 of gold 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.700
 and to deliver this award 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.700
 we call a little boring and speech the sports minister 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.350
 Sorondo Silva Junior 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.740
 shortly thereafter 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.040
 even if the recipient of a legion of people interested only in having a 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.640
 team to celebrate 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.830
 tite must send to field its performance in the top 10 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.830
 the fans of Flemish each state 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.780
 representing the situation was in são paulo 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.540
 the president of flamingo 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.540
 the brass braid 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.229
 currently the toulouse that what does not greet cbf ask style tips 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:58.429
 by the party 

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:01.009
 Everyone went 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:02.259
 winners 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:03.919
 we could have 

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:06.049
 just make a record 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.929
 I really like soccer, I come from stadiums 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:11.349
 and I realized that when the missiles 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.559
 there was a significant change in the behavior of the fans 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:16.899
 first in lack of security 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:19.899
 it's creepy you see the flamenco crowd in the maracanã stadium 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.569
 singing songs in honor of his team 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:29.129
 Above all, it is very important to change the attitudes of 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.980
 abandoning the aggressive chants of criticism with their opponents 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.239
 divorced words of encouragement from their teams that attitude 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.239
 it's very important 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:46.869
 a family abyss 

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:48.219
 the passion 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:51.639
 which is the biggest goal for Brazilian soccer congratulations to the nation 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.639
 red-black 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.189
 this twisted minister 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:08.189
 is the biggest asset of the Flemish regatta club 

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:17.009
 she attended in mass 

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:20.009
 to states here in rio de janeiro 

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:24.189
 we proved our fans proved 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:27.189
 that the Flemish is the biggest club in the world 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:36.749
 for example 

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:39.779
 there is no example of world football 

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:41.080
 from a club 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.029
 that I put 

00:04:44.029 --> 00:04:45.309
 in the field 

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:48.539
 fans paying for tickets 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.860
 in the amount of one million 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.650
 13 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.259
 both those of 96 thousand 

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:59.159
 fanatical fans for Flamengo's regatta club come 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:08.129
 this crowd 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:10.770
 changed the whole course of Flemish 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.589
 let's god us there 

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:13.889

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.209
