00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.919
 hello everyone good here greets him 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.890
 guardian of the emerald teacher of 

00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:10.930
 super cores 64 and good today 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:13.180
 I bring you a video that came to my mind 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.890
 do a few seconds ago in this video 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.199
 I will talk about a series that in a 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.090
 I did not notice the principle but 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.340
 Then I looked at it and it started 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.980
 like I'm talking about the new series 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.440
 of clarence ok how this video will be 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.330
 short I will explain in summary form of what 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.070
 what is this series about without visiting 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.529
 no website like wikipedia or 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.359
 clarence wiki clarence is a series that 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.850
 talks about the crazy adventures of a 

00:00:34.359 --> 00:00:38.949
 boy about 11 years old I think he has 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.749
 a positive vision of the world 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.789
 he has misadventures with his two 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:45.190
 best friends jeff and added which one 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:47.319
 they have different personalities 10 is 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.659
 quiet and studious but added more 

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:51.879
 restless and ignorant also in the series 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:54.399
 characters appear as his mother who does not 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.960
 I remember the name of this one she has a 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.879
 boyfriend I do not remember the name either 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.949
 but what I see likes him 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.769
 Clarence and Clarence like her 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.780
 his mother's partner another character is amy 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.880
 which is Clarence's friend and in a 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.140
 episode says that maybe the other year will 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.030
 change school 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.220
 there is also one called benson or something 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.800
 so apparently he hates clarence and he 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.479
 plays jokes on others although it seems 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.670
 to please Clarence but he does not want it 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.290
 confess good I already talked about the story 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.600
 of the series and its characters 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.040
 now I will give you my opinion what it is that 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.440
 more important in this video 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.570
 ok because as you think I like it a lot 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.790
 this series but I do not know whether to consider it the 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.710
 better now but there is something that is 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.770
 series does not have of the other series of the 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.690
 current cartoon network to see let's see in 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.670
 one more show there are two characters that 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.250
 they work in a park where they occur 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.440
 unreal events and phenomena in time 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.450
 adventure is almost the same only that in 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.369
 instead of working in a park both 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.920
 characters pretend and fight against 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.500
 monsters in great uncle for talks about 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.660
 an uncle with assistants in charge of 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.270
 to help children sometimes use 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.490
 magic and the last example that I will give is the 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.470
 from steven universe a series that 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.509
 focuses on a child that is part of a 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.759
 group of supernatural beings that must 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.340
 take care of the world of any threat is 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.170
 they gave account in clarence nothing happens 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.360
 of that in Clarence there are no things 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.319
 supernatural unless I have 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.150
 viewed 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.340
 the plot and the episodes are not so 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.249
 complex as they can be in time 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.620
 adventure or a show more practically are 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:25.870
 much more realistic as for example the 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.879
 episode where clarence spends all the 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.459
 day with a girl or where they go to a 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.560
 video game room as we see the series 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:35.290
 It seems boring to have no action as 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.209
 in other cartoon network series but 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.219
 I assure you it is not because the 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.650
 series despite being simplistic is very 

00:02:39.219 --> 00:02:43.599
 entertaining and funny as well as can 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.030
 hooking a child can also 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.129
 do with a young adult in this order 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.200
 series is great fun and also 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:52.239
 original although sometimes it reminded me 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.609
 to efe and diet and for the antics of 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.530
 clarence jeff and added but eye is not a 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.909
 plagiarism or anything like that both 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.280
 series are different 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:02.500
 ok I was left speechless to say 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.540
 from this series I can only tell you that 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.849
 see, I assure you that you will like it 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.980
 there's a lot else this video too 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.780
 was to let them know that I will have a new 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.180
 secondary avatar and will be jeff a 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.280
 character of this series I'll still follow 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.650
 using ant uclÃ©s because I consider it a 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.810
 irreplaceable avatar for this month and the 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.370
 another I have several projects but first 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.129
 I must make sure to pass 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.010
 senior year of high school siiiii al 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:28.900
 end x of now yes that was all I hope 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.530
 that you have had a good time goodbye and 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.530
 take care
