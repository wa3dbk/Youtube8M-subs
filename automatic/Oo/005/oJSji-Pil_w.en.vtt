this base
everybody<00:02:13.740> comes<00:02:14.010> in<00:02:14.250> down<00:02:14.880> here<00:02:14.940> on<00:02:15.210> the<00:02:15.300> Left

Teslas<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.600> giant<00:02:18.900> bomb<00:02:19.290> there<00:02:20.060> because

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
Teslas and a giant bomb there because

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.340 
Teslas and a giant bomb there because
that's<00:02:21.150> typically<00:02:21.600> where<00:02:21.750> they<00:02:22.050> draw<00:02:22.290> the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
that's typically where they draw the

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.050 
that's typically where they draw the
clan<00:02:22.710> troops<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.760> then<00:02:25.070> you<00:02:26.070> know<00:02:26.190> just

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
clan troops to and then you know just

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.430 
clan troops to and then you know just
continue<00:02:27.450> their<00:02:27.570> attack<00:02:27.840> from<00:02:27.990> there<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:28.350> you

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
continue their attack from there so you

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.130 
continue their attack from there so you
see<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.680> guy<00:02:29.330> dropped<00:02:30.330> all<00:02:30.450> his<00:02:30.570> Giants<00:02:31.020> at

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
see this guy dropped all his Giants at

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.340 
see this guy dropped all his Giants at
the<00:02:31.170> top<00:02:31.440> left<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.540> most<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.840> them<00:02:33.930> went<00:02:34.170> into

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
the top left and most of them went into

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.920 
the top left and most of them went into
the<00:02:34.470> top<00:02:34.710> which<00:02:35.100> quite<00:02:35.850> honestly<00:02:35.910> seems<00:02:36.600> like

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
the top which quite honestly seems like

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.100 
the top which quite honestly seems like
a<00:02:36.960> really<00:02:37.290> weak<00:02:37.830> point<00:02:38.160> in<00:02:38.310> this<00:02:38.430> base<00:02:39.110> looking

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
a really weak point in this base looking

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.100 
a really weak point in this base looking
at<00:02:40.260> it<00:02:40.380> now<00:02:41.300> of<00:02:42.300> course<00:02:42.540> he's<00:02:42.720> got<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:42.990> two

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
at it now of course he's got the two

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.420 
at it now of course he's got the two
heroes<00:02:43.410> which<00:02:43.710> certainly<00:02:44.130> helps<00:02:44.720> but<00:02:46.430> you

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
heroes which certainly helps but you

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.830 
heroes which certainly helps but you
know<00:02:47.520> other<00:02:47.670> than<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.910> Giants<00:02:48.330> he<00:02:48.420> just<00:02:48.630> used

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
know other than the Giants he just used

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.660 
know other than the Giants he just used
barbs<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.590> archers<00:02:49.950> and<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.220> can<00:02:50.370> see<00:02:50.520> he

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
barbs and archers and you can see he

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.930 
barbs and archers and you can see he
just<00:02:50.700> got<00:02:51.030> right<00:02:51.510> into<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.990> core<00:02:52.280> from<00:02:53.280> the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
just got right into the core from the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.120 
just got right into the core from the
jump<00:02:54.270> there<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.900> everything<00:02:55.740> is<00:02:56.100> just

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
jump there and everything is just

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.370 
jump there and everything is just
feeding<00:02:56.670> through<00:02:56.970> there<00:02:57.180> he's<00:02:57.900> got<00:02:58.110> a<00:02:58.140> pecka

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
feeding through there he's got a pecka

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.440 
feeding through there he's got a pecka
on<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.800> outside<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.550> kind<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.120> do<00:03:00.270> some

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
on the outside to kind of do some

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.740 
on the outside to kind of do some
cleanup<00:03:00.750> but<00:03:01.740> those<00:03:02.250> giants<00:03:02.790> man<00:03:03.450> they<00:03:03.600> just

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
cleanup but those giants man they just

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.820 
cleanup but those giants man they just
absolutely<00:03:04.380> worked<00:03:04.800> this<00:03:05.160> base<00:03:05.490> over<00:03:06.560> so<00:03:07.560> this

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
absolutely worked this base over so this

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.830 
absolutely worked this base over so this
is<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:08.040> second<00:03:08.370> three-star<00:03:08.850> I've<00:03:09.000> had<00:03:09.240> with

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
is the second three-star I've had with

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.220 
is the second three-star I've had with
this<00:03:09.990> base<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.650> first<00:03:10.860> one<00:03:11.070> was<00:03:11.880> max<00:03:12.540> dragons

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
this base the first one was max dragons

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.120 
this base the first one was max dragons
which<00:03:14.100> was<00:03:14.310> in<00:03:14.520> episode<00:03:15.210> 1<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:16.050> ever<00:03:16.980> since

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
which was in episode 1 and ever since

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.400 
which was in episode 1 and ever since
then<00:03:17.310> it<00:03:17.430> was<00:03:17.550> just<00:03:17.580> two<00:03:17.970> stars<00:03:18.270> and<00:03:18.690> one<00:03:19.170> stars

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
then it was just two stars and one stars

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.020 
then it was just two stars and one stars
actually<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:19.830> was<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.160> only<00:03:20.310> person<00:03:20.610> that<00:03:20.910> got

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.710 
actually I was the only person that got
the<00:03:21.150> restart<00:03:21.540> in<00:03:21.810> this<00:03:22.140> clan<00:03:22.560> war<00:03:23.450> so<00:03:24.450> you<00:03:24.510> see

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
bad so I'm going to try a different base

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.320 
bad so I'm going to try a different base
for<00:03:32.010> this<00:03:32.160> war<00:03:32.480> so<00:03:33.480> it's<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:34.459> don't<00:03:35.459> know<00:03:35.520> it<00:03:35.670> the

driver<00:04:08.250> village<00:04:08.790> so<00:04:09.600> I<00:04:09.630> chose<00:04:10.110> to<00:04:10.560> expose<00:04:11.040> the

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
driver village so I chose to expose the

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.220 
driver village so I chose to expose the
air<00:04:11.670> defenses<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.209> little<00:04:12.480> more<00:04:12.690> and<00:04:12.900> keep

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
air defenses a little more and keep

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.890 
air defenses a little more and keep
those<00:04:13.410> two<00:04:13.650> mortars<00:04:14.010> in<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.190> middle<00:04:14.660> the<00:04:15.660> clan

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
those two mortars in the middle the clan

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.760 
those two mortars in the middle the clan
castle<00:04:15.930> is<00:04:16.850> relatively<00:04:17.930> centralized<00:04:18.930> bouta

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
castle is relatively centralized bouta

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:21.260 
castle is relatively centralized bouta
centralizes<00:04:20.430> I<00:04:20.489> think<00:04:20.669> you<00:04:20.730> can<00:04:20.850> get<00:04:21.000> it<00:04:21.120> and

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
centralizes I think you can get it and

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:24.770 
centralizes I think you can get it and
keep<00:04:22.229> the<00:04:22.380> integrity<00:04:22.650> of<00:04:22.890> this<00:04:23.010> layout<00:04:23.780> but

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
keep the integrity of this layout but

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.350 
keep the integrity of this layout but
you'll<00:04:25.289> see<00:04:25.500> I've<00:04:25.650> moved<00:04:26.130> the<00:04:26.400> stuff<00:04:26.610> down

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 
you'll see I've moved the stuff down

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.899 
you'll see I've moved the stuff down
here<00:04:27.719> at<00:04:27.810> the<00:04:27.900> bottom<00:04:28.050> moved<00:04:28.919> it<00:04:29.039> out<00:04:29.129> just<00:04:29.699> to

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:29.909 
here at the bottom moved it out just to

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:32.029 
here at the bottom moved it out just to
the<00:04:30.030> edge<00:04:30.240> so<00:04:30.780> that<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:31.289> clan<00:04:31.560> troops<00:04:31.800> don't

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
the edge so that the clan troops don't

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.429 
the edge so that the clan troops don't
get<00:04:32.159> drawn<00:04:32.400> out<00:04:32.550> needlessly<00:04:33.000> and<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:34.139> put<00:04:34.409> my

00:04:34.429 --> 00:04:34.439 
get drawn out needlessly and I put my

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:38.330

my war base so you see the giant took a
second<00:05:33.569> there<00:05:33.750> and<00:05:33.930> then<00:05:34.319> he<00:05:34.469> dropped<00:05:34.650> the

this<00:06:36.089> guy<00:06:36.240> or<00:06:36.389> something<00:06:36.569> but<00:06:36.949> getting<00:06:37.949> hit<00:06:38.069> 4

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:38.279 
this guy or something but getting hit 4

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:40.730 
this guy or something but getting hit 4
cups<00:06:38.459> and<00:06:38.759> me<00:06:39.750> in<00:06:39.810> this<00:06:39.899> case<00:06:40.110> it<00:06:40.289> was<00:06:40.380> fine

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
cups and me in this case it was fine

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:41.839 
cups and me in this case it was fine
so<00:06:40.860> maybe<00:06:41.039> he<00:06:41.160> thought<00:06:41.280> he<00:06:41.400> was<00:06:41.520> going<00:06:41.610> to<00:06:41.669> take

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:41.849 
so maybe he thought he was going to take

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:43.730 
so maybe he thought he was going to take
me<00:06:42.000> out<00:06:42.030> completely<00:06:42.240> any<00:06:43.110> rate<00:06:43.319> so<00:06:43.500> you<00:06:43.590> see

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
me out completely any rate so you see

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.100 
me out completely any rate so you see
there<00:06:43.889> 10<00:06:44.130> max<00:06:44.370> Giants<00:06:44.910> and<00:06:45.120> the<00:06:45.840> rest<00:06:46.020> of

spells luckily he had no heroes i'm
pretty<00:06:49.710> sure<00:06:49.949> if<00:06:50.580> he<00:06:51.240> would<00:06:51.330> have<00:06:51.449> had<00:06:51.599> his

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 
pretty sure if he would have had his

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.749 
pretty sure if he would have had his
archer<00:06:52.080> queen<00:06:52.319> then<00:06:52.800> this<00:06:53.370> would<00:06:53.550> have<00:06:53.639> been<00:06:53.669> a

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 
archer queen then this would have been a

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:56.510 
archer queen then this would have been a
two<00:06:53.970> star<00:06:54.180> but<00:06:55.020> i'm<00:06:55.349> going<00:06:55.650> to<00:06:55.800> try<00:06:55.919> it<00:06:56.160> more

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:04.710 
base like I always say so that's it for

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.809
