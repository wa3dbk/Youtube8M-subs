this this monopod

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.939 
this this monopod
unlike<00:00:55.420> a<00:00:55.449> lot<00:00:55.780> of<00:00:55.809> mono<00:00:56.110> pods<00:00:56.470> that<00:00:56.650> are<00:00:56.830> out

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
unlike a lot of mono pods that are out

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.119 
unlike a lot of mono pods that are out
there<00:00:57.420> yeah<00:00:58.420> it's<00:00:58.600> collapsible<00:00:59.229> but<00:01:00.010> it's

there yeah it's collapsible but it's

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.990 
there yeah it's collapsible but it's
also<00:01:00.309> rust<00:01:00.820> resistant<00:01:01.600> so<00:01:02.440> if<00:01:03.280> you<00:01:03.519> plan<00:01:03.760> to

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.880 
also rust resistant so if you plan to
film<00:01:04.330> if<00:01:05.260> you<00:01:06.250> plan<00:01:06.520> to<00:01:06.549> film<00:01:06.940> in<00:01:07.799> salt<00:01:08.799> water

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
perspectives so you something I like to

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.849 
perspectives so you something I like to
do<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.579> monopod<00:02:01.090> is<00:02:01.390> it's<00:02:02.380> kind<00:02:02.590> of<00:02:02.649> hover

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:02.859 
do the monopod is it's kind of hover

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.160 
do the monopod is it's kind of hover
over<00:02:03.189> my<00:02:03.310> head<00:02:03.549> and<00:02:03.850> it<00:02:04.630> makes<00:02:04.840> it<00:02:04.990> look<00:02:05.049> like

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
over my head and it makes it look like

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.770 
over my head and it makes it look like
it's<00:02:05.710> being<00:02:05.950> filmed<00:02:06.219> from<00:02:06.369> a<00:02:06.520> helicopter<00:02:06.780> so
