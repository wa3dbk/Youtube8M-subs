face<00:02:19.810> up<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:20.050> a<00:02:20.200> flat<00:02:20.680> then<00:02:20.950> you<00:02:21.010> go<00:02:21.160> back<00:02:21.190> to

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
face up to a flat then you go back to

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.630 
face up to a flat then you go back to
their<00:02:21.700> first<00:02:21.880> chord<00:02:23.070> the<00:02:24.070> movie<00:02:24.250> basically

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
their first chord the movie basically

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.030 
their first chord the movie basically
flat<00:02:25.060> go<00:02:25.840> back<00:02:26.050> to<00:02:26.140> your<00:02:26.200> second<00:02:26.560> floor<00:02:26.740> so

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
flat go back to your second floor so

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:52.080 
flat go back to your second floor so
you're<00:02:27.220> just<00:02:27.310> rotating<00:02:35.880> basis<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:51.610> would<00:02:51.880> I<00:02:51.940> be

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
you're just rotating basis I would I be

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.259 
you're just rotating basis I would I be
right<00:02:52.120> there<00:02:52.450> I<00:02:53.170> when<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.010> substituted<00:02:54.730> the

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
right there I when I substituted the

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:57.390 
right there I when I substituted the
five<00:02:55.510> for<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:55.930> flat<00:02:56.200> seven<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:57.130> instead<00:02:57.340> of

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
five for the flat seven so instead of

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.640 
five for the flat seven so instead of
going<00:02:57.550> to<00:02:57.730> my<00:02:57.850> five

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.460 

come<00:03:01.189> in<00:03:01.310> there<00:03:01.430> I<00:03:01.459> way<00:03:04.450> okay<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:06.230> did<00:03:06.439> a

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
come in there I way okay and I did a

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.589 
come in there I way okay and I did a
passing<00:03:06.860> chord<00:03:07.069> to<00:03:07.159> get<00:03:07.340> there<00:03:07.549> and<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:08.420> show

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
passing chord to get there and the show

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.740 
passing chord to get there and the show
what<00:03:08.780> a<00:03:08.810> play<00:03:09.019> it<00:03:09.079> would<00:03:09.200> be<00:03:09.290> like<00:03:09.409> this<00:03:10.750> that's
