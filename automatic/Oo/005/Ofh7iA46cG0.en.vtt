okay<00:00:05.190> I'm<00:00:05.310> going<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.490> show<00:00:05.580> you<00:00:05.640> how<00:00:05.730> to<00:00:05.819> do

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
okay I'm going to show you how to do

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.799 
okay I'm going to show you how to do
manual<00:00:06.390> flips<00:00:06.720> and<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:07.919> bt-50<00:00:08.400> -<00:00:08.750> you<00:00:09.750> don't

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
manual flips and the bt-50 - you don't

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.320 
manual flips and the bt-50 - you don't
need<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.019> change<00:00:10.230> modes<00:00:10.880> this<00:00:11.880> is<00:00:12.000> not<00:00:12.090> an<00:00:12.210> auto

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
need to change modes this is not an auto

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.799 
need to change modes this is not an auto
flip

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
flip

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.870 
flip
it's<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.049> manual<00:00:13.290> flip<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:14.460> all<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.730> need<00:00:14.820> to

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
it's the manual flip so all you need to

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.050 
it's the manual flip so all you need to
do<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.900> get<00:00:16.049> some<00:00:16.199> forward<00:00:16.410> momentum<00:00:17.060> then

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
do is get some forward momentum then

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.330 
do is get some forward momentum then
both<00:00:18.240> sticks<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.600> bottom<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.340> throttle

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
both sticks to the bottom and throttle

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:36.680 
both sticks to the bottom and throttle
back<00:00:20.430> up<00:00:33.530> so<00:00:34.530> once<00:00:34.710> again<00:00:35.149> you're<00:00:36.149> going<00:00:36.360> in

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
back up so once again you're going in

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.650 
back up so once again you're going in
one<00:00:37.140> direction<00:00:37.910> hang<00:00:38.910> those<00:00:39.180> sticks<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
one direction hang those sticks to the

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.979 
one direction hang those sticks to the
bottom<00:00:40.460> and<00:00:41.460> it'll<00:00:41.820> do<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> flip<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.750> it's

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
bottom and it'll do a flip it's it's

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.410 
bottom and it'll do a flip it's it's
real<00:00:43.260> easy<00:00:43.290> once<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:43.980> have<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.460> movements

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
real easy once you have the movements

00:00:45.420 --> 00:01:36.470 
real easy once you have the movements
down<00:00:46.100> so<00:00:47.100> full<00:00:47.670> flash<00:00:47.910> forward

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.970 

do<00:01:37.480> the<00:01:37.630> boat<00:01:37.810> a<00:01:38.020> little<00:01:38.170> bit<00:01:38.260> slower<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:38.860> I'm

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
do the boat a little bit slower and I'm

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:57.300 
do the boat a little bit slower and I'm
doing<00:01:39.190> it<00:01:40.560> there<00:01:41.560> you<00:01:41.680> go

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:05.060 

letting<00:01:58.270> go<00:01:58.300> the<00:01:58.570> throttle<00:01:58.900> to<00:01:59.050> quit<00:02:03.810> okay

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
letting go the throttle to quit okay

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.990 
letting go the throttle to quit okay
it's<00:02:06.070> hard<00:02:06.220> to<00:02:06.280> try<00:02:06.399> and<00:02:06.430> do<00:02:06.580> this<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.820> get<00:02:06.910> the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
it's hard to try and do this and get the

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.220 
it's hard to try and do this and get the
transmitting<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.600> same<00:02:09.959> there<00:02:10.959> y'all

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
transmitting the same there y'all

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.140 
transmitting the same there y'all
perfect<00:02:11.850> hopefully<00:02:12.850> you<00:02:12.910> can<00:02:12.970> see<00:02:13.120> a

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
perfect hopefully you can see a

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:23.180 
perfect hopefully you can see a
transmitter

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:43.230 

sorry<00:02:23.880> birds

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:43.240 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.240 

okay<00:02:43.990> so<00:02:44.050> that's<00:02:44.230> how<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.470> do<00:02:44.560> Emmanuel<00:02:47.250> just

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
okay so that's how you do Emmanuel just

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.380 
okay so that's how you do Emmanuel just
to<00:02:48.370> show<00:02:48.520> you<00:02:48.580> again<00:02:48.670> I'm<00:02:49.030> going<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.180> do<00:02:49.300> it

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
to show you again I'm going to do it

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.830 
to show you again I'm going to do it
without<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.660> clutch<00:02:49.900> line<00:02:50.170> so<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.530> can<00:02:50.650> see

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
without the clutch line so you can see

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.870 
without the clutch line so you can see
so<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:53.830> have<00:02:54.040> you<00:02:54.130> you're<00:02:54.580> flying<00:02:54.820> a

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
so you have you you're flying a

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.710 
so you have you you're flying a
transmitter<00:02:55.300> you're<00:02:56.260> going<00:02:56.530> forward<00:02:57.550> and

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
transmitter you're going forward and

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.470 
transmitter you're going forward and
then<00:02:58.720> you<00:02:58.810> just<00:02:59.100> both<00:03:00.100> to<00:03:00.250> zero<00:03:00.490> and<00:03:00.820> then

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
then you just both to zero and then

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.650 
then you just both to zero and then
increase<00:03:01.930> throttle<00:03:03.090> all<00:03:04.090> right<00:03:04.300> hopefully

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
increase throttle all right hopefully

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.620 
increase throttle all right hopefully
you<00:03:04.960> guys<00:03:05.080> can<00:03:05.170> get<00:03:05.440> that
