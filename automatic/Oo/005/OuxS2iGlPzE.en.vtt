kind of electricity if you use too much
so<00:02:25.980> boondocking<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.690> type<00:02:27.900> of<00:02:27.930> thing<00:02:28.350> that

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
so boondocking is the type of thing that

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.000 
so boondocking is the type of thing that
gives<00:02:29.100> you<00:02:29.310> the<00:02:29.490> incentive<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:31.200> use<00:02:31.680> less

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
gives you the incentive to use less

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.520 
gives you the incentive to use less
resources<00:02:32.240> have<00:02:33.240> less<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.840> footprint<00:02:34.320> on

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
resources have less of a footprint on

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.380 
resources have less of a footprint on
the<00:02:34.680> earth<00:02:34.710> and<00:02:35.100> I<00:02:35.550> think<00:02:35.790> that's<00:02:36.000> why<00:02:36.210> a<00:02:36.240> lot

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
the earth and I think that's why a lot

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.410 
the earth and I think that's why a lot
of<00:02:36.690> people<00:02:37.020> in<00:02:37.140> here<00:02:37.380> are<00:02:37.530> here<00:02:38.040> today<00:02:38.220> is<00:02:38.640> to

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
of people in here are here today is to

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.540 
of people in here are here today is to
see<00:02:39.630> how<00:02:39.810> they<00:02:40.020> can<00:02:40.200> have<00:02:40.380> a<00:02:40.410> less<00:02:40.740> of<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:41.040> of<00:02:41.220> an

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
see how they can have a less of a of an

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.630 
see how they can have a less of a of an
imprint<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.150> live<00:02:42.390> more<00:02:42.720> green<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.740> few<00:02:44.370> years
