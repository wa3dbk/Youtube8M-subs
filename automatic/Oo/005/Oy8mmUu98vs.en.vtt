 invaluable opinion and how do you even see

 imagine the expediency of just such 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.600

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:47.170
 research and found that approximately 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.459
 half of all who came here did not 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.040

 he is not 18 you sell the game if he 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.870

 how to become can take off to buy actually 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.670
 if by sight he is not under 80 he came 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.530
 another cutter is the same to 18 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.360
 years, respectively, already just not well 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.549

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:39.060
 age fine pliz 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:40.120
 if we let a person say so 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.830
 age 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.830
 do not define remember that we can and 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.380
 sleep asked ned he what is in any 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.520
 case later 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.500
 eventually come to us and if with 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.240
 parents come it simplifies the process 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.650
 it is clear that he is with his grandmother 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.370
 come grandma won't play 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.420
 assassin's creed ii 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.520
 Well, first of all, let's say this 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.980
 I at least say what you pay 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:09.769
 attention when pear 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:11.989
 18 plus contains actually fights and 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.959
 away vegetate well for example it is in general 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:17.180
 everything contains that's why we give 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.549
 recommendations that the child principessa as 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.650
 pass on the baby and then no advice 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.630
 pick something else here 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.110
 because you are not just so glues 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:30.530
 there are no age limits 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.040
 sanctions I will say this from the store in the direction 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.389
 seller who allows 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.389
 to a minor buyer to commit 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.889
 purchase with marking 18 + not 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.199
 apply you have no clear instructions 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.600
 no and all with parents without being born mom 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:47.150
 with his grandmother no clear instructions but 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.639
 since it worked another network which 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.940
 associated only with discs that's all in addition 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.220
 imagine there even had to 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.470
 so say more rigidly seva such 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.930
 moments there were indicated there were station 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.170
 here is like a diversified company 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.180
 which principle well, no such thing 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.330
 there are no instructions on this 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.330
 about
