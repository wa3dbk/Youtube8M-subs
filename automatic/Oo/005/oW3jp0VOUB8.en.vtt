I also remember that your dad said the

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.540 
I also remember that your dad said the

madam yeah that's true he know that I

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.849 
madam yeah that's true he know that I
know<00:00:27.599> where<00:00:27.869> we<00:00:27.990> both<00:00:28.140> know<00:00:28.320> whether<00:00:28.470> we<00:00:28.619> enjoy

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
know where we both know whether we enjoy

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.310 
know where we both know whether we enjoy
now<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:30.300> also<00:00:30.420> said<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.990> should

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
now and you also said that you should

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.770 
now and you also said that you should
come<00:00:31.470> with<00:00:31.619> full<00:00:31.949> complete<00:00:32.640> theory<00:00:32.969> so<00:00:33.630> what

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
come with full complete theory so what

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.180 
come with full complete theory so what
is<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.960> theory<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.410> you've<00:00:34.649> done<00:00:34.800> for<00:00:34.860> this

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
is the theory that you've done for this

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.260 
is the theory that you've done for this
role<00:00:36.739> he<00:00:37.739> didn't<00:00:37.920> tell<00:00:37.950> me<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.730> think<00:00:39.059> that

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
role he didn't tell me that I think that

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.780 
role he didn't tell me that I think that
it<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.770> in<00:00:40.770> an<00:00:40.920> interview<00:00:41.309> saying<00:00:41.640> that

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
it in a in an interview saying that

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.160 
it in a in an interview saying that
that's<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.090> only<00:00:42.239> advice<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.750> given<00:00:43.050> her

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
that's the only advice have given her

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.979 
that's the only advice have given her
yeah<00:00:43.410> okay<00:00:43.890> then<00:00:44.070> while<00:00:45.000> bringing<00:00:45.420> me<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:45.719> I

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
yeah okay then while bringing me up I

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.650 
yeah okay then while bringing me up I
think<00:00:46.050> they've<00:00:46.700> embedded<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> theory<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.450> me

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
think they've embedded the theory and me

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.529 
think they've embedded the theory and me
so<00:00:49.079> it's<00:00:49.260> always<00:00:49.739> been<00:00:50.070> there<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.489> know<00:00:50.539> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
so it's always been there you know the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.510 
so it's always been there you know the
way<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.170> conduct<00:00:52.680> yourself<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.399> way<00:00:53.489> you

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
way you conduct yourself the way you

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.270 
way you conduct yourself the way you
behave<00:00:53.910> around<00:00:54.120> people<00:00:54.570> um<00:00:54.899> Talent<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:56.129> mean

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
behave around people um Talent I mean

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.680 
behave around people um Talent I mean
they've<00:00:56.460> always<00:00:56.610> encouraged<00:00:57.210> whatever<00:00:57.629> I

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
they've always encouraged whatever I

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.080 
they've always encouraged whatever I
want<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.020> do<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.320> fine<00:00:58.859> like<00:00:59.430> when<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.699> wanted<00:01:00.030> to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
want to do is fine like when I wanted to

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.660 
want to do is fine like when I wanted to
do<00:01:00.239> fashion<00:01:00.989> designing<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.500> fine<00:01:01.739> when<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.010> was

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
do fashion designing is fine when I was

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.160 
do fashion designing is fine when I was
into<00:01:02.940> sports<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.510> was<00:01:03.660> fine<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.250> think<00:01:05.369> I

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
into sports that was fine so I think I

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.469 
into sports that was fine so I think I
was<00:01:07.170> prepared<00:01:07.590> pretty<00:01:08.070> much<00:01:08.310> from<00:01:08.700> their<00:01:09.180> side

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
was prepared pretty much from their side

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.800 
was prepared pretty much from their side
but<00:01:09.930> things<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.920> just<00:01:11.299> happened<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.540> can't

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
but things that just happened I can't

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.590 
but things that just happened I can't
control<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.490> as<00:01:14.790> much<00:01:14.970> theory<00:01:15.210> that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
control that so the as much theory that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.050 
control that so the as much theory that
I<00:01:15.659> should<00:01:15.960> have<00:01:15.990> done<00:01:16.380> maybe<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.799> didn't<00:01:17.189> oh<00:01:17.340> do

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
I should have done maybe I didn't oh do

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.760 
I should have done maybe I didn't oh do
you<00:01:18.150> didn't<00:01:18.450> know<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.900> preparation<00:01:19.590> for

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
you didn't know like preparation for

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.469 
you didn't know like preparation for
that<00:01:19.799> acting<00:01:20.340> in<00:01:20.430> self<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:20.970> how<00:01:21.090> does<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.270> come

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
that acting in self so how does it come

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.260 
that acting in self so how does it come
instinctively<00:01:22.140> oh<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:23.040> don't<00:01:24.000> know<00:01:24.180> I

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
instinctively oh you just I don't know I

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.539 
instinctively oh you just I don't know I
think<00:01:24.360> I'm<00:01:24.659> just<00:01:24.689> good<00:01:25.650> at<00:01:26.900> doing<00:01:27.900> as<00:01:28.080> I'm<00:01:28.229> told

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:28.549 
think I'm just good at doing as I'm told

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:30.890 
think I'm just good at doing as I'm told
the<00:01:29.549> first<00:01:29.759> thing<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.060> told<00:01:30.360> my<00:01:30.420> director<00:01:30.780> was

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
the first thing I told my director was

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.450 
the first thing I told my director was
that<00:01:31.079> tell<00:01:31.350> me<00:01:31.439> exactly<00:01:31.770> what<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:31.950> want<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.340> I

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
that tell me exactly what you want and I

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.270 
that tell me exactly what you want and I
will<00:01:32.490> do<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.600> think<00:01:33.750> he<00:01:34.650> has<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.829> bin

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
will do it so I think he has the bin

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.210 
will do it so I think he has the bin
really<00:01:35.850> expressive<00:01:36.479> with<00:01:36.659> how<00:01:37.140> what<00:01:37.650> he<00:01:37.860> wants

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
really expressive with how what he wants

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.880 
really expressive with how what he wants
his<00:01:38.400> vision<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.909> very<00:01:39.299> clear-cut<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.229> he's

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
his vision is very clear-cut and he's

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.260 
his vision is very clear-cut and he's
told<00:01:41.130> me<00:01:41.310> what<00:01:41.460> he<00:01:41.549> wants<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:41.909> I've<00:01:42.030> done<00:01:42.240> that

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
told me what he wants and I've done that

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.740 
told me what he wants and I've done that
i<00:01:42.659> have<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> photo<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.220> short<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.600> know
