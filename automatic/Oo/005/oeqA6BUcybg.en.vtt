to just do is try out a few new spots so

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.600 
to just do is try out a few new spots so
that<00:00:49.140> when<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.320> do<00:00:49.440> come<00:00:49.590> back<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.430> get<00:00:50.550> that

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
using that awesome time to figure out

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.979 
using that awesome time to figure out
locations<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.550> can<00:01:00.210> use<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.660> time<00:01:00.960> to

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
locations to be I can use this time to

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.340 
locations to be I can use this time to
get<00:01:01.469> those<00:01:01.680> shots<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.629> am<00:01:03.629> actually<00:01:03.840> let<00:01:04.290> me

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
get those shots I am actually let me

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.590 
get those shots I am actually let me
show<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:05.220> I'm<00:01:05.430> actually<00:01:05.640> positioned<00:01:06.240> right

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
show you I'm actually positioned right

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.620 
show you I'm actually positioned right
here<00:01:07.080> because<00:01:07.950> there<00:01:08.220> are<00:01:08.490> some<00:01:08.970> let<00:01:09.360> me<00:01:09.450> show

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
here because there are some let me show

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.020 
here because there are some let me show
you<00:01:09.659> here<00:01:09.960> some<00:01:10.740> branches<00:01:11.250> right<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.820> side

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
you here some branches right to the side

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.530 
you here some branches right to the side
so<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.420> went<00:01:12.750> just<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.729> know<00:01:14.850> I<00:01:14.880> put<00:01:15.450> it

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
so I went just that you know I put it

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.420 
so I went just that you know I put it
forward<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:16.170> two<00:01:16.500> inches<00:01:16.710> because<00:01:17.130> those

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
forward just two inches because those

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.789 
forward just two inches because those
branches<00:01:17.700> were<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.330> picture<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.560> go

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
branches were in the picture so I go

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.649 
branches were in the picture so I go
forward<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.189> little<00:01:20.310> bit<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.759> those<00:01:21.390> branches

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
forward a little bit and those branches

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.929 
forward a little bit and those branches
on<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.020> left<00:01:22.229> are<00:01:22.439> out<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.189> I've<00:01:23.400> got<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
on the left are out and I've got the

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.179 
on the left are out and I've got the
whole<00:01:24.240> scene<00:01:25.170> there<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:28.290> know<00:01:28.380> this<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.920> is

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
whole scene there you know this this is

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.179 
whole scene there you know this this is
the<00:01:29.430> spot<00:01:29.700> if<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.150> were<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.479> do<00:01:31.189> sunrise

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
the spot if I were to do sunrise

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.100 
the spot if I were to do sunrise
pictures<00:01:32.790> or<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.530> sky<00:01:34.920> would<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.430> be

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
pictures or that that sky would just be

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.210 
pictures or that that sky would just be
you<00:01:37.110> know<00:01:37.229> because<00:01:37.439> that's<00:01:37.619> where<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.890> Sun

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
you know because that's where the Sun

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.819 
you know because that's where the Sun
rises<00:01:38.460> coming<00:01:39.240> from<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:40.110> would<00:01:40.290> be<00:01:40.409> lit<00:01:40.680> up

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
rises coming from it would be lit up

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.149 
rises coming from it would be lit up
amazingly<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:42.030> lot<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.170> my<00:01:43.290> other<00:01:43.320> shot<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.009> do

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
amazingly a lot of my other shot to do

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.550 
amazingly a lot of my other shot to do
this<00:01:44.340> location<00:01:45.000> are<00:01:45.240> from<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.229> exact

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
this location are from the exact

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.080 
this location are from the exact
opposite<00:01:47.130> corner<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.640> where<00:01:47.850> we're<00:01:48.060> at

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
opposite corner of where we're at

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.060 
opposite corner of where we're at
because<00:01:49.490> like<00:01:50.490> I've<00:01:50.700> said<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.240> past<00:01:52.070> the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
because like I've said in the past the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.460 
because like I've said in the past the
corners<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.640> these<00:01:53.939> buildings<00:01:54.380> shooting<00:01:55.380> him

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
corners of these buildings shooting him

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.980 
corners of these buildings shooting him
at<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.770> diagonal<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.700> great<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.420> if<00:01:57.869> you're

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
at the diagonal is great and if you're

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.959 
at the diagonal is great and if you're
at<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.320> corner<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.979> tree<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.490> see<00:01:59.700> over

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
at that corner that tree you see over

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.709 
at that corner that tree you see over
there<00:02:00.829> shows<00:02:01.829> up<00:02:02.130> very<00:02:02.549> nicely<00:02:02.939> in<00:02:03.540> the

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
there shows up very nicely in the

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.859 
there shows up very nicely in the
picture<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:05.070> can't<00:02:05.340> be<00:02:05.490> at<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:06.090> right-hand

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
picture you can't be at this right-hand

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.080 
picture you can't be at this right-hand
corner<00:02:07.439> because<00:02:08.190> that's<00:02:08.399> where<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.700> tree<00:02:09.060> is

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
corner because that's where the tree is

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.830 
corner because that's where the tree is
at<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:09.750> there's<00:02:10.140> no<00:02:10.319> way<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.879> get<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.420> temple

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
at so there's no way to get the temple

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.680 
at so there's no way to get the temple
there<00:02:13.050> without<00:02:13.379> gay

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
there without gay

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.950 
there without gay
just<00:02:13.960> some<00:02:14.110> random<00:02:14.380> branches<00:02:15.160> in<00:02:15.340> there<00:02:15.520> or

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
just some random branches in there or

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.810 
just some random branches in there or
