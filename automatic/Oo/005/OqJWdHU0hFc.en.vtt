00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
down and blow the air vertically so it

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.320

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
because if I don't do this I get a lot

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.000 
because if I don't do this I get a lot
of<00:03:52.430> flyaways<00:03:52.970> and<00:03:53.300> I<00:03:53.810> don't<00:03:53.990> like<00:03:54.140> that<00:03:54.320> so<00:03:54.680> I

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
of flyaways and I don't like that so I

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.580

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
keep doing that and I always leave about

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.219 
keep doing that and I always leave about

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:10.350 
one to two inches of hair left on the
bottom<00:05:08.590> because<00:05:09.219> I<00:05:09.310> don't<00:05:09.460> want<00:05:09.580> to<00:05:09.669> put<00:05:09.819> heat

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
bottom because I don't want to put heat

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.999 
bottom because I don't want to put heat
on<00:05:10.479> the<00:05:10.659> ends<00:05:11.050> and<00:05:11.229> I<00:05:11.319> just<00:05:11.530> like<00:05:11.680> the<00:05:11.800> way<00:05:11.889> it

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
on the ends and I just like the way it

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:21.909 
on the ends and I just like the way it
looks<00:05:12.190> better

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.760
