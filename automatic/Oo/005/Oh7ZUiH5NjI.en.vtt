 And now give me half a ver . 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.170

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:58.300

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:02.860
 0 No jusiguyo up when we hear a lot of flies log Levy taste 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.850
 Cheongju I would like to use a little bit of warm water to make two drops 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.170
 I think. 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.160
 The smell gives it made continuously rather than in the middle of the lid, the goddess look 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:14.750

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:19.850
 All gave the sprouts topped with mushrooms then saengpyogo 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:22.940
 If you need to write again, that'll be billed gabardine If you do not sseusyeodo independent 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:28.070
 Just put 4 shiitake mushrooms. 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:31.820
 Then the other thing we pilhago best water purifier for the right 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:36.110
 You can use it to hold the volume 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:40.790
 If you say separation rice, you can keep the amount of water equal. 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.410
 If I catch made letting a little less shape called simyeon not a true rice 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.150
 I think you'd better give it to me. 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:52.130
 I went'm doing now covered with a lid and put jusimyeonseo 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:56.840
 In Induction 10 , press the Autumn button on the gas stove . 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:59.119
 After nureusigo the go button is our boss has the most open during boiling 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.590
 One of the things you can see for sure 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.600
 So I called subong phenomenon doljyo forest nursery when we over-watering 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.040
 The lid is a crunch. 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:15.980
 It means to lower the temperature. 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:22.130
 If the temperature is lower than the temperature, the induction 5 to 7 or 8 minutes 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:28.850
 And again, get off in the Induction three times, and then draw a new three minutes or four minutes 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:34.549
 If you tie it for about 7 minutes later, you will have a very delicious bean sprout rice. 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:36.049
 Right now I'm making a cola bottle,

 This gives did tell the paper towel roll up our movie part 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:54.709
 Given that the top two in the bottom of foresight in preventing us so 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:55.910
 Because the water is not used and the pressure is written, we will cook our delicious rice much more 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:03:01.430
 I'll have a number. 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:03.270
 So while we're ready, I'll make more of our bean sprouts. 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.290

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.260
 And with the sprouts, 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.620

 Nika also puts up shiitake mushrooms. 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:04.830

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.860
 I think you can enjoy it if you enjoy it. 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.860
