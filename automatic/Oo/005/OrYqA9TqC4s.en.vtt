that's the process of actually
configuring<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.510> package<00:00:57.840> now<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:58.590> need<00:00:58.800> to

configuring the package now we need to

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.670 
configuring the package now we need to
go<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.460> set<00:00:59.850> up<00:01:00.030> those<00:01:00.300> dependencies<00:01:00.870> so

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
go and just set up those dependencies so

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.860 
go and just set up those dependencies so
we'll<00:01:01.920> go<00:01:02.129> into<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.789> properties<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.329> our

we'll go into the properties of our

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.609 
we'll go into the properties of our
package<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:05.610> from<00:01:06.000> there<00:01:06.180> we'll<00:01:06.810> go<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.409> find

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.830 
j/s application will have to be deployed
first<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.280> when<00:01:39.119> we<00:01:39.240> do<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.450> deployment

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
first and when we do the deployment

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.179 
first and when we do the deployment
through<00:01:39.960> conflict<00:01:40.229> manager<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.770> will<00:01:41.040> just

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
through conflict manager it will just

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.179 
through conflict manager it will just
take<00:01:41.250> care<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:41.939> whole<00:01:42.119> process<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.810> us

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
take care of that whole process for us

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.319 
take care of that whole process for us
so<00:01:44.189> we'll<00:01:44.340> select<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.700> package<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.149> click

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
so we'll select that package and click

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.590 
so we'll select that package and click
OK<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.840> ok<00:01:46.710> again<00:01:49.460> and<00:01:50.460> finally<00:01:50.970> ok<00:01:51.390> the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
OK and ok again and finally ok the

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.300 
OK and ok again and finally ok the
properties<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:52.350> our<00:01:52.500> package<00:01:53.689> and<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:56.040> next

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
properties for our package and the next

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.649 
properties for our package and the next
thing<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.549> we<00:01:56.670> need<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.880> do<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.210> actually

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
thing that we need to do is actually

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.630 
thing that we need to do is actually
deploy<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.409> package<00:01:58.740> out<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.189> our<00:01:59.340> user<00:01:59.549> base

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
deploy the package out to our user base

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.880 
deploy the package out to our user base
so<00:02:00.270> we're<00:02:00.509> already<00:02:00.750> within<00:02:01.020> config<00:02:01.560> manager

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
so we're already within config manager

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.340 
so we're already within config manager
2012<00:02:02.159> here<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.270> what<00:02:04.110> we<00:02:04.170> call<00:02:04.320> a

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
2012 here have a what we call a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.649 
2012 here have a what we call a
collection<00:02:04.890> which<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.460> a<00:02:05.640> group<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.119> users<00:02:06.329> so

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
collection which is a group of users so

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.960 
collection which is a group of users so
that<00:02:06.689> we<00:02:06.869> could<00:02:06.990> target<00:02:07.350> those<00:02:07.649> users<00:02:08.069> within

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
that we could target those users within

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.360 
that we could target those users within
our<00:02:09.330> deployments<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.590> case<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:11.039> Windows

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
our deployments in the case of a Windows

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.760 
our deployments in the case of a Windows
8<00:02:11.520> app<00:02:11.730> we<00:02:12.270> actually<00:02:12.599> have<00:02:12.810> to

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
8 app we actually have to

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.620 
8 app we actually have to
I'll<00:02:13.800> get<00:02:13.920> those<00:02:14.040> out<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.700> our<00:02:14.910> end<00:02:15.060> users<00:02:15.270> and

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
I'll get those out to our end users and

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.680 
I'll get those out to our end users and
not<00:02:15.930> to<00:02:16.200> devices<00:02:17.100> with<00:02:17.280> our<00:02:17.370> environment

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
not to devices with our environment

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.090 
not to devices with our environment
we're<00:02:18.690> going<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.900> hit<00:02:19.020> deploy<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:22.100> we'll

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
we're going to hit deploy and we'll

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.170 
we're going to hit deploy and we'll
actually<00:02:23.310> going<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.640> select<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:24.000> particular

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
actually going to select that particular

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.970 
actually going to select that particular
group<00:02:25.100> and<00:02:27.470> then<00:02:28.470> we'll<00:02:28.560> just<00:02:28.680> go<00:02:28.740> through

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
group and then we'll just go through

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.100 
group and then we'll just go through
setting<00:02:29.550> up<00:02:29.640> that<00:02:29.820> content<00:02:30.210> so<00:02:30.420> we'll<00:02:30.870> select

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
setting up that content so we'll select

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.710 
setting up that content so we'll select
the<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:32.550> distribution<00:02:33.090> points<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.480> we<00:02:33.540> want

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
the the distribution points that we want

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.640 
the the distribution points that we want
to<00:02:33.780> have<00:02:33.930> will<00:02:34.080> have<00:02:34.230> all<00:02:34.440> of<00:02:34.470> the

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
to have will have all of the

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.100 
to have will have all of the
dependencies<00:02:35.240> automatically<00:02:36.240> distribute<00:02:36.990> as

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
dependencies automatically distribute as

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.750 
dependencies automatically distribute as
well<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:38.040> case<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.280> only<00:02:38.490> have<00:02:38.610> one

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
well in this case I only have one

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.750 
well in this case I only have one
distribution<00:02:39.510> point<00:02:39.870> inside<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.500> my<00:02:40.680> setup<00:02:41.610> so

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
distribution point inside of my setup so

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.160 
distribution point inside of my setup so
I'll<00:02:41.880> just<00:02:41.910> use<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.870> I'm<00:02:43.020> going<00:02:43.140> to

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
I'll just use that and I'm going to

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.380 
I'll just use that and I'm going to
select<00:02:43.410> this<00:02:43.860> application<00:02:44.460> to<00:02:44.550> be<00:02:44.640> required

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
select this application to be required

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.780 
select this application to be required
which<00:02:45.990> means<00:02:46.260> that<00:02:46.470> we<00:02:46.650> will<00:02:46.830> automatically

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
which means that we will automatically

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.360 
which means that we will automatically
install<00:02:48.210> this<00:02:48.750> application<00:02:49.020> for<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.160> user

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
install this application for the user

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.980 
install this application for the user
which<00:02:50.820> is<00:02:50.970> something<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.360> we<00:02:51.480> can<00:02:51.630> do<00:02:51.780> with<00:02:51.960> a

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
which is something that we can do with a

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.990 
which is something that we can do with a
side<00:02:52.230> loaded<00:02:52.560> application<00:02:53.070> make<00:02:53.640> sure<00:02:53.880> it

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
side loaded application make sure it

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.340 
side loaded application make sure it
actually<00:02:54.090> lands<00:02:54.540> on<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.840> end<00:02:54.960> user's<00:02:55.230> device

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
actually lands on the end user's device

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.190 
actually lands on the end user's device
we<00:02:56.310> can<00:02:56.520> then<00:02:56.700> actually<00:02:57.000> say<00:02:57.510> whether<00:02:57.870> we<00:02:58.020> want

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
we can then actually say whether we want

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.900 
we can then actually say whether we want
to<00:02:58.260> schedule<00:02:58.950> that<00:02:59.220> deployment<00:02:59.490> to<00:02:59.670> make<00:02:59.790> it

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
to schedule that deployment to make it

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.760 
to schedule that deployment to make it
