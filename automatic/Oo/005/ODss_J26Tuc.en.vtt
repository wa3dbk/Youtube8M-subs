00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.110 
okay this is a review on a UV sterilizer

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.169 
okay this is a review on a UV sterilizer
that<00:00:04.110> I<00:00:04.170> bought<00:00:04.549> off<00:00:05.549> of<00:00:05.609> ebay<00:00:07.849> can't<00:00:08.849> really

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
that I bought off of ebay can't really

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.850 
that I bought off of ebay can't really
cheap<00:00:09.450> Chinese<00:00:09.840> instructions<00:00:10.380> but<00:00:10.530> honestly

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
cheap Chinese instructions but honestly

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.680 
cheap Chinese instructions but honestly
I<00:00:11.160> checked<00:00:11.550> there<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:11.849> now<00:00:12.000> it's<00:00:12.360> got<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.509> nice

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
I checked there and now it's got a nice

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.120 
I checked there and now it's got a nice
bulb<00:00:13.019> on<00:00:13.259> it<00:00:14.750> so<00:00:15.750> this<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.289> one<00:00:16.770> that's<00:00:16.980> rated

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
bulb on it so this is a one that's rated

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.260 
bulb on it so this is a one that's rated
for<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.990> 75<00:00:18.990> gallon<00:00:19.650> but<00:00:20.250> um<00:00:20.400> honestly<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:21.060> went

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
for a 75 gallon but um honestly I went

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.000 
for a 75 gallon but um honestly I went
bigger<00:00:21.539> because<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.410> don't<00:00:22.680> know<00:00:22.769> if<00:00:22.890> I'll

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
bigger because I don't know if I'll

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.029 
bigger because I don't know if I'll
upgrade<00:00:23.369> or<00:00:23.490> not<00:00:23.519> two<00:00:23.970> tanks<00:00:24.539> later<00:00:24.720> on<00:00:25.039> but

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
upgrade or not two tanks later on but

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.589 
upgrade or not two tanks later on but
this<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.519> showing<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:26.880> what<00:00:27.029> my<00:00:27.150> tank<00:00:27.420> looks

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
this is showing you what my tank looks

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.019 
this is showing you what my tank looks
like<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:27.930> beginning<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.439> all<00:00:28.789> and<00:00:29.789> just

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
like in the beginning of it all and just

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.490 
like in the beginning of it all and just
to<00:00:30.119> let<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.300> know<00:00:30.420> that<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:30.810> working<00:00:30.869> I

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
to let you know that it's working I

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.410 
to let you know that it's working I
don't<00:00:31.890> know<00:00:31.949> if<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.099> can<00:00:32.160> get<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.489> totally

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
don't know if I can get this totally

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.920 
don't know if I can get this totally
that<00:00:33.570> but<00:00:33.780> there's<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.530> little<00:00:34.770> light<00:00:35.930> right

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
that but there's a little light right

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.630 
that but there's a little light right
there<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.620> can<00:00:37.770> only<00:00:37.920> see<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.280> got<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> little

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
there you can only see it I got a little

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.970 
there you can only see it I got a little
green<00:00:38.879> water<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.020> tells<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.680> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
green water but that tells you that the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.930 
green water but that tells you that the
UV<00:00:41.370> light<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.030> on<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:43.579> it's<00:00:44.579> kind<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.789> like<00:00:44.910> a

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
UV light is on and it's kind of like a

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.840 
UV light is on and it's kind of like a
powerhead<00:00:45.329> basically<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.730> spring<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
powerhead basically it's a spring the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.060 
powerhead basically it's a spring the
water<00:00:47.940> out<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> top<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.840> power<00:00:49.020> head<00:00:49.230> and

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
water out the top like a power head and

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.639 
water out the top like a power head and
suck<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.579> down<00:00:50.760> there<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.079> UV<00:00:52.410> balls

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
suck it in down there so in the UV balls

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.119 
suck it in down there so in the UV balls
inside<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.989> we'll<00:00:55.079> see<00:00:55.230> how<00:00:55.320> it<00:00:55.350> works<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.920> is

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
inside so we'll see how it works this is

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.069 
inside so we'll see how it works this is
a<00:00:56.160> day<00:00:56.789> one<00:00:57.090> really<00:00:57.870> green<00:00:58.050> tank<00:00:58.969> so<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.329> want<00:01:00.989> to

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
a day one really green tank so I want to

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.139 
a day one really green tank so I want to
see<00:01:01.350> wait<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.590> see<00:01:01.890> what<00:01:02.280> happens<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.789> mean<00:01:03.000> now

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
see wait and see what happens I mean now

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.179 
see wait and see what happens I mean now
it's<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> little<00:01:04.199> clearer<00:01:04.439> from<00:01:04.619> when<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:04.860> first

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
it's a little clearer from when I first

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.429 
it's a little clearer from when I first
put<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.610> they'll<00:01:05.790> believe<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.090> or<00:01:06.210> not<00:01:06.439> so

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
put it in they'll believe it or not so

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:08.719 
put it in they'll believe it or not so
we'll<00:01:07.530> let<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.710> run<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.130> see<00:01:08.340> what<00:01:08.460> happens

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
we'll let it run and see what happens

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.499 
we'll let it run and see what happens
okay<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.930> t2<00:01:10.320> it's<00:01:11.130> about<00:01:13.939> 28<00:01:14.939> hours

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
okay this is t2 it's about 28 hours

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.109 
okay this is t2 it's about 28 hours
after<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.140> took<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.530> photos<00:01:16.830> video<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.220> you

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
after I took the photos video and you

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.460 
after I took the photos video and you
can<00:01:18.210> see<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.509> it's<00:01:18.659> getting<00:01:18.750> clearer<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
can see that it's getting clearer in the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.149 
can see that it's getting clearer in the
tank<00:01:19.830> now<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.820> not<00:01:21.689> perfect<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.040> can

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
tank now so not perfect but you can

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.420 
tank now so not perfect but you can
start<00:01:23.430> seeing<00:01:23.790> fish<00:01:24.119> which<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> good<00:01:25.259> thing

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
start seeing fish which is a good thing

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.340 
start seeing fish which is a good thing
so<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> UV<00:01:26.670> sterilizers<00:01:27.479> definitely<00:01:27.960> working

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
so the UV sterilizers definitely working

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.710 
so the UV sterilizers definitely working
um<00:01:28.860> I'm<00:01:29.579> going<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.820> just<00:01:29.939> keep<00:01:30.090> taking<00:01:30.270> videos

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
um I'm going to just keep taking videos

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.560 
um I'm going to just keep taking videos
as<00:01:30.930> we<00:01:31.049> go<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.820> see<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.909> clear<00:01:33.150> up<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.479> how

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
as we go and see it clear up and how

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.859 
as we go and see it clear up and how
long<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.840> takes<00:01:34.020> okay<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.750> 47<00:01:36.750> hours

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
long it takes okay this is a 47 hours

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.219 
long it takes okay this is a 47 hours
into<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.740> UV<00:01:37.890> thing<00:01:38.310> much<00:01:39.240> clearer<00:01:39.659> still<00:01:40.170> a

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
into the UV thing much clearer still a

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.319 
into the UV thing much clearer still a
little<00:01:40.500> cloudy<00:01:40.799> but<00:01:41.210> we're<00:01:42.210> definitely

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
little cloudy but we're definitely

you updated forty seven dollars later

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.749 
you updated forty seven dollars later
looking<00:01:47.880> better

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
looking better

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.730 
looking better

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
hours later after first are on the UV

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.480 
hours later after first are on the UV
sterilizer

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
sterilizer

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.920 
sterilizer
and<00:01:56.940> it's<00:01:57.060> pretty<00:01:57.299> much<00:01:57.360> clear<00:01:57.810> null<00:01:58.260> tank<00:01:59.930> I

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
and it's pretty much clear null tank I

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.620 
and it's pretty much clear null tank I
might<00:02:01.470> leave<00:02:01.650> it<00:02:01.799> running<00:02:01.979> for<00:02:02.390> maybe<00:02:03.390> like

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
might leave it running for maybe like

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.060 
might leave it running for maybe like
another<00:02:03.840> day<00:02:04.140> just<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.470> make<00:02:04.590> sure<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.770> get<00:02:04.890> it

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
another day just to make sure I get it

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.910 
another day just to make sure I get it
all<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.640> then<00:02:06.570> honestly<00:02:07.140> I'm<00:02:07.260> going<00:02:07.470> to<00:02:07.560> try

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
all and then honestly I'm going to try

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.330 
all and then honestly I'm going to try
unplugging<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:09.179> sits<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.600> little<00:02:09.630> unsightly

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
unplugging it sits a little unsightly

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.580 
unplugging it sits a little unsightly
but<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.430> definitely<00:02:11.819> doesn't<00:02:12.000> job<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.200> get

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
but it definitely doesn't job so I get

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.870 
but it definitely doesn't job so I get
to<00:02:13.709> see<00:02:13.830> everything<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.310> tank<00:02:14.550> right<00:02:14.730> now

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
to see everything the tank right now

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.720 
to see everything the tank right now
which<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.090> awesome<00:02:16.010> I'm<00:02:17.010> gonna<00:02:17.190> do<00:02:17.430> one<00:02:17.580> more

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
which is awesome I'm gonna do one more

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.050 
which is awesome I'm gonna do one more
video<00:02:17.910> before<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.569> yank<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.500> out<00:02:19.680> trying<00:02:20.310> what<00:02:21.030> I

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
video before I yank it out trying what I

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.510 
video before I yank it out trying what I
think<00:02:21.239> is<00:02:21.330> good<00:02:21.480> enough<00:02:21.720> in<00:02:21.900> order<00:02:22.050> to<00:02:22.340> keep<00:02:23.340> it

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
think is good enough in order to keep it

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.570 
think is good enough in order to keep it
clear<00:02:23.700> by<00:02:23.910> itself<00:02:24.410> but<00:02:25.410> uh<00:02:25.470> some<00:02:26.190> people<00:02:26.459> run

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
clear by itself but uh some people run

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.160 
clear by itself but uh some people run
UV<00:02:26.850> sterilizers<00:02:27.480> all<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.720> time
