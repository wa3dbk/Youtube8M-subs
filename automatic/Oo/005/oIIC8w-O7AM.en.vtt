 goalkeeper puts it in then 2 to 0 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.360

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:50.020
 central hole, but we come out well foul 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.020
 inexistent 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:59.510

 this movie but give me the yellow caiman e 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.840
 reds that were not even clear 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.390
 network opportunity 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.489
 and oh well we are in ten to 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:26.900
 twenty-second if it comes out very well from the byes 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:31.579
 bye bye agility agility try 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.980

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.230
 the protagonist of this episode in the meantime 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.570
 I also play the intercom and al 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:45.709

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.420
 lewandowski I failed to 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.840
 defend the best 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.139
 unfortunately he punctured me 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.889
 there are ten of us so there can be 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:07.040
 the first half ends 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:09.170
 I would say very very nice race domain 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.980
 absolute possession but no use we are 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.139
 in ten 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.269
 you see the central hole we see a little 

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.709
 what can we get out of this 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:19.100
 second half 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:23.120
 beautiful this ball and then serve van 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.960
 persie and van persie van persie to a pole 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.200

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.280
 she was sure hit 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.610
 resounding intervention of the defender 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.150
 you see 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:40.830
 my here my defenders collide 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:43.080
 as usual two equal goals we take 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.569
 where after having played by god also in 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:53.310
 ten and two goals equal cross in between 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:55.979
 goal of curse head oh well 21 al 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.960
 seventy-ninth immeritatissimo I do not 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.550
 I know how some people do, but it 's fine 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.479
 let's play vai de poi 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:05.580
 no but because ok we are ten but 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:08.460
 we can't take these goals 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.819
 and oh well ste balls how does no oh well how 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.159
 passed here you see that smooth but ok by 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:17.490
 I can't honestly see these things 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:21.259
 since he decides to see you lose not 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.520
 I never say these things, however, to watch them 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:25.319
 wrong the first intervention is wrong 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.830
 also the slip and then resold goes 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:33.150
 well everything ok fifa everything ok it 's fine 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:37.289
 yes ok, Jesus Christ exceeds all, here he is 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:40.770
 here and then marks a goal of the Madonna 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:42.509
 oh well i'm shut up that is all that fraia 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:47.819
 not in defense 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:49.020
 jesus christ is wedged and marks the 3rd indeed 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:51.020
 the 4 to 1 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.089
 figured if he can that dominated 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:57.539
 completely even in ten where there is 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:59.520
 go and then serve van persie van persie 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:01.830
 gives it back to him but obviously to him 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.260
 defend the player 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:09.310
 thanks to always jesus christ on the band 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:11.920
 if it goes, here it is, try to enlarge it 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:15.730
 va jesus mammamia jesus do not stop him not 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:20.580

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:24.610
 however it falls within the nova no oh well countries 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.950
