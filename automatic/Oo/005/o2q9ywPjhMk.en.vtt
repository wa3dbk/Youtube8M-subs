you're<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.640> see<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.659> only<00:01:57.899> two<00:01:58.020> tracks

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
you're going to see the only two tracks

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.139 
you're going to see the only two tracks
that<00:01:58.560> are<00:01:58.679> lit<00:01:58.799> up<00:01:58.829> as<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.219> can<00:01:59.369> see<00:01:59.549> are<00:01:59.850> the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
that are lit up as you can see are the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.359 
that are lit up as you can see are the
lead<00:02:00.360> track<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.409> I'm<00:02:01.560> currently<00:02:01.770> on<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.310> the

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
lead track and I'm currently on and the

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.399 
lead track and I'm currently on and the
rhythm<00:02:02.700> track<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:03.899> right<00:02:04.110> next

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
rhythm track to the that it's right next

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.949 
rhythm track to the that it's right next
to<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.640> so<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.729> have<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.970> do<00:02:06.149> this<00:02:06.330> by<00:02:06.509> measures

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
to it so you have to do this by measures

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:09.109 
to it so you have to do this by measures
so<00:02:07.439> whenever<00:02:07.830> you<00:02:08.039> see<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.280> red<00:02:08.459> bar<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:09.030> will

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
so whenever you see the red bar it will

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.729 
so whenever you see the red bar it will
skip<00:02:09.390> directly<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:10.019> one<00:02:11.810> now<00:02:12.810> I'm<00:02:13.590> going

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
skip directly to that one now I'm going

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.420 
skip directly to that one now I'm going
to<00:02:13.829> set<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.250> entire<00:02:14.370> song<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.569> be<00:02:15.750> lead<00:02:16.319> but<00:02:17.099> if

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
to set the entire song to be lead but if

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.449 
to set the entire song to be lead but if
you<00:02:17.579> want<00:02:18.170> maybe<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.319> couple<00:02:19.680> random<00:02:19.950> measures

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
you want maybe a couple random measures

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.089 
you want maybe a couple random measures
to<00:02:20.760> not<00:02:20.910> have<00:02:21.209> lead<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.260> can<00:02:22.440> do<00:02:22.530> that<00:02:22.709> in<00:02:22.890> this

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
to not have lead you can do that in this

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.160 
to not have lead you can do that in this
but<00:02:23.519> it<00:02:23.610> has<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.790> be<00:02:23.940> entire<00:02:24.329> measures<00:02:24.810> that's

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
but it has to be entire measures that's

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:33.530 
but it has to be entire measures that's
the<00:02:25.349> only<00:02:25.530> downside

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.410 

so<00:02:34.470> here's<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.799> end<00:02:34.920> of<00:02:34.980> my<00:02:35.099> song<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.640> you

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
so here's the end of my song and you

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.179 
so here's the end of my song and you
can't<00:02:36.599> tell<00:02:36.840> very<00:02:37.140> well<00:02:37.379> but<00:02:37.590> it's

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:38.189 
can't tell very well but it's

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.530 
can't tell very well but it's
highlighting<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:38.939> as<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.299> go

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
highlighting it as I go

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.530 
highlighting it as I go
and<00:02:40.409> now<00:02:40.590> I've<00:02:41.370> highlighted<00:02:41.579> the<00:02:41.939> entire<00:02:42.209> song

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
and now I've highlighted the entire song

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.500 
and now I've highlighted the entire song
on<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.530> lead<00:02:43.709> track<00:02:44.010> I'm<00:02:44.549> gonna<00:02:44.790> hit<00:02:44.970> green<00:02:45.269> to

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
on the lead track I'm gonna hit green to

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.119 
on the lead track I'm gonna hit green to
set<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.140> when<00:02:46.290> you<00:02:46.409> played<00:02:46.680> in<00:02:46.799> the<00:02:46.890> game

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
set that to when you played in the game

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.699 
set that to when you played in the game
you<00:02:48.090> play<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.569> lead<00:02:48.720> track<00:02:49.019> not<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.439> rhythm

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
you play the lead track not the rhythm

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.220 
you play the lead track not the rhythm
track<00:02:50.690> alright<00:02:53.299> now<00:02:54.299> to<00:02:54.360> get<00:02:54.659> back<00:02:54.690> to<00:02:55.140> the

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
track alright now to get back to the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.020 
track alright now to get back to the
bottom<00:02:55.379> or<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.040> top<00:02:56.190> usually<00:02:56.640> just<00:02:56.970> the

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
bottom or to the top usually just the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.610 
bottom or to the top usually just the
bottom<00:02:57.390> you're<00:02:58.110> going<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.290> do<00:02:58.379> is<00:02:58.500> you're

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
bottom you're going to do is you're

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.240 
bottom you're going to do is you're
going<00:02:58.650> to<00:02:58.769> strum<00:02:59.069> down<00:02:59.340> once<00:03:00.269> right<00:03:01.170> there<00:03:01.409> you

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
going to strum down once right there you

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.339 
going to strum down once right there you
strum<00:03:02.519> down<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.420> then<00:03:03.659> you<00:03:03.720> just<00:03:03.780> hold<00:03:04.049> in<00:03:04.230> the

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
strum down and then you just hold in the

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.319 
strum down and then you just hold in the
whammy<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.799> it<00:03:05.129> skips<00:03:05.400> really<00:03:05.700> fast<00:03:05.909> back<00:03:06.180> to

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
whammy and it skips really fast back to

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.380 
whammy and it skips really fast back to
the<00:03:06.420> beginning<00:03:06.780> you<00:03:07.650> can<00:03:07.799> do<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:08.209> holding<00:03:09.209> up

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
the beginning you can do that holding up

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.199 
the beginning you can do that holding up
but<00:03:09.629> it<00:03:09.720> usually<00:03:09.870> just<00:03:10.400> gets<00:03:11.400> right<00:03:11.639> way<00:03:11.940> past

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
but it usually just gets right way past

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.210 
but it usually just gets right way past
the<00:03:12.420> very<00:03:12.599> end<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.870> your<00:03:13.019> song<00:03:14.840> alright<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.769> if

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
the very end of your song alright and if

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.920 
the very end of your song alright and if
you<00:03:17.340> if<00:03:17.609> you<00:03:17.700> hold<00:03:17.909> the<00:03:18.000> whammy<00:03:18.299> unless<00:03:18.629> it

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
you if you hold the whammy unless it

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.629 
you if you hold the whammy unless it
doesn't<00:03:19.560> really<00:03:19.650> slowly<00:03:19.980> like<00:03:20.159> I'll<00:03:20.430> show<00:03:20.579> you

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
doesn't really slowly like I'll show you

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.640 
doesn't really slowly like I'll show you
like<00:03:21.480> I'm<00:03:21.629> just<00:03:21.780> holding<00:03:22.019> it<00:03:22.079> in<00:03:22.230> just<00:03:22.409> barely

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
like I'm just holding it in just barely

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.699 
like I'm just holding it in just barely
a<00:03:22.829> little<00:03:23.099> bit<00:03:23.480> enough<00:03:24.480> a<00:03:24.599> lot<00:03:27.500> alright<00:03:28.500> but

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
a little bit enough a lot alright but

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.160 
a little bit enough a lot alright but
finally<00:03:29.069> we<00:03:29.220> have<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.459> star<00:03:29.700> power

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
finally we have the star power

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.259 
finally we have the star power
so<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:31.230> hit<00:03:31.790> red<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:33.209> go<00:03:33.329> into<00:03:33.540> star<00:03:33.720> power<00:03:33.930> and

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
so you hit red to go into star power and

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.589 
so you hit red to go into star power and
then<00:03:36.269> you're<00:03:36.750> going<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.790> this<00:03:38.790> again<00:03:39.239> it<00:03:39.449> does

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:39.599 
then you're going to this again it does

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.020 
then you're going to this again it does
it<00:03:39.720> by<00:03:39.840> measures<00:03:40.340> so<00:03:41.340> if<00:03:41.459> I<00:03:41.549> want<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.849> very

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
it by measures so if I want the very

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.550 
it by measures so if I want the very
first<00:03:42.299> measure<00:03:42.540> to<00:03:42.690> be<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:42.810> star<00:03:43.049> power<00:03:43.260> phrase

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
first measure to be a star power phrase

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.530 
first measure to be a star power phrase
I'm<00:03:44.400> going<00:03:44.549> to<00:03:44.639> highlight<00:03:44.940> that<00:03:45.120> first

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
I'm going to highlight that first

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.180 
I'm going to highlight that first
measure<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.169> then<00:03:46.889> I'm<00:03:46.980> gonna<00:03:47.099> hit<00:03:47.280> green<00:03:47.609> and

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
measure and then I'm gonna hit green and

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.369 
measure and then I'm gonna hit green and
as<00:03:50.190> you<00:03:50.849> can<00:03:50.970> see<00:03:51.030> those<00:03:51.660> notes<00:03:51.870> now<00:03:52.139> have

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
as you can see those notes now have

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.990 
as you can see those notes now have
stars<00:03:52.650> on<00:03:52.799> them<00:03:53.010> being<00:03:53.340> their<00:03:53.639> star<00:03:53.849> power

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
stars on them being their star power

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.539 
stars on them being their star power
phrases<00:03:54.769> now<00:03:55.769> you<00:03:55.829> go<00:03:56.010> to<00:03:56.069> the<00:03:56.160> next<00:03:56.310> place

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
phrases now you go to the next place

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.390 
phrases now you go to the next place
that<00:03:56.639> you<00:03:56.879> want<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.209> be<00:03:57.299> star<00:03:57.569> power<00:03:57.810> and<00:03:58.400> then

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:26.069 

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:28.469 

as<00:05:27.069> you<00:05:27.249> can<00:05:27.339> see<00:05:27.519> the<00:05:27.639> very<00:05:27.819> first<00:05:28.089> thing<00:05:28.299> that

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 
as you can see the very first thing that

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:41.090 
as you can see the very first thing that
I<00:05:28.509> said<00:05:28.599> to<00:05:28.809> do<00:05:29.079> start<00:05:29.319> our<00:05:29.469> one<00:05:29.769> start<00:05:30.069> out

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.880 

and<00:05:42.100> so<00:05:43.000> there<00:05:43.210> you<00:05:43.270> go<00:05:43.420> it<00:05:44.320> set<00:05:44.590> it<00:05:44.710> to<00:05:44.800> the

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
and so there you go it set it to the

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:46.680 
and so there you go it set it to the
right<00:05:44.920> spots<00:05:45.370> just<00:05:45.550> like<00:05:45.880> I<00:05:46.000> told<00:05:46.150> it<00:05:46.300> to

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:46.690 
right spots just like I told it to

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:49.290 
right spots just like I told it to
so<00:05:47.530> just<00:05:47.980> remember<00:05:48.130> from<00:05:48.460> the<00:05:48.580> main<00:05:48.790> menu<00:05:49.000> in

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
so just remember from the main menu in

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.570 
so just remember from the main menu in
this<00:05:49.480> you<00:05:49.900> hit<00:05:50.080> orange<00:05:50.740> and<00:05:51.010> then<00:05:51.100> yellow<00:05:51.430> and

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
this you hit orange and then yellow and

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.460 
this you hit orange and then yellow and
then<00:05:51.880> you<00:05:51.970> can<00:05:52.120> set<00:05:52.300> chords<00:05:52.750> you<00:05:52.870> can<00:05:53.020> set<00:05:53.260> the

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
then you can set chords you can set the

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.140 
then you can set chords you can set the
leader<00:05:53.760> rhythm<00:05:54.760> track<00:05:55.030> and<00:05:55.300> you<00:05:55.360> can<00:05:55.510> set<00:05:57.150> the

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
leader rhythm track and you can set the

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.780 
leader rhythm track and you can set the
star<00:05:59.050> power<00:05:59.260> and<00:05:59.530> I<00:05:59.800> think<00:06:00.040> that<00:06:00.220> that<00:06:00.430> the

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:00.790 
star power and I think that that the

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.120 
star power and I think that that the
leader<00:06:01.300> rhythm<00:06:01.690> thing<00:06:01.870> if<00:06:02.170> you<00:06:02.350> go<00:06:02.470> to<00:06:02.530> Bass<00:06:02.770> it

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.100 
also lets you set it to either bass or
