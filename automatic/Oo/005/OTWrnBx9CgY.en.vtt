00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.210
 only family here cat 66 and today 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.760
 it is therefore for a tutorial on 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.870
 pokemon nation to ca so like that 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.170
 do that will teach them pellet but some 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.560
 pokemon in gaza it's a practice that 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.789
 few people know have given that 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.230
 So here we often prevents people 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.210
 who know that I prefer to sell that 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.320
 I would have to share a deer for tricks 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.660
 with you then here is the prefect made me 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.320
 wishing me a clown and so it's going 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.320
 to be a poor oxides of uranium 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.370
 acutely 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.410
 so I had redone the windshield and 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.390
 so was part of one of the machineries 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.480
 than Polish men in order to make 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:51.440
 to be stupid to show you so 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:51.440
 quickly a single block 6 the game 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:06.950
 I have conceded even so pokemon 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:13.210
 version it has to be the version that I 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.210
 will use to clone a man 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.180
 watch is so quickly but we are 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.360
 no more the inverted outdoors on 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.360
 iis 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.870
 it's luxembourg optimization so 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.850
 it is the case also touches in fact for 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:39.740
 me simply explains and bangkok 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.870
 more pokemon than I have during 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.380
 summer is here in my box I only have 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.120
 a reflex and that's what I agree 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.720
 So here we have nothing more than 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.250
 this then so now we will go to 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.540
 the theoretical part then we will see 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.350
 so the practical part 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.810
 andrée then what will happen then 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.290
 this is very simple once again 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.890
 pokemon 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.510
 then we want to say that we 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.580
 wish to actually sacrifice and a little 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.760
 insane then we will be clown and then 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.040
 beforehand, therefore, the 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.590
 pokemon xy game updates and 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.010
 pokémon rossa so like your 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.980
 console 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.450
 if you do not do this cloning does not 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.190
 will not walk and I need you 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.180
 remove the updates think about it me 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.010
 do not say it does not work if you 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.180
 did not know first update the 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.470
 had to remove the updates 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.930
 prevents you from logging in online 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.790
 which makes it quite simply 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.860
 it's an exchange that makes a local so 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.600
 sure both consoles be north side 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.420
 in Russia 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.670
 so that's all that stuff 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.720
 is saying here so you know a little 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.110
 little mentioned we will say that we will launch 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.950
 exchange 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.820
 so I have my pension next door 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.680
 with you so that the 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.959
 worry good and we propose everything 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.340
 change to the other ground obviously 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.760
 accepted it was so thing on the 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:06.440
 second console here and so the 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:08.610
 changes will launch who wants so here 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.830
 the exchange is launched 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.290
 once the currencies are launched 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.580
 so we will propose the pokemon 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.010
 we wish polish as well as the 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.180
 pokemon who serves well to be sacrificed 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.380
 in fact then the car changes so the 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.420
 pokemon choose to sacrifice and show 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.340
 to hero critics so proscribed from 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.620
 pins on this console and on the other 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.500
 console so we propose auc six 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.070
 then that's when it's done it 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.459
 proposes them 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:38.250
 and we start the exchanges so in fact this 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.720
 will happen once the exchange 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.170
 is going to be relaunched so here at the end of 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.720
 the exchange 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.010
 as soon as the black screen is ready 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.020
 count 5 seconds 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.489
 so we can do it that's what 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.200
 promise for example and turn off the 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.270
 console and then the crate you have 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.140
 sent the pokemon that I wished that 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.760
 you were leading here that's where I go 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.440
 paint the person who comes from 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.670
 to receive that potting soil in this winter 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:06.590
 the night of the accident I lose my docs 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:06.590
 6 1 2 3 4 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:11.739
 so here on the console you 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.670
 continue to see here is the exchange 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:21.790
 actually goes on but the pokemon so goes 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:25.270
 happen to you here on this console 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.590
 adventure plan be the day when lens at 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.690
 calm opening sapphire to do it 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.630
 which normally should continue 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.710
 having done so in this TF6 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.240
 console you are going to have a message 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.410
 start softly here is error of 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.120
 Morning listening communication can 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.190
 reinforce to reach the console then 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.440
 rekindled then tried it if you have 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.020
 you're going this message is that in the 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.650
 most cases you have succeeded 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.940
 when we actually do 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.340
 I'm told it was on again for one 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:54.479
 so this is seeing around menus 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:59.860
 rome enough and so inside of 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:06.160
 so here 's the game so we'll have some 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:07.600
 accessories that biased or vre and a 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.289
 other team so instead of encrypting 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:15.220
 at the game to discover others instead 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:17.590
 of shouting trio here we have the flop 6 for 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.360
 the docsis that has just been given so I 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:22.539
 will prove to you to his right and done 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:27.210
 so we save here and support 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:30.940
 Well, I'm going to make good sense because we do not 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:35.500
 do not leave back to minium that's what 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.880
 is and therefore no ambition serve alpha 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.669
 to show that I still have the 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.479
 dioxide also on alpha sapphire so i have 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:42.479
 to create a clone 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.680
 theirs 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.190
 lanson 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.670
 here 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:13.110
 around a try and so we have beautiful 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.580
 and still well the dioxide and so 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.800
 that's when you go to see others 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.690
 age of the West both versions 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:23.100
 it's the technique for koné pokémon 

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:25.440
 version his daughter rafah here are the friends 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.940
 it will be all for this video just 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.040
 after you go see so a little 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:34.260
 picture that will sum up a little bit everything to 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:35.940
 writing it a little more 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:37.770
 that's simple we'll say so we're going 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.910
 summarize the breast to their just called to 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:43.140
 writing a little picture and that's it 

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:46.680
 I hope this trick will be 

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:49.620
 helpful friends on this was at 66.11 there 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:52.670
 find a little new short video and 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.670
 voice does good to all of this
