00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 Hello everybody today, I want to 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.700
 share with you a new life story 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.500
 happened and called literally two days 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.450
 back i came across one very 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.960
 interesting video on youtube where harold 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.580
 paths people raised the barbell to 250 to g then 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.500
 there he took it on his shoulders and proper 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.510
 speaking squatting with her it seemed to me that 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.060
 it was too easy for him 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.039
 do each still 250 some kind of not 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.109
 so much and literally three days later I 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.230
 decided to enroll in our basement 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.420
 rocking chair that is my home has a basement 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.810
 there mostly hang out either you or 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.810
 pitching 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.379
 in the end I bought myself a subscription for one 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.390
 day for 50 rubles and strictly speaking 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.280
 bought so much subscription quick to escape 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.230
 a nearby stall to buy the whole pack 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.090
 cigarettes and buy a coca-cola 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.469
 well as you know during training 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.530
 need to drink lemonade 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.199
 10 minutes later I ran into the room and began 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.320
 change your costume adik i 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.850
 changed clothes and went into the hall in the hall stood 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.699
 I decided to turn on an ancient tape recorder 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.949
 turn on the radio and found a wave of chanson 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.990
 turned on the chanson at full capacity and 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.549
 actually started looking for this mushroom 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.680
 to lift it with a weight of 250 kgm saw 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.390
 I was this griffin on the woods like you 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.640
 know the vulture is on the faces so you 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.830
 could raise it and approached it 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.040
 the vulture looked at him and said that this 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.920
 it will be easy against the background of basque saws everything was 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.439
 it was great motivation all right and I 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.970
 began to hang marines crosswise but with 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.090
 i have a little trouble with this 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.250
 after i hung up 5 pancakes by 25 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.590
 when I was completely exhausted and 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.549
 decided to go outside to smoke break type 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.430
 drink coca cola 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.159
 10 minutes later I rested and came 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.600
 hang the rest of the pancakes hung five more 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.610
 25 kg pancakes 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.140
 and here I was already ready to tanks 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.970
 250 kg 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.460
 I added a little more volume 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.140
 tape recorder for a chance he sang even more 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.030
 motivation was even greater 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.490
 and actually got my iphone 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.350
 put ahead of yourself to write 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.750
 video because i really wanted to 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.880
 record a similar video and upload it to 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.580
 your youtube channel to prove to you 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.920
 that i'm hot and I started singing on the tape recorder 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.599
 my favorite songs are all elbows 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.599
 All dancing elbows 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.489
 video recording on iphone was included and i 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.900
 approached the neck to raise it 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.120
 strictly speaking and repeat the same 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.310
 the very thing that any bodybuilders do 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.170
 threw his head forward neck and began 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.269
 lift him up 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.340
 after two minutes of torment I never 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.769
 able to understand the neck not a millimeter Japan 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.940
 what you need to come up with something your need 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.650
 something original 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.690
 after that I decided to remember the laws 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.730
 physicists and understood what i have i can't 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.769
 understand dreamland place means you need both 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:46.170
 should run up and hit him 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:50.370
 so that I can raise it at speed and 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.180
 I moved to the end of the hall and decided 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.400
 run up 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.959
 I ran so fast that I didnâ€™t notice somewhere 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.970
 fan i ran so fast i didn't notice 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.670
 magento background underfoot since chanson 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.800
 Bella was motivated and strictly speaking 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.250
 would stumble over this tape player and break 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.409
 I hope you guys understand that 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.970
 it was a joke with fitness actually 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.480
 I really have big problems with my left 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.390
 by foot 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.920
 soon will have surgery 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.500
 some time I went for y 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.379
 engaged during the last lesson 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.970
 decided to somehow dramatically increase the weight of the bar 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:26.519
 of course no bar I am anywhere 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.890
 dropped nothing i didn't fall and so on i 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.120
 everything could lift but due to the fact that the muscles 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.340
 too tense 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.799
 I broke some muscle tissue and 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.690
 now when i try to even run 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.549
 or poprisedat I basically 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.099
 nothing happens why because 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.080
 now the muscles are pressing on the veins because of this 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.239
 blood does not flow to the leg so 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.700
 literally in a minute of running, I already 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:50.340
 stop feeling leg and it is very 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.989
 life threatening in the end I was at the doctors 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.780
 on the ultrasound I was told that all 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.970
 sadly you need to cut this canoe 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.730
 from the date and time leg that everything healed 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.620
 And the next six months, I will not run I 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.770
 I will not do any power 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.500
 exercise 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:07.210
 actually I will sit on the ass 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.520
 so I hope what I have brought to you 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.500
 thought need never hurry that is 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.810
 if you want to do fitness if 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.060
 you want to do yourself never 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.610
 hurry no need to chase some 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.320
 big weights up can you lift there 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.180
 small weight so you lift y not 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.310
 need to chase there for some 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.310
 unreal scales as lifts the same 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.010
 to the game on a budget site and so on it 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:32.380
 everything will come with time therefore not going anywhere 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.270
 hurry and most importantly do everything 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.310
 you will be cool and do not repeat my 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.020
 mistakes on it all i hope you 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.030
