00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.709
 for bathroom 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.320
 special is approximately one 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:19.690
 height of 90 centimeters as to the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.510
 sink height 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.510
 it is very practical is approximately common 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.340
 one meter wide with its three drawers a 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.350
 one side its two doors this product is 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.559
 very functional in any kind of 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.710
 housing and remember that the one here 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.260
 I will 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.219
 I 'm going to put I 'm going to open what is 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:47.769
 the door as it remains yes and what is this 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:51.190
 he and the drawers then definitely 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:53.440
 Well, they are a 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.340
 they are an interesting option because they 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.280
 can accommodate different 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.160
 Different products on the sides if 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.510
 we see the drawer in the part in the part 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.510
 lower yes 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.780
 then it's worth this type of d 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.310
 well of functionality that the 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.899
 who can see it and see it in 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.150
 the cajoncitos if they are three capons 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.760
 Similar 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.370
 Well, let's hope we consider this product 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.670
 for any remodeling project 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.700
 in their homes as we can see this 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.390
 product therefore in everything that is the pvc 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.360
 because it has cells inside cells that 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.850
 it makes it very resistant this is a 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.520
 rigid plastic inside we put a 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.590
 reinforcement because it is very important is 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.689
 also from pvc this is what it is 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.149
 what is the hinge so that they see that 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:58.899
 these screws when you do not fit 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:02.530
 they screw as they are is made of a 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:04.899
 way very very resistant and very very this 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.700
 Durable when a reinforcement is used 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.099
 inside obviously these are the 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.150
 shots that stick stuck perfectly 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.709
 with a special glue then I wish 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.830
 that they can consider us in any 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:22.290
 project that you have in the future 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.290
