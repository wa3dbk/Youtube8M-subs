this<00:00:08.519> design<00:00:08.970> so<00:00:09.330> what<00:00:09.599> I<00:00:09.630> did<00:00:09.750> was<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.469> use

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
this design so what I did was to use

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.259 
this design so what I did was to use
very<00:00:11.429> rounded<00:00:12.500> forms<00:00:13.500> which<00:00:13.860> are<00:00:14.210> accented<00:00:15.210> by

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
very rounded forms which are accented by

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
a special iridescent paint we also use

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.410 
a special iridescent paint we also use

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
main theater aboard the freedom I

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.080 
main theater aboard the freedom I
thought<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.410> 1880s<00:00:35.370> would<00:00:35.579> be<00:00:35.790> a<00:00:35.820> good

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
thought that the 1880s would be a good

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.630 
thought that the 1880s would be a good
decade<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.930> derive<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.680> design<00:00:38.040> from<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
decade to derive the design from the

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.819 
decade to derive the design from the
Victorian<00:00:39.000> age<00:00:39.420> so<00:00:39.809> you'll<00:00:40.020> see<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.530> lot<00:00:40.770> of

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
restaurants the posh and the chic I

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.359 
restaurants the posh and the chic I
always<00:01:41.759> thought<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.829> 1990s<00:01:43.829> food

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
always thought that in the 1990s food

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.999 
always thought that in the 1990s food
took<00:01:45.240> on<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.479> new<00:01:45.630> importance<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:46.680> thought

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
took on a new importance so I thought

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.789 
took on a new importance so I thought
that<00:01:47.070> this<00:01:47.509> decade<00:01:48.509> would<00:01:48.810> be<00:01:49.020> good<00:01:49.409> to

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
that this decade would be good to

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.590 
that this decade would be good to
represent<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.490> restaurants<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.329> Lord

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
represent the restaurants on the Lord

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.639 
represent the restaurants on the Lord
