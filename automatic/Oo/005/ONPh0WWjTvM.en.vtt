kind of have maybe the franco-belgian

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.740 
kind of have maybe the franco-belgian
bow

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
bow

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.690 
bow
but<00:02:10.050> it'll<00:02:10.259> be<00:02:10.289> ever<00:02:10.590> so<00:02:10.830> slightly<00:02:11.070> different

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
but it'll be ever so slightly different

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.670 
but it'll be ever so slightly different
to<00:02:12.150> kind<00:02:12.390> of<00:02:12.480> produce<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:13.050> different<00:02:13.260> sort<00:02:13.590> of

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
to kind of produce a different sort of

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.900 
to kind of produce a different sort of
tone<00:02:13.890> so<00:02:14.190> remember<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:16.350> fingers<00:02:17.190> on<00:02:17.700> the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
tone so remember that the fingers on the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.790 
tone so remember that the fingers on the
violin<00:02:18.270> give<00:02:18.600> you<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.930> name<00:02:19.110> of<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.380> notes<00:02:19.590> so

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
violin give you the name of the notes so

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.780 
violin give you the name of the notes so
they'll<00:02:19.950> determine<00:02:20.370> whether<00:02:20.520> you're<00:02:20.670> going

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
they'll determine whether you're going

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.280 
they'll determine whether you're going
to<00:02:20.850> be<00:02:20.940> playing<00:02:21.180> an<00:02:21.300> A<00:02:21.480> or<00:02:21.510> a<00:02:21.720> B<00:02:21.750> or<00:02:22.020> a<00:02:22.050> C<00:02:22.260> or

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.770 
to be playing an A or a B or a C or
whatever<00:02:22.500> but<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.520> bow<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:24.120> actually<00:02:24.570> what's

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
whatever but the bow is actually what's

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.080

what produces the sound for you so

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.270 
what produces the sound for you so
depending<00:02:27.780> on<00:02:27.840> how<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.080> hold<00:02:28.470> this<00:02:28.680> third<00:02:29.040> the

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
alterations but most people tend to sort

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.520 
alterations but most people tend to sort
of<00:03:01.920> have<00:03:02.220> one<00:03:02.250> bow<00:03:02.790> grip<00:03:03.060> and<00:03:03.300> stick<00:03:04.110> with<00:03:04.320> it

of have one bow grip and stick with it

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.130 
of have one bow grip and stick with it
so<00:03:05.070> everyone<00:03:05.700> is<00:03:05.850> is<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.720> was<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.840> slightly

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
so everyone is is is that was a slightly

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.770 
so everyone is is is that was a slightly
different<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:08.700> difference<00:03:09.090> just<00:03:09.330> being<00:03:09.540> that

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
different the difference just being that

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.140 
different the difference just being that
you've<00:03:09.900> got<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:10.680> finger<00:03:11.400> placement<00:03:11.670> and

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
you've got the the finger placement and

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.020 
you've got the the finger placement and
the<00:03:12.390> pronation<00:03:12.989> of<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.799> of<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.549> hand<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:14.940> the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
the pronation of the of the hand and the

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.330 
the pronation of the of the hand and the
wrist<00:03:15.209> so<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:16.019> finger<00:03:16.320> placement<00:03:16.530> is<00:03:16.980> ever<00:03:17.160> so

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
wrist so the finger placement is ever so

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.070 
wrist so the finger placement is ever so
slightly<00:03:17.580> different<00:03:17.730> on<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.209> bow<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.600> in<00:03:18.989> the

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
slightly different on the bow and in the

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.320 
slightly different on the bow and in the
hand<00:03:19.320> and<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:20.340> wrist<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.850> wrist<00:03:21.000> might<00:03:21.209> be

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
hand and the wrist the wrist might be

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.300 
hand and the wrist the wrist might be
higher<00:03:21.570> up<00:03:21.600> or<00:03:22.140> you<00:03:22.320> know<00:03:22.440> wherever<00:03:22.650> wherever

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
higher up or you know wherever wherever

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.100 
higher up or you know wherever wherever
the<00:03:23.519> wrist<00:03:23.730> is<00:03:23.850> going<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.180> be<00:03:24.299> so<00:03:24.540> so<00:03:24.989> they

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
the wrist is going to be so so they

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.310 
the wrist is going to be so so they

and<00:05:02.970> then<00:05:03.120> come<00:05:03.300> back<00:05:03.330> in<00:05:03.690> and<00:05:03.720> show<00:05:04.169> you<00:05:04.229> and

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
and then come back in and show you and

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:06.439 
and then come back in and show you and
then<00:05:04.830> you'll<00:05:04.949> see<00:05:05.160> how<00:05:05.190> my<00:05:05.490> hand<00:05:05.729> is<00:05:05.880> all<00:05:06.300> to

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
then you'll see how my hand is all to

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:08.719 
then you'll see how my hand is all to
that<00:05:06.750> but<00:05:07.350> I'm<00:05:07.500> used<00:05:07.770> to<00:05:07.860> playing<00:05:08.010> the<00:05:08.310> Franco

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
that but I'm used to playing the Franco

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:11.000 
that but I'm used to playing the Franco
so<00:05:09.000> now<00:05:09.630> trying<00:05:09.930> to<00:05:10.080> do<00:05:10.199> the<00:05:10.320> Russian<00:05:10.650> is<00:05:10.770> is

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
so now trying to do the Russian is is

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.650 
so now trying to do the Russian is is
not<00:05:11.280> going<00:05:11.520> to<00:05:11.580> be<00:05:11.699> a<00:05:11.970> hundred<00:05:12.270> percent

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
not going to be a hundred percent

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.629 
not going to be a hundred percent
perfect<00:05:12.780> but<00:05:13.349> you<00:05:13.830> know<00:05:13.949> you<00:05:14.010> can<00:05:14.250> sort<00:05:14.490> of<00:05:14.520> get

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:14.639 
perfect but you know you can sort of get

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:17.600 
perfect but you know you can sort of get
the<00:05:14.760> idea<00:05:14.789> from<00:05:15.300> it<00:05:15.479> so<00:05:16.110> when<00:05:16.349> the<00:05:17.190> three

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
the idea from it so when the three

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.040 
the idea from it so when the three
things<00:05:17.849> that<00:05:17.970> are<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.210> same<00:05:18.419> are<00:05:18.630> that<00:05:18.810> the

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
things that are the same are that the

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.260 
things that are the same are that the
the<00:05:19.620> thumb<00:05:19.860> and<00:05:20.009> the<00:05:20.460> middle<00:05:20.490> finger<00:05:20.759> are

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
the thumb and the middle finger are

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.650 
the thumb and the middle finger are
always<00:05:21.539> opposite<00:05:21.960> each<00:05:22.169> other<00:05:23.660> there's

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:24.660 
always opposite each other there's

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.020 
always opposite each other there's
there's<00:05:25.260> no<00:05:25.440> tension<00:05:25.680> in<00:05:25.919> the<00:05:25.979> hand<00:05:26.250> so<00:05:26.370> no<00:05:26.669> one

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
there's no tension in the hand so no one

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.879 
there's no tension in the hand so no one
finger<00:05:27.539> is<00:05:27.690> working<00:05:28.139> harder<00:05:28.530> than<00:05:28.560> all<00:05:28.770> the

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
finger is working harder than all the

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.700 
finger is working harder than all the
others<00:05:29.250> and<00:05:29.430> all<00:05:29.750> three<00:05:30.750> of<00:05:30.780> them<00:05:31.050> just<00:05:31.349> allow

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
others and all three of them just allow

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.310 
others and all three of them just allow
you<00:05:31.770> to<00:05:32.370> to<00:05:32.880> do<00:05:33.030> any<00:05:33.180> bow<00:05:33.389> technique<00:05:33.930> that<00:05:34.199> the

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
you to to do any bow technique that the

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.320 
you to to do any bow technique that the
player<00:05:34.530> chooses<00:05:35.010> to<00:05:35.280> do<00:05:35.460> so<00:05:35.490> your<00:05:35.940> wrist<00:05:36.180> is

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
player chooses to do so your wrist is

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.000 
player chooses to do so your wrist is
flexible<00:05:36.870> and<00:05:37.050> your<00:05:37.139> fingers<00:05:37.470> can<00:05:37.650> move<00:05:37.830> and

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
flexible and your fingers can move and

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.830 
flexible and your fingers can move and
all<00:05:38.070> that<00:05:38.220> sort<00:05:38.460> of<00:05:38.490> thing<00:05:38.699> so<00:05:38.909> there's

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
all that sort of thing so there's

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.629 
all that sort of thing so there's
there's<00:05:40.139> good<00:05:40.320> and<00:05:40.349> bad<00:05:40.530> point<00:05:40.919> to<00:05:41.220> them<00:05:41.430> but

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:41.639 
there's good and bad point to them but

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.460 
there's good and bad point to them but
the<00:05:41.970> Russian<00:05:42.360> I<00:05:42.449> think<00:05:42.479> is<00:05:42.780> just<00:05:43.020> ever<00:05:43.169> so<00:05:43.349> much

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
the Russian I think is just ever so much

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.689 
the Russian I think is just ever so much
tilted<00:05:44.280> so<00:05:44.490> it's<00:05:44.669> where<00:05:45.409> when<00:05:46.409> with<00:05:47.280> the<00:05:47.370> index

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
tilted so it's where when with the index

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.420 
tilted so it's where when with the index
finger<00:05:47.820> hears<00:05:48.659> that<00:05:48.990> the<00:05:49.260> bow<00:05:49.650> is<00:05:49.680> going<00:05:50.010> into

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
finger hears that the bow is going into

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.060 
finger hears that the bow is going into
the<00:05:50.520> actual<00:05:50.849> first<00:05:51.229> first<00:05:52.229> knuckle<00:05:52.500> where<00:05:52.860> of

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
the actual first first knuckle where of

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.339 
the actual first first knuckle where of
your<00:05:53.310> hands<00:05:53.699> so<00:05:53.849> it<00:05:54.060> causes<00:05:54.300> it<00:05:54.570> to<00:05:54.659> be<00:05:54.810> really

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
your hands so it causes it to be really

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:57.469 
your hands so it causes it to be really
really<00:05:55.560> tilted<00:05:56.220> so<00:05:56.370> again<00:05:56.639> this<00:05:57.090> probably

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
really tilted so again this probably

00:05:57.479 --> 00:05:59.450 
really tilted so again this probably
doesn't<00:05:57.690> look<00:05:57.930> completely<00:05:58.740> how<00:05:58.949> Russian<00:05:59.340> bow

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
doesn't look completely how Russian bow

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.339 
doesn't look completely how Russian bow
grip<00:05:59.639> should<00:05:59.849> be<00:05:59.970> but<00:06:00.240> I'm<00:06:00.449> used<00:06:00.960> to<00:06:00.990> doing<00:06:01.169> a

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:01.349 
grip should be but I'm used to doing a

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:03.260 
grip should be but I'm used to doing a
different<00:06:02.220> one<00:06:02.340> the<00:06:02.430> franco-belgian<00:06:02.909> one

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
different one the franco-belgian one

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.180 
different one the franco-belgian one
well<00:06:03.419> there's<00:06:03.539> nice<00:06:03.780> there's<00:06:04.409> this<00:06:04.650> nice<00:06:04.919> sort

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.190 
well there's nice there's this nice sort

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:10.909 
well there's nice there's this nice sort
of<00:06:05.250> gaps<00:06:05.490> and<00:06:05.820> and<00:06:06.150> things<00:06:06.810> like<00:06:06.960> that<00:06:08.990> so<00:06:09.990> like

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 
of gaps and and things like that so like

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:14.570 
of gaps and and things like that so like
I<00:06:11.099> said<00:06:12.710> there<00:06:13.710> isn't<00:06:14.010> really<00:06:14.159> a<00:06:14.310> right<00:06:14.550> or

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
I said there isn't really a right or

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.670 
I said there isn't really a right or
wrong<00:06:14.760> with<00:06:15.210> with<00:06:15.599> the<00:06:15.720> bow<00:06:15.900> holds<00:06:16.349> I<00:06:16.440> just
