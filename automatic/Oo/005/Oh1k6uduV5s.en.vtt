catching a lot of high-level games and
that's<00:00:41.850> not<00:00:42.059> necessarily<00:00:42.290> what<00:00:43.290> I<00:00:43.320> want<00:00:43.559> to

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
really hoping the gate go for is trying

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.889 
really hoping the gate go for is trying
to<00:00:48.329> find<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.629> niche<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:50.239> kind<00:00:51.239> of<00:00:51.329> fun<00:00:51.570> random

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.039 
jaybird starcraft so we have the peach
dessert<00:01:53.119> looks<00:01:54.119> like<00:01:54.240> he's<00:01:54.390> already<00:01:54.570> expanded

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
dessert looks like he's already expanded

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.950 
dessert looks like he's already expanded
here<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:57.030> protoss<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.689> walled<00:01:57.899> himself

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
here and the protoss is walled himself

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.530 
here and the protoss is walled himself
off<00:01:58.409> with<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.710> two<00:01:58.860> gates<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.880> this<00:02:00.090> usually

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
off with the two gates so this usually

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.950 
off with the two gates so this usually
indicates<00:02:01.200> an<00:02:01.549> aggressive<00:02:02.549> push<00:02:02.729> before<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
indicates an aggressive push before the

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.040 
on the move should be able to hold this
off<00:05:03.000> I<00:05:03.210> believe<00:05:03.600> to<00:05:05.360> be<00:05:06.360> able<00:05:06.480> to<00:05:06.600> force<00:05:06.810> field

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
off I believe to be able to force field

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.640 
off I believe to be able to force field
that<00:05:07.110> pretty<00:05:07.440> quick<00:05:07.680> and<00:05:07.920> there's<00:05:08.790> a<00:05:08.910> void<00:05:09.150> ray

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
that pretty quick and there's a void ray

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.990 
that pretty quick and there's a void ray
my<00:05:10.650> powers<00:05:10.980> of<00:05:11.010> perception<00:05:13.670> work<00:05:14.670> it's<00:05:14.910> just

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
my powers of perception work it's just

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.790 
my powers of perception work it's just
finishing<00:05:15.600> as<00:05:15.720> well

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.080 

little<00:05:21.800> little<00:05:22.160> peekaboo<00:05:22.490> there<00:05:22.820> for<00:05:23.000> the

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
little little peekaboo there for the

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:33.250 
little little peekaboo there for the
Zerg<00:05:31.300> lots<00:05:32.300> of<00:05:32.420> overload<00:05:32.780> is<00:05:32.870> just<00:05:33.050> sitting

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
Zerg lots of overload is just sitting

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:44.230 
Zerg lots of overload is just sitting
around<00:05:33.350> here<00:05:41.290> and<00:05:42.460> we<00:05:43.460> have<00:05:43.490> an<00:05:43.790> evolution

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 
around here and we have an evolution

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.860 
around here and we have an evolution
chamber<00:05:44.360> going<00:05:44.720> down<00:05:44.870> for<00:05:45.740> fallen<00:05:46.780> still<00:05:47.780> no

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870

upgrades<00:05:48.260> still<00:05:48.560> no<00:05:48.650> upgrades<00:05:49.010> I<00:05:49.280> can't<00:05:49.970> say

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
upgrades still no upgrades I can't say

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.480 
upgrades still no upgrades I can't say
what<00:05:51.110> what<00:05:51.470> level<00:05:51.830> of<00:05:52.040> game<00:05:52.460> this<00:05:52.670> is<00:05:53.710> I<00:05:54.710> try<00:05:55.460> to

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
what what level of game this is I try to

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:56.800 
what what level of game this is I try to
look<00:05:55.640> up<00:05:55.790> the<00:05:55.880> players<00:05:56.090> real<00:05:56.330> quick<00:05:56.600> but<00:05:56.780> I

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
look up the players real quick but I

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.550 
look up the players real quick but I
didn't<00:05:57.080> find<00:05:57.200> too<00:05:57.410> much<00:05:57.590> so<00:05:58.550> if<00:05:58.880> you<00:05:59.060> know<00:05:59.560> what

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
didn't find too much so if you know what

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.920 
didn't find too much so if you know what
what<00:06:01.490> league<00:06:02.030> these<00:06:02.240> guys<00:06:02.420> are<00:06:02.600> in<00:06:02.630> feel<00:06:02.870> free

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
what league these guys are in feel free

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:08.410 
what league these guys are in feel free
to<00:06:04.000> let<00:06:05.000> me<00:06:05.150> knows<00:06:05.770> so<00:06:06.770> I<00:06:06.800> don't<00:06:07.120> feel<00:06:08.120> like<00:06:08.300> an

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:08.420 
to let me knows so I don't feel like an

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.600 
to let me knows so I don't feel like an
idiot<00:06:08.540> here<00:06:11.350> I'm<00:06:12.350> assuming<00:06:12.920> these<00:06:13.280> aren't<00:06:13.520> the

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
idiot here I'm assuming these aren't the

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.880 
idiot here I'm assuming these aren't the
highest<00:06:13.910> of<00:06:14.060> players<00:06:14.420> not<00:06:15.320> a<00:06:15.350> lot<00:06:15.560> of<00:06:15.590> probes

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:15.890 
highest of players not a lot of probes

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:18.420 
highest of players not a lot of probes
production<00:06:16.730> going<00:06:16.880> on<00:06:17.060> here<00:06:17.300> a<00:06:17.420> lot<00:06:17.900> of

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
production going on here a lot of

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:27.970 
production going on here a lot of
zerglings<00:06:19.840> hanging<00:06:20.840> around<00:06:21.050> map<00:06:26.800> all<00:06:27.800> right

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:27.980 
zerglings hanging around map all right

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:32.610 
zerglings hanging around map all right
another<00:06:28.160> void<00:06:28.400> rays<00:06:30.250> so<00:06:31.250> we<00:06:31.370> have<00:06:31.460> to<00:06:31.730> out<00:06:31.970> here

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
another void rays so we have to out here

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:39.780 
another void rays so we have to out here
where<00:06:33.620> am<00:06:33.740> I<00:06:33.800> looking<00:06:34.160> here<00:06:34.810> we<00:06:35.810> go

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:39.790 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.550 

so<00:06:40.270> Boyd<00:06:40.480> really<00:06:40.630> charged<00:06:41.080> up<00:06:41.200> giving<00:06:41.500> up

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 
so Boyd really charged up giving up

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:48.720 
so Boyd really charged up giving up
hydralisk<00:06:47.070> so<00:06:48.070> that<00:06:48.190> should<00:06:48.430> be<00:06:48.520> more<00:06:48.670> than

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:48.730 
hydralisk so that should be more than

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:52.050 
hydralisk so that should be more than
enough<00:06:48.850> to<00:06:49.150> hold<00:06:49.270> off<00:06:50.130> anymore<00:06:51.130> void<00:06:51.460> rays<00:06:51.670> for

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
enough to hold off anymore void rays for

00:06:52.060 --> 00:07:01.770 
enough to hold off anymore void rays for
now<00:06:56.520> we<00:06:57.520> have<00:06:57.670> robotics<00:06:58.660> ability<00:06:59.320> going<00:06:59.560> down
