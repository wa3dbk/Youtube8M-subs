I think everyone's really confused about

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.070 
I think everyone's really confused about
what<00:00:25.529> base<00:00:26.519> unit<00:00:27.240> they<00:00:27.390> should<00:00:27.599> get<00:00:27.750> everyone

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
what base unit they should get everyone

Habitrail I'll go home this is a more
basic<00:01:42.270> set<00:01:42.869> but<00:01:43.259> what<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.439> like<00:01:43.770> about<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.490> of

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
basic set but what I like about it is of

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.520 
basic set but what I like about it is of
course<00:01:44.970> it's<00:01:45.149> still<00:01:45.270> expandable<00:01:45.899> with<00:01:46.049> all<00:01:46.320> of

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
course it's still expandable with all of

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.260 
course it's still expandable with all of
the<00:01:46.680> tubes<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.220> all<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> great<00:01:47.820> stuff

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the tubes and all of the great stuff

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.200 
the tubes and all of the great stuff
that<00:01:48.329> Habitrail<00:01:49.320> Avvo<00:01:49.860> offers<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.369> but<00:01:51.060> it's

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
that Habitrail Avvo offers you but it's

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.080 
that Habitrail Avvo offers you but it's
a<00:01:51.329> base<00:01:51.689> unit<00:01:52.140> very<00:01:52.890> simple<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.880> most

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
a base unit very simple it's the most

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.569 
a base unit very simple it's the most
cost<00:01:54.450> effective<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:55.079> think<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.770> outside<00:01:56.340> wheel

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
cost effective I think the outside wheel

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.950 
cost effective I think the outside wheel
is<00:01:56.880> cool<00:01:57.350> if<00:01:58.350> you<00:01:58.740> put<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.159> wheel<00:01:59.969> inside<00:02:00.600> you

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
is cool if you put the wheel inside you

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.469 
is cool if you put the wheel inside you
do<00:02:01.200> lose<00:02:01.500> some<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.070> space<00:02:02.399> like<00:02:02.969> in<00:02:03.000> here

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
do lose some of the space like in here

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.149 
do lose some of the space like in here
so<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.079> kind<00:02:04.320> of<00:02:04.380> nice<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.890> gives<00:02:05.070> a

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
so this is kind of nice and it gives a

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.330 
so this is kind of nice and it gives a
full<00:02:05.399> space<00:02:05.700> has<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.180> sleeper<00:02:07.110> inside<00:02:07.680> that<00:02:08.160> you

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
full space has a sleeper inside that you

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.119 
full space has a sleeper inside that you
can<00:02:08.520> just<00:02:08.700> pull<00:02:08.970> out<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.450> wash<00:02:09.869> also<00:02:10.860> kind<00:02:11.069> of

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
can just pull out and wash also kind of

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.650 
can just pull out and wash also kind of
a<00:02:11.220> neat<00:02:11.430> item<00:02:11.879> that's<00:02:12.150> include

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
a neat item that's include

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.400 
a neat item that's include
so<00:02:13.110> again<00:02:13.560> very<00:02:13.920> basic<00:02:14.190> it<00:02:14.820> comes<00:02:15.270> in<00:02:15.540> pink<00:02:16.080> and

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
so again very basic it comes in pink and

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.800 
so again very basic it comes in pink and
it<00:02:16.890> comes<00:02:17.160> in<00:02:17.370> blue<00:02:17.610> which<00:02:18.240> is<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.420> little<00:02:18.690> bit

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
it comes in blue which is a little bit

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.440 
it comes in blue which is a little bit
different<00:02:19.200> for<00:02:19.470> these<00:02:20.100> models<00:02:20.580> because<00:02:20.970> these

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
different for these models because these

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.260 
different for these models because these
don't<00:02:21.870> offer<00:02:22.170> color<00:02:22.560> options<00:02:23.040> these<00:02:23.460> do<00:02:23.730> so

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
don't offer color options these do so

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.260 
don't offer color options these do so
then<00:02:24.690> also<00:02:25.260> came<00:02:25.500> out<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:26.070> Habitrail<00:02:26.640> Ovid

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
then also came out the Habitrail Ovid

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.270 
then also came out the Habitrail Ovid
water<00:02:27.540> now<00:02:27.870> this<00:02:28.050> one<00:02:28.260> really<00:02:28.470> is<00:02:28.590> different

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
water now this one really is different

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.370 
water now this one really is different
because<00:02:29.490> if<00:02:29.760> you<00:02:29.850> have<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.030> dwarf<00:02:30.420> hamster<00:02:30.630> this

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
because if you have a dwarf hamster this

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.140 
because if you have a dwarf hamster this
is<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.710> one<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:31.890> can<00:02:32.160> recommend<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.880> the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
is the one I can recommend and the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.520 
is the one I can recommend and the
reason<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.510> recommend<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:34.050> is<00:02:34.170> because<00:02:34.440> the

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
reason I recommend it is because the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.990 
reason I recommend it is because the
tubes<00:02:34.800> are<00:02:35.010> built<00:02:35.190> differently<00:02:35.250> they're

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
tubes are built differently they're

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.380 
tubes are built differently they're
actually<00:02:36.480> built<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.500> that<00:02:37.910> dwarf<00:02:38.910> hamsters

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
actually built so that dwarf hamsters

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.260 
actually built so that dwarf hamsters
can<00:02:39.600> get<00:02:39.810> around<00:02:40.110> the<00:02:40.320> unit<00:02:40.680> really<00:02:41.220> well<00:02:41.490> so<00:02:42.030> I

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
can get around the unit really well so I

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:44.030 
can get around the unit really well so I
like<00:02:42.300> this<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:42.990> again<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.560> does<00:02:43.740> have<00:02:43.920> the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
like this and again it does have the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.910 
like this and again it does have the
carrier<00:02:44.460> but<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.690> know<00:02:46.200> if<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.470> want<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.740> take

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
carrier but you know if you want to take

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.650 
carrier but you know if you want to take
that<00:02:47.130> out<00:02:47.340> and<00:02:47.580> you<00:02:47.760> want<00:02:47.970> to<00:02:48.060> substitute<00:02:48.270> it

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
that out and you want to substitute it

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:49.970 
that out and you want to substitute it
with<00:02:48.690> other<00:02:49.020> different<00:02:49.290> types<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.770> things

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980
