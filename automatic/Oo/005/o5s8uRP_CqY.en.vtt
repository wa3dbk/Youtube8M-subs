right now how to do these both slides on

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.630 
right now how to do these both slides on
for<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> arm<00:01:01.050> front<00:01:01.650> side<00:01:01.950> which<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.430> showed

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
for the arm front side which I showed

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.720 
for the arm front side which I showed
you<00:01:02.730> first<00:01:03.559> all<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:04.620> have<00:01:04.770> to<00:01:04.890> do<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.370> make

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
you first all you have to do is make

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.450 
you first all you have to do is make
sure<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.970> your<00:01:06.330> foot<00:01:06.890> make<00:01:07.890> sure<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.310> your

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
sure that your foot make sure that your

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.360 
sure that your foot make sure that your
foot<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:09.110> here<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.440> above<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.890> bulbs<00:01:11.220> like

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.370 
foot is here so above the bulbs like

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.360 
foot is here so above the bulbs like
above<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.900> top<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.290> just<00:01:13.740> over<00:01:13.979> there<00:01:14.100> and

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
above on the top to just over there and

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.550 
above on the top to just over there and
the<00:01:14.940> lines<00:01:15.150> is<00:01:15.450> roughly<00:01:15.780> about<00:01:15.990> here<00:01:16.229> for<00:01:16.260> the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the lines is roughly about here for the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.650 
the lines is roughly about here for the
kick-out<00:01:17.540> yeah<00:01:19.010> but<00:01:20.010> yeah<00:01:20.550> so<00:01:20.910> make<00:01:21.120> sure<00:01:21.150> you

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
kick-out yeah but yeah so make sure you

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.870 
kick-out yeah but yeah so make sure you
really<00:01:21.870> can<00:01:22.080> meet<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.380> lean<00:01:22.560> backwards<00:01:23.100> so

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
really can meet and lean backwards so

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.560 
really can meet and lean backwards so
that<00:01:24.240> goes<00:01:25.050> with<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.590> 180<00:01:26.310> from<00:01:26.820> side<00:01:27.090> direction

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
that goes with a 180 from side direction

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.140 
that goes with a 180 from side direction
but<00:01:28.229> some<00:01:28.410> people<00:01:28.680> prefer<00:01:28.800> to<00:01:29.009> do<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.340> arm<00:01:29.670> toe

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
but some people prefer to do the arm toe

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.719 
but some people prefer to do the arm toe
side<00:01:30.390> because<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.979> don't<00:01:32.100> know<00:01:32.310> less

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
side because it's I don't know less

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.880 
side because it's I don't know less
scarier<00:01:33.180> but<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.720> reckon<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.350> front<00:01:34.619> side<00:01:34.770> is

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
scarier but I reckon the front side is

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.340 
scarier but I reckon the front side is
easier<00:01:35.160> for<00:01:35.850> me<00:01:35.970> all<00:01:36.390> right<00:01:36.450> now<00:01:36.690> for<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.080> toes

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
easier for me all right now for the toes

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.190 
easier for me all right now for the toes
like<00:01:37.640> it's<00:01:38.640> pretty<00:01:38.850> much<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.210> opposite<00:01:39.690> like

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
like it's pretty much the opposite like

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
like it's pretty much the opposite like
your<00:01:40.979> feet<00:01:41.190> has<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.550> be<00:01:41.670> at<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.850> top<00:01:43.040> your<00:01:44.040> back

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
your feet has to be at the top your back

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.190 
your feet has to be at the top your back
foot<00:01:44.490> has<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.670> be<00:01:44.880> roughly<00:01:45.210> here<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.570> do<00:01:46.170> a

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
foot has to be roughly here to do a

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.010 
foot has to be roughly here to do a
little<00:01:46.530> drifting<00:01:47.040> motion<00:01:47.369> but<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.000> reckon<00:01:48.840> with

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
little drifting motion but I reckon with

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.609 
little drifting motion but I reckon with
this<00:01:49.290> one<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:49.800> all<00:01:50.009> about<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.850> wages

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
this one it's all about the wages

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.780 
this one it's all about the wages
