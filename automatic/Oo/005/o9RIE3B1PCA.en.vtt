00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.440
 because today it took a year 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.449
 we took three points on Astrid TV Park 

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:10.589
 I believe that 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:11.500
 it was 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.500
 it was more important today is 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.619
 now we have two days to properly prepare the cup which is very 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.730
 important for us for the club for everyone 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.659
 for apple all things 

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:24.689
 great things to do 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.300
 well we knew that with the departure of low boussoufa was going to be a little more 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.779
 difficult for themselves 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.169
 but what are you 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.500
 it's a cry of records 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.670
 the marker can replace it 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.120
 but I think I think she's still remotely soul in the 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.660
 group f will have a little bit more time per cent 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.660
 find a replacement to work 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.760
 the most important thing now is to savor the three points after a 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.290
 times tomorrow's match against 10% the coach is there 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.290
 a year and a whole group the policemen he evokes the most rely on all 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.640
 players who are there 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.070
 we have a name 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.980
 however the head 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.150
 we play without pressure we try to qualify Wednesday after 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.150
 we try to have fun in the field we missed a lot of young people 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.610
 tonight the actor's parents 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.590
 Port-vendres 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.070
 no but I have% 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.630
 it's not always easy 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.060
 the center team were well grouped behind they really 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.700
 took advantage of two defensive mistakes 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.700
 I think yes 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.700
 on the individual flotation bottom c 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.850
 tonight 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.960
 on its release in May 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.850
 what is missing for you for your watches found this offensive solution 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.860
 maybe a little bit of 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.990
 palm game inspiration 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.470
 as the garden of his abode is not either they were they hurt and 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.250
 sixteen not easy to hold in a match like that 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.420
 it's a position you like to play drifting costs 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.560
 but whatever forms 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.630
 the controlled person 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.470
 6 but manage 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.999
 I do not even want that 

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:55.900
 storm however for its part that the defense tonight even 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.100
 our attackers have almost no balloons 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.590
 so 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.300
 there is almost no opportunity 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.300
 you know it's difficult market we do not have many opportunities in common 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.299
 and you smashed hurt like those who played his first game 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.119
 this passport his fault to him 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:16.329
 the good and people like to play his first game against the standard in the 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.609
 country increases the pressure 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:21.979
 for the time however everything is not his fault at the feet in andorre two 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:24.259
 points late on lille on the lines this 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:25.429
 tonight 

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:28.449
 so everything is still possible you have to work do business 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.419
 at least at home I have no problem when when he leaves the field 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:34.559
 activities like maximum time 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:35.939
 in the crowd just do 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.749
 last night 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:39.879
 does not happen 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.279
 it's not necessary not to wait until I play turin 

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:46.369
 a teammate or a particular person when you watch the match 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.309
 last week against gand we reacted in group 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:51.009
 and we won for 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:52.859
 that sense can not say this help 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.859
 which players will have this group who sinned 

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.619
 hence this lack of creativity is the absence of boussoufa or this other 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:02.089
 something that intervenes 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:05.949
 we can not say that whoever knows if you suffer 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.589
 didier all the magicians of the language school 

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:12.489
 we have won matches if you are not there and not small games of 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:13.399
 hockey 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:15.539
 so I think you think 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:17.509
 it's a question of 

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:21.079
 two more mentality and then that's what's easier at 1 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.169
 to work so I hope it was worth the next match
