00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:22.449
 I was because you are my opposite I 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:24.880
 will be the sand and you go out and the sea 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.039
 it's a witty thing it's not 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.589
 necessarily material things 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.810
 even if we like a very concrete fashion 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:34.270
 very daily she is there at the service 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.449
 of a witty woman who was 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.640
 completed who is confident who is not 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:43.120
 a fashionist who is who love style 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:46.780
 but who is not a slave of tendencies 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.550
 this is the ideal woman and we 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.320
 had felt his sides wrapped up 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.570
 a woman protected like that sometimes a 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.629
 little bit no more sweet but 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.769
 also the daily fight 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.930
 then some pieces are pieces 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.729
 some men are gold coins 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.920
 reworked to women of whom there is everything 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:09.009
 a game of proportions you have to follow his 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.680
 instinct and and then always found this 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.630
 little twist that makes it charming 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.759
 it's mysterious it's a bit strange 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:23.979
 also sometimes that of strangeness know 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:28.899
 that speak and his lands I am the wind 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:35.790
 and you would be the earth could walk 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:35.790
 in life change color 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:43.209
 they get lost the trash top scorer the 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:43.209
 breath traffic and a lot of rubbish 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.849
 so I wanted to see a pretty jay side 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.129
 mattrick so really ligniÃ¨res which is 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.269
 pretty cold enough strict and the 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:57.099
 contrasts and had something that 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.290
 is very spontaneous with the flowers 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:01.000
 hand-painted flowers of 2000 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.260
 dimensional that becomes 6.3 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.599
 dimensional and also look for 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.459
 elegance on the other hand so that's so 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.049
 really a mix all the elements 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.209
 but they are beautiful women for me 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.950
 to surprise is important like that I 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.180
 stay as enthusiastic and prom is 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:15.160
 also something new a lot 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.239
 money you are a lot of really the 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.129
 brilliant much brighter than 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.540
 normal at home but I wanted 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.760
 really really see one side 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.709
 different as masculine feminine it is 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.660
 eternal all - classic saint jeannais 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:35.500
 and I can not do a sense collection 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:36.660
 changed 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.650
 your memories 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.189
 Oh 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.189
 hold here 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.310
 but is not it his son 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.020
 going 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:03.790
 2 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:08.770
 to do everything upside down I 'll be the 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:13.660
 fire and you would know lapierre take the 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:25.770
 latest finds me in the corridors 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:25.770
 and knows them many infinite spaces
