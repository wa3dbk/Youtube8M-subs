00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
truly ready for this I think it's about

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.399

time<00:01:47.880> we<00:01:47.939> told<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.479> commander<00:01:48.720> what's<00:01:49.049> really

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
time we told the commander what's really

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.039

going<00:01:49.680> on<00:01:49.829> this<00:01:50.520> mission<00:01:50.759> is<00:01:51.060> far<00:01:51.420> more<00:01:51.720> than<00:01:51.960> a

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
going on this mission is far more than a

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.410 
going on this mission is far more than a
simple<00:01:52.229> shakedown<00:01:52.860> run<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.369> figured<00:01:54.180> there<00:01:54.299> was

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
simple shakedown run I figured there was

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.420

something<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.750> weren't<00:01:54.960> telling<00:01:55.079> us<00:01:55.430> we're

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
something you weren't telling us we're
