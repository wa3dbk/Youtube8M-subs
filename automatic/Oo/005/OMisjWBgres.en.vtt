of<00:02:47.079> fealty<00:02:47.349> card<00:02:47.799> now<00:02:48.489> that<00:02:48.760> guy<00:02:48.939> you<00:02:49.450> play

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:50.139 
of fealty card now that guy you play

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:51.569 
of fealty card now that guy you play
that<00:02:50.349> and<00:02:50.650> then<00:02:50.739> you<00:02:50.980> know<00:02:51.069> every<00:02:51.340> turn<00:02:51.549> you

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
that and then you know every turn you

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.099 
that and then you know every turn you
gain<00:02:51.909> control<00:02:52.269> one<00:02:52.450> of<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.629> permanence<00:02:53.049> and

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
gain control one of the permanence and

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:54.330 
gain control one of the permanence and
then<00:02:53.260> have<00:02:53.409> to<00:02:53.530> give<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.739> back<00:02:53.769> at<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.129> end<00:02:54.159> of

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
then have to give it back at the end of

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.159 
then have to give it back at the end of
the<00:02:54.430> turn<00:02:54.609> but<00:02:55.359> I<00:02:55.389> was<00:02:55.540> thinking<00:02:55.569> if<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:55.930> use

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:56.169 
the turn but I was thinking if you use

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:57.899 
the turn but I was thinking if you use
that<00:02:56.200> and<00:02:56.739> one<00:02:56.919> of<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.099> other<00:02:57.129> cards<00:02:57.549> index

00:02:57.899 --> 00:02:57.909 
that and one of the other cards index

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:59.759 
that and one of the other cards index
such<00:02:58.060> as<00:02:58.209> like<00:02:58.359> the<00:02:58.450> wand<00:02:58.659> of<00:02:58.810> elements<00:02:59.319> you

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
such as like the wand of elements you

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:00.929 
such as like the wand of elements you
can<00:02:59.799> gain<00:03:00.159> control<00:03:00.519> of<00:03:00.549> one<00:03:00.669> of<00:03:00.849> their

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:00.939 
can gain control of one of their

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:02.550 
can gain control of one of their
mountains<00:03:01.359> or<00:03:01.540> their<00:03:01.689> Island<00:03:02.169> and<00:03:02.319> then

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
mountains or their Island and then

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.679
