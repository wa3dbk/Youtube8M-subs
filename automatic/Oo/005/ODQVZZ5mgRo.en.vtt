we<00:02:09.509> can<00:02:09.720> see<00:02:09.899> clearly<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.319> deltas<00:02:10.739> shaped<00:02:11.330> wing

we can see clearly a deltas shaped wing

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
and a tail don't forget this is still

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.050 
and a tail don't forget this is still

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
the space shuttle but if we read what

the space shuttle but if we read what
the<00:02:21.240> Langley<00:02:21.570> Research<00:02:21.750> Center<00:02:22.050> told<00:02:22.740> us

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
the Langley Research Center told us

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.480 
the Langley Research Center told us
about<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.610> HL<00:02:24.120> 20<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:25.110> their<00:02:25.770> idea<00:02:26.160> that<00:02:26.370> a

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
about the HL 20 and their idea that a

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.190 
about the HL 20 and their idea that a

low-earth orbit or small amounts of
payload<00:02:35.040> all<00:02:35.670> very<00:02:36.150> interesting<00:02:36.510> but<00:02:36.810> the

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
payload all very interesting but the

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.590 
payload all very interesting but the
thing<00:02:37.740> that<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.980> claim<00:02:38.220> back<00:02:38.430> in<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.760> 1980s

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
thing that the claim back in the 1980s

thing that the claim back in the 1980s
other<00:02:40.470> with<00:02:40.740> its<00:02:40.890> wings<00:02:41.160> folded<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:42.210> will<00:02:42.450> fit

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
other with its wings folded it will fit

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.480 
other with its wings folded it will fit
