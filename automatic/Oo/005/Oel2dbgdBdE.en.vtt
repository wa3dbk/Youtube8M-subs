they'll<00:04:15.400> pick<00:04:15.610> up<00:04:15.730> tones<00:04:16.030> of<00:04:16.330> your<00:04:17.049> color<00:04:17.640> and

the<00:04:19.000> color<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.299> extensions<00:04:19.870> so<00:04:19.989> you<00:04:20.049> can't

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
the color the extensions so you can't

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.490 
the color the extensions so you can't
really<00:04:20.590> tell<00:04:20.890> where<00:04:21.549> my<00:04:21.610> hair<00:04:22.090> starts<00:04:22.750> or<00:04:23.050> ends

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
really tell where my hair starts or ends

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.400 
really tell where my hair starts or ends
and<00:04:23.920> where<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.070> extensions<00:04:24.670> start<00:04:25.140> now<00:04:26.140> you

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
and where the extensions start now you

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.840 
and where the extensions start now you
don't<00:04:26.680> have<00:04:26.830> to<00:04:26.950> wear<00:04:27.100> all<00:04:27.130> of<00:04:27.310> them<00:04:27.580> I've<00:04:27.820> got

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
don't have to wear all of them I've got

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.660 
don't have to wear all of them I've got
a<00:04:28.030> lot<00:04:28.390> of<00:04:28.420> hair<00:04:28.750> so<00:04:28.990> I<00:04:29.080> chose<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.710> and<00:04:29.980> this<00:04:30.550> is

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:30.670 
a lot of hair so I chose to and this is

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.590 
a lot of hair so I chose to and this is
how<00:04:30.820> they<00:04:30.940> look<00:04:31.210> I<00:04:32.910> gave<00:04:33.910> them<00:04:34.060> a<00:04:34.150> very<00:04:34.330> very

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
how they look I gave them a very very

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.020 
how they look I gave them a very very
very<00:04:34.930> quick<00:04:35.350> little<00:04:35.620> way<00:04:35.740> with<00:04:35.950> my<00:04:36.100> GHD<00:04:36.850> but

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
very quick little way with my GHD but

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.310 
very quick little way with my GHD but
you<00:04:37.150> can<00:04:37.390> do<00:04:37.510> so<00:04:37.780> many<00:04:37.840> different<00:04:38.020> things

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
you can do so many different things

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.830 
you can do so many different things
because<00:04:38.710> they<00:04:38.950> are<00:04:39.160> in<00:04:39.370> hair<00:04:39.640> now<00:04:40.060> this<00:04:40.600> isn't

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
because they are in hair now this isn't

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.600 
because they are in hair now this isn't
the<00:04:40.930> only<00:04:41.020> color<00:04:41.680> so<00:04:41.950> this<00:04:42.070> is<00:04:42.220> color<00:04:44.610> 2/6

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
the only color so this is color 2/6

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.460 
the only color so this is color 2/6
which<00:04:45.820> is<00:04:46.090> like<00:04:46.270> the<00:04:46.390> darkest<00:04:46.930> of<00:04:47.080> the<00:04:47.170> Belen

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470
