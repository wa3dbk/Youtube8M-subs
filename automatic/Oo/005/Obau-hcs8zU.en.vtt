hi<00:00:01.020> there<00:00:01.350> today<00:00:02.220> I<00:00:03.210> have<00:00:03.510> an<00:00:04.110> announcement

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
hi there today I have an announcement

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.179 
hi there today I have an announcement
and<00:00:05.130> it's<00:00:06.000> very<00:00:06.299> difficult<00:00:07.020> for<00:00:07.470> me<00:00:07.710> to<00:00:08.010> make

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
and it's very difficult for me to make

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.669 
and it's very difficult for me to make
this<00:00:08.370> video<00:00:08.580> but<00:00:09.030> I<00:00:09.059> think<00:00:09.389> it's<00:00:09.570> very<00:00:09.809> very

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
this video but I think it's very very

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.060 
this video but I think it's very very
necessary<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.630> that's<00:00:12.630> I'm<00:00:13.380> going<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:13.920> be

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
necessary and that's I'm going to be

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.840 
necessary and that's I'm going to be
taking<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.759> break<00:00:15.289> not<00:00:16.289> exactly<00:00:16.770> sure<00:00:17.039> for<00:00:17.730> how

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
taking a break not exactly sure for how

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.080 
taking a break not exactly sure for how
long<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.650> I'm<00:00:19.650> not<00:00:19.710> true<00:00:20.250> whether<00:00:20.520> i<00:00:20.640> will<00:00:20.939> be

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
long and I'm not true whether i will be

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.109 
long and I'm not true whether i will be
posting<00:00:21.300> videos<00:00:22.039> but<00:00:23.039> i<00:00:23.100> definitely<00:00:23.369> won't<00:00:23.910> be

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
posting videos but i definitely won't be

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.390 
posting videos but i definitely won't be

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
happiness but I've been over stretching

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.009 
happiness but I've been over stretching
myself<00:00:59.539> for<00:01:01.520> over<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> year<00:01:02.670> now<00:01:03.030> definitely

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
myself for over a year now definitely

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.219 
myself for over a year now definitely
and<00:01:05.750> it's<00:01:06.750> not<00:01:07.530> good<00:01:07.770> for<00:01:07.799> myself<00:01:08.520> and

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
and it's not good for myself and

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.880 
and it's not good for myself and
therefore<00:01:10.229> not<00:01:10.470> good<00:01:10.880> for<00:01:11.880> my<00:01:12.330> family<00:01:12.930> and<00:01:13.229> I

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
therefore not good for my family and I

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.520 
therefore not good for my family and I
kind<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.610> remember<00:01:15.210> my<00:01:15.689> priorities

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
kind of have to remember my priorities

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.609 
kind of have to remember my priorities
and<00:01:16.950> ensured<00:01:17.600> that<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.659> am<00:01:18.869> okay<00:01:19.650> too<00:01:19.710> and

probably most of you are a lot of where

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.880 
probably most of you are a lot of where
of<00:01:25.740> how<00:01:26.490> many<00:01:26.759> hours<00:01:27.030> go<00:01:27.810> into<00:01:28.320> each<00:01:28.350> video

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
of how many hours go into each video

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.880 
of how many hours go into each video
even<00:01:29.520> if<00:01:29.640> it's<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.259> a<00:01:31.259> couple<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.710> minutes

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
even if it's just a couple of minutes

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.429 
even if it's just a couple of minutes
long<00:01:32.310> it's<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:33.000> many<00:01:33.329> many<00:01:33.600> hours<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:34.259> go

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
long it's like many many hours that go

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.359 
long it's like many many hours that go

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
energy and they give me so much and I

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.880 
energy and they give me so much and I
enjoy<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.909> much<00:01:57.020> but<00:01:58.020> at<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.380> same<00:01:58.619> time

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
enjoy it so much but at the same time

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.179 
enjoy it so much but at the same time
it's<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.790> lot<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.060> work<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.750> requires<00:02:01.500> a<00:02:01.920> lot<00:02:02.159> of

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
it's a lot of work and requires a lot of

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.459 
it's a lot of work and requires a lot of
energy<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.810> and<00:02:04.610> I<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:06.060> kind<00:02:06.479> of<00:02:06.540> need<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.930> step

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
energy to and I I kind of need to step

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.190 
energy to and I I kind of need to step
back<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:08.099> bit<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.640> which<00:02:09.209> I<00:02:09.450> find<00:02:09.810> extremely

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
back a bit and which I find extremely

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.990 
back a bit and which I find extremely
difficult<00:02:10.739> because<00:02:11.250> I

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
difficult because I

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.690 
difficult because I
