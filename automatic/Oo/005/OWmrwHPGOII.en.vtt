00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
it's been 10 minutes since I've been

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.420 
it's been 10 minutes since I've been
caramelizing<00:03:06.110> these<00:03:06.410> onions<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.100> you<00:03:07.310> can

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
caramelizing these onions and you can

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.620 
caramelizing these onions and you can
see<00:03:07.580> they're<00:03:07.730> starting<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.090> turn<00:03:08.330> golden

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
see they're starting to turn golden

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.890 
see they're starting to turn golden
brown<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.500> they're<00:03:10.430> starting<00:03:10.640> to<00:03:10.790> cook<00:03:11.660> down

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
brown and they're starting to cook down

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.080 
brown and they're starting to cook down
so<00:03:11.959> there's<00:03:12.350> not<00:03:12.470> as<00:03:12.950> many<00:03:13.160> as<00:03:13.310> there<00:03:13.550> were<00:03:13.760> or

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
so there's not as many as there were or

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.190 
so there's not as many as there were or
at<00:03:14.180> least<00:03:14.330> doesn't<00:03:14.570> look<00:03:14.690> that<00:03:14.720> way

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
at least doesn't look that way

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.440 
at least doesn't look that way
from<00:03:15.530> when<00:03:15.650> we<00:03:15.739> started<00:03:15.850> now<00:03:16.850> the<00:03:16.880> reason<00:03:17.300> why

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
from when we started now the reason why

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.600 
from when we started now the reason why
I<00:03:17.480> like<00:03:17.690> to<00:03:17.810> do<00:03:17.930> this<00:03:18.080> is<00:03:18.320> because<00:03:18.620> this

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
I like to do this is because this

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.090 
I like to do this is because this
process<00:03:20.180> brings<00:03:20.510> out<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.900> sugars<00:03:21.290> in<00:03:21.620> the

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
process brings out the sugars in the

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.280 
process brings out the sugars in the
onion<00:03:22.550> and<00:03:22.850> it<00:03:23.000> just<00:03:23.209> adds<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:24.019> tremendous

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
onion and it just adds a tremendous

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.860 
onion and it just adds a tremendous
flavor<00:03:24.980> to<00:03:25.580> just<00:03:25.790> about<00:03:25.970> any<00:03:26.209> dish<00:03:26.510> that<00:03:26.540> you

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
flavor to just about any dish that you

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.140 
flavor to just about any dish that you
put<00:03:27.080> them<00:03:27.230> in<00:03:27.430> so<00:03:28.430> now<00:03:28.610> I'm<00:03:28.760> going<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:28.940> go<00:03:29.030> ahead

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
put them in so now I'm going to go ahead

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.150 
put them in so now I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:29.450> go<00:03:29.570> another<00:03:29.840> 10<00:03:30.170> minutes<00:03:30.500> my<00:03:30.769> temperature

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
and go another 10 minutes my temperature

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.340 
and go another 10 minutes my temperature
is<00:03:31.370> on<00:03:31.400> low<00:03:31.820> and<00:03:32.780> I'm<00:03:32.900> just<00:03:32.989> gonna<00:03:33.080> keep

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
is on low and I'm just gonna keep

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.140 
is on low and I'm just gonna keep
spreading<00:03:33.680> them<00:03:33.950> out<00:03:34.070> and<00:03:34.430> stirring<00:03:35.000> them

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
spreading them out and stirring them

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.870 
spreading them out and stirring them
just<00:03:35.570> like<00:03:35.810> you<00:03:35.870> see<00:03:36.170> here<00:03:36.410> and<00:03:36.620> then<00:03:37.519> after

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
just like you see here and then after

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.670 
just like you see here and then after
after<00:03:38.330> the<00:03:38.480> next<00:03:38.690> 10<00:03:38.870> minutes<00:03:39.049> we'll<00:03:39.530> be

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
after the next 10 minutes we'll be

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.620 
after the next 10 minutes we'll be
adding<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:40.340> garlic<00:03:40.519> all<00:03:41.269> right<00:03:41.390> we'll<00:03:41.510> be

this so the best way to handle it is to

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:50.360 
this so the best way to handle it is to
fold<00:05:42.820> it<00:05:43.000> in

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370
