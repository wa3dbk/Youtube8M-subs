00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
slightly we cannot leave the marine

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.760

epoxy<00:04:41.040> uncoated<00:04:41.820> it<00:04:42.240> eventually<00:04:42.870> cracked<00:04:43.530> on

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
epoxy uncoated it eventually cracked on

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.230 
epoxy uncoated it eventually cracked on
the<00:04:43.890> Sun<00:04:44.130> so<00:04:44.970> you<00:04:45.060> need<00:04:45.270> something<00:04:45.510> to<00:04:47.060> UV<00:04:48.060> it

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.780 
the Sun so you need something to UV it
so<00:04:48.720> it<00:04:49.130> doesn't<00:04:50.130> crack<00:04:52.580> unfortunately<00:04:53.580> this

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
so it doesn't crack unfortunately this

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:02.060
