00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.880
 let's see 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.350
 musician of video media of jeta 5 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.430
 online in this case I bring you a 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.080
 poquillo more information of the 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.150
 robberies to banks the critics are something 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.950
 quite interesting and we are going to talk about 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.330
 the new contacts that you will see in the 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.420
 telecommuting they worked with the part of 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.730
 all the things of cars clothes and everything 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.440
 this topic apart from physical things 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.480
 they are also going to put other physical things 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.710
 because contracts 20 are not going to 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.360
 do two physical things are people 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.500
 basically but good the case we're going to 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.210
 talk about the two contacts that we are going to 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.039
 have on the mobile which are going to 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.840
 order missions as I say this is not 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:36.430
 for nothing confirmed simply be 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.429
 there since I let filtrate all this topic 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.199
 and as I say it is not confirmed but 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:43.210
 it's supposed to be that way because 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.920
 missing for the robberies and it seems 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.909
 that I'm quite credible the case of 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.890
 thriller come down as always under the 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:50.260
 description and the truth that is a subject 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.489
 tiny enough not obviously not 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.079
 in high definition since you already know that 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.370
 the images of the contacts have 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.600
 to take from the mobile and the mobile 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.729
 see a pretty small picture of 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.929
 Contact contact but good the case 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:00.940
 we start with the image on the left 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:03.460
 which we see there is an uncle with hair 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.110
 short you have the face a bit of face 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.760
 Raccoon not tell me that's not who 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.500
 help to action and slight resemblance a 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.510
 Raccoon but good the case as there is no 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.280
 name as you are seeing 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.230
 and well, maybe this can be done 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.580
 contacts that we are going to have in the Teresa 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.230
 traca bandos but as I said well no 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.670
 there is name after mobile more to the 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:25.480
 right and so with the hair a little more 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:27.900
 crazy this seems like it's as if 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.900
 I would have gotten 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.430
 A bit of fear 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.050
 although the next one which we see a 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.570
 uncle what good is that it seems a little 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.520
 silly as vice as if a little strange 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.310
 He has long hair, so you have to see 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.930
 like a little in jacket or and two other 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.890
 contact is really going as I say I do not know 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.380
 they know the names you do not know the 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.580
 missions that will be commissioned later 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.180
 we have another guy who looks like this 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.950
 is going to be the most formal so to speak 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.420
 I see him face of it and then face of 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.729
 formally and maybe it was the one that 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.590
 dominate load the robbery of the torneig van 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.560
 yes is good mail is one of 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.080
 those two were the most important thing I suppose 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.479
 it seems that there is a tree there 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.940
 from the bottom and nothing seems like a 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.560
 mirror is also that this guy seems 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.300
 that pretty formal although the next 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.910
 which we see good this one that has the 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.050
 typical mafioso face of the movies 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:23.200
 the 16th 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:25.060
 and all that, so he also paints 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.590
 missions those at the beginning will be those 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.150
 the mission of a little more for the threshing 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.290
 and the latter seem to have a face 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.850
 a little more interesting he knew that 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.410
 they will be the ones who commission us the mission is 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.360
 a little more two and who am I but 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.800
 well I think that these are enough and ordered 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.810
 arranged and in the next image 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.130
 we have an uncle with glasses and also 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.600
 It seems quite interesting and as I say 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.910
 Well, it seems a lot more formal, I think 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.650
 the beginning and finally we have this 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.300
 another guy who has his face angry and 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.370
 This I think is going to be the most 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.780
 not stop talking because as I say 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.220
 a pretty peculiar image how am I 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.140
 seeing in the head has a tattoo there 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.010
 that covers half a head and two and I 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.570
 I think this guy is going to be the most 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.770
 important and the one that is not the best 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.820
 we are going to have to do something special 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.320
 with which we do not have to do with the 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.210
 others and as I say, I think that 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.860
 this is going to be the contact the contact 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.230
 exclusive and special so to speak 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.940
 because I do not know if he himself is exclusive 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.470
 because logical when observed but 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.930
 special because as well as I'm going to head 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.100
 it still has a pretty image 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.360
 shocking the truth there is an attic 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.770
 basically this are the two 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.090
 contact that they will see them back how many 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.010
 it is supposed as I say it is simply a 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.600
 rumor like that a good idea without favorites 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.810
 we take the song love time and the 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.810
 we see
