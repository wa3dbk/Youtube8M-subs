00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.030
 ah 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:09.800
 hello I hope you are very well from a 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.360
 application we bring a new open pack 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.340
 for those who have asked me how 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.550
 I have gone in the pac open and especially 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.890
 in this with this I call it wrong I do not 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.500
 has touched absolutely nothing since 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.120
 the 22 and well before either very good 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.160
 Now there are special envelopes 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:30.020
 let's open we're going to open all 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:33.530
 these 5 of 35 thousand and two of 50 thousand to see 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.379
 if you touch and something go down we'll see that 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.899
 the hours I do not think I repeat I have very 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:45.850
 very bad luck with the envelopes 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:49.329
 absolutely nothing and what is salvageable but 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.329
 like this 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:56.289
 Luke 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:01.210
 Reverend sucks this scam 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:03.810
 it arises maybe before good can that 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.180
 jeans garment 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.100
 in something the truth is that I do not know if they have 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.620
 conquered as soon as it is depressed 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.260
 but well they did not touch the first envelope in 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:17.540
 nothing 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:22.870
 to see there are not 4 of 35 thousand 250 thousand left 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:25.120
 the second let's see if it touches us 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:29.240
 when I do not even paint but live 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:32.580
 lost there is a player there depends with 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.580

 of shoes good my our areas where 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:48.770
 State absolutely no text 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:51.940
 something good literally nothing with what 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:56.060
 may have lost how to amortize it 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.700
 about him not even there can I rescue 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:02.870
 even half of what of what is 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.150
 spent on them sometimes third about 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.700
 come again give him 82 on average 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:12.689
 that no magician who zabaleta 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.239

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:18.910

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:23.130
 282 62 82 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.130
 now it's my turn less than 32 for sure 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.790
 leaving 35 thousand let's see 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.790

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.049
 and click 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.049
 perhaps 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.540
 contracts fitness is absolutely 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.610
 innate 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.390
 Question 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.390
 but there 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:10.540
 let's go with the last envelope of 35,000 you 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.450
 we remove those of 50 good the one of gift 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.060
 that they were made of 35,000 that for me 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:19.510
 is all about all these 35,000 my 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:24.390
 hands bill is so you do not touch 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.390
 absolutely nothing for me nor lasts 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:35.050
 nothing nothing at all for god 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.390
 today we are going to open now 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:40.890
 about if he made this gift and the last ones 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.890
 two of 50 and why 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.730
 I do not see I do not see that I 'm going to touch something 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.349
 lost and people 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.349
 has not seen also with 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.180
 trash 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.950
 let's see we're going for the last two months 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.460
 of 50,000 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.090
 and well what I'm going to what is going to 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:18.120
 spend those coins for nothing to see 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:20.540
 first of 50 years but can not 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.540
 touch another 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:26.860
 well something is not wrong because it is 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:30.100
 salable but go to go did not recover 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.100
 absolutely nothing 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.720
 and having other 87 players from 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.550
 medium comes to touch me I think it's 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.050
 cheaper good after shot so that 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.290
 we too 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:46.160
 and forgetting 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:46.160
 and the last 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:55.030
 of 50,000 to see what it is that crap we 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.030
 it brings but only nothing 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.180
 to see poor come 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.259
 14 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:06.870
 and I repeat with this about the truth that 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:09.660
 I'm not lucky I do not like to see envelopes 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.030
 therefore a waste of coins 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:14.100
 for me I prefer to buy the one I want 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.350
 buy me the player I want to have 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.960
 metal hopes in the envelope but 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.900
 As you can see, he did not touch anything at all 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:23.370
 in 935 or 50's but good is what 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.169
 there is 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.699
