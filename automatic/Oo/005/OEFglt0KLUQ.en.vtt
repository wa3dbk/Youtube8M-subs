okay<00:00:02.860> so<00:00:02.920> I've<00:00:03.159> got<00:00:03.190> the<00:00:03.340> new<00:00:03.550> valves<00:00:03.969> in<00:00:04.149> and

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:04.960 
okay so I've got the new valves in and

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.749 
okay so I've got the new valves in and
they're<00:00:05.319> seaton<00:00:05.620> nicely<00:00:06.009> you<00:00:06.460> see<00:00:06.609> that

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:06.759 
they're seaton nicely you see that

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:08.129 
they're seaton nicely you see that
there's<00:00:07.000> a<00:00:07.060> little<00:00:07.299> bit<00:00:07.480> of<00:00:07.509> a<00:00:07.629> lip<00:00:07.839> they're

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:08.139 
there's a little bit of a lip they're

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:10.830 
there's a little bit of a lip they're
the<00:00:08.320> same<00:00:08.500> as<00:00:08.680> those<00:00:08.889> for<00:00:09.040> the<00:00:09.430> exhaust<00:00:09.760> as<00:00:10.630> I

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:10.840 
the same as those for the exhaust as I

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.950 
the same as those for the exhaust as I
showed<00:00:11.050> before<00:00:11.080> the<00:00:11.559> old<00:00:12.340> valves<00:00:12.960> basically

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:13.960 
showed before the old valves basically

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.160 
showed before the old valves basically
what<00:00:14.170> happened<00:00:14.679> is<00:00:15.270> they<00:00:16.270> get<00:00:16.450> worn<00:00:16.779> of<00:00:17.050> the

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
what happened is they get worn of the

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.290 
what happened is they get worn of the
seat<00:00:17.410> you<00:00:18.009> see<00:00:18.189> how<00:00:18.310> the<00:00:18.369> seats<00:00:18.669> all<00:00:18.880> worn<00:00:19.149> out

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
seat you see how the seats all worn out

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.560 
seat you see how the seats all worn out
on<00:00:19.509> that<00:00:19.750> which<00:00:20.619> is<00:00:20.829> where<00:00:21.399> it<00:00:21.640> is<00:00:22.060> shiny<00:00:22.450> and

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 
on that which is where it is shiny and

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.769 
on that which is where it is shiny and
silver<00:00:23.040> that<00:00:24.040> valves<00:00:24.579> a<00:00:24.669> soft<00:00:24.910> titanium<00:00:25.509> valve

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
silver that valves a soft titanium valve

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:28.979 
silver that valves a soft titanium valve
and<00:00:26.619> in<00:00:26.890> a<00:00:26.919> nutshell<00:00:27.220> it<00:00:28.090> sits<00:00:28.450> in<00:00:28.630> there<00:00:28.779> too

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:28.989 
and in a nutshell it sits in there too

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:31.229 
and in a nutshell it sits in there too
far<00:00:29.320> you<00:00:29.770> see<00:00:29.800> how<00:00:30.099> high<00:00:30.340> up<00:00:30.550> the<00:00:30.790> one<00:00:30.939> on<00:00:31.119> the

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:31.239 
far you see how high up the one on the

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:33.090 
far you see how high up the one on the
right<00:00:31.419> is<00:00:31.660> and<00:00:31.960> see<00:00:32.079> how<00:00:32.259> low<00:00:32.469> down<00:00:32.710> in<00:00:32.920> there

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
right is and see how low down in there

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.920 
right is and see how low down in there
the<00:00:33.219> other<00:00:33.370> one<00:00:33.580> is<00:00:33.760> does<00:00:34.270> that<00:00:34.480> makes<00:00:34.720> your

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
the other one is does that makes your

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.080 
the other one is does that makes your
valve<00:00:35.140> gap<00:00:35.500> tighter<00:00:35.950> and<00:00:36.250> tighter<00:00:36.430> until<00:00:36.820> you

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
valve gap tighter and tighter until you

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.350 
valve gap tighter and tighter until you
don't<00:00:37.180> have<00:00:37.300> any<00:00:37.600> compression<00:00:38.200> because<00:00:39.360> it'll

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 
don't have any compression because it'll

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.570 
don't have any compression because it'll
be<00:00:40.480> open<00:00:40.690> slightly<00:00:41.140> that<00:00:41.980> makes<00:00:42.160> it<00:00:42.310> really

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
be open slightly that makes it really

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.830 
be open slightly that makes it really
hard<00:00:42.790> to<00:00:42.910> start<00:00:43.180> that's<00:00:43.360> why<00:00:43.510> you<00:00:43.570> have<00:00:43.690> to

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
hard to start that's why you have to

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.720 
hard to start that's why you have to
adjust<00:00:43.900> the<00:00:44.200> valves<00:00:44.470> on<00:00:44.590> when<00:00:45.370> you<00:00:45.490> do<00:00:45.610> the

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
adjust the valves on when you do the

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.250 
adjust the valves on when you do the
cable<00:00:45.940> white<00:00:46.210> valves<00:00:46.600> you<00:00:46.660> can<00:00:46.840> buy<00:00:47.020> them<00:00:47.170> on

diamond is what they call it they're
coated<00:00:58.900> with<00:00:59.230> stuff<00:00:59.500> to<00:00:59.829> help<00:01:00.610> prevent<00:01:01.300> where

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
coated with stuff to help prevent where

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.900 
coated with stuff to help prevent where
the<00:01:02.170> stainless<00:01:02.620> steel<00:01:02.829> wears<00:01:03.100> really<00:01:03.430> slowly

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
the stainless steel wears really slowly

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.480 
the stainless steel wears really slowly
it's<00:01:04.659> a<00:01:04.839> lot<00:01:05.110> harder<00:01:05.409> than<00:01:05.590> titanium<00:01:06.310> titanium

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
it's a lot harder than titanium titanium

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.320 
it's a lot harder than titanium titanium
is<00:01:06.970> strong<00:01:07.390> it's<00:01:08.140> incredibly<00:01:08.770> light<00:01:09.130> but<00:01:09.490> it's

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
is strong it's incredibly light but it's

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.260 
is strong it's incredibly light but it's
also<00:01:10.600> very<00:01:11.020> soft<00:01:11.440> as<00:01:12.340> you<00:01:12.580> can<00:01:12.760> see<00:01:12.970> here

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
also very soft as you can see here

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.420 
also very soft as you can see here
stainless<00:01:14.110> steel<00:01:14.350> is<00:01:14.470> really<00:01:14.620> hard<00:01:14.950> it<00:01:15.100> lasts

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
stainless steel is really hard it lasts

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.219 
stainless steel is really hard it lasts
a<00:01:15.460> lot<00:01:15.610> longer<00:01:15.670> so<00:01:16.659> if<00:01:16.780> you're<00:01:16.960> sick<00:01:17.200> of

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 
a lot longer so if you're sick of

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:18.930 
a lot longer so if you're sick of
getting<00:01:17.860> your<00:01:17.950> valves<00:01:18.280> adjusted<00:01:18.790> all<00:01:18.909> the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
getting your valves adjusted all the

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.050 
getting your valves adjusted all the
time<00:01:19.350> go<00:01:20.350> with<00:01:20.530> some<00:01:20.710> stainless<00:01:21.310> steel<00:01:21.520> valves

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
time go with some stainless steel valves

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.780 
time go with some stainless steel valves
you<00:01:22.659> might<00:01:22.900> sacrifice<00:01:23.229> just<00:01:23.890> a<00:01:24.040> teeny<00:01:24.310> bit<00:01:24.430> in

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
you might sacrifice just a teeny bit in

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.530 
you might sacrifice just a teeny bit in
performance<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:27.940> long<00:01:28.120> haul<00:01:28.390> you'll

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
performance but in the long haul you'll

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.630 
performance but in the long haul you'll
have<00:01:28.690> a<00:01:28.720> lot<00:01:28.960> less<00:01:29.170> labor<00:01:29.409> it'll<00:01:30.159> make<00:01:30.310> a<00:01:30.340> high

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
have a lot less labor it'll make a high

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.250 
have a lot less labor it'll make a high
maintenance<00:01:30.880> bike<00:01:31.360> like<00:01:31.630> this<00:01:31.900> a<00:01:31.930> low

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
maintenance bike like this a low

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.680 
maintenance bike like this a low
maintenance<00:01:32.500> bike<00:01:32.950> over<00:01:33.909> time<00:01:34.360> a<00:01:34.390> lot<00:01:34.570> of

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
maintenance bike over time a lot of

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.420 
maintenance bike over time a lot of
people<00:01:34.960> have<00:01:35.170> hard<00:01:35.380> starting<00:01:35.860> the<00:01:36.010> bike<00:01:36.159> won't

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
people have hard starting the bike won't

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.399 
people have hard starting the bike won't
start<00:01:36.790> because<00:01:37.450> they<00:01:38.020> won't<00:01:38.140> have

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409 
start because they won't have

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.609 
start because they won't have
compression<00:01:38.890> that's<00:01:39.220> because<00:01:39.670> over<00:01:40.060> time<00:01:40.619> the

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
compression that's because over time the

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.130 
compression that's because over time the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
valves the trumpet part of the valve it

reality<00:01:49.330> it's<00:01:50.170> not<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.500> best<00:01:50.710> valve<00:01:51.010> I've

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
reality it's not the best valve I've

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.789 
reality it's not the best valve I've
ever<00:01:51.400> drawn<00:01:51.790> let's<00:01:52.540> try<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:52.930> again<00:01:55.619> dude<00:01:56.619> to

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
ever drawn let's try that again dude to

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.580 
ever drawn let's try that again dude to
do<00:01:56.979> maybe<00:01:57.580> if<00:01:57.790> I<00:01:57.939> sing<00:01:58.360> or<00:01:58.540> do<00:01:58.659> elevator<00:01:59.140> music

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
do maybe if I sing or do elevator music

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.340 
do maybe if I sing or do elevator music
I'll<00:01:59.710> draw<00:01:59.920> better<00:02:00.189> who<00:02:00.700> knows<00:02:00.909> so<00:02:01.840> basically

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
I'll draw better who knows so basically

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:04.800 
I'll draw better who knows so basically
your<00:02:02.590> valve<00:02:02.860> sits<00:02:03.280> in<00:02:03.430> a<00:02:03.520> valve<00:02:03.759> seat<00:02:04.150> and<00:02:04.509> it

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
your valve sits in a valve seat and it

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.260 
your valve sits in a valve seat and it
seals<00:02:05.140> at<00:02:05.500> this<00:02:05.680> point<00:02:05.979> right<00:02:06.159> here<00:02:06.220> well<00:02:07.119> what

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
seals at this point right here well what

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.559 
seals at this point right here well what
happens<00:02:07.720> is<00:02:07.960> over<00:02:07.990> time<00:02:08.319> on<00:02:08.860> a<00:02:09.060> CRF<00:02:10.060> they<00:02:10.299> use

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
happens is over time on a CRF they use

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.470 
happens is over time on a CRF they use
titanium<00:02:11.560> valves<00:02:12.249> titanium<00:02:12.879> sounds<00:02:13.299> like<00:02:13.450> a

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
titanium valves titanium sounds like a

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.790 
titanium valves titanium sounds like a
good<00:02:13.749> idea<00:02:14.049> but<00:02:14.230> it's<00:02:14.379> not

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
good idea but it's not

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.550 
good idea but it's not
because<00:02:15.100> titanium<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:15.760> really<00:02:16.030> soft<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.630> the

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
because titanium is really soft and the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.290 
because titanium is really soft and the
trouble<00:02:17.890> with<00:02:18.040> its<00:02:18.220> maybe<00:02:18.550> really<00:02:18.880> light<00:02:19.150> and

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
trouble with its maybe really light and

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.790 
trouble with its maybe really light and
really<00:02:19.360> strong<00:02:19.810> but<00:02:19.990> because<00:02:20.350> it's<00:02:20.560> soft

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
really strong but because it's soft

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.250 
really strong but because it's soft
these<00:02:21.190> valve<00:02:21.460> seats<00:02:21.730> wear<00:02:21.970> out<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:22.990> valve

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
these valve seats wear out and the valve

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.800 
these valve seats wear out and the valve
actually<00:02:24.010> wears<00:02:24.340> into<00:02:24.670> there<00:02:24.850> so<00:02:25.180> say<00:02:25.480> it<00:02:25.600> used

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
actually wears into there so say it used

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.410 
actually wears into there so say it used
to<00:02:25.960> be<00:02:26.080> at<00:02:26.230> this<00:02:26.380> level<00:02:26.730> over<00:02:27.730> time<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:28.240> wears

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
to be at this level over time it wears

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.410 
to be at this level over time it wears
out<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:28.960> goes<00:02:29.170> up<00:02:29.700> and<00:02:30.700> these<00:02:30.850> valve<00:02:31.120> seats

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
out and it goes up and these valve seats

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.050 
out and it goes up and these valve seats
cause<00:02:31.780> the<00:02:32.050> valve<00:02:32.260> to<00:02:32.470> ride<00:02:32.650> higher<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.340> then

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
cause the valve to ride higher and then

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.470 
cause the valve to ride higher and then
where<00:02:34.300> you<00:02:34.420> used<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.780> have<00:02:34.960> your<00:02:35.170> cam<00:02:35.410> riding

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
where you used to have your cam riding

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.200 
where you used to have your cam riding
say<00:02:37.480> this<00:02:37.660> is<00:02:37.840> your<00:02:38.020> cam<00:02:38.820> where<00:02:39.820> it<00:02:39.940> used<00:02:40.150> to

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
say this is your cam where it used to

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.510 
say this is your cam where it used to
ride<00:02:40.480> it<00:02:40.660> gets<00:02:40.840> right<00:02:41.050> up<00:02:41.110> into<00:02:41.470> there<00:02:41.770> and<00:02:42.070> so

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
ride it gets right up into there and so

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.490 
ride it gets right up into there and so
then<00:02:42.700> you<00:02:42.820> don't<00:02:43.000> have<00:02:43.180> any<00:02:43.360> compression<00:02:43.930> so

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
then you don't have any compression so

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.590 
then you don't have any compression so
what<00:02:44.680> do<00:02:44.770> you<00:02:44.860> do<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.610> get<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:45.820> smaller<00:02:46.180> shim

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
what do you do you get a smaller shim

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.630 
what do you do you get a smaller shim
and<00:02:46.840> that<00:02:46.930> basically<00:02:47.380> opens<00:02:47.860> up<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.160> gap<00:02:48.370> and

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
and that basically opens up the gap and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.490 
and that basically opens up the gap and
the<00:02:48.850> math<00:02:49.030> will<00:02:49.270> be<00:02:49.390> reflected<00:02:49.930> different<00:02:50.350> if

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
the math will be reflected different if

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.780 
the math will be reflected different if
you're<00:02:50.620> going<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:51.040> a<00:02:51.070> smaller<00:02:51.400> one<00:02:51.610> or<00:02:51.760> a

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
you're going to a smaller one or a

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.760 
you're going to a smaller one or a
bigger<00:02:51.970> one<00:02:52.210> you<00:02:52.870> look<00:02:53.050> in<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.260> manual<00:02:53.650> they

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
bigger one you look in the manual they

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.740 
bigger one you look in the manual they
say<00:02:53.950> they<00:02:54.130> do<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.400> math<00:02:54.580> this<00:02:54.820> way<00:02:55.120> because

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
say they do the math this way because

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.080 
say they do the math this way because
they<00:02:55.930> start<00:02:56.200> with<00:02:56.380> no<00:02:56.650> shim<00:02:56.950> in<00:02:57.190> it<00:02:57.340> and<00:02:57.490> then

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
they start with no shim in it and then

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.630 
they start with no shim in it and then
work<00:02:58.390> up<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:59.230> you<00:02:59.800> know<00:02:59.920> a<00:02:59.950> bigger<00:03:00.280> size<00:03:00.610> and

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
work up to you know a bigger size and

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.840 
work up to you know a bigger size and
bigger<00:03:01.030> size<00:03:01.330> so<00:03:01.750> they<00:03:01.870> add<00:03:02.430> what<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:03.460> want<00:03:03.730> to

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
bigger size so they add what you want to

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.240 
bigger size so they add what you want to
do<00:03:04.030> if<00:03:04.330> you're<00:03:04.750> having<00:03:05.140> hard<00:03:05.470> starting<00:03:06.010> is

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
do if you're having hard starting is

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.340 
do if you're having hard starting is
you'll<00:03:06.640> want<00:03:06.670> to<00:03:06.940> subtract<00:03:07.450> you'll<00:03:08.050> want<00:03:08.260> to

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
you'll want to subtract you'll want to

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.150 
you'll want to subtract you'll want to
basically<00:03:09.810> remove<00:03:12.030> size<00:03:13.230> instead<00:03:14.230> of<00:03:14.410> having

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
basically remove size instead of having

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.760 
basically remove size instead of having
a<00:03:15.460> great<00:03:16.060> big<00:03:16.090> size<00:03:16.600> that<00:03:16.840> you<00:03:16.930> subtract<00:03:17.410> from

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
a great big size that you subtract from

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.560 
a great big size that you subtract from
you<00:03:18.340> want<00:03:18.550> to<00:03:18.670> take<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:19.000> difference<00:03:19.420> or

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
you want to take the difference or

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.420 
you want to take the difference or
whatever<00:03:19.900> whatever<00:03:20.410> it<00:03:20.530> takes<00:03:20.770> to<00:03:20.980> get<00:03:21.130> it<00:03:21.310> to

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
whatever whatever it takes to get it to

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.560 
whatever whatever it takes to get it to
a<00:03:21.459> point<00:03:21.790> 1<00:03:22.090> 6<00:03:22.620> so<00:03:23.850> let's<00:03:24.850> put<00:03:25.060> this<00:03:25.209> reality

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
a point 1 6 so let's put this reality

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.300 
a point 1 6 so let's put this reality
say<00:03:25.989> my<00:03:26.170> measurement<00:03:26.680> was<00:03:26.860> zero

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
say my measurement was zero

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.930 
say my measurement was zero
they<00:03:27.640> had<00:03:27.790> no<00:03:27.970> compression<00:03:28.420> you<00:03:29.320> go<00:03:29.410> zero

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
they had no compression you go zero

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.610 
they had no compression you go zero
minus<00:03:30.940> one<00:03:31.209> point<00:03:31.870> six<00:03:33.330> millimeter<00:03:34.330> erb<00:03:34.620> 0.16

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
minus one point six millimeter erb 0.16

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.850 
minus one point six millimeter erb 0.16
excuse<00:03:36.160> me<00:03:36.280> you<00:03:36.370> gotta<00:03:36.550> get<00:03:36.640> that<00:03:36.850> right<00:03:37.860> so

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
excuse me you gotta get that right so

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.410 
excuse me you gotta get that right so
you<00:03:38.950> take<00:03:39.160> that<00:03:39.310> measurement<00:03:39.640> until<00:03:40.270> you're

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
you take that measurement until you're

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.280 
you take that measurement until you're
at<00:03:40.540> a<00:03:40.570> negative<00:03:41.730> value<00:03:42.730> so<00:03:43.600> say<00:03:43.780> this<00:03:43.959> is<00:03:44.140> the

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
at a negative value so say this is the

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.900 
at a negative value so say this is the
spacer<00:03:44.739> that<00:03:44.890> I<00:03:44.920> had<00:03:45.160> in<00:03:45.340> there<00:03:45.520> the<00:03:45.730> shim

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
spacer that I had in there the shim

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.520 
spacer that I had in there the shim
ahead<00:03:46.209> in<00:03:46.360> there<00:03:46.540> say<00:03:46.810> it<00:03:46.870> was<00:03:46.989> a<00:03:47.020> one<00:03:47.260> point

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
ahead in there say it was a one point

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.310 
ahead in there say it was a one point
six<00:03:48.340> five<00:03:48.610> in<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.060> head<00:03:49.270> zero<00:03:49.510> as<00:03:49.840> a

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
six five in the head zero as a

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.930 
six five in the head zero as a
measurement<00:03:51.100> I<00:03:51.220> couldn't<00:03:51.520> get<00:03:51.640> a<00:03:51.670> feeler

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
measurement I couldn't get a feeler

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.080 
measurement I couldn't get a feeler
gauge<00:03:52.180> under<00:03:52.570> there<00:03:52.750> you'd<00:03:53.440> basically<00:03:54.090> take

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
gauge under there you'd basically take

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.449 
gauge under there you'd basically take
that<00:03:55.330> and<00:03:55.570> subtract<00:03:56.110> from<00:03:56.500> it<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.860> one<00:03:57.160> point

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
that and subtract from it the one point

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.790 
that and subtract from it the one point
six
