00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 ok here we are in a new tutorial 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.160
 of minecraft and let's make a statue 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.530
 of capitan america giant size good 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.679
 first of all I feel the inactivity 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.500
 of these months because I've been in of 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.150
 holidays and such and also now with the 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.970
 start of the course I do not have time and such 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.960
 good that since finally find a 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.910
 hollow and here is the new good statue 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.720
 because for this we are going to need wool 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.600
 blue wool red wool white normal finger 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.720
 life and yellow wool and boards 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.600
 good birch let's start 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.700
 the first as always 4 x 8 of 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.440
 measure they were telling us to the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.920
 people who explained to me and also 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.900
 you already know that I always 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.070
 I explain not like other people who go up 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.830
 videos and do not explain the measures 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.190
 simply teaches them the good point 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:59.820
 because the first thing with red wool we do in 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.980
 vertical 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.850
 equal on all sides both by 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.510
 back as laterally and ahead 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.570
 then 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:14.960
 ahead 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:17.380
 we do with blue wool 1 2 3 4 5 6 and 7 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.689
 just like everywhere 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.439
 or wait for me to leave this here 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.439
 Unfilled 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:29.260
 on all sides equal both 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.260
 laterally as from behind and all 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.049
 and when it arrives and in the next line 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.220
 we make the belt that you just finished 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.060
 watch 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:47.030
 it's a whole black line behind and 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.479
 the lateral equal and ahead 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.690
 and we make three in three on each side of 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.400
 black and in the middle two yellow and 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.680
 we make another line over exactly 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.290
 same as another whole black and ahead 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.610
 we leave three blacks on each side and in the 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.570
 all yellow center to make 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.729
 as if it were the belt 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.890
 well then after the part of 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.020
 forward and behind I think it's 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.700
 even laterally I do not know because this 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.840
 is covering the arm but not equal if 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.950
 behind is the same 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.879
 Well, that's what we have to do, 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.920
 lines of three high corners 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:27.790
 reds like that 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.709
 then the next two white and 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.260
 also three high as if they were 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:37.630
 six and in the center another six but 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:40.870
 red and behind exactly the same 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.540
 two first three red the islands the 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.690
 next six white and the middle one 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.819
 six reds and now as much behind as 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.880
 ahead as you can see the 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.040
 star is the same we leave a line 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.469
 whole blue 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.430
 so a whole blue line ahead 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:03:04.959
 behind and laterally and then we make two 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:08.829
 whites that is two blue pardons to each 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.859
 side after one white and two blue 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:14.200
 then good if I explained I will burn 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.150
 here be better explained the star and 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.579
 then later it reigns is that the blue 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.989
 so good in the third block starting 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.900
 from the corner and each one you put one 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.530
 white well after four whites over 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.329
 so and then six whites above and in 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.879
 the center two whites and it would stay this 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.290
 form then if you have any doubt I would 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.160
 ask in the comments and such 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.140
 because sometimes the time had said 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.120
 it's good that sometimes it did not explain well 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.630
 and such but I'm sorry but this is what 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.090
 there's because if I throw myself too long 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:48.150
 recording for example doing it doing 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.980
 the statues do not think more then 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.560
 then then it would last me a long time and 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.060
 not being a partner, I can not go up 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.030
 more than 15 minutes then I could not 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.780
 upload the video so I do not do it like that 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.569
 do not think that the other thing 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.560
 for vagrancy or whatever is good and 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:04.480
 after making the star and 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.060
 fill it in blue we make another line in 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.700
 blue fabric 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.319
 then for the arms we do as 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:15.200
 as long as they are 4 wide 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.650
 as of all life as if in everything 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.229
 other videos 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.610
 and also long box and then 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.970
 from vertically we do 1 2 3 4 and 5 of 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.320
 blue 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.930
 then or three of white 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.930
 and red box until I get up 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:38.460
 one below the belt and from behind 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.100
 and under the same and now to finish the 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.310
 head 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.980
 we do as always the same measure of 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.530
 eight by four as the eight feet 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.849
 by eight and as long as two 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.009
 picture 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:53.509
 we could trace wood on each side and 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:57.349
 we left the two of the center black 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:59.809
 then a whole wood and then two 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:02.569
 in the center and then already the rest these 

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:04.520
 of blue then a blue on each side and 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:08.119
 then the eyes of a black and white 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:11.629
 black and white and then two blue then 

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:14.899
 two blue whole lines and then the 

00:05:11.629 --> 00:05:16.789
 next two blue on each side then 

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:18.830
 one white in each and two blue in 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:21.319
 the middle and in the next two blue to 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:24.919
 each side also and four whites in the 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:26.449
 half above would stay this and 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:29.119
 now laterally in the other would be 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:32.209
 we do the same in this corner below 

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:35.389
 four wooden then I 'm in 

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:38.110
 pico piques and four other wooden and 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:42.139
 the rest blue and on top of this line 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:44.449
 we put two white two white and 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:47.029
 three whites and on the opposite side 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:48.260
 just that it would start from the 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:51.650
 another point 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:53.870
 and behind whole blue good for this 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:57.350
