00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.850
 there is no reason to make an intervention when there is no more chance of 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:04.480
 goal 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.700
 until it served simply to prolong the suffering 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:11.250
 vilma just in one of the 30 thousand 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.299
 the situation 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:13.829
 after all 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:16.779
 the present that allows you to synchronize 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:18.470
 this situation 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.869
 because people 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:20.929
 refusing 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:22.019
 ef 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:23.829
 naturally 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.729
 the breach of telephone confidentiality of deputy geddel who does not like to see 

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:28.929
 blood 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.449
 that we have 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.780
 and that even the list refuses to go to the doctor prescribing the movies 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.800
 has been so since the indent 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.990
 we have some people forced to refuse treatment as uncle 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.460
 religious 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.020
 patient's anxiety and can accept or reject the treatment he or she 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.280
 understand 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:56.280
 giving since the sexes he promised to bring the adult patient capable he can 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.830
 accept or refuse I want him to understand 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.580
 for religious reasons or not 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.820
 there are people for example open 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.220
 understood that there are people who do not accept blood transfusion for 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.220
 medical reason fear of disease through contamination 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.120
 but there is for example a religions is the best known case 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.820
 of Jehovah's Witnesses for example 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.380
 Why did not you accept? 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.900
 have undergone a blood transfusion for months on eminently 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.400
 games 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.400
 thankfully all 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.790
 not only in the sense of respecting the patient's right 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.820
 but to combat 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.250
 dc in the fly treatment alternatives 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.400
 then we have a series of procedures that eliminate 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.640
 so to speak 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.720
 the need for the use of blood in the vast majority of cases are 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.350
 treatments that have to be used quite effectively 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.350
 internationally proven relatively simple procedures 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.399
 which has allowed doctors to attend for six months 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.780
 patients 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.300
 to worsen the situation of the senate 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.469
 of health 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:02.899
 or in some way 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:04.770
 increases the risk 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.539
 of that patient's life the case of that of the Jews that you formed when you are 

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:13.129
 could have some or some objections 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.129
 of internal religious order, for example, are related to 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:20.509
 their Jewish festivities in relation to 

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:21.659
 the gun 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:26.980
 for example in the last round on Saturday the same procedure already occurs with the 

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:28.169
 procedures 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:30.919
 tiny 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:35.180
 a use within the time limits but before - 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:40.679
 they consider a marine animal pig 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:44.829
 a group of ten years the issue for example of the woman and their daughter was more 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.559
 then a Catholic woman 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:47.969
 what 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:48.870
 the doctor 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.989
 prescribe an abortion called therapeutic abortion that her life at risk 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.020
 but I do not want 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.080
 for reasons of delay in their faith 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.940
 She does not comply She prefers to run the risk of dying and even if she has to 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.240
 She and her son die if she is to take that risk. 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.229
 we do not have just one abortion 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:07.419
 are some of the issues that involve 

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:10.369
 religious beliefs that are clearly independent of 

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:11.870
 we agree or not 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.879
 believe or not but we have to respect the right of each person but the 

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:20.090
 doctor if he needed to refuse to do many shows in the blood that the 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.689
 worst crisis 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.689
 the doctor should not be held responsible for this 

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:28.029
 of course 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:32.179
 in the first place the doctor must be guided by an ethical conduct 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.559
 technical 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:36.509
 it is very common 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:40.459
 a professional believes that for example cases will not be necessary 

00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:45.900
 and that it is the only treatment that could be given that patient 

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:51.679
 In this situation the family, for example, gets another professional 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:55.849
 disposes and that can treat that patient in use of santinha 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:59.239
 what the doctor will never do to abandon the patient 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:03.049
 cuiabÃ¡ the doctor can not, for example, stop giving care 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:06.329
 that this could characterize as its juice 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:07.689
 but if you respect me 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.569
 I do not wish imposed by the patient himself 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:16.299
 parents' request then in no way neglecting 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.840
 life of the child but are only asking for the optimization of the 

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:23.719
 alternative to 1 in the middle 

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:26.539
 scientifically proven that it would 

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:27.930
 beck that would reach 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.290
 the same purpose 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.230
 The doctor should respect the lieutenant well and I did not feel well I would not have to 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.840
 to hold accountable in the document
