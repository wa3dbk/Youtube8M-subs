get a 50 gunstreak ha no pun intended

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.490 
get a 50 gunstreak ha no pun intended
gets<00:00:27.340> a<00:00:27.460> 50-ton<00:00:28.150> streak<00:00:28.539> in<00:00:28.720> this<00:00:29.019> game<00:00:29.199> play

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:29.500 
gets a 50-ton streak in this game play

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.230 
gets a 50-ton streak in this game play
so<00:00:30.039> it<00:00:30.099> is<00:00:30.160> pretty<00:00:30.369> sweet<00:00:30.640> it's<00:00:31.029> a<00:00:31.089> pretty

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
so it is pretty sweet it's a pretty

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.450 
so it is pretty sweet it's a pretty
fast-paced<00:00:31.599> gameplay<00:00:32.019> I<00:00:32.470> think<00:00:33.010> he<00:00:33.129> hits<00:00:33.370> that

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
fast-paced gameplay I think he hits that

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.729 
fast-paced gameplay I think he hits that
like<00:00:33.699> a<00:00:33.910> 900<00:00:34.660> score<00:00:35.019> per<00:00:35.170> minute<00:00:35.440> somewhere

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
like a 900 score per minute somewhere

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:37.890 
like a 900 score per minute somewhere
around<00:00:35.830> there<00:00:36.250> because<00:00:36.580> he<00:00:36.699> gets<00:00:36.910> 50<00:00:37.629> kills

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
around there because he gets 50 kills

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.439 
around there because he gets 50 kills
and<00:00:38.140> just<00:00:38.559> about<00:00:38.739> five<00:00:39.100> and<00:00:39.550> a<00:00:39.879> half<00:00:39.910> minutes

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:40.449 
and just about five and a half minutes

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.299

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
September maybe because it's like going

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.159 
September maybe because it's like going
back<00:04:19.100> to<00:04:19.130> school<00:04:19.459> and<00:04:20.060> everything's<00:04:20.930> kind<00:04:21.140> of

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
back to school and everything's kind of

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.740

like<00:04:21.430> restarting<00:04:22.430> after<00:04:22.790> a<00:04:22.910> long<00:04:23.210> break<00:04:23.479> I

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
like restarting after a long break I

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.690 
like restarting after a long break I
think<00:04:23.780> that<00:04:24.050> is<00:04:24.169> a<00:04:24.200> difficult<00:04:24.830> month<00:04:25.400> for<00:04:25.640> a

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
think that is a difficult month for a

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.480 
think that is a difficult month for a
lot<00:04:25.880> of<00:04:25.970> people<00:04:26.150> but<00:04:26.800> yes<00:04:27.800> that's<00:04:27.950> the<00:04:28.130> only

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
lot of people but yes that's the only

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.190 
lot of people but yes that's the only
it's<00:04:28.669> not<00:04:28.729> really<00:04:28.970> because<00:04:29.120> of<00:04:29.300> the<00:04:29.450> way<00:04:30.080> it

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
it's not really because of the way it

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.810 
it's not really because of the way it
feels<00:04:30.350> outside<00:04:30.830> or<00:04:30.979> anything<00:04:31.280> just<00:04:31.400> kind<00:04:31.610> of<00:04:31.669> a
