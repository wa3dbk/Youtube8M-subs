00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
the phrase and all that stuff just to

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.280 
the phrase and all that stuff just to
get<00:01:39.950> it<00:01:40.130> all<00:01:40.250> clear<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:40.940> then<00:01:41.840> when<00:01:42.050> it<00:01:42.170> comes

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
while I record they did an animation

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.170 
while I record they did an animation
test<00:01:54.860> would<00:01:55.130> violate<00:01:55.370> that<00:01:55.910> has<00:01:57.790> they<00:01:58.790> did<00:01:59.030> an

then<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.400> would<00:02:21.760> cut<00:02:22.060> out<00:02:22.239> little<00:02:23.080> pieces<00:02:23.560> here

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
then I would cut out little pieces here

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.570 
then I would cut out little pieces here
and<00:02:24.430> there<00:02:24.489> where<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.030> screwed<00:02:25.629> up<00:02:26.430> just<00:02:27.430> to

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
and there where I screwed up just to

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.420 
and there where I screwed up just to
make<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:28.080> perfectly<00:02:29.080> clear

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
make a perfectly clear

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.479 
make a perfectly clear
just<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.150> make<00:02:31.299> all<00:02:31.840> one<00:02:32.500> big<00:02:32.739> perfectly

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
just to make all one big perfectly

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.430 
just to make all one big perfectly
cleared<00:02:34.829> recording<00:02:35.829> of<00:02:35.980> it<00:02:36.159> and<00:02:36.810> I<00:02:37.810> support

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
cleared recording of it and I support

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.460 
cleared recording of it and I support
the<00:02:38.530> cording<00:02:39.040> I<00:02:39.700> wouldn't<00:02:40.420> read<00:02:40.629> the<00:02:41.019> entire

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
the cording I wouldn't read the entire

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.759 
the cording I wouldn't read the entire
thing<00:02:41.500> in<00:02:42.250> one<00:02:42.700> shot<00:02:43.120> what<00:02:43.959> I<00:02:43.989> do<00:02:44.110> is<00:02:44.500> that<00:02:44.709> I

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
thing in one shot what I do is that I

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.930 
thing in one shot what I do is that I
would<00:02:45.159> take<00:02:45.370> like<00:02:45.640> big<00:02:46.150> chunks<00:02:46.720> of<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:47.940> like

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
would take like big chunks of it like

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.599 
would take like big chunks of it like
pretty<00:02:49.299> much<00:02:49.510> what<00:02:50.019> would<00:02:50.170> fill<00:02:50.530> up<00:02:50.560> my<00:02:51.190> screen

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
pretty much what would fill up my screen

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:56.099 
pretty much what would fill up my screen
as<00:02:52.049> for<00:02:53.049> the<00:02:53.379> the<00:02:53.910> length<00:02:54.910> again<00:02:55.660> it<00:02:55.930> all

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
as for the the length again it all

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.800 
as for the the length again it all
depends<00:02:56.590> on<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:57.579> length<00:02:57.760> of<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.269> subject

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
depends on the length of the subject

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.649 
depends on the length of the subject
like<00:02:59.200> how<00:02:59.349> big<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.890> text<00:03:00.280> would<00:03:00.430> be<00:03:00.489> on<00:03:01.000> either

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
like how big the text would be on either

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.509 
like how big the text would be on either
the<00:03:01.930> movie<00:03:02.290> or<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:02.769> subject<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.280> I<00:03:03.370> would

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
the movie or the subject that I would

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.640 
the movie or the subject that I would
talk<00:03:03.670> about<00:03:04.049> if<00:03:05.049> it's<00:03:05.230> something<00:03:05.530> that's

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
talk about if it's something that's

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.039 
talk about if it's something that's
really<00:03:06.010> short<00:03:06.340> where<00:03:06.879> the<00:03:07.390> recording<00:03:07.870> would

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
really short where the recording would

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.369 
really short where the recording would
be<00:03:08.260> like<00:03:08.560> a<00:03:08.590> minute<00:03:09.010> or<00:03:09.129> two<00:03:09.340> long<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:11.170> would

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
be like a minute or two long it would

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.479 
be like a minute or two long it would
take<00:03:11.409> around<00:03:12.129> maybe<00:03:13.000> 10<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.200> 20<00:03:14.590> minutes<00:03:14.859> to

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
take around maybe 10 to 20 minutes to

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.199 
take around maybe 10 to 20 minutes to
record<00:03:15.849> to<00:03:16.359> do<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.959> entire<00:03:17.260> thing<00:03:17.909> but<00:03:18.909> when

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
record to do the entire thing but when

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.330 
record to do the entire thing but when
it's<00:03:19.359> something<00:03:19.599> that's<00:03:19.959> big<00:03:20.560> like<00:03:21.010> The

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
it's something that's big like The

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.170 
it's something that's big like The
Incredibles<00:03:21.459> then<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:23.590> length<00:03:23.859> can<00:03:24.579> the<00:03:24.910> time

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
Incredibles then the length can the time

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.349 
Incredibles then the length can the time
length<00:03:25.389> can<00:03:25.780> go<00:03:25.959> either<00:03:26.260> from<00:03:26.889> 30<00:03:27.790> minutes<00:03:28.060> to

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
length can go either from 30 minutes to

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.129 
length can go either from 30 minutes to
an<00:03:28.599> hour<00:03:28.900> so<00:03:29.440> as<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:30.790> probably<00:03:31.090> guess<00:03:31.569> this<00:03:31.930> is

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:32.139 
an hour so as you probably guess this is

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.759 
an hour so as you probably guess this is
the<00:03:32.769> shortest<00:03:33.250> process<00:03:33.879> to<00:03:34.150> do<00:03:34.299> like<00:03:34.690> I<00:03:34.900> could

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
the shortest process to do like I could

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:39.900 
the shortest process to do like I could
do<00:03:35.919> it<00:03:36.099> in<00:03:36.280> just<00:03:36.790> like<00:03:36.940> this<00:03:38.430> normally<00:03:39.430> I<00:03:39.459> would

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
do it in just like this normally I would

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.449 
do it in just like this normally I would
be<00:03:40.090> finished<00:03:40.540> with<00:03:40.989> this<00:03:41.200> part<00:03:41.560> and<00:03:41.829> I<00:03:42.280> would

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
be finished with this part and I would

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.970 
be finished with this part and I would
join<00:03:42.609> you<00:03:42.669> guys<00:03:42.970> later<00:03:43.299> but<00:03:43.780> since<00:03:44.590> it<00:03:44.799> is<00:03:44.949> the

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
join you guys later but since it is the

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.640 
join you guys later but since it is the
Incredibles<00:03:45.790> I<00:03:46.120> decided<00:03:46.989> to<00:03:47.230> add<00:03:47.379> in

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
Incredibles I decided to add in

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.580 
Incredibles I decided to add in
something<00:03:48.040> a<00:03:48.579> little<00:03:49.239> extra<00:03:49.900> for<00:03:50.139> it<00:03:50.310> which<00:03:51.310> is

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
something a little extra for it which is

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.180 
something a little extra for it which is
do<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:53.829> do<00:03:54.400> an<00:03:54.519> impression<00:03:54.849> of<00:03:55.799> animo

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
do it and do an impression of animo

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.339 
do it and do an impression of animo
so<00:03:57.489> pretty<00:03:58.060> much<00:03:58.150> I'll<00:03:58.510> be<00:03:58.629> talking<00:03:58.870> to<00:03:59.109> you

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
so pretty much I'll be talking to you

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:02.339 
so pretty much I'll be talking to you
guys<00:03:59.470> about<00:03:59.620> how<00:04:00.340> I<00:04:00.760> would<00:04:01.000> prepare<00:04:01.690> myself<00:04:01.870> to

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
guys about how I would prepare myself to

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.589 
guys about how I would prepare myself to
do<00:04:02.639> character<00:04:03.639> impersonations

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:04.599 
do character impersonations

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.970 
do character impersonations
so<00:04:05.669> what<00:04:06.669> I<00:04:06.699> pretty<00:04:07.000> much<00:04:07.090> do<00:04:07.480> is<00:04:07.810> that<00:04:08.410> I<00:04:08.650> would

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
so what I pretty much do is that I would

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.289 
so what I pretty much do is that I would
start<00:04:09.280> by<00:04:09.370> listening<00:04:10.180> to<00:04:10.239> a<00:04:10.419> few<00:04:10.780> clips<00:04:11.319> of<00:04:12.299> of

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299 
start by listening to a few clips of of

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.629 
start by listening to a few clips of of
the<00:04:13.810> movie<00:04:14.260> that<00:04:14.980> would<00:04:15.190> feature<00:04:15.430> the

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
the movie that would feature the

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:18.770 
the movie that would feature the
character<00:04:16.470> that<00:04:17.470> I<00:04:17.500> want<00:04:17.769> to<00:04:17.889> impersonate<00:04:18.190> and

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
character that I want to impersonate and

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
character that I want to impersonate and
then<00:04:19.780> I<00:04:20.049> would<00:04:20.519> record<00:04:21.519> myself<00:04:22.349> as<00:04:23.349> the

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
then I would record myself as the

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.730 
then I would record myself as the
character<00:04:24.310> like<00:04:24.969> just<00:04:25.240> whip

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
character like just whip

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.580 
character like just whip
one<00:04:26.130> of<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.340> lines<00:04:26.520> that<00:04:27.050> like<00:04:28.050> that<00:04:28.380> the

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
one of the lines that like that the

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.830 
one of the lines that like that the
character<00:04:28.979> said<00:04:29.280> and<00:04:29.580> then<00:04:30.360> I<00:04:30.389> would<00:04:30.630> try<00:04:30.810> to

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
character said and then I would try to

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.249 
character said and then I would try to
compare<00:04:31.349> it<00:04:31.470> by<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.710> two<00:04:32.039> just<00:04:32.430> to<00:04:32.610> know<00:04:33.259> if

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
compare it by the two just to know if

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.080 
compare it by the two just to know if
there's<00:04:34.620> any<00:04:34.860> adjustments<00:04:35.610> that<00:04:35.669> I<00:04:35.789> have<00:04:35.970> to

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
there's any adjustments that I have to

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.809 
there's any adjustments that I have to
do<00:04:36.210> with<00:04:36.330> my<00:04:36.479> own<00:04:36.660> voice<00:04:37.039> but<00:04:38.039> where<00:04:38.280> the<00:04:38.520> heck

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:38.819 
do with my own voice but where the heck

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:41.300 
do with my own voice but where the heck
am<00:04:38.849> I<00:04:39.060> gonna<00:04:39.240> get<00:04:39.449> a<00:04:39.509> new<00:04:39.720> it's<00:04:40.500> impossible

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
am I gonna get a new it's impossible
