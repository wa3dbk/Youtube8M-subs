Ladies and Gentelmen,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.200
knowing me I definetley 
didn't buy this tv,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.900
it was lying outside,  
just next to the rubbish containers,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.100
so I, as a good human being, an example to follow, 
had to take it in just like it was one of mine own.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.000
Just a couple of years back you could spend a good penny on it.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.500
Xbox was also taken in by me, 
from the same rubbish containers that is.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.400
For these games I have payed less 
than 2 pounds each, so bloody cheap.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.500
Couple of days ago I've bought this 
Sega Megadrive for Â£10.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.900
You would think '10 quid for Sega, 
so f* expensive'

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.100
but there is a little hook to it, with the Sega 
itself there was some games as well. we had:

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.500
PGA European Tour

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.000
Mega Games I

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.400
Sonic

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.700
Outrun

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.300
Alex the Kid in the Enchanted Castle

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.400
Strider

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.800
Ghouls'n Ghosts

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.800
Streets of Rage

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.200
and the Revange of Shinobi
21
00:01:09,500 --&gt; 00:01:09,400
and these three are the ones that just turn me on the most.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.300
All of them one after each other  in those boxes 
with all the booklets included,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.600
at some point the hydrophilic gel will have to be used but

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.300
time or occasion to go to the shoe store 
to look around in those shoe boxes.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.400
Alex the Kid so beautiful so phenomenal,

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.900
so many booklets that the won't even fill in the box, 
I've had to stick them just behind the case itself.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.900
Unfortunately Outrun did not have any booklets with it.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.100
Oh what can You do, what can You do...

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.300
For a change Sonic does not include cart

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.600
but it is almost in every game set so it is not a big loss.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.500
So, just a reminder

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.800
the first model of Sega is equipped with 
the volume adjuster,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.400
regular antenna output, next to it, 
there is din 5,  from which You take the AV out,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.400
and 9 volt input for the power cable,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.300
where in the second version we have lesser din and also 9/10 volt

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.400
the rest of it You can find on Wikipedia.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.800
The only one mystery is this bloody din 5,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.900
yes,  exactly the same one of which I have not any idea where to stick it in.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.300
Any normal tvs in these times you cannot see an input for it,  
and as far as I'm concerned the older tvs are not much more better.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.800
So that is pretty much it, thanks for listening,  with the Kindest of Regards.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.800
Almost forgot,

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.200
Also I am going to connect that with the stereophonic audio-video cable,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.300
the same cable of which soldering was meant to be a really important part of this video,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.100
however after doing that for over 2.5 hours I  came to the conclusion

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.800
that I am not going to be able  to narrate the final 8 minutes of soldering

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.700
So again thank You for your time  I appreciate that.
