is because Shao Kahn came into earth
realm

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:22.900 
realm

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.170 
realm
even<00:01:23.380> after<00:01:23.710> Liu<00:01:23.890> Kang<00:01:24.070> defeated<00:01:24.460> him<00:01:24.610> so

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
even after Liu Kang defeated him so

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.730 
even after Liu Kang defeated him so
perhaps<00:01:25.330> he<00:01:25.570> descended<00:01:26.080> into<00:01:26.230> a<00:01:26.320> higher<00:01:26.560> plane

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
perhaps he descended into a higher plane

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.140 
perhaps he descended into a higher plane
after<00:01:27.190> his<00:01:27.280> death<00:01:27.520> and<00:01:27.760> just<00:01:27.910> straight<00:01:28.120> up

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
after his death and just straight up

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.720 
after his death and just straight up
became<00:01:28.480> a<00:01:28.510> god<00:01:28.810> himself<00:01:29.290> even<00:01:30.070> more<00:01:30.280> powerful

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
became a god himself even more powerful

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.210 
became a god himself even more powerful
and<00:01:30.910> badass<00:01:31.180> than<00:01:31.570> ever<00:01:31.750> and<00:01:32.020> I<00:01:32.770> think<00:01:33.070> would

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
be an interesting story arc if he

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.360 
be an interesting story arc if he
actually<00:01:34.930> got<00:01:35.200> more<00:01:35.350> corrupt<00:01:35.800> as<00:01:35.980> time<00:01:36.190> went

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
actually got more corrupt as time went

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.520 
actually got more corrupt as time went
on<00:01:36.490> eventually<00:01:37.270> becoming<00:01:37.630> completely<00:01:38.050> evil

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530

Liu Kang has always been an easy to pick
up<00:01:47.950> combo<00:01:48.430> heavy<00:01:48.640> character<00:01:49.030> with<00:01:49.240> flashy

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
up combo heavy character with flashy

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.140 
up combo heavy character with flashy
moves<00:01:49.840> it<00:01:50.500> was<00:01:50.620> also<00:01:50.770> very<00:01:51.040> well<00:01:51.280> rounded<00:01:51.490> he

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
moves it was also very well rounded he

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.120 
moves it was also very well rounded he
had<00:01:52.240> access<00:01:52.510> to<00:01:52.570> projectiles<00:01:53.290> a<00:01:53.500> counter<00:01:53.950> and

had access to projectiles a counter and

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.520 
had access to projectiles a counter and
effective<00:01:54.850> melee<00:01:55.120> moves<00:01:55.360> so<00:01:56.020> I<00:01:56.050> think<00:01:56.170> all

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
effective melee moves so I think all

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.899 
effective melee moves so I think all
these<00:01:56.710> elements<00:01:56.980> can<00:01:57.250> be<00:01:57.280> just<00:01:57.520> worked<00:01:57.760> upon

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
these elements can be just worked upon

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:00.300 
these elements can be just worked upon
through<00:01:58.300> his<00:01:58.450> three<00:01:58.690> variations<00:01:59.040> the<00:02:00.040> first

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
through his three variations the first

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.220 
through his three variations the first
variation<00:02:00.820> can<00:02:00.940> be<00:02:01.000> purely<00:02:01.480> melee<00:02:01.810> focused

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
variation can be purely melee focused

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.080 
variation can be purely melee focused
putting<00:02:02.800> more<00:02:02.980> emphasis<00:02:03.159> on<00:02:03.550> moves<00:02:03.760> like<00:02:03.909> his

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
putting more emphasis on moves like his

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.510 
putting more emphasis on moves like his
dragon<00:02:04.479> kick<00:02:04.720> counter<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:06.070> classic

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
dragon kick counter and the classic

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.249 
dragon kick counter and the classic
bicycle<00:02:06.970> kick<00:02:07.120> which<00:02:07.360> now<00:02:07.570> to<00:02:07.750> think<00:02:07.930> about<00:02:08.140> it

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
bicycle kick which now to think about it

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:09.540 
bicycle kick which now to think about it
should<00:02:08.619> be<00:02:08.709> a<00:02:08.739> staple<00:02:09.009> move<00:02:09.310> in<00:02:09.429> all

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
should be a staple move in all

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.430 
should be a staple move in all
variations<00:02:10.300> I<00:02:10.390> mean<00:02:10.750> if<00:02:10.810> Liu<00:02:10.929> Kang<00:02:11.140> doesn't

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
variations I mean if Liu Kang doesn't

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.229 
variations I mean if Liu Kang doesn't
have<00:02:11.590> his<00:02:11.709> bicycle<00:02:12.099> kick<00:02:12.280> don't<00:02:12.940> even<00:02:13.060> bother

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
have his bicycle kick don't even bother

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.100 
have his bicycle kick don't even bother

putting you in the game
the<00:02:14.650> second<00:02:15.010> variation<00:02:15.220> can<00:02:15.490> be<00:02:15.610> more

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
the second variation can be more

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.970 
the second variation can be more

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
of an emphasis on the dragon stance

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.240 
of an emphasis on the dragon stance
which<00:02:25.840> puts<00:02:26.110> him<00:02:26.170> in<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.350> posture<00:02:26.590> that<00:02:26.950> grants
