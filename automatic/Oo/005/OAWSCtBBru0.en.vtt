00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.180
 whose recipe consists of three ingredients 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.120
 flour eggs and sugar are not so 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.610
 easy to make because when baking 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.500
 they go back to get rid quickly without and 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.420
 you have to be careful the mass has to 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.640
 be perfect the consistency has to be 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.589
 the right one and then yes but what 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.489
 we will achieve with my indications we are going 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.489
 to look great 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.290
 everything first is to visit the market to 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.850
 buy fresh fruits for dessert on 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.300
 road crosses the old town 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.610

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.090
 humanity and passes in front of the house where

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.120
 as decoration for use no channel of 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.680
 Salzburg that notifies is decided by 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.840
 these blueberries 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.509
 the nocturnal of those original borough 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.490
 they are white but they can also be 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.500
 give a touch of color for that we have 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.040
 bought cranberries and at home you 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.560
 we will take advantage 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.630
 in the caramelized kitchen in the first place 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.950
 the source for the oven putting sugar 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.200
 and liquid cream in a refractory mold 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.210
 these ingredients are cooked to 220 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.050
 degrees until the dough is browned 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.050
 slightly 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.350
 at the time of serving the rockies of 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.540

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.950
 candy below and served on the plate 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.950
 this gives them very good flavor 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.110
 the next thing is to beat the whites of 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.740
 egg who wants it can do it with 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.740
 a blender 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:15.959
 the important thing is to beat the whites the 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.090
 excess has to be a consistency 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.400
 creamy and not too liquid 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.799
 so that when the gnocchi are put on 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.370
 the mold of the oven do not remain white and 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.370

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.580
 grated and mixed again 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.640
 now the yolks and flour are added and 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.640
 it is removed with care 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.830
 finally gernot way 3 xenon kern 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.700
 three mountaineers and they have to be 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.700
 only three 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.800

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:07.310

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.300
 You can also use powders to 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.010
 make pudding and starch, there are those who add it 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.620
 previously to the mass so that this 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.780
 be firmer more consistent but it is 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.440
 a trick is to cheat and is not faithful to 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.440
 the original recipe 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:44.270
