00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.870 

to<00:00:10.080> do<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.440> twinkling<00:00:10.830> staff<00:00:11.099> string<00:00:11.550> figure

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
to do the twinkling staff string figure

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.339 
to do the twinkling staff string figure
you<00:00:12.090> just<00:00:12.300> want<00:00:12.480> to<00:00:12.540> start<00:00:12.750> with<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.019> loop<00:00:13.200> of

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
you just want to start with the loop of

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.250 
you just want to start with the loop of
string<00:00:13.530> across<00:00:13.830> your<00:00:14.070> palms<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:15.260> then

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
string across your palms and then

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.769 
string across your palms and then
clicked<00:00:16.789> the<00:00:17.789> little<00:00:18.060> finger<00:00:18.359> string<00:00:18.420> with

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
clicked the little finger string with

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.750 
clicked the little finger string with
your<00:00:18.810> thumb<00:00:18.960> from<00:00:19.439> above<00:00:19.770> by<00:00:20.100> rotating<00:00:20.609> your

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
your thumb from above by rotating your

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.220 
your thumb from above by rotating your
hand<00:00:21.029> forward<00:00:23.510> should<00:00:24.510> end<00:00:24.750> up<00:00:24.840> with<00:00:24.900> that

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
hand forward should end up with that

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.200 
hand forward should end up with that
kind<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.619> pattern<00:00:25.949> on<00:00:26.099> your<00:00:26.250> hand<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.880> do<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
kind of pattern on your hand and do the

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:34.490 
kind of pattern on your hand and do the
same<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.900> other<00:00:27.930> side<00:00:33.140> so<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.230> should

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
same on the other side so you should

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.740 
same on the other side so you should
look<00:00:34.739> like<00:00:34.770> that<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.489> then<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:36.390> can<00:00:36.540> just

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
look like that and then you can just

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.830 
look like that and then you can just
collect<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.649> palm<00:00:37.890> strings<00:00:38.660> with<00:00:39.660> your

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
collect the palm strings with your

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:49.190 
collect the palm strings with your
pointer<00:00:40.140> finger<00:00:47.450> now<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:48.510> want<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.050> go

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
pointer finger now you want to go

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.369 
pointer finger now you want to go
underneath<00:00:50.210> both<00:00:51.210> pointer<00:00:51.780> finger<00:00:52.050> strings

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
underneath both pointer finger strings

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.639 
underneath both pointer finger strings
into<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.489> little<00:00:53.730> finger<00:00:54.059> loop<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.649> collect

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
into the little finger loop and collect

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.720 
into the little finger loop and collect
the<00:00:55.860> near<00:00:56.100> little<00:00:56.610> finger<00:00:56.940> string<00:00:58.640> so<00:00:59.640> I'll

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
the near little finger string so I'll

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.029 
the near little finger string so I'll
show<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.000> how<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.300> looks<00:01:00.390> like<00:01:00.600> here<00:01:01.050> go<00:01:01.739> into

show you how it looks like here go into
that<00:01:02.219> little<00:01:02.550> finger<00:01:02.820> loop<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.710> then<00:01:04.710> collect

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
that little finger loop and then collect

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.200 
that little finger loop and then collect
it<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.700> bring<00:01:05.880> it<00:01:05.909> back

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
click the far thumb string by going

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.020 
click the far thumb string by going
underneath<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.390> pointer<00:01:15.750> finger<00:01:16.020> loops<00:01:17.030> will

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
underneath the pointer finger loops will

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.140 
underneath the pointer finger loops will
do<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.420> by<00:01:19.009> using<00:01:20.009> my<00:01:20.280> other<00:01:20.430> hand<00:01:20.759> I'll<00:01:21.000> go

pinch the fire thumb string and put it
on<00:01:26.189> my<00:01:26.520> little<00:01:26.759> finger<00:01:27.740> do<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.920> over<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
on my little finger do that over the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.749 
on my little finger do that over the
other<00:01:29.340> side<00:01:30.680> underneath<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:32.100> pointer<00:01:32.430> finger

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759

other side underneath the pointer finger
loops<00:01:34.310> collect<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.610> far<00:01:35.820> thumb<00:01:36.060> string<00:01:36.619> and

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
loops collect the far thumb string and

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.319 
loops collect the far thumb string and
then<00:01:38.009> put<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.369> onto<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:39.299> little<00:01:39.479> finger<00:01:41.329> now

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
then put it onto the little finger now

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.999 
then put it onto the little finger now
that's<00:01:42.630> pretty<00:01:42.899> much<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.409> star<00:01:43.649> string

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
that's pretty much the star string

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.539 
that's pretty much the star string
figure<00:01:44.280> done<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:45.439> to<00:01:46.439> make<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.799> star<00:01:47.070> twinkle

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549

we need to do is wobble your hands
around<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.310> little<00:01:50.430> bit<00:01:50.670> until<00:01:51.590> your<00:01:52.790> pointer

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
around a little bit until your pointer

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.990 
around a little bit until your pointer
finger<00:01:54.149> loops<00:01:54.659> become<00:01:55.110> small<00:01:55.560> and<00:01:55.820> then<00:01:56.820> to

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
finger loops become small and then to

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.670 
finger loops become small and then to
reveal<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.540> star<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:58.020> can<00:01:58.200> pull<00:01:58.500> your

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
reveal the star you can pull your

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.840 
reveal the star you can pull your
pointer<00:01:59.009> fingers<00:01:59.310> outwards<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:01.369> just<00:02:02.369> repeat

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
pointer fingers outwards and just repeat

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.580 
pointer fingers outwards and just repeat
to<00:02:03.570> make

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
to make
