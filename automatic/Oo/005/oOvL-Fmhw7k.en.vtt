00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 kick the game start the game on the map 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.970
 belcher lead j decorated 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.040
 wonderful Komi planets logos 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.259
 our league 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.190
 should lead j the game starts right 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.260
 now and right below the yellow jar has appeared 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.029
 quantic teams whose logo to see 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.430
 right in the middle mineral lines 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.230
 reigning champion ritmiks Russell and 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.920
 the man who won already 2 with this in 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.040
 this match 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:33.989
 this is a clan tag and it plays against blue 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.640
 blue zerg yes we have red blue 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.059
 up red right bottom blue 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.640
 respectively on the top left and for those 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.110
 who don't know this guy call u in 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.719
 country of a sort of 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.149
 he is captain of european 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.210
 team and now his task is 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.210
 beat the youngest task to perform 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.590
 not easy here's a quick voice command 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.160
 here he is red-eyed 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.550
 wolf on quantic, then they have 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.900
 this can be the most aesthetic 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:10.670
 logo but then we have what we have 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:13.260
 look I like it a lot and so 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.570
 what will we have going on in this behind 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:20.270
 vase for starters we note that no one 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:23.490
 goes to pool 10 is already quite important 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.140
 Young, too, sort of like Drome yes yes ooh and on 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.810
 drone cultivars hadrons then all 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.650
 standard no earlier aggression with 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.460
 from the side of the hyun and not from the sort of a in 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:39.600
 Generally I do not know I do not know what will happen next 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.470
 how this game will develop but not 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.110
 it is possible that we will please please 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.090
 macro game of their varieties young and apparently so far 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.009
 I want 15 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.430
 and because I'm different it is strange that not 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.500
 afraid to do it players okay young 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.270
 probably guesses that varieties are not 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.369
 will play 10 full sort of the 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.729
 who saw the two start sets 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:05.159
 who in general knows what style 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.299
 sometimes plays for vases and he i think he could 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.509
 would be afraid 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:11.489
 what's going on okay okay in any 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.590
 case on this map by the way from the point 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.660
 view of hours let's go like this 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.450
 height look very important to connect 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.239
 creeps here this section between 1 and 2 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.190
 locations this one needs to connect creeps 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.530
 so that the queens have time to come 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.290
 to the ramp and fight back because as you can see 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.040
 if the attack comes from somewhere 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.290
 from here 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.480
 as a rule it happens like this 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.349
 go opponent's troops and here they come 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.390
 on natural 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.069
 but naturally it is possible to assume that 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.840
 somehow beat back here there is a queen even 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.879
 probably posture in slaves because 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.400
 put the wall here in this passage in 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.230
 principle can be but quite difficult and 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.269
 it takes a lot of time if so 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.370
 some earlier for example just super they 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.890
 and speed link of the extremely important to close 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.720
 with queens ramp here this tramp here 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.329
 this rise on the highground respectively 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.849
 it is imperative that the queen have time to go there 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:03.120
 come up and the queens as you know it 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.459
 units that are being built are under construction 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.920
 how much they are walking very slowly 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.079
 outside the creep and therefore which may be 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.599
 problems in order to come from here 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.760
 or here from here just for that 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.470
 to close it may be it for nothing 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.120
 with all of this we argue because 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.639
 what is not yet clear whether the network 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.889
 sides attack off varieties and right now 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:24.600
 should go to him in lingam here in this 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.639
 the pool literally just been 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.010
 ordered just plays at speed 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.739
 dogs on the ear went to home bailin where 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.359
 speed to the dogs he has before and 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.150
 theoretically just aggression is quite 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:38.160
 possible and that Iâ€™m warming you 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.709
 so much told that is it 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.030
 can be for example about stalin cobain and 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.239
 some bay wing bast 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.489
 maybe something else like that sort 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.440
 already beginning to prepare for the way 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:52.169
 a similar scenario with 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.180
 nko and bailen nests have already been delivered 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:56.000
 I usually had to stay like that 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.049
 way to close at least part 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.459
 space between wanna 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:05.190
 and more precisely possible as between sleds and 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.530
 possible place to attack 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.090
 ling here were of course a little bit of us 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.709
 will help that is, the ling is not completely 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.400
 be able to surround the female right here between 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.870
 the buildings have no passage but to be honest too 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.090
 quite controversial option in my opinion 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.500
 wall installation could somehow 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.650
 already here goes 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.690
 close because creep crawled already 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.159
 ran the first honda dogs from him 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.840
 just aggression is expected here 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:31.229
 look how much linda is built in 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.390
 both on the lane and on naturally dogs were 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.520
 they all run out first bane and 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.800
 wrinkles what to make varieties and varieties too 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.050
 Morpher Payne now him important 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.450
 place them yuna it certainly doesn't 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.219
 so simple but quite possible the problem 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.740
 varieties is that it is not carefully 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:49.260
 watched whether something else is a problem but 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.300
 in short now he is not quite ready 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.030
 to this attack oh how could you 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.669
 blow up all these lingvo like them all 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.219
 it was possible to tear it, but now I'm afraid 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.919
 sort of a oh like he has huge here 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:03.930
 problems bane and blow slaves left 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.200
 a bunch of red arabica we make sorts 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:10.500
 now just just lose 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:12.390
 lose because it is not clear 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:14.430
 how do we fight back he is serious 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.099
 the kitchen came to the truth further already 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.530
 send slaves that is he is not very serious 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:21.330
 now invested in this attack here we are 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.580
 just running with peels and at home like 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:28.409
 see working worker working worker and 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:30.120
 right now 39 for 1941 for 19 

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:32.490
 the use of quantic young so called 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.710
 successful attack of course varieties not 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.630
 he is going to put up with it morpher 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.729
 bins directly crushed lords opponent 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:41.370
 soup at home there is only one 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:44.580
 branding but then morph zu new right there 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:48.360
 two more females are put in and in this way 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.729
 he understands what the main threat is now 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.560
 from the opponent understands what to expect 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:55.260
 here bane ran very nicely by 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.180
 other warriors are young and what size beat 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.070
 we still have one but one remains 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.530
 his hyung and therefore the exchange is completely 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.990
 equal and right there grades writes digi 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.900
 the score thus becomes 30 in 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.849
 team favor korea and this of course 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.279
 very very very sad 

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:12.060
 the accent is so that sis games by the way can 

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:16.620
 in 10 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:19.169
 just press 30 completely 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:22.110
 it is not clear what to do next to the team 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:26.360
 Europe because it actually does 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:29.550
 alkyl and we just have to wait 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:32.039
 the moment when the millennium appears on the field 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.740
 fist anyone else and when exactly it 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:35.729
 will try to beat Ace and the leader 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.499
 opponent's teams 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:40.020
 team kew on in order to save 

00:06:37.499 --> 00:06:41.669
 the honor of the European national team is small 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.879
 commercial break after which we again 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:43.879
 will be back
