00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.330
 Hi, I'm going to show you how to configure 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.790
 Any TV adapter with signal 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.460
 digital they have for pc or for their 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.519
 computer so they can use it with 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.329
 the windows center center that has the 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:22.769
 tv tuner option in this 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:25.970
 case we're not going to start windows all 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:29.759
 the programs and we will find 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:34.010
 windows media center that is installed 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:38.250
 by default in most versions 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:42.359
 windows professionals or windows 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.640
 cb and other versions in this case I 

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:49.140
 I have here in windows seven 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.140
 the lake click to start 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.170
 Y 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.800
 then I go to the part where it 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.750
 configure 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.970
 what is 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.970
 in the bottom or look for it 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.820
 this configuration the mobility 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:21.100
 let's go to tv 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.100
 tv signal 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:29.530
 set tdt signal 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:33.100
 we give it without continuing 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.549
 in this case I want to pause and 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:40.930
 I'm going to remove that by configuring the region 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:42.640
 we do not have to consider the country where 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.880
 we're 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.590
 and if at the time of continuing with the area 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:52.090
 sneaks up does not catch us to any channel 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.190
 then we would have to find out in 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.790
 our country with what region 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:03.520
 works with which region or with which country it is 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:07.170
 compatible digital signal channels 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.899
 of our country in this case 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.670
 I'm going to catch 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.099
 here 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.490
 I want to manually select the 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.490
 region 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.620
 then as you do not want to be from a region 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.520
 different to select and if already 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.520
 figure that the region because I already wish 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.080
 work I put you without anything else 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.080
 I'm going to select the eyes and 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:40.640

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.640

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.760

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:55.439
 in this I digit the following 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:59.579
 We will be next to download 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:03:13.250
 an internet configuration does not delay 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:13.250
 much I give it then antenna next 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:25.970

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.500
 digital signal channels that are 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.460

 in my area 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.740
 this takes about 15 minutes 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.230
 already began to capture the channels and 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.230

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:16.820
 young girl is catching the tv signals 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.979
 digital remember that this will depend 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.739
 what area or region we had 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.960

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:32.840
 compatible with japan brazil peru and others 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:36.330

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:40.280
 select our own country 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.280
 and has captured on any channel 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:46.660
 in base you will find several 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.660
 channels 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:55.540

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:50.880
 Record

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.670
 video handling that will have to go 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.940
