00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
difficult game on Saturday because as I

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.470 
difficult game on Saturday because as I
said<00:00:29.630> considering<00:00:30.630> very<00:00:30.960> few<00:00:31.260> goals<00:00:32.360> one<00:00:33.360> of

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
said considering very few goals one of

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.139 
said considering very few goals one of
those<00:00:33.630> teams<00:00:34.559> with<00:00:34.950> with<00:00:35.340> most<00:00:35.550> confidence<00:00:36.059> I

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
those teams with with most confidence I

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.010 
those teams with with most confidence I
mean<00:00:36.300> they<00:00:36.450> just<00:00:36.890> recently<00:00:37.890> beat<00:00:39.020> manchester

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
mean they just recently beat manchester

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.580 
mean they just recently beat manchester
united<00:00:40.469> at<00:00:41.309> home<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.840> as<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.870> said<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.320> see<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
united at home and as I said can see the

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.170 
united at home and as I said can see the
very<00:00:43.770> few<00:00:44.040> goals<00:00:44.280> only<00:00:44.520> four<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.059> last

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
very few goals only four in the last

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.080 
very few goals only four in the last
eight<00:00:45.539> league<00:00:46.350> games<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.820> would<00:00:47.969> be

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
eight league games so so it would be

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.360 
eight league games so so it would be
difficult<00:00:48.270> for<00:00:48.750> us<00:00:49.020> there<00:00:49.860> are<00:00:49.920> other<00:00:50.039> teams

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
difficult for us there are other teams

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.650 
difficult for us there are other teams
who<00:00:50.640> were<00:00:51.300> fight<00:00:51.539> for<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.110> mean<00:00:53.660> it

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
who were fight for that I mean it

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.420 
who were fight for that I mean it
wouldn't<00:00:54.930> be<00:00:55.020> logic<00:00:55.469> for<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:55.980> for<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.250> team

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
wouldn't be logic for for for a team

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.500 
wouldn't be logic for for for a team
like<00:00:56.460> like<00:00:56.910> Swansea<00:00:58.309> 222<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.969> play<00:01:00.149> for<00:01:00.210> such

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
like like Swansea 222 to play for such

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.830 
like like Swansea 222 to play for such
places<00:01:02.030> that<00:01:03.030> doesn't<00:01:03.359> mean<00:01:03.510> that<00:01:03.539> we're<00:01:03.809> not

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
places that doesn't mean that we're not

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.580 
places that doesn't mean that we're not
happy<00:01:04.199> being<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.240> good<00:01:06.240> point<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.840> table

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
happy being a good point of the table

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.570 
happy being a good point of the table
but<00:01:07.830> again<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.100> have<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.490> repeat<00:01:08.820> myself<00:01:10.040> I<00:01:11.040> look

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580

but again I have to repeat myself I look
at<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.790> points<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.330> obviously<00:01:12.780> I'm<00:01:12.990> very

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.179 
at the points and obviously I'm very
pleased<00:01:14.100> with<00:01:14.220> what<00:01:14.430> we<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.729> until<00:01:14.970> now<00:01:16.189> but

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
right now it's it's not so important I

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.600 
right now it's it's not so important I

23 to go and and it's it's still tight I
mean<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:32.400> looked<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.030> couple<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.390> weeks<00:01:33.570> ago<00:01:33.689> and

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
mean I looked a couple of weeks ago and

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.760 
mean I looked a couple of weeks ago and
you<00:01:34.680> say<00:01:34.890> yeah<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.880> position<00:01:36.450> but<00:01:37.259> then<00:01:37.560> when

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
you say yeah the position but then when

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.890 
you say yeah the position but then when
you<00:01:37.799> start<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.250> see<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.820> team<00:01:39.240> below

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
you start to see that the team below

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.050 
you start to see that the team below
what<00:01:40.140> they<00:01:40.290> have<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.530> point<00:01:40.829> or<00:01:41.189> above<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.909> this

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
what they have a point or above in this

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.080 
what they have a point or above in this
case<00:01:42.619> yeah<00:01:43.619> it's<00:01:43.799> it's<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.369> very<00:01:44.549> tight<00:01:44.820> so

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
case yeah it's it's it's very tight so

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.060 
case yeah it's it's it's very tight so
you<00:01:45.149> know<00:01:45.390> in<00:01:45.509> 34<00:01:45.960> games<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.619> can<00:01:46.860> change

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
you know in 34 games it can change

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.330 
you know in 34 games it can change
completely<00:01:47.820> so<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:48.780> think<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:49.770> best<00:01:49.890> for<00:01:50.310> all

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
completely so I think it's best for all

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.170 
completely so I think it's best for all
us<00:01:50.700> just<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:52.009> take<00:01:53.009> one<00:01:53.040> game<00:01:53.430> at<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.850> time<00:01:53.939> and

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
us just to take one game at a time and

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.670 
us just to take one game at a time and
look<00:01:54.540> at<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.020> point<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.470> have<00:01:55.969> then<00:01:57.530> when<00:01:58.530> we

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
look at the point we have then when we

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.969 
look at the point we have then when we
arrived<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.219> march<00:02:00.149> april<00:02:00.630> then<00:02:01.320> we<00:02:01.530> can<00:02:01.710> start

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
arrived to march april then we can start

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.560 
arrived to march april then we can start
to<00:02:02.299> maybe<00:02:03.299> if<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.290> if<00:02:05.009> what<00:02:05.430> if<00:02:05.579> now<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.060> could

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
to maybe if and if what if now we could

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.479 
to maybe if and if what if now we could
win<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.020> they<00:02:07.439> could<00:02:07.770> lose<00:02:07.799> what<00:02:08.280> then

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
win this and they could lose what then

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.009 
win this and they could lose what then
in<00:02:08.810> in<00:02:09.810> december<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.470> can't<00:02:10.709> do<00:02:10.860> that
