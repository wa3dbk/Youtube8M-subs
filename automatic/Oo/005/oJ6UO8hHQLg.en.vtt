and everything so definitely use some

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.590 
and everything so definitely use some
street<00:00:53.039> smarts<00:00:53.070> when<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.670> comes<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.969> spots<00:00:54.270> and

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
street smarts when it comes to spots and

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.959 
street smarts when it comes to spots and
maybe<00:00:55.590> don't<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:56.070> lighting<00:00:56.370> stuff<00:00:56.610> up<00:00:56.820> that's

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
maybe don't be lighting stuff up that's

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.410 
maybe don't be lighting stuff up that's
in<00:00:57.210> maybe<00:00:58.199> not<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.559> best<00:00:58.739> area<00:00:59.000> so<00:01:00.000> filming<00:01:00.329> at

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
in maybe not the best area so filming at

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.450 
in maybe not the best area so filming at
night<00:01:00.449> requires<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.350> lot<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.620> extra<00:01:02.219> equipment

because you can get hit with death of
electricity<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.619> I've<00:01:22.770> had<00:01:22.920> it<00:01:23.040> happen<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.340> me

electricity and I've had it happen to me

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.300 
electricity and I've had it happen to me
and<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:23.939> sucks<00:01:24.290> so<00:01:25.290> this<00:01:25.500> generator<00:01:25.920> here<00:01:26.220> is

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
and it sucks so this generator here is

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.020 
and it sucks so this generator here is
the<00:01:26.490> Honda<00:01:26.750> mm<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.920> probably<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.000> most

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the Honda mm this is probably the most

it's<00:01:57.509> pretty<00:01:57.780> good<00:01:57.930> on<00:01:58.049> gas<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.770> know<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.070> can

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
it's pretty good on gas you know you can

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.469 
it's pretty good on gas you know you can
fill<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.579> up<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.790> it's<00:01:59.909> gonna<00:02:00.030> run<00:02:00.210> for<00:02:00.450> a

this<00:03:12.420> thing<00:03:12.629> is<00:03:12.690> probably<00:03:12.780> at<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.049> ground

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
this thing is probably at the ground

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.559 
this thing is probably at the ground
fifty<00:03:13.620> times<00:03:13.799> and<00:03:14.069> it's<00:03:14.190> still<00:03:14.370> going<00:03:14.760> these

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
fifty times and it's still going these

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.539 
fifty times and it's still going these
lights<00:03:15.780> are<00:03:15.900> great<00:03:16.140> because<00:03:16.379> they<00:03:17.220> put<00:03:17.400> off<00:03:17.519> a

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
lights are great because they put off a

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.190 
lights are great because they put off a
lot<00:03:17.819> of<00:03:17.849> light<00:03:18.000> they're<00:03:18.660> really<00:03:18.959> strong

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
lot of light they're really strong

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.620 
lot of light they're really strong
lights<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:20.250> feel<00:03:20.730> like<00:03:20.849> two<00:03:21.060> of<00:03:21.090> these<00:03:21.299> lights

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
lights I feel like two of these lights

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.659 
lights I feel like two of these lights
alone<00:03:22.019> can<00:03:22.500> light<00:03:22.709> up<00:03:22.739> most<00:03:23.099> skate<00:03:23.340> spots

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
alone can light up most skate spots

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:26.809 
alone can light up most skate spots
pretty<00:03:24.150> well<00:03:24.620> so<00:03:25.620> another<00:03:25.859> light<00:03:26.130> option<00:03:26.639> is

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
pretty well so another light option is

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.539 
pretty well so another light option is
the<00:03:27.239> airy<00:03:27.450> 650<00:03:28.290> this<00:03:28.950> is<00:03:29.069> a<00:03:29.099> pretty<00:03:29.340> popular

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
the airy 650 this is a pretty popular

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.339 
the airy 650 this is a pretty popular
light<00:03:30.000> right<00:03:30.299> now<00:03:30.329> in<00:03:30.540> skateboarding<00:03:30.780> as<00:03:31.169> well

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
light right now in skateboarding as well

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.259 
light right now in skateboarding as well
there's<00:03:32.280> not<00:03:32.430> a<00:03:32.459> big<00:03:32.700> difference<00:03:33.090> between

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
this one though that makes us like

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.470 
this one though that makes us like
pretty<00:03:37.560> cool<00:03:37.769> is<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.760> has<00:03:38.940> this<00:03:39.060> knob<00:03:39.299> on<00:03:39.450> the

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
pretty cool is it has this knob on the

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
and just create either a stronger beam

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.159 
and just create either a stronger beam
of<00:03:46.290> light<00:03:46.410> or<00:03:46.889> you<00:03:47.370> can<00:03:47.549> mellow<00:03:48.000> it<00:03:48.180> out<00:03:48.299> with

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
of light or you can mellow it out with

of light or you can mellow it out with
that<00:03:49.349> which<00:03:49.709> is<00:03:49.829> pretty<00:03:49.950> cool<00:03:50.250> so<00:03:50.940> sometimes

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
that which is pretty cool so sometimes

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.330 
that which is pretty cool so sometimes
you<00:03:51.900> know<00:03:52.049> you<00:03:52.500> might<00:03:52.680> not<00:03:52.709> need<00:03:53.040> as<00:03:53.280> much

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340

you know you might not need as much
light<00:03:53.790> or<00:03:53.819> you<00:03:54.060> might<00:03:54.209> need<00:03:54.359> more<00:03:54.540> light<00:03:54.780> in

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
one area and that helps with that so
