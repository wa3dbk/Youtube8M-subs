00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.199 
what I got going at the same time I
bought<00:03:44.669> this

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
bought this

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.979 
bought this
it's<00:03:45.900> a<00:03:45.959> pH<00:03:46.200> controller<00:03:47.359> still<00:03:48.359> plugged<00:03:48.720> in

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
it's a pH controller still plugged in

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.979 
it's a pH controller still plugged in
but<00:03:49.200> it's<00:03:49.319> not<00:03:49.470> hooked<00:03:49.709> up<00:03:50.060> as<00:03:51.060> my<00:03:51.269> pH<00:03:51.630> is<00:03:51.780> right

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
but it's not hooked up as my pH is right

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.830 
but it's not hooked up as my pH is right
now<00:03:52.310> it<00:03:53.310> just<00:03:53.370> it's<00:03:53.760> just<00:03:54.030> an<00:03:54.150> indicator<00:03:54.540> it's

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
now it just it's just an indicator it's

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.740 
now it just it's just an indicator it's
not<00:03:54.989> hooked<00:03:55.290> up<00:03:55.760> to<00:03:56.760> shut<00:03:56.970> it<00:03:57.090> on<00:03:57.209> or<00:03:57.359> off<00:03:57.389> or

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
not hooked up to shut it on or off or

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.960 
not hooked up to shut it on or off or
anything<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.919> it<00:03:59.069> wouldn't<00:03:59.310> matter<00:03:59.489> because

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
anything and it wouldn't matter because

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.449 
anything and it wouldn't matter because
the<00:04:00.569> timer<00:04:00.810> doesn't<00:04:01.230> work<00:04:01.500> on<00:04:01.769> it<00:04:01.980> I<00:04:02.190> mean<00:04:02.310> I

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
the timer doesn't work on it I mean I

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.069 
the timer doesn't work on it I mean I
check<00:04:02.730> it<00:04:02.940> without<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:04.019> timer<00:04:04.290> and<00:04:04.980> uh<00:04:06.079> it

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
check it without the timer and uh it

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:07.909 
check it without the timer and uh it
just<00:04:07.109> stays<00:04:07.470> open

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
just stays open

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.559 
just stays open
it<00:04:08.069> doesn't<00:04:08.370> shut<00:04:08.549> off<00:04:08.579> so<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:09.060> doesn't<00:04:09.180> matter

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
it doesn't shut off so it doesn't matter

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.240 
it doesn't shut off so it doesn't matter
if<00:04:09.630> it's<00:04:09.720> on<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.810> timer<00:04:10.109> or<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.410> pH<00:04:10.769> controller

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
if it's on a timer or a pH controller

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.089 
if it's on a timer or a pH controller
it's<00:04:11.519> just<00:04:11.730> not<00:04:11.940> shutting<00:04:12.239> off<00:04:13.010> don't<00:04:14.010> know
