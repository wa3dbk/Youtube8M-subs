00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.309
 hello everyone we meet today 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.630
 for a short video of unpacking and 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.119
 presentation why is she 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.310
 will be shorter because we are going 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.109
 today we are interested in a carpet 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.769
 mouse 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:29.670
 despite the imposing size of this 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.410
 little box and ben it is a good 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.020
 mousepad 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.250
 so the 6th storm control rx gaming 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.290
 mouse not then obviously it's for 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.210
 the gamers of the mouse mats of 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.640
 this size conduct lives jury 6th 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.530
 storm that will perfectly match 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.440
 if you make a theme cm storm it goes 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.360
 perfectly match the rest if 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.079
 you have a casing cm storm a mouse 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.449
 cm storm 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.670
 so it's a rug that's optimized 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.890
 for precision and control with 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.800
 a back surface that is anti 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.660
 slip and the top and in lycra you 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.360
 can you if you want to test it before 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.670
 to buy in store the touch here so 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.430
 it's lycra and that allows the mouse 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.290
 to slide without any effort and 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.950
 I already use a lycra floor mat 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.180
 and it's really very very nice 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.340
 so I will give you a dimension 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.770
 so that's the model his note is it 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.000
 not the biggest but he's already not 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.780
 wrong so it's 44 cm by 35 cm and it 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.640
 is 5 mm thick 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.100
 so what is still in France 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.200
 is little used with all types of 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.770
 sensors so yielded corner resist 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.390
 resistant to fraying and that 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.380
 I'll see what it looks like 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.899
 because I have a mouse pad 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.869
 corsairs and so we will be able to compare 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.119
 because that's a good thing 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:54.899
 so that's the structure that's 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.630
 anti-slip polyurethane so voila 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.899
 here I am just going here we have some 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.090
 little some stickers that go 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.439
 to close 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:11.340
 this mouse pad and we're going 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:14.000
 can access the mouse pad at 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.880
 god look at the size of this box 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.700
 so here you already have a cardboard that 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.190
 will serve him to make all this rigid 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.430
 is there for a mouse pad 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.769
 massive cooler master i hope we 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.250
 will see with them seven years already a 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:34.200
 black desk but look at this rug 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.430
 beautiful beautiful finish mice 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:41.599
 finish so as says says big 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:45.630
 logo siam storm here control rick 6.6 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:47.630
 superb lycra surface on the back 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.609
 protected by a protective film 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.620
 you have the slip-resistant surface and 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:55.290
 I can not even move my hand on it 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.410
 ac I showed you people there just a 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.239
 little part 1 but it does not move 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.489
 it's impressive 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.519
 this surface I put the film back 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.389
 protection and the mouse pad for 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:11.549
 to be thick he and he's really thick 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:13.650
 they have to make the thickness he has to 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.989
 to make the thickness of a f3 with almost 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.239
 the thickness of a f3 power is 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:20.160
 really a very thick mouse pad 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.010
 in fact why do they do it 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.569
 as big in fact so I'm going to you 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.650
 show that with a mouse all 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.599
 I just showed you why 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.690
 did they make this size 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.510
 there to stay to try in 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.829
 ter in the theme 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.769
 cooler master jay no longer this mouse is 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.090
 in fact if you play with dpi is 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.069
 a little weaker so there by the way its 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.349
 part m 2 with the mouse to make you 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:44.400
 size and carpet actually 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.859
 it will help if you play with 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.829
 weak countries to really do very 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.590
 very big movement with your mouse 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:53.480
 it's really loved to be able to watch me 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.550
 that this mouse 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.090
 it's pretty impressive 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:00.260
 for anti-fraying edges this is 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.060
 very very well done you can see 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.370
 that in fact no corners are are 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.879
 rounded very very well done I'm going 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.830
 show because I have a carpet of 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:11.239
 corsair mice and can see what that 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.890
 done after a while it's 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:19.340
 that the corners the fabric gets up a little 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.959
 and it's a little less pretty and you 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:24.979
 will not have this problem there with this carpet 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:26.060
 excellent manufacturing quality 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.949
 which I think we will have done in 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.600
 after that I do not have much else 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:33.970
 to say can see play sublime surface 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.440
 slip 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.020
 unlike what is done here I 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.810
 you 're just comparing that with 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.270
 the non-slip surface of a carpet of 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:46.669
 corsair mouse there it's just a species 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.310
 of plastic anti reports there it's 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.470
 really there it's limited it sticks to 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.240
 your office 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.500
 so that's it for this 6th mouse pad 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.510
 storm control rick thank you
