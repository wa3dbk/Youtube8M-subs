00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.190
 Jan Rays 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.690
 That the charcoal is today 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.000
 Got a museum 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:17.930
 I think that I want to go against 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:20.610
 Hyun Well the Tteyuu is Jar Jar's say chairs in the non-key money Hyun 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:24.200
 Ann to say whether the break dance school 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.200
 Because it is the first thing to learn 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.940
 Remember 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.900
 road 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.090
 As a goal 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.610
 Come on 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.610
 Make your dominant hand mature and have a TV 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.030
 If you know I think it is just right I will not explain that month 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.250
 First of all 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.290
 The hand to go 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.710
 As much as possible my navel 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.370
 Closer to the people 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.590
 Voice straight with your body straight 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.860
 vertical 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.580
 I 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.580
 Make a came 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.559
 Lie down on the ground 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.900
 Oyado etc 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.359
 The same 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.220
 Soft 

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:11.170
 Put on the ground 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.690
 5 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.710
 It is already one of the 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.310
 Take the balance 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.990
 Well that I can not but 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.479
 Please keep 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.479
 Next time I will try a chair 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.690
 Well this is a chair 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.290
 When 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.290
 Initially 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.680
 It will be easy to explain if there is another person who can list it, but keep your legs open 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.670
 In such Fu 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.670
 I think it is easier to give 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.590
 Let's go 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.320
 Look at the frog and my brother's onset doesn't mean to open it 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.260
 People who are used to 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.610
 Same skin as 2 axes 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.820
 Here 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.850
 Let alone come to enter the lower side 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.250
 The opposite talks 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.150
 behind 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.200
 It looks good if you cross it 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.200
 Easy to balance 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.200
 It is this way 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.030
 Oh dear 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.050
 road 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.910
 People say Toka Harcourt is 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.980
 The left and right muscles are as good as possible 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.980
 It would be a good person who went around that same 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.810
 Even axis 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.400
 Dare 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.400
 I think it would be better to share 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:52.610
 This eh 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.610
