a ziploc bag and continue to freeze the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.689 
a ziploc bag and continue to freeze the
reason<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.050> want<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.410> use<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:56.160> plate<00:00:56.460> is

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
reason that you want to use the plate is

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.389 
reason that you want to use the plate is
because<00:00:57.210> if<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.750> do<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.859> won't<00:00:59.129> get

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
because if you do that you won't get

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.459 
because if you do that you won't get
clumped<00:00:59.910> up<00:01:00.030> or<00:01:00.239> stuck<00:01:00.539> together<00:01:00.899> pieces<00:01:01.199> of

frozen fruit when you transfer it to the

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.750 
frozen fruit when you transfer it to the
ziplock<00:01:03.660> bag<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.320> I've<00:01:04.530> gone<00:01:04.739> ahead<00:01:04.799> and<00:01:05.100> have

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760
