further<00:01:08.520> than<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:08.970> k10<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:11.159> fmg9<00:01:11.520> does

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
further than the k10 so the fmg9 does

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.320 
further than the k10 so the fmg9 does
the<00:01:12.000> maximum<00:01:12.390> damage<00:01:12.570> where<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.619> k10<00:01:13.950> can't

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
the maximum damage where the k10 can't

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.690 
the maximum damage where the k10 can't
at<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.479> distance<00:01:15.689> number<00:01:16.560> two<00:01:16.740> magazine<00:01:17.610> is

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
at that distance number two magazine is

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.030 
at that distance number two magazine is
much<00:01:17.880> larger<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.720> effing<00:01:18.990> v9<00:01:19.229> s-7<00:01:19.350> bullets

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
much larger the effing v9 s-7 bullets

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.550 
much larger the effing v9 s-7 bullets
more<00:01:21.000> than<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.299> k10<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.170> can<00:01:22.290> make<00:01:22.409> all

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
more than the k10 and that can make all

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.399 
more than the k10 and that can make all
the<00:01:22.590> difference<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:23.340> a<00:01:23.400> gunfight<00:01:24.170> so<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.229> know

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
the difference in a gunfight so you know

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.080 
the difference in a gunfight so you know
seven<00:01:25.979> extra<00:01:26.220> bolt<00:01:26.400> that's<00:01:26.580> good<00:01:26.759> more

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
seven extra bolt that's good more

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.249 
seven extra bolt that's good more
killing<00:01:27.479> right<00:01:27.740> now<00:01:28.740> number<00:01:28.950> three<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:30.840> fmg9

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
killing right now number three the fmg9

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.200 
killing right now number three the fmg9
has<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> slightly<00:01:32.159> higher<00:01:32.310> maximum<00:01:32.700> distance

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
has a slightly higher maximum distance

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.660 
has a slightly higher maximum distance
meaning<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.689> fmg9<00:01:34.250> basically<00:01:35.250> has<00:01:35.430> more

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
meaning the fmg9 basically has more

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.240 
meaning the fmg9 basically has more
range<00:01:36.049> like<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.500> know<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.070> shoot<00:01:38.189> your

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
range like you know you can shoot your

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.760 
range like you know you can shoot your
bolts<00:01:38.579> further<00:01:38.790> hit<00:01:39.299> people<00:01:39.630> further<00:01:39.780> better

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
bolts further hit people further better

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.359 
bolts further hit people further better
range<00:01:41.520> ok<00:01:42.240> 10<00:01:42.420> not<00:01:42.600> as<00:01:42.899> much<00:01:43.229> still<00:01:43.710> PDW<00:01:44.220> but

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
range ok 10 not as much still PDW but

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.639 
range ok 10 not as much still PDW but
still<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:45.840> fmg9<00:01:46.110> also<00:01:46.799> has<00:01:47.009> less<00:01:47.579> recoil<00:01:47.820> now

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
still the fmg9 also has less recoil now

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.109 
still the fmg9 also has less recoil now
you<00:01:49.649> both<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:49.890> really<00:01:50.340> lovely<00:01:50.729> clothes<00:01:50.909> for

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
you both have really lovely clothes for

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.319 
you both have really lovely clothes for
pd<00:01:51.360> w's<00:01:51.720> 11<00:01:52.439> e9<00:01:52.680> has<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> bit<00:01:53.220> less<00:01:53.399> recoil<00:01:53.670> so

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
pd w's 11 e9 has a bit less recoil so

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.760 
pd w's 11 e9 has a bit less recoil so
you<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.689> pick<00:01:54.869> up<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.110> play<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.380> every<00:01:55.590> cool
