legs making sure that the holes line up

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.469 
legs making sure that the holes line up
so<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.340> can<00:01:53.460> put<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.670> hardware<00:01:54.060> in<00:01:54.210> there<00:01:54.360> and

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
so you can put the hardware in there and

two<00:02:48.970> inches<00:02:49.300> so<00:02:49.360> what<00:02:49.690> I'm<00:02:49.810> going<00:02:49.960> to<00:02:50.020> do<00:02:50.230> is

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
two inches so what I'm going to do is

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.540 
two inches so what I'm going to do is
take<00:02:51.610> this<00:02:51.790> tape<00:02:52.060> measure<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:53.370> Mark<00:02:54.370> two

take this tape measure and Mark two

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.970 
take this tape measure and Mark two
inches<00:02:54.880> about<00:02:55.180> right<00:02:56.050> here<00:02:56.350> from<00:02:56.890> the

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
inches about right here from the

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.070 
inches about right here from the
furthest<00:02:57.340> point<00:02:57.370> do<00:02:58.210> the<00:02:58.330> same<00:02:58.570> thing<00:02:58.840> from

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
furthest point do the same thing from

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.160 
furthest point do the same thing from
this<00:02:59.260> end<00:03:00.060> mark<00:03:01.060> two<00:03:01.300> inches<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:01.810> that<00:03:01.930> kind

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
this end mark two inches and that kind

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.460 
this end mark two inches and that kind
of<00:03:02.230> forms<00:03:02.590> a<00:03:02.710> little<00:03:03.420> square<00:03:04.420> triangle<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.140> if

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
of forms a little square triangle so if

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.850 
of forms a little square triangle so if
I<00:03:05.920> mount<00:03:06.220> my<00:03:07.090> front<00:03:07.420> foot<00:03:07.510> anywhere<00:03:08.380> in<00:03:08.560> here

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
I mount my front foot anywhere in here

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.460 
I mount my front foot anywhere in here
that's<00:03:09.430> going<00:03:09.610> to<00:03:09.670> be<00:03:09.760> good<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.270> what<00:03:11.080> I'll<00:03:11.200> do

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
that's going to be good and what I'll do

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.650 
that's going to be good and what I'll do
is<00:03:11.770> take<00:03:12.010> this<00:03:12.490> angled<00:03:12.820> mount<00:03:13.030> make<00:03:13.360> sure<00:03:13.510> it's

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
is take this angled mount make sure it's

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.260 
is take this angled mount make sure it's
facing<00:03:13.840> in<00:03:14.430> get<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.580> in<00:03:15.670> there<00:03:15.850> somewhere<00:03:16.120> and

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
facing in get it in there somewhere and

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.960 
facing in get it in there somewhere and
just<00:03:16.540> mount<00:03:16.780> my<00:03:16.960> front<00:03:17.260> screw<00:03:17.620> get<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.520> H<00:03:18.700> bar

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
just mount my front screw get the H bar

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.580 
just mount my front screw get the H bar
on<00:03:19.120> there<00:03:19.300> and<00:03:19.420> then<00:03:19.540> adjust<00:03:20.200> it<00:03:20.350> from<00:03:20.500> there

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
on there and then adjust it from there

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:33.420 
on there and then adjust it from there
so<00:03:21.190> that's<00:03:21.340> what<00:03:21.489> we'll<00:03:21.610> do<00:03:21.760> next

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.610 

I'll<00:03:34.430> slip<00:03:34.700> my<00:03:34.880> two<00:03:35.080> washers<00:03:36.080> which<00:03:36.290> will<00:03:36.470> act

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
I'll slip my two washers which will act

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.890 
I'll slip my two washers which will act
like<00:03:36.680> spacers<00:03:38.470> onto<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.590> bolt<00:03:40.720> put<00:03:41.720> it<00:03:41.810> in

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
like spacers onto the bolt put it in

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.150 
like spacers onto the bolt put it in
through<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:42.230> mount<00:03:42.410> you<00:03:42.500> can<00:03:42.709> see<00:03:42.890> how<00:03:42.980> it's

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
through the mount you can see how it's

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.520 
through the mount you can see how it's
kind<00:03:43.340> of<00:03:43.400> sitting<00:03:43.970> up<00:03:44.090> like<00:03:44.270> that<00:03:44.540> that'll

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
kind of sitting up like that that'll

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.280 
kind of sitting up like that that'll
tighten<00:03:45.740> down<00:03:46.010> even<00:03:46.340> more<00:03:46.370> once<00:03:46.790> I<00:03:47.200> once<00:03:48.200> I

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
tighten down even more once I once I

00:03:48.290 --> 00:04:02.080 
tighten down even more once I once I
bolt<00:03:48.530> it<00:03:48.680> in<00:03:59.470> take<00:04:00.470> my<00:04:00.650> two<00:04:00.709> washers<00:04:01.370> which

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
bolt it in take my two washers which

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.100 
bolt it in take my two washers which
will<00:04:02.270> act<00:04:02.420> like<00:04:02.540> spacers<00:04:04.330> one<00:04:05.950> to<00:04:07.900> make<00:04:08.900> sure

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
will act like spacers one to make sure

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.280 
will act like spacers one to make sure
this<00:04:09.320> piece<00:04:09.620> is<00:04:09.800> facing<00:04:10.190> inwards<00:04:10.870> and<00:04:11.870> see<00:04:12.230> how

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
this piece is facing inwards and see how

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.920 
this piece is facing inwards and see how
they're<00:04:12.500> actually<00:04:13.010> spacing<00:04:13.459> it<00:04:13.580> out<00:04:13.780> get<00:04:14.780> in

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
they're actually spacing it out get in

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.310 
they're actually spacing it out get in
