of a future had me Russell some people
will<00:01:49.020> wonder<00:01:49.259> why<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.590> British<00:01:50.189> Legion<00:01:50.549> is

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
will wonder why the British Legion is

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.149 
will wonder why the British Legion is
having<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.600> help<00:01:51.810> people<00:01:52.470> like<00:01:52.590> Freddie<00:01:52.920> when

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
having to help people like Freddie when

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.310 
having to help people like Freddie when
when<00:01:53.700> they'd<00:01:54.450> say<00:01:54.659> it<00:01:54.869> isn't<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
when they'd say it isn't it the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.690 
when they'd say it isn't it the
responsibility<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.130> state<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
responsibility of the state and the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.090 
responsibility of the state and the
Ministry<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.180> Defence<00:01:57.630> well<00:01:58.500> indeed<00:01:58.740> but<00:01:58.920> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
Ministry of Defence well indeed but the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.950 
Ministry of Defence well indeed but the
the<00:01:59.369> reason<00:01:59.520> basically<00:02:00.180> i<00:02:00.210> think<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.630> safety

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the reason basically i think is a safety

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.889 
the reason basically i think is a safety
net<00:02:01.290> for<00:02:01.649> people<00:02:02.070> like<00:02:02.430> Craig<00:02:02.909> coming<00:02:03.570> bike

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
net for people like Craig coming bike

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.410 
net for people like Craig coming bike
we're<00:02:04.829> there<00:02:05.070> for<00:02:05.100> people<00:02:05.460> who<00:02:05.729> were<00:02:05.969> injured

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
we're there for people who were injured

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.910 
we're there for people who were injured
during<00:02:06.630> service<00:02:07.320> and<00:02:07.469> that's<00:02:07.619> what<00:02:07.770> we've

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
during service and that's what we've

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.639 
during service and that's what we've
been<00:02:07.950> since<00:02:08.340> nineteen<00:02:08.759> twenty-one<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.840> we

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
been since nineteen twenty-one so we

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.110 
been since nineteen twenty-one so we
basically<00:02:10.830> can't<00:02:11.340> cope<00:02:11.670> with<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.940> major

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120
