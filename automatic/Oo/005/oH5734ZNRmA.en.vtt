00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
at any particular moment in that level

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.229 
at any particular moment in that level
including<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.410> time<00:00:52.620> multiplier<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:54.120> you're

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
including the time multiplier so you're

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.180 
including the time multiplier so you're
gonna<00:00:54.360> want<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.629> have<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.020> so<00:00:55.500> you<00:00:55.559> can

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
gonna want to have that on so you can

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.549 
gonna want to have that on so you can
see<00:00:56.430> if<00:00:56.610> you're<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.840> far<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> level<00:00:58.469> and

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
see if you're so far in the level and

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.779 
see if you're so far in the level and
you're<00:00:58.710> not<00:00:58.859> even<00:00:58.920> close<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.280> getting<00:00:59.430> par

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
you're not even close to getting par

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.130 
you're not even close to getting par
score<00:00:59.910> which<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.300> believe<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.660> like<00:01:00.809> twenty

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
score which I believe is like twenty

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.799 
score which I believe is like twenty
five<00:01:01.170> thousand<00:01:01.739> for<00:01:01.920> every<00:01:02.160> level<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.809> just

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
five thousand for every level you just

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.179 
five thousand for every level you just
restart<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.290> level<00:01:04.530> at<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.680> point<00:01:04.949> so

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
restart the level at that point so

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.560 
restart the level at that point so
that's<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.489> nice<00:01:05.640> little<00:01:05.790> indicator<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
that's a nice little indicator in the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.870 
that's a nice little indicator in the
corner<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:06.960> your<00:01:07.049> screen<00:01:07.110> number<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.310> have<00:01:08.700> at

will<00:02:46.890> go<00:02:46.920> from<00:02:47.160> like<00:02:47.340> two<00:02:47.490> point<00:02:47.730> nine<00:02:47.880> nine

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
will go from like two point nine nine

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.610 
will go from like two point nine nine
down<00:02:48.300> at<00:02:48.480> two<00:02:48.660> point<00:02:48.900> nine<00:02:49.050> eight<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:49.590> on

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
down at two point nine eight and so on

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.790 
down at two point nine eight and so on

until it gets to the base one times this

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.690 
until it gets to the base one times this
doesn't<00:02:53.190> mean<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.340> you're<00:02:53.580> gonna

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
doesn't mean that you're gonna

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.970 
doesn't mean that you're gonna
automatically<00:02:54.240> lose<00:02:54.630> if<00:02:55.080> this<00:02:55.380> starts<00:02:55.740> going

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
automatically lose if this starts going

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.580 
automatically lose if this starts going
down<00:02:56.370> but<00:02:57.090> it's<00:02:57.360> it's<00:02:57.750> nice<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.260> have<00:02:58.440> that

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
down but it's it's nice to have that

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.020 
down but it's it's nice to have that
competitive<00:02:58.890> scoring<00:02:59.340> on<00:02:59.430> because<00:02:59.790> you<00:02:59.880> can

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
competitive scoring on because you can

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.300 
competitive scoring on because you can
see<00:03:00.210> it<00:03:00.300> just<00:03:00.330> start<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.260> drop<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:01.770> it<00:03:02.160> will

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
see it just start to drop and it will

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.490 
see it just start to drop and it will
directly<00:03:02.760> impact<00:03:03.000> your<00:03:03.360> overall<00:03:03.840> score<00:03:04.170> so<00:03:04.410> if

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
directly impact your overall score so if

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.750 
directly impact your overall score so if
you<00:03:04.590> see<00:03:04.800> you're<00:03:04.980> like<00:03:05.010> two-thirds<00:03:05.550> through

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
you see you're like two-thirds through

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.150 
you see you're like two-thirds through
the<00:03:05.850> level<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.360> your<00:03:06.750> time<00:03:07.320> multiplier<00:03:07.770> just

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
the level and your time multiplier just

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.070 
the level and your time multiplier just
starts<00:03:08.460> dropping<00:03:08.820> down<00:03:09.000> and<00:03:09.330> you're<00:03:09.810> still

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
starts dropping down and you're still

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.870 
starts dropping down and you're still
well<00:03:10.260> over<00:03:10.560> twenty<00:03:10.800> five<00:03:10.950> thousand<00:03:11.490> you<00:03:11.700> could

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
well over twenty five thousand you could

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.460 
well over twenty five thousand you could
still<00:03:12.120> complete<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.540> level<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.050> get<00:03:13.170> it<00:03:13.290> but

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
still complete the level and get it but

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.140 
still complete the level and get it but
it's<00:03:13.590> just<00:03:13.650> a<00:03:13.860> nice<00:03:14.040> indicator<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.940> show<00:03:14.970> you

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
it's just a nice indicator to show you

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.390 
it's just a nice indicator to show you
how<00:03:15.480> much<00:03:15.690> that<00:03:16.230> time<00:03:16.530> multiplier<00:03:17.160> is

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
how much that time multiplier is

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.420 
how much that time multiplier is
affecting<00:03:17.880> your<00:03:17.970> overall<00:03:18.450> score<00:03:19.190> number<00:03:20.190> six

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
affecting your overall score number six

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.880 
affecting your overall score number six
