00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
texture is very pretty but I was just

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.290 
texture is very pretty but I was just
kind<00:02:47.500> of<00:02:47.590> nervous<00:02:47.830> a<00:02:48.190> little<00:02:48.340> bit<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:48.970> I<00:02:49.210> was

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
kind of nervous a little bit and I was

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.050 
kind of nervous a little bit and I was
very<00:02:49.540> surprised<00:02:50.020> to<00:02:50.170> see<00:02:50.260> how<00:02:50.590> how<00:02:51.400> tough<00:02:51.820> and

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
very surprised to see how how tough and

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.690 
very surprised to see how how tough and
how<00:02:52.180> thick<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.660> was<00:02:52.810> kind<00:02:53.200> of<00:02:53.380> getting<00:02:53.740> but<00:02:54.670> I

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
how thick it was kind of getting but I

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.460 
how thick it was kind of getting but I
was<00:02:54.940> happy<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.330> know<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:55.930> I<00:02:55.959> was<00:02:56.170> able<00:02:56.320> to

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
was happy to know that I was able to

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.860 
was happy to know that I was able to
bring<00:02:56.740> it<00:02:56.920> back<00:02:56.950> down<00:02:57.100> around<00:02:57.790> like<00:02:58.209> this<00:02:58.510> part

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
bring it back down around like this part

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.810 
bring it back down around like this part
right<00:02:59.020> here<00:02:59.380> is<00:02:59.440> where<00:02:59.800> it<00:03:00.010> did<00:03:00.190> not<00:03:00.370> return

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
right here is where it did not return

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.880 
right here is where it did not return
its<00:03:01.090> curl<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.810> it's<00:03:02.740> just<00:03:03.100> really<00:03:03.520> dry<00:03:03.910> on<00:03:04.890> on

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
its curl and it's just really dry on on

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.910 
its curl and it's just really dry on on
the<00:03:06.100> end<00:03:06.340> so<00:03:06.760> most<00:03:07.060> likely<00:03:07.720> I<00:03:07.750> may<00:03:08.260> be<00:03:08.320> cutting

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
the end so most likely I may be cutting

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.010 
the end so most likely I may be cutting
this<00:03:09.070> hair<00:03:09.459> I<00:03:09.700> don't<00:03:10.120> want<00:03:10.480> to<00:03:10.540> cut<00:03:10.690> it<00:03:10.810> too

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.449 
this hair I don't want to cut it too
short<00:03:11.050> but<00:03:11.470> I'm<00:03:11.590> definitely<00:03:11.800> gonna<00:03:12.040> cut<00:03:12.340> it

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
short but I'm definitely gonna cut it

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.040 
short but I'm definitely gonna cut it
where<00:03:12.640> I<00:03:12.670> don't<00:03:13.030> really<00:03:13.270> see<00:03:13.540> any<00:03:13.750> need<00:03:13.990> for

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050

natural this hair is really fine at the
closure<00:04:58.460> area<00:04:59.409> it's<00:05:00.409> just<00:05:00.650> really<00:05:00.860> straight

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:01.550 
closure area it's just really straight

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:03.790
