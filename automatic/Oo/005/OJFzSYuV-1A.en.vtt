 it's good, gentlemen, you 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.090
 what is it that influences here we have the 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.990
 two sides both in the front and 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.990
 the back 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.630
 and here we are going to have a LED stick of the 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.150
 company is lic 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.740
 dotcom brooks we have the term with 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.090
 which I have to clean the screen and 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.510
 the back to be able to place it 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:31.000
 and this to be able to take out the bubbles 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.610
 then we will bring the ipad that 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.020
 let's start with the front that 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.299
 expensive 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.750
 I'm going to do it this way so that 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:42.460
 it's easier for me to be able to place it 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.469
 we have to clean here we have the cloth 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.390
 that the company has included us for 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:51.380
 can clean the edges can be 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.790
 an expert me 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.960
 placing this kind of thing 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.960
 let's remove it 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.740
 it's not that it's carbon fiber 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.430
 but it has the fiber type design of 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.229
 carbon we are going to 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.229
 it's a bit difficult for me 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.350
 and that's it, so here I have it 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.310
 in the front that you can 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.650
 watch 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.260
 and in footwear although it has cost me a 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.260
 little but they can see what 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.480
 and now what we are going to do is the 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.740
 installation on the back and 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.120
 we can enter the button without any 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.549
 problem 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.980
 and the camera we can see that there too 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:03.060
 she is very tired 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:06.000
 we go with the back 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.800
 for the back we're going to do it 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.910
 differently I think I'm going to do it 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.910
 in this way 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.570
 at the beginning 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.930
 you have to cut well in the microphone and 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.930
 the camera 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.439
 there he is holding 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.730
 that is, as it would be in the part 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:48.569
 later I have a few minutes to return 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.430
 in the seconds 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.659
 we just used the dryer for 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.459
 a few seconds and you can see from 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.560
 that hot air has helped it 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:58.170
 adhere as it should be there is no 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.999
 no unprotected or raised area 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.189
 that is not well stuck all has been 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:05.099
 perfectly and that's what they indicate 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:06.780
 on the web page there is now an advantage 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:08.280
 with regard to this type of products and 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.170
 is the fact that in case you 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.730
 They want to replace it with another skin 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.069
 they can simply withdraw it and not leave 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.949
 no glue residue on the part 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:19.579
