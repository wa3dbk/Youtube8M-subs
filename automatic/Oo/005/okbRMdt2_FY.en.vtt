today I want to show you a double brick

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.190 
today I want to show you a double brick
construction<00:00:11.240> building<00:00:12.240> without<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:12.750> timber

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
construction building without a timber

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.310 
construction building without a timber
for<00:00:13.440> so<00:00:14.540> as<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.750> can<00:00:15.809> see<00:00:15.870> we're<00:00:16.139> starting

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
for so as you can see we're starting

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.810 
for so as you can see we're starting
starting<00:00:17.099> out<00:00:17.220> very<00:00:17.460> similar<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.419> the<00:00:18.990> other

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
starting out very similar to the other

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.910 
starting out very similar to the other
videos<00:00:20.820> that<00:00:20.850> have<00:00:21.090> done<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:21.390> these

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
videos that have done on these

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.310 
videos that have done on these
construction<00:00:22.920> methods<00:00:23.570> however<00:00:24.570> for<00:00:25.199> the

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
construction methods however for the

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.620 
construction methods however for the
observant<00:00:26.220> among<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.609> you'll<00:00:27.119> notice<00:00:27.480> that

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
observant among you you'll notice that

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.599 
observant among you you'll notice that
this<00:00:27.779> footing<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.710> strip<00:00:29.010> footing<00:00:29.160> here<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.580> a

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
this footing the strip footing here is a

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.509 
this footing the strip footing here is a
lot<00:00:29.820> wider<00:00:30.210> than<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.679> other<00:00:31.830> ones<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.400> that's

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:32.519 
lot wider than the other ones and that's

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:34.789 
lot wider than the other ones and that's
because<00:00:32.850> instead<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.600> just<00:00:33.720> sitting<00:00:34.140> one<00:00:34.350> skin

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:34.799 
because instead of just sitting one skin

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:35.600 
because instead of just sitting one skin
a<00:00:34.860> brick<00:00:35.040> click<00:00:35.190> on<00:00:35.309> it

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
a brick click on it

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.369 
a brick click on it
of<00:00:36.299> course<00:00:36.479> it's<00:00:36.629> double<00:00:36.989> brick<00:00:37.170> construction

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
of course it's double brick construction

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.219 
of course it's double brick construction
of<00:00:38.010> now<00:00:38.190> but<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.580> -<00:00:38.909> it's<00:00:39.809> going<00:00:40.019> to<00:00:40.140> be

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:40.229 
of now but it's it - it's going to be

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:41.719 
of now but it's it - it's going to be
quick<00:00:40.409> on<00:00:40.620> that<00:00:40.650> footing<00:00:41.159> so<00:00:41.280> that's<00:00:41.460> a<00:00:41.580> little

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:41.729 
quick on that footing so that's a little

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:43.820 
quick on that footing so that's a little
bit<00:00:41.850> wider<00:00:42.089> to<00:00:42.269> start<00:00:42.629> with<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:43.409> can

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:43.830 
bit wider to start with so that we can

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.649 
bit wider to start with so that we can
get<00:00:43.949> both<00:00:44.129> skins<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.549> bit<00:00:46.549> of<00:00:47.549> course<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.210> strip

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:48.659 
get both skins a bit of course a strip

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:51.109 
get both skins a bit of course a strip
footing<00:00:48.809> requires<00:00:49.320> reinforcement<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.369> again

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:51.119 
footing requires reinforcement and again

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:53.090 
footing requires reinforcement and again
for<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.510> absorbent<00:00:52.019> you'll<00:00:52.440> notice<00:00:52.769> I've<00:00:52.920> now

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
for the absorbent you'll notice I've now

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.210 
for the absorbent you'll notice I've now
got<00:00:53.280> four<00:00:53.720> bars<00:00:54.720> across<00:00:55.500> here<00:00:55.769> instead<00:00:56.100> of

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:56.220 
got four bars across here instead of

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.060 
got four bars across here instead of
three<00:00:56.670> because<00:00:57.269> of<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.510> extra<00:00:57.839> width<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.559> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
three because of the extra width of the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.590 
three because of the extra width of the
footing<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.640> again<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.089> could<00:01:00.239> be<00:01:00.299> just

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
footing and again that could be just

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.990 
footing and again that could be just
strap<00:01:01.049> plain<00:01:01.290> old<00:01:01.500> bars<00:01:01.739> or<00:01:02.189> it<00:01:02.339> could<00:01:02.549> be<00:01:02.760> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
strap plain old bars or it could be a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.380 
strap plain old bars or it could be a
four<00:01:03.930> bar<00:01:04.080> trench<00:01:04.409> measure<00:01:04.650> that's<00:01:04.890> used

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
four bar trench measure that's used

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.570 
four bar trench measure that's used
again<00:01:06.390> it's<00:01:06.750> spaced<00:01:07.590> off<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.160> side<00:01:08.370> of<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
again it's spaced off the side of the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.260 
again it's spaced off the side of the
trench<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.330> allow<00:01:09.570> for<00:01:10.560> your<00:01:10.980> cover<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.850> it's

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
trench to allow for your cover and it's

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.640 
trench to allow for your cover and it's
sitting<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.600> bar<00:01:12.810> chairs<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.440> I<00:01:13.470> stopped

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
sitting on bar chairs so I stopped

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.820 
sitting on bar chairs so I stopped
touching<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.130> bottom<00:01:14.370> of<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.550> trench<00:01:15.830> and

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
touching the bottom of the trench and

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.890 
touching the bottom of the trench and
once<00:01:17.220> that's<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.610> place<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.120> inspected<00:01:18.690> we

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
once that's in place and inspected we

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.380 
once that's in place and inspected we
can<00:01:19.110> pour<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.620> concrete<00:01:19.800> in<00:01:20.100> there<00:01:20.390> again

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
can pour the concrete in there again

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.540 
can pour the concrete in there again
keeping<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:21.990> below<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.710> ground<00:01:22.950> line<00:01:23.160> so

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
keeping it just below the ground line so

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.210 
keeping it just below the ground line so
I<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:23.790> cover<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.090> up<00:01:24.210> liner<00:01:24.620> and<00:01:25.620> we<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:25.980> pour

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
I can cover it up liner and we can pour

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.610 
I can cover it up liner and we can pour
our<00:01:26.460> blob<00:01:26.790> footing<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.540> spot<00:01:27.900> concrete<00:01:28.470> in

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:28.620 
our blob footing to spot concrete in

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.230 
our blob footing to spot concrete in
there<00:01:30.409> now<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.770> second<00:01:32.130> or<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.460> big<00:01:32.760> biggest

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
there now the second or the big biggest

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.480 
there now the second or the big biggest
change<00:01:33.480> if<00:01:33.690> you<00:01:33.780> like<00:01:33.930> is<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.200> dwarf<00:01:34.890> wall<00:01:35.190> is

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
change if you like is the dwarf wall is

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.600 
change if you like is the dwarf wall is
now<00:01:35.670> our<00:01:35.790> two<00:01:36.060> skins<00:01:36.480> brickwork<00:01:37.460> still<00:01:38.460> has

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
now our two skins brickwork still has

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.649 
now our two skins brickwork still has
our<00:01:38.790> vents<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.390> it

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
our vents in it

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.040 
our vents in it
however<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.650> back<00:01:41.010> skin<00:01:41.720> don't<00:01:42.720> need<00:01:42.870> to<00:01:42.930> put

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
however the back skin don't need to put

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.480 
however the back skin don't need to put
the<00:01:43.140> physical<00:01:43.590> vent<00:01:43.800> in<00:01:43.950> there<00:01:44.100> can<00:01:44.280> just

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
the physical vent in there can just

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.710 
the physical vent in there can just
leave<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.880> open<00:01:46.790> so<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.940> airflow<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.479> pass

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
leave that open so the airflow can pass

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.540 
leave that open so the airflow can pass
through<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:50.900> you'll<00:01:51.900> also<00:01:52.110> notice<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:53.070> in

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
through and you'll also notice that in

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.719 
through and you'll also notice that in
the<00:01:54.180> cavity<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.500> bottom<00:01:55.830> half<00:01:56.070> here<00:01:56.490> we've

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
the cavity the bottom half here we've

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.580 
the cavity the bottom half here we've
actually<00:01:56.909> filled<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.630> with<00:01:57.810> mortar<00:01:58.290> and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
actually filled that in with mortar and

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.490 
actually filled that in with mortar and
we've<00:01:59.250> sloped<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.450> off<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.140> any<00:02:01.290> water

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
we've sloped that off so that any water

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.920 
we've sloped that off so that any water
that<00:02:01.680> does<00:02:01.979> get<00:02:02.220> into<00:02:02.400> this<00:02:02.640> area<00:02:03.030> will<00:02:03.630> run

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
that does get into this area will run

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
have our damp-proof course this one's

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.979 
have our damp-proof course this one's
wide<00:02:35.190> enough<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.760> cover<00:02:35.940> both<00:02:36.560> walls<00:02:38.989> also

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
wide enough to cover both walls also

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.319 
wide enough to cover both walls also
fall<00:02:40.500> out<00:02:40.709> engage<00:02:41.160> pier<00:02:41.489> and<00:02:41.760> our<00:02:41.879> isolated

fall out engage pier and our isolated

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.229 
fall out engage pier and our isolated
pier<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:43.379> we<00:02:43.680> have<00:02:43.829> our<00:02:43.980> end<00:02:44.160> cap<00:02:44.430> as<00:02:44.700> well<00:02:44.940> and

pier and we have our end cap as well and
again<00:02:45.569> this<00:02:45.750> one<00:02:45.959> is<00:02:45.989> wide<00:02:46.349> enough<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:46.920> cover

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
again this one is wide enough to cover

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.140 
again this one is wide enough to cover
both<00:02:48.060> both<00:02:48.959> walls<00:02:50.870> of<00:02:51.870> course<00:02:52.109> our<00:02:52.349> bearer<00:02:53.150> and

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
both both walls of course our bearer and

both both walls of course our bearer and
our<00:02:54.780> joists<00:02:55.079> now<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:55.920> time<00:02:56.220> we<00:02:56.640> don't<00:02:56.819> need<00:02:57.239> a

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
our joists now this time we don't need a

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.349 
our joists now this time we don't need a
double<00:02:57.959> joist<00:02:58.260> on<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.799> outside<00:02:59.159> because<00:02:59.579> the

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
double joist on the outside because the

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.229 
double joist on the outside because the
wall<00:03:00.659> is<00:03:00.690> not<00:03:01.049> sitting<00:03:01.440> on<00:03:01.650> the<00:03:02.099> floor<00:03:02.640> this<00:03:03.180> is

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
wall is not sitting on the floor this is

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.199 
wall is not sitting on the floor this is
just<00:03:03.599> taking<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.409> floor<00:03:04.730> so<00:03:05.730> if<00:03:05.879> you<00:03:05.970> put<00:03:06.180> a

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
just taking the floor so if you put a

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.080 
just taking the floor so if you put a
sheet<00:03:06.269> or<00:03:06.840> platform<00:03:07.409> floor<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:08.700> wall<00:03:08.940> is

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
sheet or platform floor the wall is

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.190 
sheet or platform floor the wall is
actually<00:03:09.209> going<00:03:09.450> to<00:03:09.540> come<00:03:09.659> up<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.810> inside

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
actually going to come up the inside

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.370 
actually going to come up the inside
it'll<00:03:10.500> be<00:03:10.590> brick<00:03:10.890> and<00:03:11.359> we<00:03:12.359> won't<00:03:12.599> need<00:03:12.810> before

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
it'll be brick and we won't need before

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.870 
it'll be brick and we won't need before
to<00:03:13.739> carry<00:03:13.950> any<00:03:14.160> of<00:03:14.220> our<00:03:14.370> wall<00:03:14.579> loads<00:03:14.790> at<00:03:15.000> all<00:03:16.880> on

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
to carry any of our wall loads at all on

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.670 
to carry any of our wall loads at all on
the<00:03:18.120> outside<00:03:18.150> we<00:03:18.840> can<00:03:18.989> start<00:03:19.260> to<00:03:19.380> bring<00:03:19.560> our

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
the outside we can start to bring our

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.789 
the outside we can start to bring our
brickwork<00:03:20.040> up<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.459> as<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:20.880> said<00:03:21.620> we're<00:03:22.620> gonna

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
brickwork up and as I said we're gonna

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.520 
brickwork up and as I said we're gonna
tie<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.760> walls<00:03:24.000> together<00:03:24.329> with<00:03:24.810> these<00:03:25.230> things

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
tie the walls together with these things

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.629 
tie the walls together with these things
is<00:03:26.150> called<00:03:27.150> Moore's<00:03:27.540> ties<00:03:28.250> you<00:03:29.250> can<00:03:29.370> see

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
is called Moore's ties you can see

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.729 
is called Moore's ties you can see
there's<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.060> little<00:03:30.180> divot<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.810> little<00:03:31.349> bend<00:03:31.620> in

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
there's a little divot a little bend in

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.289 
there's a little divot a little bend in
the<00:03:31.859> middle<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.310> that<00:03:32.340> any<00:03:32.609> water<00:03:32.849> wants<00:03:33.209> to

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
the middle so that any water wants to

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.300 
the middle so that any water wants to
cross<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.629> cavity<00:03:33.989> it<00:03:34.680> will<00:03:34.859> get<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.190> that

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
cross the cavity it will get to that

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.689 
cross the cavity it will get to that
little<00:03:35.579> divot<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:35.910> then<00:03:36.150> drop<00:03:36.359> off<00:03:37.489> and<00:03:38.489> then

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:38.699 
little divot and then drop off and then

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:40.400 
little divot and then drop off and then
I'll<00:03:38.819> tie<00:03:39.120> these<00:03:39.180> two<00:03:39.629> courses<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:40.049> brick<00:03:40.260> work

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
I'll tie these two courses a brick work

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.610 
I'll tie these two courses a brick work
together<00:03:40.730> they<00:03:41.730> can<00:03:41.760> also<00:03:42.150> be<00:03:42.480> used<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:43.349> tie

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
together they can also be used to tie

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.640 
together they can also be used to tie
you<00:03:44.400> engage<00:03:44.760> pier<00:03:45.209> back<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:46.079> your<00:03:46.230> main<00:03:46.410> wall

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
you engage pier back to your main wall

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.720 
you engage pier back to your main wall
as<00:03:46.889> well<00:03:47.180> quite<00:03:48.180> often<00:03:48.359> so<00:03:48.870> there<00:03:49.019> are<00:03:49.169> Moore's

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
as well quite often so there are Moore's

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.790 
as well quite often so there are Moore's
tie

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.230 

and<00:03:55.800> then<00:03:55.980> we're<00:03:56.130> going<00:03:56.250> to<00:03:56.310> continue<00:03:56.610> the

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
and then we're going to continue the

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.220 
and then we're going to continue the
brickwork<00:03:57.720> up<00:03:58.820> so<00:03:59.820> that's<00:04:00.000> the<00:04:00.420> first<00:04:00.690> part<00:04:00.960> of

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
brickwork up so that's the first part of

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.300 
brickwork up so that's the first part of
