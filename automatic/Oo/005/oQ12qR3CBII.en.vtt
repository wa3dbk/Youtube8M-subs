00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:03.240
 We speak 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.560
 practically all sports develop into a geometric figure the 

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:10.559
 baseball field 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.369
 if mathematics and we could not even take the third 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.579
 rest time 

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:24.579
 the text has been difficult 

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:29.009
 He expressed his happiness and happy and wants to say yes or yes 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.890
 even the revolt 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.890
 has multiple blocks 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.240
 m 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.990
 are 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.830
 jim joyce abma no 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.200
 it's a mathematical game that two perfect games are played 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.670
 United 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.420
 with three different stars and with many reference points in other 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.420
 words pillage 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.369
 it's not casual you know how to play true urns 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.750
 they will wait 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.750
 I never wanted to move your location 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.810
 now 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.120
 hence the service an expert 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.120
 player of the villarreal 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.290
 we are machines 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.440
 the white ball must not only give to the other bags but must touch the 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.520
 less in three bands before giving the latest fashions 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.950
 d 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.800
 3 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.170
 one all 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:57.229
 borja was expected 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.800
 first 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.800
 besides the treasure 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:13.099
 percent 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.249
 that's why the experts the guilds of the musical magisterium 

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:18.669
 1 2 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:20.599
 3 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.599
 an obsexos miracle 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.889
 carlos cháirez coppel stressed 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:31.979
 the service 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:34.979
 in this game and to know all the angles 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.269
 sorry 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:46.489
 it was not weird 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:52.359
 p 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:53.999
 Ron 

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:55.659
 a bomb 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.659
 for a more rigorous analysis and never 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:04.299
 I'm not a winner 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.389
 first that age 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:08.649
 hit the ball very down 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.649
 so that it goes back 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:19.269
 If you hit the ball on the right the band will be displayed for these shots etc 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:24.109
 the waters 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.109
 world 

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:31.729
 3 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:34.729
 saints has gone to hammerhead 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:38.509
 in this game and that doing very precise calculations 

00:03:39.059 --> 00:03:42.059
 he imagines every blow in his mind 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:43.740
 I could do this 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.019
 but I would need some luck 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.489
 there is an alternative 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.339
 for it launched three years ago as if they were a mathematical aunt 

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:56.799
 first year calculation 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.200
 ive that the white ball 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.409
 according to the against the brand number 3 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:06.320
 then according to the reports ipsca the bread pan opposition highlighted 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.459
 this requires good business 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.699
 solórzano this has been when he catches him set 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:15.489
 the position of this Thursday the current 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.120
 now we make a simple view 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.079
 4-3 that 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.969
 if you pull against the first sleeve it should come out it's called the marking system 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:27.610
 do not 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.550
 Everything tall 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.400
 with the three points 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.860
 taco position 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:39.620
 a video of two and a half minutes 3 three and a half three and a half less possible 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.270
 the medium so you have to throw between the first and second mark 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:46.710
 1st 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.060
 1 the winning Murcian engineer 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.710
 facing the sun 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.449
 we are four 

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:00.900
 both parties 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.830
 quarter 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.550
 not to mention the citizens are just some marcela we do not speak every 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.479
 orlov person 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.039
 jack nicklaus death 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:16.810
 no donald 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.870
 mathematics there are no assumptions is very simple the natural angle of the 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.160
 hit writings 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.040
 a position of the tobacco for itself 1-2 1 

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:32.249
 the new 

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:35.249
 one 

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:40.279
 uu 1 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.099
 likewise the memory 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.099
 giunta 

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:56.019
 we cheated the game for several weeks the most sensible 6 300 people 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:12.800
 port iguazú - marta domínguez each 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.650
 very good to donate 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:19.110
 now you're ready for the most exciting game 2 such a done
