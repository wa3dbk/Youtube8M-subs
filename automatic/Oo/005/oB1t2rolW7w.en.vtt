on one of the many projects we do but
it's<00:01:06.020> very<00:01:06.200> special<00:01:06.530> because<00:01:07.490> of<00:01:08.119> the

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
it's very special because of the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.039 
it's very special because of the
connection<00:01:08.600> with<00:01:08.780> with<00:01:09.080> dance<00:01:10.690> one<00:01:11.690> of<00:01:11.900> the

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
connection with with dance one of the

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.050 
connection with with dance one of the
basic<00:01:12.530> ideas<00:01:12.830> I<00:01:12.950> had<00:01:13.100> about<00:01:13.130> computer<00:01:13.850> music

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
basic ideas I had about computer music

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.770 
basic ideas I had about computer music
is<00:01:14.420> that<00:01:14.659> it's<00:01:16.210> computer<00:01:17.210> music<00:01:17.420> it's<00:01:17.659> not

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
is that it's computer music it's not

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.840 
is that it's computer music it's not
really<00:01:18.020> your<00:01:18.109> style<00:01:18.189> in<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:19.250> same<00:01:19.430> way<00:01:19.490> as

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
really your style in the same way as

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.730 
really your style in the same way as
improvised<00:01:20.479> music<00:01:20.509> it's<00:01:21.020> not<00:01:21.109> really<00:01:21.289> style

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
improvised music it's not really style

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.649 
improvised music it's not really style
it<00:01:22.039> only<00:01:22.250> means<00:01:22.520> that<00:01:22.670> you<00:01:22.850> use<00:01:23.030> computers

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
it only means that you use computers

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:25.719 
it only means that you use computers
when<00:01:24.530> you<00:01:24.619> use<00:01:24.799> a<00:01:24.829> computer<00:01:25.280> you<00:01:25.490> have<00:01:25.549> to

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
when you use a computer you have to

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.179 
when you use a computer you have to
think<00:01:25.939> about<00:01:26.119> what<00:01:26.479> is<00:01:26.600> different<00:01:27.079> in<00:01:27.950> which

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
think about what is different in which

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.779 
think about what is different in which
which<00:01:28.939> aspects<00:01:29.420> are<00:01:29.710> different<00:01:30.710> from<00:01:31.700> a

00:01:31.779 --> 00:01:31.789 
which aspects are different from a

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:33.730 
which aspects are different from a
normal<00:01:31.850> musical<00:01:32.719> instrument<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.350> use<00:01:33.530> those

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
normal musical instrument and use those

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:56.050 
normal musical instrument and use those
things

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.270 

for<00:01:57.060> me<00:01:57.180> that's<00:01:57.330> very<00:01:57.630> normal<00:01:57.870> to<00:01:58.110> switch<00:01:59.040> from

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
for me that's very normal to switch from

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.400 
for me that's very normal to switch from
one<00:01:59.520> idea<00:02:00.000> for<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.450> other<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.230> also

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
one idea for the other and it's also

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.550 
one idea for the other and it's also
that's<00:02:02.250> I'm<00:02:02.490> not<00:02:02.730> interested<00:02:03.090> in<00:02:03.480> the<00:02:04.230> styles

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
that's I'm not interested in the styles

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.470 
that's I'm not interested in the styles
itself<00:02:04.680> i'm<00:02:05.100> interested<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.730> making<00:02:06.060> music

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
give that forum interviews and that's

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.060 
give that forum interviews and that's
really<00:02:12.060> what<00:02:12.270> interests<00:02:12.720> me<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:13.530> language

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
really what interests me the language

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.310 
really what interests me the language
you<00:02:14.220> find<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.940> that's<00:02:15.210> is<00:02:15.420> important<00:02:16.020> and

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
you find that that's is important and

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.750 
you find that that's is important and
how<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:17.400> can<00:02:17.730> use<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:18.090> in<00:02:18.300> interaction<00:02:19.080> and

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
how you can use that in interaction and

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.200 
how you can use that in interaction and
I<00:02:21.800> think<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:23.010> defines<00:02:23.430> whether<00:02:23.760> something

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
I think that defines whether something

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.790 
I think that defines whether something
is<00:02:24.300> good<00:02:24.570> or<00:02:24.600> not<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:26.600> at<00:02:27.600> all<00:02:27.930> of<00:02:28.440> course<00:02:28.680> I

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
is good or not and at all of course I

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.280 
is good or not and at all of course I
then<00:02:28.980> at<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.310> last<00:02:29.580> at<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.840> end<00:02:30.990> it<00:02:31.230> should

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
then at the last at the end it should

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:44.270 
then at the last at the end it should

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:43.849 
making a connection between the music

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:46.749 
making a connection between the music
and<00:05:43.970> dance<00:05:44.330> and<00:05:44.570> then<00:05:45.320> use<00:05:45.639> computers<00:05:46.639> as

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 
and dance and then use computers as

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:50.919 
and dance and then use computers as
intermediate<00:05:47.630> between<00:05:47.870> those<00:05:48.590> two
