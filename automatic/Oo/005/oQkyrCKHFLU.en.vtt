00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.059
 Hi, I'm Carlos from the Cinemanet River 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.710
 for film and this time we're going to 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.929
 talk about the movie since the hunt 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.929
 giants jack the giants lade 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.130
 since the giant fighter is a movie 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.560
 Directed by bryan singer this man 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.540
 that brought us the common suspects and 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.880
 after the first two films of 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.440
 x-men also brought us a movie of 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.450
 superman that we did not like anything 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.610
 this time take a story of 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.610
 classic tale of jacques and beans 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.559
 magical or jacques and beans in 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.480
 a season in which we are seeing 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.940
 recent years as they are using 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.160
 all kinds of children's stories for 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.210
 give them a new twist suddenly it seems 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.570
 that the stories are running out 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.100
 jacques and the magical beans and 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.640
 is one of the favorite stories of the 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.440
 people is not the most remembered is the one that 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.540
 was possibly and what is it 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.920
 can this man do with one of his 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.750
 screenwriters with whom he has worked with 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.760
 a long time since the times of 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.400
 suspects like 1,4 and well it's something 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.710
 truly rewarding a good 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.990
 experience in the billboard history 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.960
 that is intended not for children but 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.420
 teenagers from jacques mixed a little 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.119
 with elements that did not exist the mister 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.070
 original as is that of a princess who 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.510
 is involved in the story and 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.900
 doing it a bit 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.550
 more serious than if we imagine that you 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.440
 they had put in a little more effort 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.180
 in the bank for adults would have been 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.810
 like a movie truly 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.480
 terrifying the giants that live to the 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.920
 half between heaven and earth at a 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.630
 place where you can only reach 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.520
 thanks to these giant plants that 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.890
 grow from the beans or from 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.440
 the magic beans is a breed that 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.900
 he tasted human flesh and he has desires 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.850
 of returning to reconquer the the 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.070
 protagonist of the story is nicholas 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.110
 hoult a boy we had seen 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.810
 work as a child in the movie now 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.450
 I go in a very very nice role and very 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.340
 endearing and does it next to ewan 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.610
 mcgregor that gives you a great 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.920
 support as the person and the figure that 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.320
 will somehow guide him and by 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.940
 another side to stanley tucci as one of 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.350
 the enemies in history the 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.350
 following the movie as you can 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.270
 imagine are created digitally but 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.980
 I think it 's a job if it turns out 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.830
 convenient that works for the 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.200
 story and they give us a version 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.270
 different that can be a great 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.440
 experience for the viewer a 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.570
 movie with a cast 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.590
 interesting that comes to include ian 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.600
 mcshane a different and pleasant version of 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.580
 the story of a classic story is one 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.570
 movie that deserves three stars in the 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.570
 scale of this space 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.819
