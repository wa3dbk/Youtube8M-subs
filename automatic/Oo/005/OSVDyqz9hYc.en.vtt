00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 
normally when you're doing something

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.300 
normally when you're doing something
that<00:00:22.360> is<00:00:22.630> really<00:00:23.020> diffused<00:00:23.500> and<00:00:23.650> intense<00:00:23.980> you

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
that is really diffused and intense you

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:26.550

think<00:00:26.620> the<00:00:26.860> more<00:00:27.039> modern<00:00:27.400> approach<00:00:27.760> is<00:00:28.090> to

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
think the more modern approach is to

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.580 
think the more modern approach is to
actually<00:00:28.750> a<00:00:28.960> pair<00:00:29.110> it<00:00:29.200> with<00:00:29.230> spin<00:00:29.470> it's<00:00:29.560> a

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
actually a pair it with spin it's a

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.050 
actually a pair it with spin it's a
