00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:09.430
Avocado as an ingredient is really important
for the skin.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:12.760
It really makes the skin very hydrated.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.680
As you may know just from nutrition, avocado
contains a lot of really healthy good fat

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.680
for your whole body.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.720
But for the skin that just translates into
a more hydrated skin which everybody could

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.870
use, especially in the winter when your skin
feels really parched.

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.791
So the three ingredients that we're going
to be using for this mask, warmed honey, four

00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:39.680
tablespoons worth.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.010
I like to use warmed honey just because it's
easier to work with.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.519
It blends with the other ingredients really
well.

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:51.390
I'm going to use one egg yolk.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.359
And I'm going to use about four tablespoons
of avocado.

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:15.680
So I'm going to start by cutting my avocado.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:25.280
So you can just kind of dig the meat of the
avocado out and add it to your bowl.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.411
Four tablespoons is roughly half of an avocado.

00:01:29.411 --> 00:01:39.299
And now I'm going to add my egg yolk to the
mix.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.719
So it's all in there together with the honey.

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:49.200
I'm going to use a fork actually to mush everything
together a little bit.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:02:00.210
All I'm doing is pressing down on the avocado,
giving it a little bit of a twirl to get all

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.469
the ingredients nice and blended.

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.090
So now that all of the ingredients are blended
together, you're really just going to apply

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.250
a very thin layer of the mask.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:17.180
As you can see, it has a nice paste consistency
so all the ingredients are really going to

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.830
stick to the surface of the skin nicely.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.340
Which means that all of that good fat, all
of that hydration is going straight into your

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.340
skin.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.519
This is a great mask for wintertime when you
have like really dull lifeless winter skin.

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.050
Put it on for 20 minutes.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.069
You're going to rinse it off with tepid water.

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.310
You're just going to be amazed.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.459
Your skin is going to really be revitalized.

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.069
And, you know, you're going to kind of have
washed away that dullness and that gray look

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.349
that your skin gets in the winter.

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:53.830
And it's just going to make your skin look
really dewy, very glowy and you're going to

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.590
look like your skin is absolutely incredibly
healthy even though it's kind of the dead

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.130
of winter.
