wear the trigger got caught on gear it

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.570

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
could fire inadvertently fire the weapon

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.390 
could fire inadvertently fire the weapon
off<00:04:53.700> on<00:04:53.880> your<00:04:54.000> back<00:04:54.180> that's<00:04:55.020> not<00:04:55.230> good<00:04:55.470> all

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
off on your back that's not good all

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.710 
off on your back that's not good all
right<00:04:56.490> the<00:04:56.640> other<00:04:56.670> way<00:04:57.000> that<00:04:57.030> we<00:04:57.180> can<00:04:57.360> do<00:04:57.510> this

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
right the other way that we can do this

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.160 
right the other way that we can do this
is<00:04:58.440> when<00:04:58.620> we're<00:04:58.770> up<00:04:58.830> on<00:04:58.980> target<00:05:00.110> we<00:05:01.110> can

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.170 
is when we're up on target we can

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:03.110 
is when we're up on target we can
actually<00:05:01.380> put<00:05:02.040> our<00:05:02.130> weapon<00:05:02.430> on<00:05:02.580> safe<00:05:02.850> from

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
actually put our weapon on safe from

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.280 
actually put our weapon on safe from
this<00:05:03.270> position<00:05:04.520> extend<00:05:05.520> drop<00:05:06.290> simultaneously

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
this position extend drop simultaneously

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.320 
this position extend drop simultaneously
dropping<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:07.920> weapon<00:05:08.280> over<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.640> top<00:05:08.850> and

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
dropping the weapon over the top and

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.580 
dropping the weapon over the top and
then<00:05:09.870> going<00:05:10.680> into<00:05:10.950> our<00:05:12.170> transition<00:05:13.170> draw<00:05:13.350> for

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
then going into our transition draw for

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.610 
then going into our transition draw for
our<00:05:13.620> pistol<00:05:14.570> so<00:05:15.570> this<00:05:16.050> is<00:05:16.200> a<00:05:16.230> little<00:05:16.500> bit

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
our pistol so this is a little bit

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.110 
our pistol so this is a little bit
faster<00:05:17.070> on<00:05:17.220> the<00:05:17.310> second<00:05:17.670> way<00:05:17.730> that<00:05:17.880> I<00:05:17.940> just

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
faster on the second way that I just

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.270 
faster on the second way that I just
showed<00:05:18.330> you<00:05:18.360> a<00:05:18.720> little<00:05:19.620> bit<00:05:19.710> faster<00:05:20.130> you're

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
showed you a little bit faster you're

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.360 
showed you a little bit faster you're
minimizing<00:05:20.490> milliseconds<00:05:21.420> just<00:05:21.630> taking<00:05:22.370> you

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
minimizing milliseconds just taking you

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.830 
minimizing milliseconds just taking you
know<00:05:23.460> you<00:05:23.520> need<00:05:23.730> to<00:05:23.760> cut<00:05:23.970> down<00:05:24.000> in<00:05:24.390> two<00:05:24.450> seconds

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
know you need to cut down in two seconds

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.540 
know you need to cut down in two seconds
when<00:05:25.440> you're<00:05:25.560> out<00:05:25.650> on<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:25.830> battlefield<00:05:26.160> or
