00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.129
 hi all how good you are 

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.309
 came this makeup inspired by the 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:12.889
 taylor swift last music video was 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.080
 called blog and good as you have seen 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.109
 I use my favorite base book that sprinter 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.660
 lidema and I've gone directly to 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:23.210
 delineate the eye is a makeup 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.779
 quite aggressive with a very eyeliner 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:28.849
 marked so to not be applying 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.789
 shadow and wasted not so to speak 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:35.120
 I have marked a very thick and very eyeliner 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.780
 intense and has already made the transition with 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.780
 black shadow 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.989
 the lacrimal we also do it in peak 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.260
 to follow that aerodynamic form 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:05.470
 so to speak this brush is a bit 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.119
 bone to make it so finite but good 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.830
 at the end it came out if you have a brush 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.230
 mark and go a little bit narrower 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.810
 best 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.230
 and what we do is delineate the whole eye 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.230
 completely filling the water line 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.210
 also the lower upper island for 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.660
 that we do not have any little white boat 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.250
 and be quite more powerful and the part 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:31.500
 superior, well, you do not have to 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.760
 be perfect because like I said let's go 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.760
 to apply black shadow 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:46.010
 we are going to tap a little 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.500
 is the most powerful color because if 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.750
 we drag we lose intensity 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.720
 then we apply all the 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.680
 eyelid mobile following more or less the 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.680
 eyeliner line 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.149
 and the edge we blur a tad 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:13.980
 not much because now we're going to 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.980
 continue to blur with another shadow 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:26.940
 we also make up the bottom of 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:29.400
 of the eye with a gray taupe shadow 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.280
 more or less what we do is go 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.710
 making the line the black edge that 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.940
 we had done so we are going to make it up 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.940
 and we blur it 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.710
 now here I wanted to mark a little 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.020
 more intensity in the final area of 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.970
 eye because I had lost a little bit 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.610
 of intensity then with shadow 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.160
 black we mark it again 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.460
 brush change and I keep blurring with 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.130
 the shadow gray color until I already 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.110
 I remain as we also make up the 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.900
 lower eye area with this shadow 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.120
 gray and now with a vanilla shadow 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.060
 so let's make up what is the lower part 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:17.170
 of the eyebrow a little bit just to 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.170
 give it a tad more than luminosity 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:27.880
 we apply mascara 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.880
 I am using this deliplus 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:34.950
 and we put rouge I used the flamingo 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.530
 also of plus 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.230
 illuminated the area of ​​the cheekbone and the area 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.680
 central of the face with the escape law 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.680
 and others 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.079
 and with the matte lipstick of the jagger that 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.849
 I think it's the backstage I'll leave you in the 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.480
 information card the name 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.250
 concrete because I do not remember it very well 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.950
 we give a couple of capes with care of 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.019
 that we do not have patches and on top of 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.140
 given a little bit of the mac diva and so 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:10.970
 I would hope you liked it and 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.970
 see you in the next see you later
