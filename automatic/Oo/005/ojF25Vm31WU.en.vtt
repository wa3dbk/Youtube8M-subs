now<00:05:33.520> that's<00:05:33.760> one<00:05:34.060> way<00:05:34.180> of<00:05:34.300> doing<00:05:34.540> it<00:05:34.810> there's

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
now that's one way of doing it there's

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.710 
now that's one way of doing it there's
also<00:05:35.920> different<00:05:36.610> way<00:05:36.700> I<00:05:36.730> create<00:05:37.210> hair<00:05:37.480> lines

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:37.720 
also different way I create hair lines

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
also different way I create hair lines
depending<00:05:38.290> on<00:05:38.680> the<00:05:38.860> scale<00:05:39.520> of<00:05:39.670> the<00:05:39.790> sculpture

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
depending on the scale of the sculpture

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:47.280 
depending on the scale of the sculpture
but<00:05:41.940> this<00:05:42.940> will<00:05:43.150> work

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.290 

and<00:05:47.830> the<00:05:47.980> reason<00:05:48.250> I'm<00:05:48.370> switching<00:05:48.910> over<00:05:48.970> to

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
and the reason I'm switching over to

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.560 
and the reason I'm switching over to
this<00:05:49.450> clay<00:05:49.810> is<00:05:49.960> because<00:05:50.760> as<00:05:51.760> much<00:05:52.060> as<00:05:52.210> I<00:05:52.300> love

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
this clay is because as much as I love

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:57.240 
this clay is because as much as I love

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
to work with very time-consuming yes as

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.640 
to work with very time-consuming yes as
I<00:06:01.180> constantly<00:06:01.600> have<00:06:01.900> to<00:06:01.930> be<00:06:02.110> working<00:06:02.410> with<00:06:02.500> the

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
I constantly have to be working with the

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.990 
I constantly have to be working with the
heat<00:06:03.390> to<00:06:04.770> soften<00:06:05.770> it<00:06:06.070> up<00:06:06.190> and<00:06:06.520> get<00:06:06.640> back<00:06:06.820> to

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
heat to soften it up and get back to

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.930 
heat to soften it up and get back to
work<00:06:07.180> this<00:06:07.540> looks<00:06:07.870> like<00:06:08.700> it<00:06:09.700> would<00:06:09.790> be<00:06:09.850> a

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
work this looks like it would be a

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:16.879 
work this looks like it would be a
no-brainer

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:16.889 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.390 

though<00:06:17.400> right<00:06:17.639> now<00:06:18.080> the<00:06:19.080> clay<00:06:19.319> does<00:06:19.770> appear<00:06:20.370> to

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
though right now the clay does appear to

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.430 
though right now the clay does appear to
be<00:06:20.759> a<00:06:20.789> little<00:06:21.180> on<00:06:21.300> the<00:06:21.419> soft<00:06:21.780> side<00:06:22.050> for<00:06:22.319> my

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
be a little on the soft side for my

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.129 
be a little on the soft side for my
liking<00:06:22.710> but<00:06:22.949> again<00:06:23.430> like<00:06:23.610> I<00:06:23.729> said<00:06:24.000> it's<00:06:24.240> it's

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139 
liking but again like I said it's it's

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:27.110 
liking but again like I said it's it's
95<00:06:25.740> degrees<00:06:25.770> out<00:06:26.280> here<00:06:26.430> right<00:06:26.610> now

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 
95 degrees out here right now

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:30.020 
95 degrees out here right now
and<00:06:27.470> it<00:06:28.470> seems<00:06:28.770> to<00:06:28.979> me<00:06:29.099> like<00:06:29.129> in<00:06:29.520> the<00:06:29.550> cooler

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
and it seems to me like in the cooler

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.899 
and it seems to me like in the cooler
months<00:06:30.690> being<00:06:31.680> winter<00:06:34.099> parts<00:06:35.099> of<00:06:35.220> spring<00:06:35.639> and

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:35.909 
months being winter parts of spring and

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:39.439 
months being winter parts of spring and
this<00:06:35.970> is<00:06:36.120> going<00:06:36.270> to<00:06:36.330> be<00:06:36.449> ideal<00:06:36.629> for<00:06:37.110> me<00:06:38.449> it's

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090 
going to allow me to work much quicker

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.279 
going to allow me to work much quicker

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.160 

and<00:06:57.890> wonder<00:06:58.640> if<00:06:58.730> I<00:06:58.790> could<00:06:58.850> take<00:06:59.120> a<00:06:59.180> brush<00:06:59.600> and

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:00.170 
and wonder if I could take a brush and

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.600 
and wonder if I could take a brush and
when<00:07:00.320> I'm<00:07:00.440> done<00:07:00.620> to<00:07:00.800> this<00:07:00.890> point<00:07:01.250> I<00:07:01.400> just

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610 
when I'm done to this point I just

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.150 
when I'm done to this point I just
brushed<00:07:01.970> these<00:07:02.210> off

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 
brushed these off

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.760 
brushed these off
we<00:07:04.160> only<00:07:04.340> fall<00:07:04.640> off<00:07:04.760> nicely<00:07:05.270> they<00:07:05.390> don't

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.770 
we only fall off nicely they don't

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:13.780

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:26.110 
adhere to the original piece which is a
big<00:07:14.000> plus<00:07:15.310> let's<00:07:16.310> see<00:07:16.550> let's<00:07:16.820> use<00:07:17.060> my<00:07:17.210> fingers

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.120 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:32.030 

it's<00:07:26.600> not<00:07:26.750> bad

and a big plus about this clay here is

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:36.080 
and a big plus about this clay here is
sulfur<00:07:34.740> free<00:07:35.070> and<00:07:35.310> that's<00:07:35.400> usually<00:07:35.700> what<00:07:35.970> we

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:36.090 
sulfur free and that's usually what we

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.080 
sulfur free and that's usually what we
look<00:07:36.300> for<00:07:36.530> when<00:07:37.530> we're<00:07:37.770> going<00:07:38.640> to<00:07:38.820> go<00:07:39.000> ahead
