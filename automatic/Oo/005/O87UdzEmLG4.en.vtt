ways pointed out to me I've just become

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.180 
ways pointed out to me I've just become
this<00:00:42.590> fat<00:00:44.239> uncoordinated<00:00:45.379> unathletic<00:00:46.379> and

this fat uncoordinated unathletic and
most<00:00:47.969> of<00:00:48.239> all<00:00:48.360> under<00:00:48.930> carved<00:00:49.500> man<00:00:50.449> and<00:00:51.449> not

most of all under carved man and not
only<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.960> but<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.940> realized<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.270> may<00:00:54.510> have

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
only that but I realized that I may have

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.619 
only that but I realized that I may have
led<00:00:54.809> my<00:00:54.989> girlfriend<00:00:55.559> astray<00:00:56.010> by<00:00:56.399> telling<00:00:57.180> her

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
led my girlfriend astray by telling her

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.340 
led my girlfriend astray by telling her
that<00:00:58.170> she<00:00:58.680> should<00:00:59.550> also<00:00:59.760> be<00:01:00.300> brought<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.989> that

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
that she should also be brought in that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.990 
that she should also be brought in that
she<00:01:01.530> should<00:01:01.710> keep<00:01:01.980> going<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.550> path<00:01:02.760> she

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
she should keep going on the path she

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.939 
she should keep going on the path she
was<00:01:03.149> going<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.570> it<00:01:03.660> was<00:01:03.780> working<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.229> well

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
was going that it was working so well

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.700 
was going that it was working so well
but<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:06.119> seemed<00:01:06.600> at<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.900> time<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.590> was<00:01:07.680> a

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
but it seemed at the time that it was a

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.030 
but it seemed at the time that it was a
good<00:01:07.920> idea<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.490> realized<00:01:09.060> now<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.890> it<00:01:10.890> was

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
good idea but I realized now that it was

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.460 
good idea but I realized now that it was
the<00:01:11.189> wrong<00:01:11.369> decision<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.570> don't<00:01:12.960> think<00:01:13.170> I<00:01:13.409> can

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
the wrong decision I I don't think I can

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.490 
the wrong decision I I don't think I can
really<00:01:13.880> express<00:01:14.880> in<00:01:15.150> words<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.780> error<00:01:16.049> that

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
really express in words the error that

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.429 
really express in words the error that
I've<00:01:16.650> come<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.090> but<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.420> thought<00:01:18.960> perhaps<00:01:19.170> I

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
I've come to but I thought perhaps I

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.410 
I've come to but I thought perhaps I

you<00:02:29.700> really<00:02:30.120> eat<00:02:30.360> turkey<00:02:30.720> burgers<00:02:31.080> and

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
you really eat turkey burgers and

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.440 
you really eat turkey burgers and
Pringles<00:02:31.920> because<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.490> calorie<00:02:32.880> restrict

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
Pringles because you calorie restrict

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.750 
Pringles because you calorie restrict
and<00:02:33.660> that's<00:02:34.320> what<00:02:34.620> makes<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:35.100> fat

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
and that's what makes you fat

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.600 
and that's what makes you fat
you<00:02:36.420> also<00:02:36.600> fastened<00:02:37.260> for<00:02:37.380> 26<00:02:37.890> days<00:02:37.950> which<00:02:38.460> is

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
you also fastened for 26 days which is

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.300 
you also fastened for 26 days which is
horrible<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.270> slows<00:02:39.570> your<00:02:39.690> metabolism<00:02:40.280> so<00:02:41.280> I

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
horrible and slows your metabolism so I

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.130 
horrible and slows your metabolism so I
shouldn't<00:02:41.790> have<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.240> go<00:02:42.360> over<00:02:42.630> that<00:02:42.840> part

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
shouldn't have to go over that part

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.740 
shouldn't have to go over that part
anyway<00:02:43.520> I<00:02:44.520> thought<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.030> could<00:02:45.240> help<00:02:45.450> a<00:02:45.570> bit

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
anyway I thought I could help a bit

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.330 
anyway I thought I could help a bit
because<00:02:45.930> I've<00:02:46.290> been<00:02:46.440> wearing<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:46.920> longer

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
this is the advice I wish I'd had when I

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.520 
this is the advice I wish I'd had when I

like freely does the only way to remedy

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.050 
like freely does the only way to remedy
that<00:05:15.300> is<00:05:15.810> by<00:05:16.020> doing<00:05:16.099> exercise<00:05:17.099> and<00:05:17.340> the<00:05:17.580> only
