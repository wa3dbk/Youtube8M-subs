00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.290
 as well 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.389
 hello everyone welcome to my channel your 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.390
 hd escape and we are in a new 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.080
 white game 2 a game that I 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.000
 just put in because heavy come worth 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.689
 only by extreme mouth teams in the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.829
 extreme because it is normal apart from 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.530
 that there is a need for a quantity of 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.570
 inhuman bullets to be able to kill people 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.940
 then let's play here that the only 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.550
 problem that I can have is the lag but 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.789
 that if I give this as you see if I give 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.739
 is dead so come on let's go there 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.510
 first blood for me good I go with the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.289
 a in 94 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.370
 there is with fast charger muffler 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.370
 and cylinder head 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.690
 well in extremes we always have the 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.690
 next 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.040
 to the pross that go with brushes and 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.400
 good on this screen 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.180
 then those who complain about campers in 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.130
 battlefield are the ones this death 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.130
 are those that are on top of the 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.940
 shades 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.030
 shit shit shit I want you to have 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.970
 one behind 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:34.310
 recharge I have a come 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.870
 good as you have seen has started in 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.159
 the main channel that I'll put it 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.890
 down as I have always started 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.630
 from the left it is killed by my partner 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.170
 I have started a new campaign in the 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.200
 main channel that is the freckles 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.420
 of line 9 in the third person of war 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.620
 it's pretty good the truth that is 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.920
 liking enough 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.300
 I like it a lot and I loved it 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.220
 because you're looking up from the roof 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.720
 both the backs 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.430
 good the competition is costing 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.470
 quite because it has enough action 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.800
 at least the first mission that is 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.030
 played quite interesting enough the 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.020
 story also seems good to me 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.310
 Story story tells about 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.290
 soldiers in Dubai that 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.110
 suppose they have to 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.420
 and make an evacuation of friends about 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.239
 friends of partners of allies but that 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.609
 it gets complicated then you're good 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:31.040
 watching the episodes and I say that to me 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:32.000
 they are helping pretty good enough 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.810
 good if it is not proving me 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.810
 interesting the 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.870
 death nor do history 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.219
 of the line mirrors is far away 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.400
 quite interesting but good and the 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:48.360
 hand of main channel 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:53.090
 and six seeing so then 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.090
 they are giving me 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.330
 you always have extremely foolish of 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:05.599
 shotguns the champion's fool and the 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:08.090
 shield that in all the games has 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:10.190
 that there are some people that kind of 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.170
 characters always gets in bed 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.770
 finding but good 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.599
 for that we are to try to kill him and 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.400
 stay at the minimum per ass possible 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:21.650
 we have I think we have the roof 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.870
 because listen look back on it is that 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.280
 they do not arrive 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.280
 this seen from there 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:49.560
 I have some encouragement to feel it 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:52.140
 ready with the sentinel valerenga 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.740
 now charge a payment in sight and 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.390
 as well 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.880
 I have a good streak of boyle is a 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.640
 streak of would ruthless that that in me 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.340
 it's very little but very unlikely 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.090
 make me way let's put here I do not know 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.090
 how will it go bankrupt 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.230
 thank goodness he kills my partner and 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.230
 says it 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.190
 a man gave red fame 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.190
 for no one 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.459
 sorry 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.900
 again our cole take away the 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.970
 shotgun you need a weapon that will kill you 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.840
 of a bullet because as I have to give 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:38.060
 two already his cure happens in more good cure 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.030
 which is a bank that is going to be a bank 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.569
 for you need to need more than to kill a 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.580
 shot for 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:49.070
 to kill because if you would not eat a 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.990
 shit in the games but good 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:54.070
 come on let's get in here for the 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.070
 bar that there are always people 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.970
 and no one 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.970

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.009

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:26.220

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.810
 top of my team very well kill me from 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.590
 my team without having anyone less and 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:30.590
 I had a forward 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:38.890
 the droplets when they kill me when I have 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:41.550
 already an interesting and complete streak that 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:41.550
 yes yes 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:53.150

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.150
 let's go with the lag 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.110
 nobody nobody 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:07.520
 I do not even know how I was doing it because it hits me 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:10.550
 the gauze and I have the gun 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.910
 looking is looking at the basin a savior 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.910
 from Cuenca 

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:22.630
 in all phases it is already looking 

00:06:19.819 --> 00:06:25.230
 because here 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.230
 there's shit 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:32.290

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.190
 here now with the basin but good 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:35.190

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:42.590
 It's worth a good afternoon but nothing 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.340
 I hope you liked the team scream 

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.699
 And until next time 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.699
