be careful snake on akan I know where
liquid<00:04:58.350> is<00:04:58.680> yeah<00:04:59.610> I'm<00:05:00.210> confirming<00:05:00.780> the

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
liquid is yeah I'm confirming the

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.380 
liquid is yeah I'm confirming the
location<00:05:01.310> it's<00:05:02.310> to<00:05:02.520> the<00:05:02.640> north<00:05:02.910> of<00:05:03.090> where<00:05:03.270> you

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
location it's to the north of where you

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.990 
location it's to the north of where you
are<00:05:03.830> Merrill's<00:05:04.830> really<00:05:05.130> change<00:05:05.460> doesn't<00:05:05.790> she

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
are Merrill's really change doesn't she

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.070 
are Merrill's really change doesn't she
snake<00:05:06.300> she's<00:05:07.260> a<00:05:07.290> lot<00:05:07.560> more<00:05:07.730> self-assured<00:05:09.080> hmm

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
snake she's a lot more self-assured hmm

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.350 
snake she's a lot more self-assured hmm
I<00:05:10.200> wonder<00:05:11.070> how<00:05:11.310> much<00:05:11.490> of<00:05:11.550> that<00:05:11.669> has<00:05:11.940> to<00:05:11.970> do<00:05:12.210> with

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
I wonder how much of that has to do with

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.900 
I wonder how much of that has to do with
the<00:05:12.510> system<00:05:12.980> the<00:05:13.980> census<00:05:14.340> you<00:05:14.370> used<00:05:14.760> to

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
the system the census you used to

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.520 
the system the census you used to
develop<00:05:15.300> through<00:05:15.480> extended<00:05:15.930> training<00:05:16.230> and

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
develop through extended training and

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.170 
develop through extended training and
experience<00:05:17.100> can<00:05:17.250> now<00:05:17.370> be<00:05:17.550> obtained<00:05:17.910> without

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
experience can now be obtained without

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.480 
experience can now be obtained without
even<00:05:18.360> working<00:05:18.600> for<00:05:18.750> them<00:05:19.140> seems<00:05:20.130> once<00:05:20.370> you're

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
even working for them seems once you're

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.190 
even working for them seems once you're
under<00:05:20.700> the<00:05:20.820> systems<00:05:21.270> control<00:05:21.750> you<00:05:21.870> don't<00:05:21.990> even

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
under the systems control you don't even

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.630 
under the systems control you don't even
need<00:05:22.380> experience<00:05:22.980> at<00:05:23.130> all

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
need experience at all

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.730 
need experience at all
it<00:05:24.030> even<00:05:24.270> beats<00:05:24.450> that<00:05:24.690> VR<00:05:25.140> training<00:05:25.590> there<00:05:25.710> was

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
it even beats that VR training there was

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.030 
it even beats that VR training there was
all<00:05:25.950> the<00:05:26.040> rage<00:05:26.220> a<00:05:26.280> few<00:05:26.610> years<00:05:26.820> back<00:05:27.060> yeah<00:05:28.080> the

growing need for PMC's has led to the

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:32.240 
growing need for PMC's has led to the
