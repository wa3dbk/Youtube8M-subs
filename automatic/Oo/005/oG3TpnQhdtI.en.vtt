00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.330
 by も こ ん こ ん ま 今 回 大学 大学 英語 英語 英語 英語 コ ツ の 長 Tips for long-term reading in English 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.380
 I will talk about how to study English long reading comprehension in this way that long sentence is to study 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:17.279
 I think 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:19.199
 It decided the Scoring 6 points after very Scoring is or where it is high sound and university entrance exam plague students 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.020
 About that or not from being 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.920
 This long sentence of red 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.550
 This time I am taking sputum is going I want to thank you talking about the study of this 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.560
 I will 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:32.059
 So where is that long sentence reading skill 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.450
 If it is fixed or specific is fixed, it is the processing speed. 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:38.280
 Netsumari is 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:42.300
 Long reading comprehension is a game of processing speed already 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:48.130
 Or quickly and accurately to read the once 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:53.470
 No matter how accurately you read it is meaningless to be slow and accurate even if you read it fast 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:58.930
 It is Tsukun high school data and so have no meaning if stop clogging read accurately faster 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:02.180
 It's like reading exactly that fast. What's the point? 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.360
 English reading until you understand the meaning without converting it into Japanese 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:10.910
 It becomes important that you become 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:12.530
 So what should I do before taking it to that stage ? 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:18.290
 I 'm thinking I 'm revenge 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:22.170
 It's like, but it is the same with Katayama School, which is going to a preparatory school or a school, but it is almost impossible 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.140
 Problem solving or of the long sentence was or now problems understanding 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.210
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.200
 The well until it is the answer why to understand that say in a situation of this it is able to Te the sky 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.520
 I think there is 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:39.880
 Well I would like to ask the teacher if I can not do that, but I can do it 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:41.159
 Also it once to hear the commentary dated yet put round taking issue with Pong yourself to read lengthy Being 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.119
 I understood 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.680
 So when I went there I wonder where the difference is going or I think it's still revenge 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.480
 is not it 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:58.070
 I 'm probably not doing welfare well and that way is wrong 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:58.070
 So say what to do I'm white 100 times the reading aloud 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:07.530
 The amount of quality law under which there is good quality guarantees the quality 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:12.060
 No matter how wonderful it is, at the beginning I did manage it 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:17.040
 I think that soccer players can lift up to 5,000 times normally but first 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:18.569
 Is a misunderstanding become, but we just could not also be integrated nothing body that the First what body 1 times 5 times 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.480
 10 times it is the Fu that without 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:27.159
 If it is baseball to play a sleeping vehicle, Ichiro will probably have no package at first. 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.770
 I think it wasn't there, and shake it wat dozens of times, hundreds of times or thousands of times 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:33.240
 By 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:38.410
 When I read English as well , I was able to become an active member in the major league 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:42.330
 Since I Is not take basically the time because Yon Doc 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:46.530
 There are people who write and remember, but write once and write once 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:50.730
 I can not read it because I can read it about 10 times in time 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:55.160
 Since English is a language in the first place, it has no meaning unless you speak a language 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.840
 If you look at your baby, you will understand it as a form of language . 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.620
 Baby is suddenly 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.269
 I do not start writing 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.569
 Suddenly you are not the baby where you start writing letters like your father 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:10.830
 At first we start to say such words as dad or manners 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:14.650
 Same as that, you have to read it first 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:18.090
 That's why aloud and writing is the last thing 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:23.790
 Please choose first because it does not matter whether it is the correct spelling of 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:27.010
 I think that it would be better to give up if it was impossible after 100 readings in the reading but reading aloud 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:31.959
 It's absolutely ok if you turn 100 times, so please go 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.920
 The first one is the rhythm rhythm when it comes to the magic of reading aloud or what to be aware of 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.189
 rhythm 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.069
 What does this mean? Where the meaning is understood 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:43.469
 In the sense of delimiting 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:48.270
 Gatsumari If you would like to see us have discussed in other videos it is that read the sentence 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:51.630
 Another thing after living in rhythm rhythm is that super speed of limit Bucks 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:56.820
 I don't remember that languages do n't load that much. 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:58.710
 In order to be able to understand only by listening to English without converting to this Japanese, it is necessary to put a load 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.250
 In that sense super ski water station Mito 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:03.980
 It is exaggerated accent after 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.300
 Japanese is basically 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.100
 That 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:11.120
 There is no strength 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:13.210
 Put the results exaggerated accent of talking to the recording are you talking about Japanese but ordinary 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.800
 People do n't have to talk like this 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:23.500
 It feels like today's weather is like rain. 

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:24.550
 English and basic accents do to exaggerated to it First of all because it is important rather than it is 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.440
 I mean 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:33.200
 Hey other to please take a take a look also there in're up video on how the temperature is 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:36.680
 That's all for studying the tips of long-term reading in English 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:40.850
 Tell it rains it is to say the clogging and reading aloud 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:43.720
