00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.480
 Hi, I'm Carlos Urquijo and in this 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:08.860
 occasion I want to get into the kitchen of 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.750
 ivette invited me to teach if I 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.460
 you asked for is a soup then 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.740
 I came up with nothing tortilla soup there 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.449
 wonders help me with throwing your hand 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.249
 for it is very simple in everything it is very 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.529
 easy what we're going to need nothing more 

00:00:18.249 --> 00:00:23.979
 They are two large tomatoes and one onion 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.569
 Complete 2 cloves of garlic 8 tortillas 

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:28.029
 those tortillas I recommend that one day 

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:29.829
 before you put them outdoors so that 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.259
 begin to lose moisture and become 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:37.210
 hard and we do not need to put them at 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:38.760
 Fry them is a meal much more greeting 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.440
 talk 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.690
 it's easier now and now it's a chile 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.690
 guajillo cut with scissors 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.070
 and they were 100 grams of cotija cheese that 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:56.379
 children are 2 liters of hard broth in the 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.719
 chicken broth that you already put to the 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.489
 time to do the coyol that exists with 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.840
 their 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.120
 all the preparation that does not 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.560
 we have salt right now or anything that already comes 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.320
 in which exactly that already comes from 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.500
 with the chicken broth and with the favor of 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.970
 teaching everything is coming and it is already like 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.369
 we started that is the first thing we're going to 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.490
 do let's put a pan a 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:21.220
 little oil is already heating up and 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.840
 we will fry in getting guajillo 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:28.659
 the tomato following the parts of the 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:30.490
 half to look at it and the onion 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.369
 I guess you do not need it that way 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:44.950
 small because it goes to the blender more 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:46.420
 half because if it was a good gourd 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.369
 of the gourds of the most answered one 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.320
 half nothing else would be four more or more and 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.440
 four or five already depends on the size of 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.440
 every 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.710
 thanks for the epazote you need a 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.710
 object a term twig 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.000
 from the same 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.060
 Y 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.890
 let's go to the cinema 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.820
 in the end 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.230
 the oil we are going to leave the same oil 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:48.090
 that already has the flavor is directly 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:48.090
 Chile and this is coming a little bit more 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.670
 Y 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:04.730
 and this is going to end the sauce we put 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:07.730
 with the whole onion we are 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.730
 Excellent 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.080
 normally we will think and the chili 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.569
 where he goes here until the lack in Chile 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.760
 jalapeÃ±o or serrano as if it were a 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.760
 salsa but it's not an omelette soup 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:31.430
 of chile guajillo and apart as we fry 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.819
 oil oil that we have the 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:41.900
 site where the sauce is displayed 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:45.050
 depart as the parties already as the 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.320
 before we dry them we can start with the 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:47.320
 hands 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.910
 we need the spring twig 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:14.710
 jarvis with some chicken or with the sauce 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:17.220
 and the broth also has no longer serving 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.220
 with roll 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.180
 Yeah sure 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.390
 if in the end we are going to put what is the 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.340
 tortilla because in the end if I put it 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.410
 from the data soup 10 pizzas to the wada 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.990
 then we removed the whole system 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.920
 17 comma trainer and bring the tortilla 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.610
 tortilla is added 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:47.610
 to taste 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.870
 that 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.340
 the ribbon is in the tortilla 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:12.550
 and we have here the delicious soup of 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:12.550
 tortilla that we are what we eat
