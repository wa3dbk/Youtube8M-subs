00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
have been really lucky to test-drive the

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.920 
have been really lucky to test-drive the
Kluger<00:00:12.920> well<00:00:13.920> current<00:00:14.850> car<00:00:15.029> is<00:00:15.209> a<00:00:15.240> lot<00:00:15.570> smaller

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:15.930 
Kluger well current car is a lot smaller

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.300 
Kluger well current car is a lot smaller
it's<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.410> hatchback

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
it's a hatchback

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.999 
it's a hatchback
so<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:18.060> Kluger<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.600> completely<00:00:19.560> different

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:20.009 
so the Kluger is completely different

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.909 
so the Kluger is completely different
and<00:00:20.310> I've<00:00:21.150> really<00:00:21.570> enjoyed<00:00:21.630> just<00:00:22.169> the<00:00:22.679> height

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:22.919 
and I've really enjoyed just the height

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:26.659 
and I've really enjoyed just the height
being<00:00:23.490> higher<00:00:23.759> up<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:25.169> compass<00:00:26.009> see

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:26.669 
being higher up and the compass see

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:28.279 
being higher up and the compass see
so<00:00:26.789> I'll<00:00:26.880> just<00:00:27.060> enjoyed<00:00:27.329> everything<00:00:27.720> about<00:00:28.079> it

different from our current car so it's

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.740 
different from our current car so it's
been<00:00:34.470> great<00:00:34.650> the<00:00:35.640> height<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.970> the<00:00:36.090> Kluger<00:00:36.480> for

putting in the kids in their car seats

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.300 
putting in the kids in their car seats
is<00:00:38.940> excellent<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.690> find<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.470> lot<00:00:40.590> easier<00:00:40.830> just

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
is excellent I find it a lot easier just

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.430 
is excellent I find it a lot easier just
for<00:00:42.120> strapping<00:00:42.360> them<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.720> and<00:00:42.900> everything<00:00:43.290> and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
for strapping them in and everything and

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.280 
for strapping them in and everything and
they<00:00:44.010> also<00:00:44.220> like<00:00:44.580> to<00:00:44.700> climb<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.420> get<00:00:46.170> in

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
they also like to climb in and get in

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.600 
they also like to climb in and get in
themselves<00:00:46.680> which<00:00:46.920> is<00:00:47.100> quite<00:00:47.310> fun<00:00:47.490> for<00:00:47.730> them

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
themselves which is quite fun for them

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.580

putting<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.730> car<00:00:50.940> seats<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.360> was<00:00:51.570> simple<00:00:52.080> I<00:00:52.260> was

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
putting a car seats in was simple I was

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.500 
putting a car seats in was simple I was
a<00:00:52.830> little<00:00:53.130> bit<00:00:53.280> more<00:00:53.820> nervous<00:00:54.000> about<00:00:54.240> that

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
a little bit more nervous about that

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.420 
a little bit more nervous about that
because<00:00:54.690> they<00:00:54.900> can<00:00:55.080> be<00:00:55.170> quite<00:00:55.430> difficult

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
because they can be quite difficult

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.450 
because they can be quite difficult
sometimes<00:00:57.110> but<00:00:58.110> in<00:00:58.320> fact<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.770> anchor<00:00:59.250> point

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
sometimes but in fact the anchor point

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.060 
sometimes but in fact the anchor point
was<00:00:59.610> right<00:00:59.820> behind<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.270> seat<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:01.080> it<00:01:01.770> was<00:01:01.980> just

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
was right behind the seat so it was just

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.539 
was right behind the seat so it was just
straight<00:01:02.730> forward<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.540> meant<00:01:04.530> that<00:01:04.619> we've

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
straight forward and meant that we've

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.469 
straight forward and meant that we've
put<00:01:05.909> them<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.150> within<00:01:06.330> about<00:01:06.630> five<00:01:07.140> minutes

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
put them in within about five minutes

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.510 
put them in within about five minutes
