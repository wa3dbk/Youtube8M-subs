if<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:18.090> don't<00:00:18.300> have<00:00:18.480> tools<00:00:18.810> handy<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:20.189> can

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
if you don't have tools handy you can

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.220 
if you don't have tools handy you can
simply<00:00:22.279> wrap<00:00:23.279> them<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:24.029> loop<00:00:24.330> like<00:00:24.689> so<00:00:25.590> and

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
simply wrap them in a loop like so and

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.939 
simply wrap them in a loop like so and
that'll<00:00:28.230> just<00:00:28.500> get<00:00:28.710> them<00:00:28.890> out<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.279> way<00:00:30.949> be

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
that'll just get them out of the way be

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.350 
that'll just get them out of the way be
careful<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.520> these<00:00:32.640> sharp<00:00:33.410> pointy<00:00:34.410> ends<00:00:35.360> but

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
careful of these sharp pointy ends but

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.910 
careful of these sharp pointy ends but
if<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.600> do<00:00:36.870> have<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.140> pair<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.530> needlenose

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
if you do have a pair of needlenose

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.430 
if you do have a pair of needlenose
pliers<00:00:38.430> with<00:00:38.850> with<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> wire<00:00:39.510> cutter<00:00:39.540> in<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.290> or

pliers with with a wire cutter in it or

just a set of wire cutters you'll want
to<00:00:43.440> clip<00:00:43.710> away<00:00:43.860> this<00:00:44.250> excess<00:00:44.700> string<00:00:45.059> just

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
to clip away this excess string just

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.840 
to clip away this excess string just
because<00:00:46.079> they<00:00:46.230> do<00:00:46.649> create<00:00:46.890> noise<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.550> tend<00:00:47.760> to

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
because they do create noise and tend to

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.000 
because they do create noise and tend to
get<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.149> way<00:00:48.270> now<00:00:48.930> when<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.230> when<00:00:49.980> you

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
get in the way now when you when you

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.090 
get in the way now when you when you
trim<00:00:50.399> these<00:00:50.579> strings<00:00:51.030> it's<00:00:51.360> important<00:00:52.100> that

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
trim these strings it's important that

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
trim these strings it's important that
you<00:00:54.170> come<00:00:55.170> at<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.620> at<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.100> string<00:00:56.399> at<00:00:56.550> a<00:00:56.640> 90

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
you come at the at the string at a 90

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.110 
you come at the at the string at a 90
degree<00:00:57.149> angle<00:00:58.039> because<00:00:59.039> if<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.340> cut<00:00:59.670> them<00:00:59.879> at

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
degree angle because if you cut them at

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.170 
degree angle because if you cut them at
a<00:01:00.449> diagonal<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.190> you're<00:01:02.910> basically

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
a diagonal like this you're basically

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.500 
a diagonal like this you're basically
creating<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.260> needle<00:01:04.739> you're<00:01:05.549> sharpening<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
creating a needle you're sharpening the

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.990 
creating a needle you're sharpening the
end<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.930> string<00:01:07.290> if<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:08.400> brush<00:01:08.790> up

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
end of that string if you brush up

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.020 
end of that string if you brush up
against<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.720> or<00:01:10.080> if<00:01:10.470> you're<00:01:10.920> tuning<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.670> you

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
against it or if you're tuning and you

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.760 
against it or if you're tuning and you
hit<00:01:12.479> with<00:01:12.600> your<00:01:12.659> finger<00:01:13.110> even<00:01:13.470> when<00:01:13.650> you're

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
hit with your finger even when you're

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.460 
hit with your finger even when you're
changing<00:01:14.040> strings<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.850> next<00:01:15.270> time<00:01:15.479> if<00:01:15.780> you've

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
changing strings the next time if you've

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.600 
changing strings the next time if you've
got<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.890> at<00:01:17.070> an<00:01:17.729> angle<00:01:18.090> like<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:19.490> there's<00:01:20.490> a

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
got it at an angle like this there's a

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.399 
got it at an angle like this there's a
lot<00:01:20.880> better<00:01:21.119> chance<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.750> when<00:01:21.869> some<00:01:22.080> when

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
lot better chance that when some when

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.090 
lot better chance that when some when
your<00:01:22.560> tune<00:01:22.799> changing<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.549> strings<00:01:24.890> you<00:01:25.890> can

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
your tune changing the strings you can

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.399 
your tune changing the strings you can
you<00:01:26.729> know<00:01:26.850> it'll<00:01:27.030> snap<00:01:27.270> back<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.840> cut<00:01:28.229> your

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
you know it'll snap back and cut your

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.940 
you know it'll snap back and cut your
stabby<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.970> again<00:01:30.630> come<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:30.990> at<00:01:31.110> 90<00:01:31.439> degrees<00:01:31.500> so

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
stabby so again come in at 90 degrees so

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.270 
stabby so again come in at 90 degrees so
you're<00:01:32.100> cutting<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.549> off<00:01:32.670> flat<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:34.009> just<00:01:35.009> snip

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
you're cutting it off flat and just snip

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.210 
you're cutting it off flat and just snip
the<00:01:35.520> string<00:01:36.409> and<00:01:37.409> I'm<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.799> going<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:37.979> come

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
the string and I'm just going to come

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.600 
the string and I'm just going to come
around<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.810> carefully<00:01:39.920> do<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.280> all<00:01:41.430> of

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
around and carefully do that to all of

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.389 
around and carefully do that to all of
them<00:01:41.670> when<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.000> when<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.329> trim<00:01:42.659> your<00:01:42.840> strings

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
them when you when you trim your strings

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:50.359 
them when you when you trim your strings
you'll<00:01:44.399> want<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.850> leave<00:01:45.409> you<00:01:46.409> know<00:01:48.140> an<00:01:49.369> eighth

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
you'll want to leave you know an eighth

00:01:50.369 --> 00:02:00.649 
you'll want to leave you know an eighth
to<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:50.850> quarter<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.990> an<00:01:52.170> inch<00:01:53.780> of<00:01:55.040> extra

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.590 

and<00:02:01.860> really<00:02:02.860> all<00:02:03.100> that's<00:02:03.310> doing<00:02:04.030> for<00:02:04.479> you

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
and really all that's doing for you

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.940 
and really all that's doing for you
leaving<00:02:04.840> that<00:02:05.170> extra<00:02:05.740> on<00:02:05.829> there<00:02:06.100> is<00:02:07.950> creating

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
leaving that extra on there is creating

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.670 
leaving that extra on there is creating
something<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.489> grab<00:02:09.759> with<00:02:10.209> your<00:02:10.390> pliers<00:02:10.680> when

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
you remove these strings after they've

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.700 
you remove these strings after they've
worn<00:02:15.069> out<00:02:15.310> or<00:02:15.640> broken
