00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
Moon that's we've got here is a Blood

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.050 
Moon that's we've got here is a Blood
Moon<00:02:46.180> alright<00:02:46.690> so<00:02:47.020> here's<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.160> stages<00:02:48.700> of<00:02:48.730> it

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
Moon alright so here's the stages of it

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.420 
Moon alright so here's the stages of it
if<00:02:49.240> you<00:02:49.330> understand<00:02:49.720> that<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:50.080> timeline<00:02:50.620> for<00:02:50.890> 12

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
if you understand that a timeline for 12

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.860 
if you understand that a timeline for 12
stages<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.180> eclipse<00:02:53.070> stage<00:02:54.070> 4<00:02:54.580> or<00:02:55.030> it's<00:02:55.209> 73

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
stages of the eclipse stage 4 or it's 73

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.070 
stages of the eclipse stage 4 or it's 73
/<00:02:56.140> 75<00:02:56.770> percent<00:02:57.190> coverage<00:02:57.400> that's<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.910> 2<00:02:58.180> 49<00:02:58.630> a.m.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
/ 75 percent coverage that's a 2 49 a.m.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.750 
/ 75 percent coverage that's a 2 49 a.m.
so<00:02:59.680> basically<00:03:00.070> that's<00:03:00.220> eastern<00:03:00.610> standard

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
so basically that's eastern standard

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.199 
so basically that's eastern standard
time<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.390> then<00:03:02.230> less<00:03:03.160> than<00:03:03.190> five<00:03:03.730> minutes<00:03:04.030> of

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
totality starts at 301 am so seven

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.440 
totality starts at 301 am so seven
several<00:03:09.280> minutes<00:03:09.640> before<00:03:10.030> and<00:03:10.150> after

the moon's disk this may be produce a
beautiful<00:03:19.420> phenomenon<00:03:20.050> this<00:03:20.230> is<00:03:20.500> the

beautiful phenomenon this is the

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.550 
beautiful phenomenon this is the
Japanese<00:03:21.220> Lantern<00:03:21.700> effect<00:03:22.090> alright<00:03:23.080> so<00:03:23.380> then

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
Japanese Lantern effect alright so then

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.820 
Japanese Lantern effect alright so then

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.580 
can glow a bright orange during other
eclipses<00:03:40.330> so<00:03:40.570> it's<00:03:41.110> going<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:41.290> be<00:03:41.380> interesting

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
eclipses so it's going to be interesting

a much greater number of stars were

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.190 
a much greater number of stars were

so<00:04:11.860> I'm<00:04:12.280> hoping<00:04:12.700> that<00:04:12.850> we<00:04:12.970> get<00:04:13.150> through<00:04:13.450> it<00:04:13.570> we

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
so I'm hoping that we get through it we

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.660 
so I'm hoping that we get through it we
can<00:04:13.900> actually<00:04:14.080> see<00:04:14.530> it<00:04:14.650> here<00:04:14.920> total<00:04:15.580> eclipse

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
there about the blast all SpaceX has

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.790 
there about the blast all SpaceX has
it's<00:04:46.420> a<00:04:46.510> private<00:04:46.720> company<00:04:46.960> they're<00:04:47.380> shooting

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
it's a private company they're shooting

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.160 
it's a private company they're shooting
their<00:04:48.250> rocket<00:04:48.610> off<00:04:48.760> it's<00:04:49.000> a<00:04:49.060> falcon<00:04:49.450> 9<00:04:49.660> leaving

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
their rocket off it's a falcon 9 leaving

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.620 
their rocket off it's a falcon 9 leaving
out<00:04:50.320> of<00:04:50.350> Cape<00:04:51.190> Canaveral<00:04:51.520> today<00:04:52.000> they're

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
out of Cape Canaveral today they're

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.540 
out of Cape Canaveral today they're
going<00:04:52.750> to<00:04:52.810> deliver<00:04:52.900> a<00:04:53.140> payload<00:04:53.350> up<00:04:53.740> to<00:04:53.890> the<00:04:53.980> ISS

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:54.550 
going to deliver a payload up to the ISS

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.120 
going to deliver a payload up to the ISS
so<00:04:54.910> just<00:04:55.180> I<00:04:55.450> know<00:04:56.080> they've<00:04:56.290> got<00:04:56.440> 12<00:04:56.800> of<00:04:56.950> them<00:04:57.070> I

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
so just I know they've got 12 of them I

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.680 
so just I know they've got 12 of them I
think<00:04:57.160> this<00:04:57.430> is<00:04:57.550> their<00:04:57.700> third<00:04:57.940> go<00:04:58.180> around<00:04:58.450> at

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
think this is their third go around at

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.090 
think this is their third go around at
it<00:04:58.840> and<00:04:58.990> that's<00:04:59.200> pretty<00:04:59.350> awesome<00:04:59.470> because<00:04:59.890> you

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
it and that's pretty awesome because you

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.130 
it and that's pretty awesome because you
know<00:05:00.220> what<00:05:00.430> spaceflight<00:05:01.060> is<00:05:01.270> hitting<00:05:01.990> the

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
know what spaceflight is hitting the

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.590 
know what spaceflight is hitting the
actual<00:05:02.680> market<00:05:02.950> where<00:05:03.280> the<00:05:03.880> entrepreneur<00:05:04.450> is

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
actual market where the entrepreneur is

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.760 
actual market where the entrepreneur is
going<00:05:04.720> to<00:05:04.780> be<00:05:04.930> able<00:05:05.110> to<00:05:05.170> take<00:05:05.350> some<00:05:05.620> of<00:05:05.710> this

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
going to be able to take some of this

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.020 
going to be able to take some of this
over<00:05:05.920> and<00:05:06.130> get<00:05:06.250> it<00:05:06.340> out<00:05:06.400> of<00:05:06.460> the<00:05:06.550> government's

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
over and get it out of the government's
