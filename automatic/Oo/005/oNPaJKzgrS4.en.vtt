Mac<00:04:01.850> and<00:04:03.950> that's<00:04:04.950> all<00:04:05.160> there<00:04:05.250> was<00:04:05.310> to<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:05.760> so

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
Mac and that's all there was to that so

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.540 
Mac and that's all there was to that so
this<00:04:06.660> little<00:04:06.870> switch<00:04:07.200> here<00:04:07.260> goes<00:04:08.160> through<00:04:08.490> a

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
this little switch here goes through a

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.660 
this little switch here goes through a
bunch<00:04:08.700> of<00:04:08.850> delayed<00:04:09.320> repeater<00:04:10.320> delays<00:04:10.680> down

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
bunch of delayed repeater delays down

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.370 
bunch of delayed repeater delays down
below<00:04:12.030> and<00:04:12.330> the<00:04:12.750> only<00:04:12.870> reason<00:04:12.959> for<00:04:13.230> the

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
below and the only reason for the

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.780 
below and the only reason for the
repeater<00:04:13.709> delays<00:04:14.040> it<00:04:14.220> so<00:04:14.280> i<00:04:14.340> can<00:04:14.489> make<00:04:14.610> sure<00:04:14.760> i

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
repeater delays it so i can make sure i

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.310 
repeater delays it so i can make sure i
was<00:04:14.970> in<00:04:15.090> exactly<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.630> right<00:04:15.750> position<00:04:15.900> before

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
was in exactly the right position before

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.580 
was in exactly the right position before
the<00:04:16.500> fireworks<00:04:16.739> went<00:04:17.130> off<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:18.049> all<00:04:19.049> that<00:04:19.260> does

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
the fireworks went off and all that does

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.099 
the fireworks went off and all that does
is<00:04:19.980> go<00:04:20.700> through<00:04:20.730> a<00:04:20.970> tunnel<00:04:21.270> and<00:04:21.479> come<00:04:21.690> out<00:04:21.870> back

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
is go through a tunnel and come out back

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.640 
is go through a tunnel and come out back
here<00:04:22.560> and<00:04:23.690> this<00:04:24.690> right<00:04:24.990> here<00:04:25.020> is<00:04:25.440> the

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
here and this right here is the

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.770 
here and this right here is the
contraption

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
contraption

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.379 
contraption
did<00:04:26.900> the<00:04:27.020> light<00:04:27.170> show<00:04:27.610> so<00:04:28.610> these<00:04:29.330> are

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
did the light show so these are

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:31.150 
did the light show so these are
dispensers<00:04:29.960> with<00:04:29.990> lots<00:04:30.440> of<00:04:30.590> fireworks<00:04:30.950> of

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.160 
dispensers with lots of fireworks of

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.530 
dispensers with lots of fireworks of
course<00:04:31.580> and<00:04:33.340> these<00:04:34.340> right<00:04:34.700> here<00:04:34.730> this<00:04:35.389> is<00:04:35.510> a

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
course and these right here this is a

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.270 
course and these right here this is a
little<00:04:35.720> random<00:04:35.960> number<00:04:36.350> generator<00:04:36.770> as<00:04:37.010> the

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
little random number generator as the

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.240 
little random number generator as the
mine<00:04:37.730> cart<00:04:37.970> goes<00:04:38.270> across<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:39.590> detector<00:04:40.040> rail

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
mine cart goes across the detector rail

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.990 
mine cart goes across the detector rail
it<00:04:40.580> will<00:04:40.730> fire<00:04:41.500> fire<00:04:42.500> fire<00:04:42.530> works<00:04:43.100> and<00:04:43.490> it<00:04:43.850> will

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
it will fire fire fire works and it will

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.040 
it will fire fire fire works and it will
also<00:04:44.470> fire<00:04:45.470> off<00:04:45.680> this<00:04:46.010> dropper<00:04:46.639> right<00:04:47.540> here

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
also fire off this dropper right here

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.830 
also fire off this dropper right here
which<00:04:48.440> will<00:04:48.850> pop<00:04:49.850> up<00:04:49.880> either<00:04:50.180> a<00:04:50.300> wooden<00:04:50.600> sword

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
which will pop up either a wooden sword

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.240 
which will pop up either a wooden sword
or<00:04:51.200> a<00:04:51.230> block<00:04:51.560> up<00:04:52.370> in<00:04:52.580> here<00:04:52.970> and<00:04:53.139> a<00:04:54.250> comparator

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
or a block up in here and a comparator

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.570 
or a block up in here and a comparator
right<00:04:55.490> here<00:04:56.620> detects<00:04:57.620> that<00:04:57.800> signal<00:04:58.280> if<00:04:58.400> it's

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
right here detects that signal if it's

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.430 
right here detects that signal if it's
the<00:04:58.760> block<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.480> signal<00:04:59.660> will<00:04:59.960> only<00:05:00.080> go<00:05:00.260> one

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
the block the signal will only go one

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.050 
the block the signal will only go one
block<00:05:00.620> so<00:05:00.980> nothing<00:05:01.250> will<00:05:01.340> happen<00:05:01.700> but<00:05:01.850> if<00:05:01.940> it's

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
block so nothing will happen but if it's

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.210 
block so nothing will happen but if it's
a<00:05:02.150> sword<00:05:02.450> the<00:05:02.750> signal<00:05:03.440> go<00:05:03.560> longer<00:05:03.950> than<00:05:03.980> one

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
a sword the signal go longer than one

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.350 
a sword the signal go longer than one
block<00:05:04.690> which<00:05:05.690> will<00:05:05.900> trigger<00:05:06.140> this<00:05:07.360> monostable

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.360 
block which will trigger this monostable

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.150 
block which will trigger this monostable
circuit<00:05:08.870> right<00:05:09.050> here<00:05:09.320> which<00:05:09.770> creates<00:05:10.070> a

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
circuit right here which creates a

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.690 
circuit right here which creates a
simple<00:05:10.460> one<00:05:10.610> tick<00:05:10.880> pulse<00:05:11.210> and<00:05:12.010> a<00:05:13.010> one<00:05:13.460> tick

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
simple one tick pulse and a one tick

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.700 
simple one tick pulse and a one tick
pulse<00:05:14.030> will<00:05:14.330> make<00:05:14.480> a<00:05:14.510> sticky<00:05:14.870> piston<00:05:15.080> drop<00:05:15.530> its

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
pulse will make a sticky piston drop its

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.630 
pulse will make a sticky piston drop its
block<00:05:16.090> so<00:05:17.090> the<00:05:17.510> one<00:05:17.690> tick<00:05:17.930> pulse<00:05:18.229> in<00:05:18.590> there<00:05:19.400> if

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
block so the one tick pulse in there if

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.420 
block so the one tick pulse in there if
we<00:05:19.700> randomly<00:05:20.390> get<00:05:20.690> our<00:05:21.169> pulse<00:05:21.530> it<00:05:21.830> will<00:05:22.100> pop

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
we randomly get our pulse it will pop

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.210 
we randomly get our pulse it will pop
this<00:05:22.610> block<00:05:22.910> over<00:05:23.390> the<00:05:23.870> beacon<00:05:24.229> here<00:05:24.500> first

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
this block over the beacon here first

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.510 
this block over the beacon here first
time<00:05:25.550> the<00:05:25.760> blue<00:05:25.970> guy<00:05:26.150> moves<00:05:27.190> that's<00:05:28.190> going<00:05:28.430> to

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:28.520 
time the blue guy moves that's going to

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.190 
time the blue guy moves that's going to
displace<00:05:28.880> this<00:05:29.360> block<00:05:29.630> and<00:05:29.930> it's<00:05:30.020> going<00:05:30.139> to

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
displace this block and it's going to

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.100 
displace this block and it's going to
turn<00:05:30.350> the<00:05:30.500> beacon<00:05:30.800> on<00:05:30.950> same<00:05:31.669> thing<00:05:31.880> over<00:05:32.000> here

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
turn the beacon on same thing over here

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.710 
turn the beacon on same thing over here
so<00:05:33.110> let's<00:05:33.320> go<00:05:33.410> ahead<00:05:33.440> and<00:05:33.590> turn<00:05:33.770> this<00:05:33.979> on<00:05:34.720> give

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
so let's go ahead and turn this on give

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.200 
so let's go ahead and turn this on give
me<00:05:35.780> a<00:05:35.810> lever<00:05:36.020> thank<00:05:36.650> you<00:05:36.860> and<00:05:37.130> we'll<00:05:37.910> show<00:05:38.180> you

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
me a lever thank you and we'll show you

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:41.380 
me a lever thank you and we'll show you
how<00:05:38.390> this<00:05:38.540> were<00:05:38.720> have<00:05:39.050> a<00:05:39.080> lever<00:05:39.290> nevermind<00:05:40.390> see

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
how this were have a lever nevermind see

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:46.170 
how this were have a lever nevermind see
there<00:05:41.660> it's<00:05:41.870> firing<00:05:42.169> off<00:05:42.500> the<00:05:44.260> firing<00:05:45.260> off<00:05:45.380> the

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
there it's firing off the firing off the

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.670 
there it's firing off the firing off the
rockets<00:05:47.180> and<00:05:49.270> here's<00:05:50.270> a<00:05:50.330> one<00:05:50.720> and<00:05:50.900> you<00:05:51.590> know

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
rockets and here's a one and you know

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.230 
rockets and here's a one and you know
fifty<00:05:51.979> percent<00:05:52.250> chance<00:05:52.550> that<00:05:52.789> any<00:05:53.060> one<00:05:53.210> of

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 
fifty percent chance that any one of

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.890 
fifty percent chance that any one of
these<00:05:53.360> guys<00:05:53.600> will<00:05:53.840> fire<00:05:54.340> and<00:05:55.340> when<00:05:55.550> they<00:05:55.700> do

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:55.900 
these guys will fire and when they do

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.270 
these guys will fire and when they do
they<00:05:56.900> pop<00:05:57.169> one<00:05:57.410> of<00:05:57.440> these<00:05:57.530> colored<00:05:58.010> blocks

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
they pop one of these colored blocks

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.640 
they pop one of these colored blocks
over<00:05:58.640> and<00:05:59.060> as<00:05:59.570> you<00:05:59.750> can<00:05:59.900> see<00:05:59.930> different<00:06:00.289> color

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
over and as you can see different color

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.570 
over and as you can see different color
blocks<00:06:01.010> make<00:06:01.430> the<00:06:02.800> make<00:06:03.800> the<00:06:03.950> beacons<00:06:04.280> change

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
blocks make the make the beacons change

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.340 
blocks make the make the beacons change
colors<00:06:05.320> so<00:06:06.320> it's<00:06:06.500> as<00:06:06.650> simple<00:06:06.830> as<00:06:07.070> that<00:06:08.350> pretty

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
colors so it's as simple as that pretty

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.100 
colors so it's as simple as that pretty
simple<00:06:09.500> little<00:06:09.770> device<00:06:12.400> nothing<00:06:13.400> too<00:06:13.580> fancy

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
simple little device nothing too fancy

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:16.210 
simple little device nothing too fancy
I've<00:06:15.110> been<00:06:15.229> thinking<00:06:15.410> about<00:06:15.680> maybe<00:06:16.070> doing

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
I've been thinking about maybe doing

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.040 
I've been thinking about maybe doing
something<00:06:16.700> a<00:06:16.850> little<00:06:16.970> fancier<00:06:17.600> with<00:06:17.810> this

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:18.050 
something a little fancier with this

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.810 
something a little fancier with this
maybe<00:06:18.410> finding<00:06:19.039> a<00:06:19.160> way<00:06:19.310> to<00:06:19.340> extend<00:06:19.789> this<00:06:20.150> a<00:06:20.210> bit

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
maybe finding a way to extend this a bit

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.670 
maybe finding a way to extend this a bit
more<00:06:22.820> compact<00:06:23.270> it<00:06:23.479> I<00:06:23.660> would<00:06:24.169> think<00:06:24.380> there

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
more compact it I would think there

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.100 
more compact it I would think there
ought<00:06:24.710> to<00:06:24.830> be<00:06:24.979> a<00:06:25.039> way<00:06:25.250> to<00:06:25.280> take<00:06:25.669> this

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
ought to be a way to take this

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.440 
ought to be a way to take this
can<00:06:26.620> cat<00:06:26.830> get<00:06:27.070> right<00:06:27.250> down<00:06:27.280> to<00:06:27.520> a<00:06:27.760> really<00:06:28.120> small

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.450 
can cat get right down to a really small

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:35.400 
can cat get right down to a really small
size<00:06:28.920> but<00:06:30.540> for<00:06:31.540> now<00:06:31.660> this<00:06:31.900> is<00:06:31.960> good<00:06:32.260> enough<00:06:34.410> you

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:35.410 
size but for now this is good enough you

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.350 
size but for now this is good enough you
end<00:06:35.560> up<00:06:35.740> with<00:06:35.860> kind<00:06:36.100> of<00:06:36.190> a<00:06:36.310> random<00:06:36.550> color<00:06:37.000> thing

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:37.360 
end up with kind of a random color thing

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.130 
end up with kind of a random color thing
