00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.760
 hi i am andre and this is the htc one 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:10.760
 sv 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.420
 the one sv comes with an adapter 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.210
 a micro usb cable and of course one 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.740
 headset 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.730
 we see the one sv closer 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.770
 at the top like 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.000
 usually a speaker grill 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.830
 in addition windows phones facing camera 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.470
 and there under the screen 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.470
 this is a 4.3 inch super lcd2 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.640
 screen resolution of 480 by 800 pixels 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.440
 we will naturally look at it immediately 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.030
 then again we find three tics 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.339
 buttons as you are used to with android 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.110
 htc devices all the way in there 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:41.159
 we find a microphone and a micro-usb 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.629
 gate 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:44.670
 to the right of that we only find the 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.019
 volume buttons on the top and 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.670
 we find the on and off button 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.860
 a second microphone and a headset 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.479
 gate on the left side 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.220
 nothing go to the back 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.530
 find a 5 megapixel camera with that 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.199
 we can still see the flash at the very bottom 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.210
 a speaker grill well then we go it 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.589
 just open the device which is more difficult 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.180
 equally well your nails the in between 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.129
 but according to you can tailgate 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.040
 easy removal in the rear cover 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.840
 we see processed and NSC chicken 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.550
 well how bad that away we see here 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.100
 of course still a micro sd card inside 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.100
 lock a sim card slot and the battery 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.650
 Now go watch by exactly one sv 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.090
 works for that will entice him 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.400
 see the usual android lok 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.490
 screen of htc what would take a while 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.940
 there is a sense layer over it, so the layer 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.210
 from 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.340
 will from itself well and therefore and 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.270
 who makes sure that yes things do pretty well 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.590
 look different 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.630
 you see of you have a certain widgets 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.980
 who normally don't have but 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.270
 in fact it actually comes to the same 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.409
 down we see widget seen 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.730
 shortcuts and we see some 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.320
 tabs 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.600
 run behind the scenes on android 4 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.760
 point 0 unfortunately not four point one the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.200
 version of sencys is the latest version 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.120
 which we also with all other devices 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.210
 learn to see that have just been released 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.770
 well we see some adjustments here 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.240
 entails you considering it too 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.310
 overview of all apps 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.180
 yes that also looks slightly different 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.400
 from then 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.930
 hema standard with android you can do that 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.790
 even at your own discretion 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.100
 set and adjust the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.890
 order of how those apps are displayed 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.570
 then we go back a little, we'll see here 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.400
 above the notification screen 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.200
 the settings also that list looks 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.370
 Something different from HC which is another fun 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.050
 effect if we 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.370
 yes if we go down and it is possible 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.470
 no longer within frame 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.730
 kind of a harmonica effect for draft 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.980
 the device has 1.2 gigahertz 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.380
 by core processor provides one 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.459
 device runs reasonably smoothly 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.220
 yes you didn't notice it that way 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.510
 very quickly hiccups you open an application 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.100
 on your more heavy applications 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.410
 at the same time 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.850
 yes then you see that yes it sometimes 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.950
 a bit slower than 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.110
 for example the top models of htc 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.690
 but in principle yes it doesn't matter 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.520
 many problems can still take a look 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.410
 to the screen the screen displays the 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.020
 colors very nice weather is a super lcd2 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.700
 screen only the screen does not have one 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:56.459
 very high resolution has a resolution 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.340
 from 480 to 800 so nowadays anyway 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.620
 we see that screen more often towards the 720 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.910
 go hd ready resolution 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.070
 yes that is sometimes possible with small ones 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.070
 fine print we see here 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.720
 just a trailer after those two and we 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.670
 see that the screen itself is the 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.840
 colors so well 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.840
 the speaker can also be quite loud 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.830
 and of course this device has like 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.420
 all new hc is also about the beats 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.450
 audio functionality that you can 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.280
 in the settings screen 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:31.569
 beats audio card is on or off on 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.430
 this just have no headset in the 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.630
 we do not see that setting again moment 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.769
 you do it's in you can directly 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.230
 you a notification screen 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.480
 things on or off'm still here 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.290
 look at the browser 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.290
 ok internet 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.130
 we are now on your iphone 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.430
 we go to our website for a moment 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.980
 like that for the first time see that 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.330
 he just really feels stupid we 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.220
 4life are there but still 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.870
 everything is rendered very quickly see 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.610
 no plaster at all or something like that 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.750
 can also zoom in very easily and 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.430
 zoom out 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.620
 everything will be just fine and fast 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.239
 rendered as it should be and yes here 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.739
 so sees the problem a bit 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.170
 screen and slightly low resolution 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.819
 if you then if you then smaller text 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.109
 then it is just a little less 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.669
 nice way than a screen with high 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.139
 resolution 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.150
 well let's take a look at the 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.370
 camera functionalities of the one sv 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.260
 we now see the camera application in 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.060
 well use i make a simple photo 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.039
 by simply pressing the camera button 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.360
 see that tunnels go pretty fast 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.160
 We can also take each other night photo 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.080
 extend the focal point by 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.550
 simply by shifting them she protects 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.530
 find the one I want in the bottom right 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.910
 gallery back then find links here 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.350
 default settings and such as one 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.030
 find flash settings here 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.669
 more extensive settings such as 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:47.830
 resolution quality of the video you can 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.320
 all adjustments according to their own 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.510
 At the bottom left you will find a number 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.560
 cameras there are choices HDR 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:55.479
 choose option or for example the 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.010
 panorama to the top right something else 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.889
 nice different filters 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.810
 if we have different filters here 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.860
 tick also see that it becomes the same 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:04.479
 applied 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.729
 well in itself nice with your instagram 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:07.950
 handy behind you that it's right 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.389

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.560
 photos are made on 5 megapixels and 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.460
 we are also going to have a look at one 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.960
 movie 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.630
 we see a video recorded here with 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.669
 htc one sv the sound comes from the 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:23.880
 internal microphone recorded the movies 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:23.880
 720 p in the maximum resolution is 1080 p 

00:05:24.619 --> 00:05:30.210
 the one sv does not have android 4 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:31.619
 point one but android 4 point 0 pity 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.089
 that they are not right and the last one 

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:34.740
 version 

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:38.990
 in addition, this screen in resolution of 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.990
 only 800 by 480 pixels 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:44.490
 by the materials used and its 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.929
 format feet one sv very nice 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.369
 in addition, the internal memory can be turned off 

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:50.129
 extend through a micro sd 

00:05:47.369 --> 00:05:53.809
 card slot and finally the device goes 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:53.809
