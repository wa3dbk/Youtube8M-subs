isn't<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.719> mostly<00:00:43.110> theory<00:00:43.590> though<00:00:43.739> so

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
isn't this is mostly theory though so

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.240 
isn't this is mostly theory though so
it's<00:00:44.910> nothing<00:00:45.649> completing<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.770> confirmed

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
it's nothing completing is confirmed

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.709 
it's nothing completing is confirmed
about<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.700> like<00:00:47.940> everything<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.690> see

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
about this like everything you can see

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.420 
about this like everything you can see
but<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.500> timeline<00:00:49.860> can't<00:00:50.160> be<00:00:50.250> confirmed

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
but the timeline can't be confirmed

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.729 
but the timeline can't be confirmed
until<00:00:50.760> Scott<00:00:51.690> actually<00:00:52.110> puts<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.530> game

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
until Scott actually puts in the game

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.860 
until Scott actually puts in the game
that<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.399> timelines<00:00:53.850> are<00:00:54.030> they're<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.629> ones

be<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.820> very<00:01:45.000> first<00:01:45.240> family<00:01:45.390> diner<00:01:45.750> but<00:01:46.110> we

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
be and a very first family diner but we

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.200 
be and a very first family diner but we
don't<00:01:46.710> know<00:01:46.860> that<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.369> I'm<00:01:47.520> not<00:01:47.700> really<00:01:48.000> gonna

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
don't know that so I'm not really gonna

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.780 
don't know that so I'm not really gonna
put<00:01:48.479> it<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.770> actual<00:01:50.009> tunnel<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.460> just<00:01:50.670> in

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
put it in the actual tunnel in just in

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.940 
put it in the actual tunnel in just in
case<00:01:50.970> but<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.750> once<00:01:52.020> again<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.470> mostly

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
case but in once again this is mostly

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.780 
case but in once again this is mostly
theory<00:01:53.340> then<00:01:54.090> we<00:01:54.270> got<00:01:54.420> see<00:01:54.659> with<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.460> new<00:01:56.460> toy

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
theory then we got see with the new toy

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.969 
theory then we got see with the new toy
versions<00:01:57.270> as<00:01:57.450> well<00:01:57.479> which<00:01:57.840> makes<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.320> more

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
versions as well which makes it more

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.459 
versions as well which makes it more
what's<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.790> cold<00:02:00.030> No<00:02:00.600> Child<00:02:00.780> Franny<00:02:01.140> that's

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
what's the cold No Child Franny that's

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.100 
what's the cold No Child Franny that's
why<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:02.399> they<00:02:02.579> don't<00:02:02.759> show<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.540> old<00:02:03.810> weird

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
why that they don't show the old weird

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.109 
why that they don't show the old weird
visions<00:02:04.590> which<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:05.369> know<00:02:05.490> makes<00:02:05.700> sense<00:02:05.969> you

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
visions which you know makes sense you

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.240 
visions which you know makes sense you
want<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.360> do<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.719> normal<00:02:07.530> fredbear<00:02:07.920> speech

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
want to do it a normal fredbear speech

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.309 
want to do it a normal fredbear speech
with<00:02:08.670> it<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:09.179> know<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.509> animatronics<00:02:10.229> you

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
with it you know the animatronics you

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.370 
with it you know the animatronics you
wanna<00:02:10.530> have<00:02:11.009> some<00:02:11.250> nice<00:02:11.640> child<00:02:12.120> Franny<00:02:12.480> and

wanna have some nice child Franny and

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.020 
wanna have some nice child Franny and
tronox<00:02:13.680> are<00:02:13.800> proud<00:02:13.980> then<00:02:14.220> we<00:02:14.310> got<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.520> do<00:02:14.790> in

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
tronox are proud then we got to do in

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.290 
tronox are proud then we got to do in
the<00:02:15.480> very<00:02:15.660> first<00:02:16.020> game<00:02:16.260> we<00:02:16.440> go<00:02:16.590> see<00:02:16.920> in<00:02:17.130> 1993<00:02:18.120> is

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
the very first game we go see in 1993 is

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.550 
the very first game we go see in 1993 is
the<00:02:18.990> old<00:02:19.470> versions<00:02:20.130> but<00:02:20.460> more<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.720> guess<00:02:22.050> more

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
the old versions but more I guess more

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.710 
the old versions but more I guess more
advanced<00:02:22.920> they<00:02:23.280> had<00:02:23.460> more<00:02:23.820> barren<00:02:24.180> technology

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
advanced they had more barren technology

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.900 
advanced they had more barren technology
face<00:02:25.470> record<00:02:25.830> well<00:02:26.040> I<00:02:26.220> guess<00:02:26.490> the<00:02:26.700> Freddy

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
face record well I guess the Freddy

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.600 
face record well I guess the Freddy
fazbear's<00:02:27.360> has<00:02:27.510> like<00:02:28.110> better<00:02:28.560> for<00:02:28.890> most<00:02:29.340> cold

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
fazbear's has like better for most cold

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.120 
fazbear's has like better for most cold
I<00:02:29.760> recognition<00:02:30.480> all<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:31.140> stuff<00:02:31.440> so<00:02:31.620> that's

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
I recognition all that stuff so that's

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.950 
I recognition all that stuff so that's
quite<00:02:32.280> s<00:02:32.760> is<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.180> very<00:02:33.330> confusing<00:02:33.720> if<00:02:33.900> you

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
quite s is it very confusing if you

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.810 
quite s is it very confusing if you
don't<00:02:34.140> understand<00:02:34.590> what<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:34.830> but<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.460> don't

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
don't understand what that but I don't

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.100 
don't understand what that but I don't
really<00:02:35.910> want<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.120> talk<00:02:36.240> too<00:02:36.480> much<00:02:36.600> about<00:02:36.660> that

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
really want to talk too much about that

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.470 
really want to talk too much about that
so<00:02:37.650> yeah<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.130> with<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.400> very<00:02:38.610> newest<00:02:39.270> one

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
so yeah and with the very newest one

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.900 
so yeah and with the very newest one
wish<00:02:39.630> is<00:02:39.750> about<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:39.960> come<00:02:40.110> out<00:02:40.320> is<00:02:40.580> 2017<00:02:41.580> this

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
wish is about to come out is 2017 this

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.630 
wish is about to come out is 2017 this
honestly<00:02:42.900> I<00:02:42.990> think<00:02:43.140> this<00:02:43.620> animatronic<00:02:44.040> was

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
honestly I think this animatronic was

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.850 
honestly I think this animatronic was
back<00:02:45.240> in<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.600> very<00:02:45.840> first<00:02:46.080> game<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.350> be<00:02:46.560> honest

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
back in the very first game to be honest

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.310 
back in the very first game to be honest
i<00:02:47.010> believe<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:48.030> was<00:02:48.300> some<00:02:48.840> sort<00:02:48.990> of<00:02:49.080> prototype

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
i believe it was some sort of prototype

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.990 
i believe it was some sort of prototype
of<00:02:49.680> something<00:02:49.920> like<00:02:49.980> that<00:02:50.220> which<00:02:50.760> they

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
of something like that which they

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.420 
of something like that which they
weren't<00:02:51.750> really<00:02:51.930> fond<00:02:52.260> of<00:02:52.470> or<00:02:52.740> maybe<00:02:53.040> it's<00:02:53.280> too

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
weren't really fond of or maybe it's too

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.950 
weren't really fond of or maybe it's too
expensive<00:02:53.670> something<00:02:54.360> they<00:02:54.480> had<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.720> get<00:02:54.840> rid

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
expensive something they had to get rid

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.410 
expensive something they had to get rid
of<00:02:55.020> it<00:02:55.170> replace<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.160> with<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.340> more<00:02:56.730> less<00:02:57.090> cheap

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
of it replace it with a more less cheap

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.440 
of it replace it with a more less cheap
well<00:02:58.410> more<00:02:58.590> cheap<00:02:58.860> i<00:02:59.010> should<00:02:59.220> say<00:02:59.430> than<00:03:00.090> the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
well more cheap i should say than the

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.150 
well more cheap i should say than the
very<00:03:00.600> first<00:03:00.870> prototype<00:03:01.290> which<00:03:01.410> they<00:03:01.560> made<00:03:01.800> or

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
very first prototype which they made or

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.790 
very first prototype which they made or
maybe<00:03:02.550> it<00:03:02.760> was<00:03:02.820> unstable<00:03:03.360> who<00:03:03.750> knows<00:03:03.990> maybe<00:03:04.710> we

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
maybe it was unstable who knows maybe we

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.770 
maybe it was unstable who knows maybe we
just<00:03:04.980> went<00:03:05.160> on<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.340> killing<00:03:05.550> spree<00:03:05.760> because<00:03:06.300> if

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
just went on a killing spree because if

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.140 
just went on a killing spree because if
I<00:03:07.050> first<00:03:07.290> game<00:03:07.530> freddie<00:03:08.310> was<00:03:08.490> actually

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.150 
I first game freddie was actually
friendly<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:09.870> he<00:03:10.020> didn't<00:03:10.380> kill<00:03:10.530> anyone<00:03:10.740> till

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
friendly and he didn't kill anyone till

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.670 
friendly and he didn't kill anyone till
he<00:03:11.610> witnessed<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.120> deaths<00:03:12.390> so<00:03:12.840> that's<00:03:13.470> pretty

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
he witnessed the deaths so that's pretty
