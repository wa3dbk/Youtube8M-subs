now<00:03:04.480> I<00:03:04.810> think<00:03:05.230> by<00:03:05.380> default<00:03:05.440> it<00:03:06.040> assigns<00:03:06.850> it<00:03:07.030> to

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
now I think by default it assigns it to

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.500 
now I think by default it assigns it to
the<00:03:07.560> kick<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.770> bass<00:03:08.950> drum<00:03:11.910> let<00:03:12.910> me<00:03:13.090> minimize

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
the kick the bass drum let me minimize

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.330 
the kick the bass drum let me minimize
this<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.290> bring<00:03:14.440> it<00:03:14.560> in<00:03:14.680> where<00:03:14.800> you<00:03:14.890> guys<00:03:15.040> can

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
see it I'm using dual monitors so it's

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:29.930 
see it I'm using dual monitors so it's
kind<00:03:22.780> of<00:03:22.870> dropping<00:03:23.290> things<00:03:23.320> where<00:03:23.770> it<00:03:23.920> wants

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.770

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.239 
I'm going to zoom way out where it all

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.300 
I'm going to zoom way out where it all
fits<00:03:37.540> in<00:03:38.520> and<00:03:39.520> if<00:03:40.180> you<00:03:40.330> do<00:03:40.480> this<00:03:40.630> for<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:41.310> snare

converting an audio track to a MIDI

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:45.019 
converting an audio track to a MIDI
track<00:04:40.800> and<00:04:41.089> a<00:04:42.089> hurry<00:04:43.460> I'm<00:04:44.460> not<00:04:44.669> sure<00:04:44.879> if<00:04:44.969> you
