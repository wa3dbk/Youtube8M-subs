00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.940
 hello people welcome to the frame 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.469
 Let's study in this lesson the balance 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.529
 steam link 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.299
 considering the emission and condensation 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:18.970
 of substances 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.420
 let's start first with a small 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.560
 review when we provide heat to 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.910
 the liquid it increases its temperature 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:34.210
 up to a maximum temperature that is equal to 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.390
 vaporization temperature when the 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.329
 start the vaporization at the temperature 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.870
 remains constant until all 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.690
 liquid has become steam 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.079
 when this happens we continue to 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:54.399
 supply heat to the vapor temperature 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.920
 rising again considering steam now 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.839
 of the same substance when we 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.190
 we cool the steam 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:07.570
 it loses heat to a temperature that 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.240
 is the condensation temperature when the 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.970
 condensation have begun, ie the 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.850
 transformation of the vapor into liquid 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.760
 while the substance loses heat to 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.610
 temperature remains constant 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.400
 after all steam has been converted into 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.720
 the system will continue to lose 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.230
 heat again the temperature will 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.960
 decrease 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:35.380
 you already know that during the changes 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.380
 physical condition with there are two 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.740
 physical states of the same substance 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:46.030
 in the case of vaporization and condensation 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:49.350
 liquid and vapor states 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.710
 as well as for the merger and 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.420
 solidification of the amount of heat 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.930
 provided for the substance during the 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.420
 vaporization is equal to the amount of 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.250
 heat that the substance loses during 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.670
 condensation process 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:11.349
 if we consider water the heat 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:14.769
 latent vaporization is equal to 540 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:15.969
 calories per gram that considering the 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.370
 right water 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:22.379
 since the latent heat with dem 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.849
 the water action equals minus 540 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:27.720
 calories per gram so you can 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:32.260
 to realize that the amount of heat 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:35.290
 received and lost is the same changes the mode 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.489
 because the + sign indicates that the body 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.409
 or the substance is receiving heat and the 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.360
 sign indicates that it is 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:46.780
 losing heat 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.349
 analyzing the influence of pressure on 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:53.650
 the vaporization temperature you saw 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:55.720
 in classes on phase diagrams that the 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.379
 from point t 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.359
 there is a curve for vaporization 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:05.319
 of substances 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:08.409
 this curve is practically the same for 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.890
 all substances do not equal but it is 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:14.950
 similar it has the same format 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.609
 What you realize here is that as you 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:22.889
 in which we have increased the pressure on 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:27.180
 substance at the vaporization temperature 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:31.389
 also increases the greater the pressure 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:34.450
 the higher the vaporization temperature 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:38.440
 substances and one of the factors that 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:41.260
 change the pressure is the altitude you already 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.220
 have seen some examples of this let's 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:48.190
 consider water imagine a family 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.519
 boiling water in rio de janeiro river 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.269
 January is at an altitude of 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.599
 from the sea 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:59.500
 there the temperature of the water 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:03.160
 is equal to 100 degrees centigrade a 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:07.750
 family located in Brasilia that is 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:10.209
 a thousand 170 meters altitude can 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.319
 boil the same amount of water to a 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:17.380
 temperature less than 96 degrees and 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:22.139
 Bolivians living in the peace that is 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:25.270
 3,700 meters above sea level can 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:27.849
 vaporize the water at a temperature still 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.080
 less than 87 degrees 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:32.169
 this proves that the increase in altitude 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.349
 decreases 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:37.840
 the boiling temperature of the water and the 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:41.349
 enem has explored this a few times 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:43.479
 and we'll see how the enem 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:47.849
 worked this content 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.849
