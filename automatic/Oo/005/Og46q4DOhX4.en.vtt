into<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.960> core<00:02:07.320> of<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.500> engine<00:02:07.980> because<00:02:08.310> it

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
into the core of the engine because it

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.889 
into the core of the engine because it
gives<00:02:08.640> us<00:02:08.790> additional<00:02:09.360> performance

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
gives us additional performance

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
as well as reducing engine weight

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:16.730 
as well as reducing engine weight
considerably<00:02:15.750> because<00:02:15.930> these<00:02:16.140> composite

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
considerably because these composite

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.740 
considerably because these composite
