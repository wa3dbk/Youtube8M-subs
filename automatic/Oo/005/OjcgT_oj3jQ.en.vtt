when<00:00:00.480> I<00:00:00.599> was<00:00:00.750> a<00:00:00.780> child<00:00:00.870> I<00:00:01.469> was<00:00:01.800> fascinated<00:00:01.829> by

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
when I was a child I was fascinated by

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.900 
when I was a child I was fascinated by
telepathy<00:00:03.510> in<00:00:04.020> science<00:00:04.500> fiction<00:00:04.950> in<00:00:05.310> fact<00:00:05.730> I

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
telepathy in science fiction in fact I

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.330 
telepathy in science fiction in fact I
tried<00:00:06.210> really<00:00:06.600> hard<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:07.200> read<00:00:07.529> other<00:00:07.859> people's

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
tried really hard to read other people's

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.060 
tried really hard to read other people's
minds<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.389> project<00:00:09.809> my<00:00:10.019> thoughts<00:00:10.050> into<00:00:10.800> other

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
minds to project my thoughts into other

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.669 
minds to project my thoughts into other
people's<00:00:11.550> heads<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.840> came<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.500> the

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
people's heads and I came to the

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.060 
people's heads and I came to the
conclusion<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.880> maybe<00:00:15.509> telepaths<00:00:16.350> do<00:00:16.800> walk

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
conclusion that maybe telepaths do walk

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.550 
conclusion that maybe telepaths do walk
the<00:00:17.279> surface<00:00:17.670> of<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.910> earth<00:00:17.990> but<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.230> wasn't

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
the surface of the earth but I wasn't

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.390 
the surface of the earth but I wasn't
one<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:19.920> them

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
one of them

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.870 
one of them
now<00:00:21.119> I'm<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.779> physicist<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:23.010> realized<00:00:23.519> that

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
now I'm a physicist and I realized that

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.750 
now I'm a physicist and I realized that
with<00:00:24.210> all<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.930> electromagnetic<00:00:25.740> probes<00:00:26.550> that

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
with all the electromagnetic probes that

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.150 
with all the electromagnetic probes that
we<00:00:26.910> have<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.689> human<00:00:28.019> brain<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:29.010> can

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
we have of the human brain we can

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.429 
we have of the human brain we can
actually<00:00:29.369> see<00:00:29.730> thoughts<00:00:30.179> ricocheting<00:00:31.019> across

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
actually see thoughts ricocheting across

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.799 
actually see thoughts ricocheting across
the<00:00:31.710> brain<00:00:31.949> itself<00:00:32.369> we<00:00:32.610> can<00:00:32.759> see<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.210> thinking

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
the brain itself we can see the thinking

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.950 
the brain itself we can see the thinking
living<00:00:34.290> brain<00:00:34.500> as<00:00:34.800> it<00:00:35.489> thinks<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.719> can

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
living brain as it thinks and we can

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.560 
living brain as it thinks and we can
create<00:00:37.290> computer<00:00:38.010> simulations<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.910> this<00:00:39.149> to

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
create computer simulations of this to

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.020 
create computer simulations of this to
understand<00:00:40.230> what<00:00:40.530> people<00:00:40.860> are<00:00:40.950> thinking<00:00:41.030> so

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
understand what people are thinking so

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.170 
understand what people are thinking so
at<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.239> present<00:00:42.629> time<00:00:42.660> telepathy<00:00:43.520> exists<00:00:44.520> for

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
at the present time telepathy exists for

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.389 
at the present time telepathy exists for
example<00:00:45.320> look<00:00:46.320> at<00:00:46.469> my<00:00:46.530> colleague<00:00:47.129> Stephen

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
example look at my colleague Stephen

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.090 
example look at my colleague Stephen
Hawking<00:00:47.910> he's<00:00:48.510> lost<00:00:48.809> control<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.320> his<00:00:49.680> fingers

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
Hawking he's lost control of his fingers

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.160 
Hawking he's lost control of his fingers
now<00:00:50.309> so<00:00:50.579> he<00:00:50.730> cannot<00:00:51.030> communicate<00:00:51.539> even<00:00:51.930> with

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
now so he cannot communicate even with

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.010 
now so he cannot communicate even with
the<00:00:52.289> laptop<00:00:52.680> computer<00:00:53.000> but<00:00:54.000> look<00:00:54.600> at<00:00:54.840> his

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the laptop computer but look at his

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.709 
the laptop computer but look at his
right<00:00:55.379> frame<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:55.980> his<00:00:56.340> glasses<00:00:56.510> there's<00:00:57.510> an

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
right frame of his glasses there's an

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.010 
right frame of his glasses there's an
EEG<00:00:58.170> sensor<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.309> picks<00:00:59.520> up<00:00:59.730> radio<00:01:00.539> waves

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020

from his brain decodes that and he's

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.750 
from his brain decodes that and he's
allowed<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.379> manipulate<00:01:04.920> to<00:01:05.070> some<00:01:05.280> degree<00:01:05.640> a

exoskeleton<00:02:10.530> by<00:02:11.520> which<00:02:11.819> they<00:02:12.060> can<00:02:12.120> become

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
exoskeleton by which they can become

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.800 
exoskeleton by which they can become
Iron<00:02:12.690> Man

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
Iron Man

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.620 
Iron Man
and<00:02:14.050> so<00:02:14.830> Ironman<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.610> not<00:02:15.850> simply<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.360> question

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
and so Ironman is not simply a question

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.900 
and so Ironman is not simply a question
of<00:02:16.930> science<00:02:17.350> fiction<00:02:17.770> it's<00:02:18.250> something<00:02:18.700> that

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
of science fiction it's something that

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.180 
of science fiction it's something that
we<00:02:19.180> can<00:02:19.420> actually<00:02:19.630> visualize<00:02:20.170> in<00:02:20.770> the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
we can actually visualize in the

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.300 
we can actually visualize in the

on<00:02:24.520> top<00:02:24.819> of<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.209> brain<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:26.110> can<00:02:26.290> actually<00:02:26.620> put

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
on top of the brain you can actually put

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.790 
on top of the brain you can actually put
sensors<00:02:27.880> directly<00:02:28.750> into<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.410> brain<00:02:29.590> itself

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
sensors directly into the brain itself

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.790 
sensors directly into the brain itself
that<00:02:30.370> are<00:02:30.580> like<00:02:30.760> hair<00:02:31.270> like<00:02:31.630> thin<00:02:32.110> fibers

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:46.500 
are chronically depressed it turns out
that<00:02:44.950> when<00:02:45.069> you<00:02:45.160> put<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.340> brain<00:02:45.610> scan<00:02:46.000> put<00:02:46.390> them

this depression by putting in probes you

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.420 
this depression by putting in probes you
can<00:02:55.570> dampen<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.350> electrical<00:02:56.830> activity<00:02:56.980> of

this and all of a sudden they're cured
on<00:03:00.610> one<00:03:00.880> hand<00:03:01.180> you<00:03:01.330> see<00:03:01.510> somebody<00:03:01.900> who's

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
afterwards they're just cured it's

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.520 
afterwards they're just cured it's
remarkable<00:03:09.850> but<00:03:10.450> this<00:03:10.630> is<00:03:10.810> just<00:03:11.050> another

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:16.719 
in Kyoto and at Berkeley what you do is

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:19.110 
in Kyoto and at Berkeley what you do is
you<00:05:17.379> put<00:05:17.650> the<00:05:17.680> patient<00:05:18.069> in<00:05:18.550> an<00:05:18.729> MRI<00:05:18.969> scanner

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
you put the patient in an MRI scanner

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.619 
you put the patient in an MRI scanner
and<00:05:19.750> he<00:05:19.990> falls<00:05:20.259> asleep<00:05:20.909> the<00:05:21.909> brain<00:05:21.939> is<00:05:22.449> then

00:05:22.619 --> 00:05:22.629 
and he falls asleep the brain is then

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:26.249 
and he falls asleep the brain is then
scanned<00:05:23.020> creating<00:05:23.800> 30,000<00:05:24.699> dots<00:05:24.909> a<00:05:25.259> computer

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:26.259 
scanned creating 30,000 dots a computer
