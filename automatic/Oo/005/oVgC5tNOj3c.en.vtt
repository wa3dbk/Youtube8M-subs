00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
you can s alive them right no problem

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.080 
you can s alive them right no problem
and<00:03:02.860> so<00:03:02.950> what<00:03:03.070> Origin<00:03:03.370> PC<00:03:03.400> did<00:03:03.880> is<00:03:04.000> they

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
and so what Origin PC did is they

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.460 
and so what Origin PC did is they
demonstrated<00:03:04.570> how<00:03:04.720> you<00:03:04.780> can<00:03:05.020> combine<00:03:05.170> both

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
demonstrated how you can combine both

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.620 
demonstrated how you can combine both
solutions<00:03:05.830> to<00:03:06.190> create<00:03:06.430> an<00:03:06.490> ultimate<00:03:06.850> PC<00:03:07.210> this

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
solutions to create an ultimate PC this

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.060 
solutions to create an ultimate PC this
is<00:03:07.750> really<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.170> beauty<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.530> all<00:03:08.680> of<00:03:08.830> it<00:03:08.920> this

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
is really the beauty and all of it this

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:10.640 
is really the beauty and all of it this
is<00:03:09.130> why<00:03:09.340> a<00:03:09.400> stack<00:03:09.730> of<00:03:09.790> P&amp;Y<00:03:10.150> got<00:03:10.480> together

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
is why a stack of P&amp;Y got together

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.720 
is why a stack of P&amp;Y got together
origin<00:03:11.650> is<00:03:11.770> done<00:03:12.040> an<00:03:12.190> excellent<00:03:12.520> job

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
origin is done an excellent job

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.160 
origin is done an excellent job
demonstrating<00:03:13.480> just<00:03:13.510> how<00:03:13.750> far<00:03:14.050> this

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
demonstrating just how far this

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.440 
demonstrating just how far this
technology<00:03:14.740> can<00:03:14.890> go<00:03:15.070> this<00:03:15.820> is<00:03:16.000> super<00:03:16.150> Mesa

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
technology can go this is super Mesa

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.320 
technology can go this is super Mesa
