00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.760 
we're going to comment and then you
would<00:01:47.160> have<00:01:47.810> Starbound<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:49.020> here<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.530> you

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
would have Starbound in here and you

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.219 
would have Starbound in here and you
would<00:01:49.860> follow<00:01:50.039> this<00:01:50.280> a<00:01:50.399> very<00:01:51.179> similar<00:01:51.599> path<00:01:51.810> so

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
would follow this a very similar path so

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.419 
would follow this a very similar path so
if<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.190> move<00:01:53.429> back<00:01:53.489> into<00:01:54.119> here<00:01:54.890> similar<00:01:55.890> every<00:01:56.190> C

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
if I move back into here similar every C

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:02.620 
if I move back into here similar every C
Maps<00:01:57.020> common<00:01:58.020> wrong<00:01:58.500> one

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.210 

wrong<00:02:03.630> 100<00:02:04.290> here<00:02:05.280> we<00:02:05.400> are

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.620 
wrong 100 here we are
Starbound<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.640> then<00:02:08.760> we<00:02:08.850> obviously<00:02:09.030> just<00:02:09.450> go

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
Starbound and then we obviously just go

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.590 
Starbound and then we obviously just go

what<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.209> is<00:03:06.360> doing<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.690> making<00:03:06.900> sure<00:03:07.220> you

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
what this is doing is making sure you

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.699 
what this is doing is making sure you
have<00:03:08.370> permission<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:09.120> load<00:03:10.080> up<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.320> game

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:16.900 

so<00:03:15.709> now<00:03:15.800> we<00:03:15.860> have<00:03:16.010> the<00:03:16.099> launcher<00:03:16.520> it's<00:03:16.640> pretty

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
so now we have the launcher it's pretty

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.589 
so now we have the launcher it's pretty
standard<00:03:17.120> normally<00:03:17.810> that<00:03:18.310> normal<00:03:19.390> same<00:03:20.390> as<00:03:20.510> it

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
standard normally that normal same as it

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.240 
standard normally that normal same as it
was<00:03:20.720> before<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.620> this<00:03:21.800> time<00:03:21.860> I'm<00:03:22.099> originally

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
was before and this time I'm originally

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.790 
was before and this time I'm originally
launched<00:03:22.849> Starbound<00:03:23.360> and<00:03:23.599> this<00:03:24.380> is<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.620> time

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
launched Starbound and this is the time

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.920 
launched Starbound and this is the time
that<00:03:24.830> I<00:03:25.010> usually<00:03:25.130> get<00:03:25.370> my<00:03:25.550> biggest<00:03:25.760> FPS<00:03:26.239> drop

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
that I usually get my biggest FPS drop

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.300 
that I usually get my biggest FPS drop
I<00:03:26.959> usually<00:03:27.860> lag<00:03:28.190> out<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:28.760> freeze<00:03:29.360> so

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
I usually lag out and freeze so

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.309 
I usually lag out and freeze so
hopefully<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:32.270> won't<00:03:32.420> be<00:03:32.540> too<00:03:32.780> bad

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
hopefully it won't be too bad

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.220 
hopefully it won't be too bad
I've<00:03:34.040> got<00:03:34.250> my<00:03:34.340> game<00:03:34.489> sets<00:03:34.730> 1280<00:03:35.209> by<00:03:35.390> 720<00:03:35.780> and

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
windowed mode because that's how I like

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.340
