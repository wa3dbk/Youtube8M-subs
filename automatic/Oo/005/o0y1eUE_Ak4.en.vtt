00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
very mind this is only speculation it's

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.380

only<00:00:16.800> my<00:00:16.920> opinion<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.640> I'm<00:00:17.789> not<00:00:17.940> saying<00:00:18.150> that

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
only my opinion and I'm not saying that

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.179 
only my opinion and I'm not saying that
I'm<00:00:18.510> right<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.770> only<00:00:19.800> way<00:00:20.070> it

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
I'm right and this is the only way it

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.640 
I'm right and this is the only way it
can<00:00:20.340> happen<00:00:20.490> no<00:00:21.000> absolutely<00:00:21.359> not<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.140> idea<00:00:22.439> is

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
can happen no absolutely not the idea is

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.800 
can happen no absolutely not the idea is

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
all like speculating you get it here's

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.670 
all like speculating you get it here's
my<00:00:32.759> take<00:00:33.030> there<00:00:33.480> seems<00:00:33.870> to<00:00:34.110> be<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.320> lot<00:00:34.620> of

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
my take there seems to be a lot of

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.370 
my take there seems to be a lot of
deception<00:00:35.489> going<00:00:35.940> on<00:00:36.180> between<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.050> different

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
deception going on between the different

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
symbol I'm sorry I don't believe Batman

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.349 
symbol I'm sorry I don't believe Batman
would<00:00:59.160> do<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.730> just<00:01:00.030> don't<00:01:00.270> believe

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
would do that I just don't believe

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.150 
would do that I just don't believe
Batman<00:01:00.750> would<00:01:01.109> do<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.440> don't<00:01:01.770> care<00:01:01.920> how

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
Batman would do that I don't care how

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.250 
Batman would do that I don't care how
crazy<00:01:02.399> he<00:01:02.760> gets<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.660> don't<00:01:03.870> think<00:01:04.110> he

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
crazy he gets I just don't think he

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.219 
crazy he gets I just don't think he
would<00:01:04.439> but<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:04.979> do<00:01:05.129> believe<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:06.090> maybe<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
would but I do believe that maybe the

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.890 
would but I do believe that maybe the
Joker<00:01:07.860> would<00:01:08.100> go<00:01:08.310> around<00:01:08.460> doing<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.630> give

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
Joker would go around doing that to give

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.109 
Joker would go around doing that to give
Batman<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> bad<00:01:10.710> name<00:01:11.010> perhaps<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.790> an<00:01:11.909> effort

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
Batman a bad name perhaps in an effort

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.789 
Batman a bad name perhaps in an effort
to<00:01:12.299> make<00:01:12.570> him<00:01:12.750> look<00:01:12.780> like<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.170> bad<00:01:13.439> guy<00:01:13.500> to

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
to make him look like the bad guy to

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.340 
to make him look like the bad guy to
Superman<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.030> also<00:01:15.240> believe<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.780> Lex

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
Superman and I also believe that Lex

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.499 
Superman and I also believe that Lex
Luthor<00:01:16.860> would<00:01:17.130> be<00:01:17.310> willing<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.759> bankroll<00:01:17.970> a

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
Luthor would be willing to bankroll a

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.410 
Luthor would be willing to bankroll a
group<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.200> Superman<00:01:20.040> Nazis<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.880> make<00:01:21.030> Superman

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
group of Superman Nazis to make Superman

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.719 
group of Superman Nazis to make Superman
look<00:01:21.780> bad<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.530> Batman<00:01:22.979> will<00:01:23.189> come<00:01:23.369> after

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
look bad so the Batman will come after

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.399 
look bad so the Batman will come after
it<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.150> here's<00:01:24.330> what<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.509> think<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.900> think<00:01:24.960> Lex

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
it so here's what I think I think Lex

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.109 
it so here's what I think I think Lex
Luthor<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.890> Joker<00:01:26.250> have<00:01:26.280> teamed<00:01:26.700> up<00:01:26.939> and

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
Luthor and Joker have teamed up and

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.359 
Luthor and Joker have teamed up and
they've<00:01:27.360> set<00:01:27.630> up<00:01:27.659> these<00:01:27.930> scenarios<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.950> pit

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
they've set up these scenarios to pit

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.249 
they've set up these scenarios to pit
these<00:01:29.549> two<00:01:29.820> heroes<00:01:30.180> against<00:01:30.659> each<00:01:30.810> other<00:01:31.079> and

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
these two heroes against each other and

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.830 
these two heroes against each other and
I<00:01:31.500> think<00:01:31.530> Lex<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.700> Joker<00:01:33.090> are<00:01:33.270> doing<00:01:33.659> this

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
I think Lex and the Joker are doing this

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.990 
I think Lex and the Joker are doing this
setting<00:01:34.530> these<00:01:34.680> two<00:01:34.950> heroes<00:01:35.310> up<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.820> go

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
setting these two heroes up to go

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.300 
setting these two heroes up to go
against<00:01:36.360> each<00:01:36.479> other<00:01:36.750> as<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.049> distraction<00:01:37.829> a

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
against each other as a distraction a

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.910 
against each other as a distraction a
