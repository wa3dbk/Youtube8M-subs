tutorials<00:00:16.170> work<00:00:16.590> just<00:00:17.460> yet<00:00:17.580> I'll<00:00:17.940> mention

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
tutorials work just yet I'll mention

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.660 
tutorials work just yet I'll mention
that<00:00:18.960> in<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.439> tutorial<00:00:20.010> which<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.310> should<00:00:20.520> have

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
that in the tutorial which I should have

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.630 
that in the tutorial which I should have
posted<00:00:20.910> up<00:00:21.210> fairly<00:00:21.449> soon<00:00:21.750> so<00:00:22.490> I'll<00:00:23.490> destroy

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
posted up fairly soon so I'll destroy

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.210 
posted up fairly soon so I'll destroy
the<00:00:24.029> effect<00:00:24.359> now<00:00:25.170> you<00:00:25.500> just<00:00:25.680> use<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.830> regular

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
the effect now you just use a regular

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.740 
the effect now you just use a regular
deck<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.400> cards<00:00:26.820> there's<00:00:26.970> no<00:00:27.060> gimmicks<00:00:27.449> you

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
deck of cards there's no gimmicks you

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.370 
deck of cards there's no gimmicks you
can<00:00:27.900> show<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.170> cards<00:00:28.439> are<00:00:28.590> all<00:00:28.619> mixed<00:00:29.099> and

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
can show the cards are all mixed and

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.630 
can show the cards are all mixed and
they<00:00:31.380> can<00:00:31.529> cut<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.830> cards<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.130> number<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.430> times

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
they can cut the cards a number of times

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.560 
they can cut the cards a number of times
if<00:00:33.000> they<00:00:33.149> want<00:00:33.360> it's<00:00:34.790> not<00:00:35.790> really<00:00:36.059> necessary

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
if they want it's not really necessary

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.880 
if they want it's not really necessary
because<00:00:36.750> we're<00:00:36.989> gonna<00:00:37.079> generate<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.620> random

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
because we're gonna generate a random

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.330 
because we're gonna generate a random
card<00:00:38.399> using<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:39.050> red<00:00:40.050> card<00:00:40.410> now<00:00:41.100> I'll<00:00:41.280> just

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
card using this red card now I'll just

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.950 
card using this red card now I'll just
show<00:00:41.579> all<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.850> backs<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.270> cards<00:00:42.300> too<00:00:42.690> just

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
show all the backs of the cards too just

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.560 
show all the backs of the cards too just
so<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.140> can<00:00:43.260> see<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.680> there's<00:00:44.070> no<00:00:44.280> other<00:00:44.570> red

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
so you can see that there's no other red

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.979 
so you can see that there's no other red
card<00:00:45.840> hidden<00:00:46.050> anywhere<00:00:46.469> here<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.840> I'd<00:00:48.840> have

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
card hidden anywhere here and I'd have

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.189 
card hidden anywhere here and I'd have
the<00:00:49.110> spectator<00:00:49.559> just<00:00:50.840> insert<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.989> card

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
the spectator just insert the card

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.770 
the spectator just insert the card
anywhere<00:00:52.559> they<00:00:52.680> like<00:00:53.420> now<00:00:54.420> you're<00:00:54.629> probably

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
anywhere they like now you're probably

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.119 
anywhere they like now you're probably
wondering<00:00:55.079> what's<00:00:55.469> on<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.649> other<00:00:55.680> side<00:00:55.829> of

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
wondering what's on the other side of

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.939 
wondering what's on the other side of
this<00:00:56.190> card<00:00:56.460> well<00:00:57.270> what<00:00:57.420> I've<00:00:57.539> done<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.989> I've

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
this card well what I've done is I've

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.380 
this card well what I've done is I've
actually<00:01:00.379> labeled<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.949> card<00:01:02.219> value<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:03.120> suit

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
actually labeled the card value in suit

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.210 
actually labeled the card value in suit
to<00:01:03.600> point<00:01:03.840> at<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.290> cards<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.680> are<00:01:04.769> opposite

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
to point at the cards that are opposite

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.359 
to point at the cards that are opposite
each<00:01:05.400> side<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:06.260> inserted<00:01:07.260> card<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:08.310> is

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
each side of this inserted card this is

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.130 
each side of this inserted card this is
going<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.670> generate<00:01:09.060> our<00:01:09.180> random<00:01:09.510> card<00:01:09.780> so

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
going to generate our random card so

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.609 
going to generate our random card so
we're<00:01:10.229> gonna<00:01:10.320> set<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.680> there<00:01:11.150> and<00:01:12.470> well<00:01:13.470> just

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
we're gonna set that there and well just

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.399 
we're gonna set that there and well just
turn<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:13.799> over<00:01:14.100> for<00:01:14.280> now<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.900> we<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.080> mix

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
turn that over for now and we can mix

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.920 
turn that over for now and we can mix
these<00:01:16.560> cards<00:01:16.920> up<00:01:17.330> it<00:01:18.330> doesn't<00:01:18.479> really<00:01:18.689> matter

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
these cards up it doesn't really matter

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.490 
these cards up it doesn't really matter
the<00:01:19.170> spectator<00:01:19.710> can<00:01:19.860> do<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.159> now<00:01:21.380> before<00:01:22.380> we

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
the spectator can do that now before we

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.980 
the spectator can do that now before we
reveal<00:01:23.040> our<00:01:23.250> randomly<00:01:23.729> generated<00:01:24.180> card<00:01:24.509> we're

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
reveal our randomly generated card we're

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.359 
reveal our randomly generated card we're
going<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.250> also<00:01:26.930> prepare<00:01:28.130> generating<00:01:29.130> our

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
going to also prepare generating our

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.450 
going to also prepare generating our
random<00:01:30.060> number<00:01:30.689> between<00:01:30.840> 1<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.320> 52<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.310> that

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
random number between 1 and 52 so that

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.090 
random number between 1 and 52 so that
we<00:01:32.549> can<00:01:32.729> reveal<00:01:32.970> them<00:01:33.150> both<00:01:33.299> at<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.509> same<00:01:33.720> time

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
we can reveal them both at the same time

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.770 
we can reveal them both at the same time
I'll<00:01:35.100> show<00:01:35.310> you<00:01:35.400> what<00:01:35.520> I<00:01:35.549> mean<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.509> we're<00:01:36.689> going

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
I'll show you what I mean so we're going

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.020 
I'll show you what I mean so we're going
to<00:01:36.840> generate<00:01:37.079> we're<00:01:37.680> gonna<00:01:37.770> select<00:01:38.670> four

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
to generate we're gonna select four

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.270 
to generate we're gonna select four
random<00:01:39.450> cards<00:01:39.810> total<00:01:40.590> them<00:01:40.770> up<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.009> get<00:01:41.100> our

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
random cards total them up to get our

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.120 
random cards total them up to get our
random<00:01:41.670> number<00:01:41.700> between<00:01:42.829> technically<00:01:43.829> four

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
random number between technically four

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.859 
random number between technically four
and<00:01:44.310> 52<00:01:44.700> because<00:01:44.850> if<00:01:45.090> we<00:01:45.180> had<00:01:45.329> all<00:01:45.450> four<00:01:45.689> aces

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
and 52 because if we had all four aces

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.289 
and 52 because if we had all four aces
that<00:01:46.200> would<00:01:46.320> be<00:01:46.439> four<00:01:46.950> aces<00:01:47.700> being<00:01:48.090> one<00:01:48.270> of

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
that would be four aces being one of

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.990 
that would be four aces being one of
course<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.869> if<00:01:49.829> we<00:01:49.950> had<00:01:50.040> all<00:01:50.159> four<00:01:50.549> kings<00:01:50.820> that

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
course and if we had all four kings that

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.960 
course and if we had all four kings that
would<00:01:51.299> be<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.450> maximum<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.259> 52<00:01:52.950> Kings<00:01:53.310> being<00:01:53.549> 13

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
would be a maximum of 52 Kings being 13

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.959 
would be a maximum of 52 Kings being 13
so<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.710> spectator<00:01:56.100> can<00:01:56.369> cut<00:01:56.549> anywhere<00:01:56.820> they

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
so the spectator can cut anywhere they

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.630 
so the spectator can cut anywhere they
want<00:01:57.380> okay<00:01:58.380> they<00:01:58.530> cut<00:01:58.740> out<00:01:58.860> a<00:01:58.890> jack<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.460> the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
want okay they cut out a jack so the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.170 
want okay they cut out a jack so the
jack<00:01:59.850> value<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.689> 11<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.619> we'll<00:02:01.799> write<00:02:02.430> 11<00:02:03.000> down

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
jack value is 11 so we'll write 11 down

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.850 
jack value is 11 so we'll write 11 down
and<00:02:04.130> we<00:02:05.130> look<00:02:05.250> at<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.430> next<00:02:05.670> card<00:02:06.439> value<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.590> 4

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
and we look at the next card value is 4

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.650 
and we look at the next card value is 4
we're<00:02:08.520> at<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.759> down<00:02:09.000> 4

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
we're at that down 4

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.770 
we're at that down 4
now<00:02:10.500> place<00:02:10.890> those<00:02:11.100> back<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.330> spectator

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
now place those back and the spectator

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.870 
now place those back and the spectator
can<00:02:12.900> cut<00:02:13.110> somewhere<00:02:13.650> else<00:02:13.830> for<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.160> final<00:02:14.760> two

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
can cut somewhere else for the final two

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.550 
can cut somewhere else for the final two
cards<00:02:15.240> we've<00:02:15.330> got<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.480> queen<00:02:15.780> here<00:02:16.050> so<00:02:16.380> that's

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
cards we've got a queen here so that's

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.350 
cards we've got a queen here so that's
12<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.450> our<00:02:18.450> next<00:02:18.690> card<00:02:18.960> is<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.470> 2<00:02:19.920> so<00:02:20.610> we'll

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
12 and our next card is a 2 so we'll

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.980 
12 and our next card is a 2 so we'll
write<00:02:21.570> 2<00:02:21.990> down<00:02:22.340> so<00:02:23.340> our<00:02:23.550> random<00:02:23.970> values<00:02:24.420> are<00:02:24.630> 11

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
write 2 down so our random values are 11

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.160 
write 2 down so our random values are 11
4<00:02:25.200> 12<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.680> 2<00:02:25.920> now<00:02:26.580> we'll<00:02:26.760> total<00:02:27.090> those<00:02:27.210> up<00:02:27.270> so

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
4 12 and 2 now we'll total those up so

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.910 
4 12 and 2 now we'll total those up so
11<00:02:28.470> +<00:02:28.560> 4<00:02:28.740> is<00:02:28.770> 15<00:02:29.340> plus<00:02:30.000> 12<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.630> 17<00:02:31.880> or<00:02:32.880> I'm<00:02:33.330> sorry

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
11 + 4 is 15 plus 12 is 17 or I'm sorry

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:42.440 
11 + 4 is 15 plus 12 is 17 or I'm sorry
11<00:02:34.920> 4<00:02:35.130> is<00:02:35.250> 15<00:02:35.700> plus<00:02:35.940> 12<00:02:36.330> is<00:02:36.890> 27<00:02:37.890> plus<00:02:38.670> 2<00:02:39.540> is<00:02:40.340> 29<00:02:41.450> so

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
11 4 is 15 plus 12 is 27 plus 2 is 29 so

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.370 
11 4 is 15 plus 12 is 27 plus 2 is 29 so
our<00:02:42.690> total<00:02:42.930> is<00:02:43.430> 29<00:02:44.430> that's<00:02:44.730> our<00:02:44.880> random<00:02:45.240> number

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
our total is 29 that's our random number

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.450 
our total is 29 that's our random number
so<00:02:46.380> we<00:02:46.470> have<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.650> random<00:02:46.860> number<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.280> you

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:47.460 
so we have a random number and you

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.950 
so we have a random number and you
notice<00:02:47.730> I'm<00:02:47.820> not<00:02:47.970> touching<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.420> deck<00:02:48.690> I'm<00:02:48.870> not

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
notice I'm not touching the deck I'm not

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.630 
notice I'm not touching the deck I'm not
going<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.170> do<00:02:49.230> anything<00:02:49.410> funny<00:02:49.740> well<00:02:50.460> leave

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
going to do anything funny well leave

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.700 
going to do anything funny well leave
the<00:02:50.730> deck<00:02:50.880> as<00:02:51.060> is<00:02:51.240> we<00:02:51.870> just<00:02:52.050> generated<00:02:52.530> a

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
the deck as is we just generated a

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.770 
the deck as is we just generated a
number<00:02:53.010> 29<00:02:53.490> and<00:02:53.790> now<00:02:54.270> we're<00:02:54.420> going<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.600> just

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
number 29 and now we're going to just

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.570 
number 29 and now we're going to just
generate<00:02:55.170> our<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:56.360> random<00:02:57.360> card<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.460> to<00:02:59.460> do

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
generate our a random card and to do

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:00.650 
generate our a random card and to do
that<00:02:59.730> we're<00:02:59.940> just<00:02:59.970> going<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.210> actually<00:03:00.570> we

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
that we're just going to actually we

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.970 
that we're just going to actually we
could<00:03:00.750> have<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:00.900> spectator<00:03:01.380> mix<00:03:01.590> these<00:03:01.710> cards

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
could have a spectator mix these cards

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.230 
could have a spectator mix these cards
around<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.280> doesn't<00:03:02.550> matter<00:03:02.670> they<00:03:02.850> can<00:03:02.880> choose

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 
around it doesn't matter they can choose

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.780 
around it doesn't matter they can choose
however<00:03:03.900> they<00:03:04.200> want<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.470> do<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.710> now<00:03:05.640> we're

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
however they want to do it now we're

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.010 
however they want to do it now we're
going<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:05.970> turn<00:03:06.150> over<00:03:06.210> a<00:03:06.750> middle<00:03:07.410> card<00:03:07.730> to<00:03:08.730> show

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
going to turn over a middle card to show

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.490 
going to turn over a middle card to show
that<00:03:10.550> what<00:03:11.550> card<00:03:12.390> represents<00:03:13.020> what<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.380> we've

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
that what card represents what so we've

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.010 
that what card represents what so we've
got<00:03:13.620> value<00:03:14.010> for<00:03:14.220> this<00:03:14.310> card<00:03:14.580> suit<00:03:15.240> for<00:03:15.990> that

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
got value for this card suit for that

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.020 
got value for this card suit for that
card<00:03:16.380> so<00:03:16.530> let's<00:03:16.560> see<00:03:16.800> our<00:03:16.920> suit<00:03:17.190> we've<00:03:17.850> got<00:03:18.000> a

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
card so let's see our suit we've got a

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.380 
card so let's see our suit we've got a
diamond<00:03:18.510> for<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.720> suit<00:03:18.990> and<00:03:19.880> we've<00:03:20.880> got<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.060> 6

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
diamond for the suit and we've got a 6

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.430 
diamond for the suit and we've got a 6
for<00:03:22.080> our<00:03:22.110> value<00:03:22.890> so<00:03:23.700> what<00:03:24.630> are<00:03:24.840> the<00:03:24.990> chances

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
for our value so what are the chances

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.120 
for our value so what are the chances
that<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:26.430> six<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:26.970> diamonds<00:03:27.420> is<00:03:28.130> the

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
that the six of diamonds is the

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.510 
that the six of diamonds is the
twenty-ninth<00:03:29.970> card<00:03:30.480> in<00:03:30.920> this<00:03:31.920> deck<00:03:31.980> now

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
is it the six of diamonds there you have

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.229 
is it the six of diamonds there you have
it<00:04:13.310> so<00:04:14.420> yes<00:04:15.420> this<00:04:15.690> trick<00:04:16.260> by<00:04:16.410> the<00:04:16.440> way<00:04:16.650> ends
