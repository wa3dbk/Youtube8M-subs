00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.450
 Flipkens wins a meeting here today in Luxembourg that revolves around whether the 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.299
 obligation that every death falls the attacker was last year just like last 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.299
 year that would be a piece or three four against the plain 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:26.730
 not posted 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.560
 want to teach 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.349
 the suitable club three kilometers 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.450
 in a fight 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.579
 internet is now a week earlier 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.970
 editors 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.040
 I think more important 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.480
 the recovery is faster 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.480
 the reason for the programming of media messages 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.380
 No 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.380
 brussels anp to attract the dutch youth 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.420
 that can benefit 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.840
 I started searching 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.670
 people start using the internet 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.560
 black water country young people 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.630
 thus it lost 4 0 from standard poor's warned releases 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.630
 minister it is still uncertain 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.950
 alderman to see the theater 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.950
 victim of violence 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.320
 I am satisfied 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.320
 maybe not the cut 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.510
 at the back of the incident 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.980
 fortunately there were no differences but that can read 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.200
 Forfeiting a few seconds you can of course also live this way 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.070
 I will be 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.860
 what is the problem then 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.880
 it's marco velo 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.719
 but also 79 people worldwide who try to know this way 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.330
 via email this is a lot happening now 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.979
 and now there is a bit nice and quick 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.979
 renault 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:14.649
 he must have known them yet 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:17.649
 by that of the following week 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.819
 that was experienced by the mileage 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.359
 that left the trainer 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.629
 18 kilometers 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.629
 he argues there is no date yet 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.189
 almost 4 percent more than the feet can 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.219
 politics not high enough points to learn why not the north 

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:57.759
 utrecht is the traffic 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.689
 a second position 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:29.469
 there are decency rules 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.069

 3for12 friesland 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:47.139
 that is a hefty fine 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:50.139
 all commissions 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.159
 I see house rules 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:00.699
 Philip Dierckx 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:11.679
 gas is back 

00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:14.229
 wise man does not fulfill 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:17.229
 although affected area 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.239
 the scenario 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.239
 companies located here 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.819
 that's how it went 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.460
 rotterdam anp rotterdam 

00:04:32.809 --> 00:04:35.809

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:45.069
 a boy 

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:55.279
 completely stuck 

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:58.279
 set that world record 

00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:02.559
 the terrain has the greatest chance of heart failure 

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:05.559
 if a user chooses 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.669
 I have a very different direction 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.210

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.110

 I can really lie awake 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.680

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.469
