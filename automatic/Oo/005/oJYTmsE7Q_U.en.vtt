00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.970
 so guys good evening fucking because 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.740
 he is now evening what we have we have 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:13.019
 prioru 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:16.130
 prioru restyling 2 now we are seeing 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.930
 which is more accurate 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:22.170
 Many owners of this model are very 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.330
 often encounter a problem when 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.500
 buying priors restyling them very 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.520
 often the dashboard turns off say 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.380
 so you often turn off shorter 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.840
 brains fuck short let 's say so here 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.940
 Now we see that it works, but we 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.070
 caught such a country very strange 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.410
 the phenomenon is shorter look here now we 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.710
 turn on the ignition as you see here 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.680
 I turn the key about you all 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.590
 earned light bulbs burn 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.170
 car starts naham work well bye 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.440
 teeth carrying 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.350
 I have to see you on the neck and now we 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.149
 turn off our machine shorter 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.250
 and now completely turn off the ignition 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.560
 off dimensions completely off of 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.159
 the soul does not remember anything and does not affect accurate 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.399
 now we go there wait wire 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.659
 carry out doing knives magic 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:18.920
 rag so to speak so-called 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:21.289
 microfiber which disables just 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.880
 light touch hold 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:27.350
 And he usually rags day and choose in 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.869
 the hotel wipe just easy you 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.860
 beautiful in no pressure no 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:36.289
 nothing like that just we her three three 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.130
 here is my second hand as if nothing would 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.880
 do not turn off turn on the ignition panel 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.250
 appliances 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.520
 she doesn't work nichrome that's what it is 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.009
 so for 1 day the car starts up 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.060
 down the arrows fell down the panel fell 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.979
 devices do not work therefore very often 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.250
 many people are mistaken and change 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.450
 I'll go burns process they say 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.549
 on and became about vocabulary 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.539
 but it is not so easy not to use 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:08.329
 of course fiber and fucked up and then your 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:11.690
 review will be your prior will work 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:15.859
 like a clock now the treatment method ladies and 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.680
 disease open open the hood here 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:21.160
 actually open the hood go 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:26.329
 see what happens there 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:31.609
 show any wonder but kalinkovich 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:33.739
 number km and then all the same here we look 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.630
 disconnect the terminals shaft that he did not pizdit 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.970
 the panel visited I already here key and threatened 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.840
 would be specially prepared but because 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.200
 She like I marked it here we remove 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.200
 cleat 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:53.740
 tascam for 10 seconds wait wait wait 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:59.380
 extremely strange such an honest phenomenon 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:02.160
 fucking word is he so fucked up 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.480
 Interpol Internet looked fucking 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.910
 they said that motorola all processors 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.480
 things may be the way it is of course 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.670
 here dick take most likely it 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.890
 microfiber publishes some electromagnetic 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.150
 radiation which is some kind of secret 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:27.550
 way affects the performance 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:30.430
 CPU and so go ahead we get everything 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.650
 tachometer transactions earned speedometer 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.500
 shorter at zero everything works temperature 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.480
 shows so guys do not chop 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.850
 if you don't spend extra money on pin 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:46.840
 I will fight and just do not buy this one 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:49.000
 river rag not to worry about not that you 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.230
 the turret will walk rejoice up 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.660
 the machine will be working on the creature on 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.700
 the phenomenon really want to know well this 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:00.880
 probably we are the first you really revealed it 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.890
 everything works like this and by the way please 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.170

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.490
 pressing on the panel we just have it 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:09.040
