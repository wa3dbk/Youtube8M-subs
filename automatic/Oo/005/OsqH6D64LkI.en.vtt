normally<00:00:13.349> we<00:00:13.500> don't<00:00:13.769> make<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.070> distinction

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
normally we don't make a distinction

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.000 
normally we don't make a distinction
between<00:00:14.730> architecture<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:15.660> building<00:00:16.170> but<00:00:16.920> I

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
between architecture and building but I

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.670 
between architecture and building but I
think<00:00:17.250> it's<00:00:17.369> important<00:00:17.910> to<00:00:18.029> recognize<00:00:18.570> that

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
think it's important to recognize that

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.189 
think it's important to recognize that
there<00:00:19.680> are<00:00:19.740> these<00:00:20.100> two<00:00:20.369> words<00:00:21.359> and<00:00:21.720> almost<00:00:22.050> in

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
there are these two words and almost in

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.170 
there are these two words and almost in
every<00:00:22.439> language<00:00:22.760> and<00:00:25.970> architecture<00:00:26.970> with<00:00:27.119> the

every language and architecture with the

you know which goes back to what good 60
years<00:01:02.489> already<00:01:02.850> more<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.210> think<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.809> know<00:01:03.930> 70

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
years already more I think you know 70

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.320 
years already more I think you know 70
years<00:01:04.530> even

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
years even

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.680 
years even
I<00:01:07.430> mean<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.700> know<00:01:08.820> architects<00:01:09.270> cannot<00:01:09.570> do

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
I mean you know architects cannot do

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.820 
I mean you know architects cannot do
very<00:01:09.900> much<00:01:10.050> about<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.740> mean<00:01:10.800> it's<00:01:11.580> it's<00:01:11.820> a

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
very much about that I mean it's it's a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.000 
very much about that I mean it's it's a
demographic<00:01:13.830> economic<00:01:15.680> social<00:01:16.680> problem

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
demographic economic social problem

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.510 
demographic economic social problem
political<00:01:17.520> problem<00:01:17.910> well<00:01:18.450> architecture<00:01:18.960> is

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
political problem well architecture is

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.190 
political problem well architecture is
impotent<00:01:20.520> from<00:01:20.910> that<00:01:21.060> point<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.420> view<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:22.170> I

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
impotent from that point of view so I

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.530 
impotent from that point of view so I
think<00:01:22.290> one<00:01:22.530> should<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:23.580> know<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.300> more

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
think one should you know and it's more

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.360 
think one should you know and it's more
like<00:01:24.750> building<00:01:25.200> its<00:01:25.350> spontaneous<00:01:25.740> building

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
like building its spontaneous building

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.550 
like building its spontaneous building
people<00:01:26.700> building<00:01:27.090> their<00:01:27.630> own<00:01:27.690> houses<00:01:28.140> which

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
people building their own houses which

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.920 
people building their own houses which
is<00:01:28.590> what<00:01:28.860> happened<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.430> suppose<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.450> medieval

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
is what happened I suppose in medieval

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.970 
is what happened I suppose in medieval
period<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:31.710> on

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
period and so on

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.620 
period and so on
you<00:01:32.070> know<00:01:32.220> and

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.499 

so<00:01:36.229> you<00:01:37.159> know<00:01:37.310> I<00:01:37.340> think<00:01:37.490> that<00:01:37.820> in<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.150> end<00:01:38.270> one

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
so you know I think that in the end one

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.109 
so you know I think that in the end one
has<00:01:38.689> to<00:01:39.220> discriminate<00:01:40.220> you<00:01:40.460> know<00:01:40.610> I'm<00:01:40.939> not

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
has to discriminate you know I'm not

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.210 
has to discriminate you know I'm not
saying<00:01:41.360> that<00:01:41.540> one<00:01:41.689> cannot<00:01:41.930> do<00:01:42.290> a<00:01:42.590> social

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
saying that one cannot do a social

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.649 
saying that one cannot do a social
housing<00:01:43.759> that<00:01:43.909> has<00:01:44.119> very<00:01:44.420> strong

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
housing that has very strong

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.550 
housing that has very strong
architectural<00:01:45.259> quality<00:01:45.909> but<00:01:47.350> sometimes<00:01:48.350> we

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
architectural quality but sometimes we

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.700 
architectural quality but sometimes we
ask<00:01:48.799> of<00:01:49.100> the<00:01:49.310> architecture<00:01:49.759> profession

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
ask of the architecture profession

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.139 
ask of the architecture profession
demands<00:01:51.710> which<00:01:51.979> the<00:01:52.130> profession<00:01:52.610> by<00:01:52.790> itself

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:53.149 
demands which the profession by itself

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.750 
demands which the profession by itself
cannot<00:01:53.560> cannot<00:01:54.560> meet

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
cannot cannot meet

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.510 
cannot cannot meet
so<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.390> think<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.900> to<00:01:58.800> distinguish<00:01:59.430> between

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
so I think that to distinguish between

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.490 
so I think that to distinguish between
architecture<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.270> building<00:02:00.570> him<00:02:00.690> and<00:02:01.140> then<00:02:01.320> I

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
architecture and building him and then I

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.110 
architecture and building him and then I
suppose<00:02:01.740> well<00:02:02.070> finally<00:02:02.730> what<00:02:02.940> is

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
suppose well finally what is

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.880 
suppose well finally what is
architecture<00:02:03.660> I<00:02:03.750> mean<00:02:03.900> I<00:02:03.990> think<00:02:04.050> architecture

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
architecture I mean I think architecture

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.640 
architecture I mean I think architecture
is<00:02:05.370> you<00:02:06.180> know<00:02:06.270> guarantees<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:07.020> public<00:02:07.410> realm

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
is you know guarantees the public realm

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.590 
is you know guarantees the public realm
it<00:02:07.920> has<00:02:08.130> I<00:02:08.340> think<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.760> kind<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.420> political

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
it has I think that kind of political

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.900 
it has I think that kind of political
and<00:02:10.230> cultural<00:02:10.770> social<00:02:11.340> importance

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
and cultural social importance

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.020 
and cultural social importance
there's<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.950> there's<00:02:15.950> a<00:02:16.100> philosopher<00:02:16.790> named

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
there's a there's a philosopher named

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.000 
there's a there's a philosopher named
Hannah<00:02:17.270> Arendt<00:02:17.570> who<00:02:17.750> coined<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.710> term<00:02:18.800> the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
Hannah Arendt who coined the term the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.710 
Hannah Arendt who coined the term the
space<00:02:19.550> of<00:02:19.760> public<00:02:20.090> appearance

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
space of public appearance

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.840 
space of public appearance
I<00:02:20.750> think<00:02:21.110> architecture<00:02:21.560> ultimately<00:02:22.190> is<00:02:22.520> about

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
I think architecture ultimately is about

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.090 
I think architecture ultimately is about
the<00:02:23.060> space<00:02:23.330> of<00:02:23.360> public<00:02:23.810> film<00:02:24.080> like<00:02:24.560> his<00:02:24.800> face

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
the space of public film like his face

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.750 
the space of public film like his face
for<00:02:25.400> example<00:02:25.940> and<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:26.330> building
