 thing that will serve you well when 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.060

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.490
 caps and your wood completely in his 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.750
 natural aspect a possibility of 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.430
 retry the right directly with 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.500
 products that give a finished look 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.550
 completely united which you just need 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.919
 to buy a product called a 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.359
 hue in a column possibly 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.579
 quite clear that you have to know that the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.710
 canteen sees and usually try 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.179
 after the basic color it is a small 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.349
 little more supported so here we go 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:32.669
 work on his products to give you 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:36.030
 an example on the basics like 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:41.149
 that you apply the hue with a 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:45.500
 fairly regular appearance and alice and that's it 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:48.510
 we showed a little bit for example to 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.769
 you come with him here is a small 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.710
 result like this there especially well 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:59.670
 soaked wood but do not leave it 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:02.550
 completely with thicknesses like 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.400
 here and there if he is your brush 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:09.990
 until you get a result 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:13.890
 so read that's pretty much the color 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.290
 we will get finished with a finished result 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.600
 once it's over, if ray is here 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.299
 so that allows us to look 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.020
 General proof of your wood lesson 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.060
 next we will see the waxing 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.979
 so with another product that will give 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.250
 a more or less complete aspect of said 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.600
 seat 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.149

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.909
 other videos on our site by hand 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.590
 he finished his regular fellow I 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.719
 say beyond reach 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.280
 you have to know that after a little 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.259
 hour or two you're going to have a wood 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.640
 who will go a little bit clear as 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.409
 the one who's over there already finished since 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.009
 a little while and right after this 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.149
 surgery 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.470
 we can eventually show you 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.210
 how you can 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.370

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.280
 we will show you a little bit so a 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.680
 once the damage to be dried on the

 Greek we introduced you just before 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.170
 wanted you have a result that is 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.250
 more or less clean and the hall 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.590
 advantages that we will have is that we have 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.760
 just a past syrah so you can 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.140
 easily find any 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.450
 DIY store a while 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.330
 allows you to have after the result 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.350
 we will try to realize now 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.040
 so in the end just enough just 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:28.640
 applied the base a bit like one 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.510
 did it with the following hue whatever 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.840
 pretty daring thing a good result 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.010
 for the products are well spent 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.280
 that's especially not too leave 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.600
 thick because the problem that 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.540
 you may encounter if you 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.740
 load too much wax is after you 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.709
 are going to have small species 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:52.300
 Rennes aesthetically who will not be 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:56.150

 step by step without too much overload 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:09.340
 like that always in advance here 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.530
 so it's not too bad if you have 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:21.900
 a little worry like that you come back 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:21.900
 above and it allows us to have it 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.160
 we'll go around a little bit like 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:32.900

 if you have an overload like that of 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.230
 well smooth and that's it is executed the
