00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
just so exciting and she's such a big

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.030 
just so exciting and she's such a big

really<00:02:28.340> tall<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:29.440> so<00:02:30.440> you<00:02:31.220> know<00:02:31.340> it<00:02:31.569> she<00:02:32.569> could

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
really tall and so you know it she could

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.059 
really tall and so you know it she could
only<00:02:32.810> get<00:02:33.050> better<00:02:33.200> if<00:02:33.470> she<00:02:33.560> continues<00:02:33.739> to

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
only get better if she continues to

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.809 
only get better if she continues to
