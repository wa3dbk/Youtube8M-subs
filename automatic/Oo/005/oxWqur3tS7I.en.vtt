00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
want to watch it I recommend using

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.110 
want to watch it I recommend using
having<00:04:52.640> Wi-Fi<00:04:52.880> or<00:04:53.680> 3g<00:04:54.680> you<00:04:55.460> know<00:04:55.550> eats<00:04:55.820> up<00:04:55.970> your

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
having Wi-Fi or 3g you know eats up your

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.570 
having Wi-Fi or 3g you know eats up your
data<00:04:56.300> unless<00:04:56.780> you've<00:04:56.990> got<00:04:57.020> unlimited<00:04:57.740> data<00:04:58.370> or

00:04:58.570 --> 00:04:58.580 
data unless you've got unlimited data or

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:59.740 
data unless you've got unlimited data or
whatever<00:04:58.820> you<00:04:58.970> don't<00:04:59.060> have<00:04:59.210> to<00:04:59.300> care<00:04:59.480> about<00:04:59.510> it

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
whatever you don't have to care about it

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.140 
whatever you don't have to care about it
but<00:05:00.560> sometimes<00:05:01.160> it<00:05:01.430> loads<00:05:01.580> a<00:05:01.640> little<00:05:01.850> bit<00:05:01.940> slow

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
but sometimes it loads a little bit slow

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.540 
but sometimes it loads a little bit slow
on<00:05:02.180> 3g<00:05:02.540> than<00:05:03.080> Wi-Fi<00:05:03.440> connection<00:05:04.010> because<00:05:04.190> your

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
on 3g than Wi-Fi connection because your

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.330 
on 3g than Wi-Fi connection because your
Wi-Fi<00:05:04.850> connection<00:05:05.270> is<00:05:05.480> usually<00:05:06.160> faster<00:05:07.160> than

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
Wi-Fi connection is usually faster than

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.840 
Wi-Fi connection is usually faster than
3G<00:05:07.850> so<00:05:08.660> when<00:05:09.080> I<00:05:09.650> recommend<00:05:10.100> using<00:05:10.340> get<00:05:10.580> vid

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:10.850 
3G so when I recommend using get vid

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:12.490 
3G so when I recommend using get vid
skip<00:05:11.060> I<00:05:11.210> think<00:05:11.390> i<00:05:11.450> mighta<00:05:11.480> phone<00:05:11.840> said<00:05:12.110> that<00:05:12.260> if
