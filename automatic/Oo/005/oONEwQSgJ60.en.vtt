 how to make minjiang claws like the 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.410
 we've seen in bruce movies 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.320
 reads and very easy to do for now in 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.730
 these halloween dates 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.280
 What we need are 6 sticks of 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.450
 mathematic studies languages â€‹â€‹of those who use 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.940
 the doctors and we're going to take a knife 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.870
 with a keyboard in our kitchen 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.600
 our parents live together 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.440
 we are small 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.440
 we are going to mark them 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.410
 let's mark it like this later with the help 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.430
 of a saw 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.800
 no scissors a razor or something but 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:04.530
 always having a lot of caution 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.530
 let's cut being the way 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:26.430
 and with the help of a paper of this paper 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.729
 of sandpaper we will not be for those 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.729
 dangerous 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.640
 and this one stays we need six what 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.340
 let's do the same let's cut if it's 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.970
 well after 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:57.610
 let's cut a stick 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:59.610
 the rounds of stations like 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.300

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.629
 to lose 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.730
 our little sticks we count which will be 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.730
 the long ones we are going to insert there 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.520
