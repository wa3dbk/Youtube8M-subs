00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:00.920 
just in case you want to save on some of
that<00:03:59.409> fuel<00:03:59.680> while<00:03:59.829> your<00:04:00.010> inner<00:04:00.159> city<00:04:00.400> driving

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
that fuel while your inner city driving

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.509 
that fuel while your inner city driving
um<00:04:01.930> let's<00:04:02.530> see<00:04:02.709> what<00:04:02.890> else<00:04:03.010> do<00:04:03.099> we<00:04:03.129> have<00:04:03.220> here

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
um let's see what else do we have here

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:05.970 
um let's see what else do we have here
of<00:04:03.819> course<00:04:04.030> steering<00:04:04.359> wheel<00:04:04.510> adjustments<00:04:05.019> and

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
of course steering wheel adjustments and

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.490 
of course steering wheel adjustments and
I<00:04:06.819> believe<00:04:07.120> that's<00:04:07.299> pretty<00:04:07.750> much<00:04:07.900> about<00:04:08.079> it<00:04:08.140> of

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
I believe that's pretty much about it of

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.589 
I believe that's pretty much about it of
course<00:04:08.739> a<00:04:09.090> compass<00:04:10.090> and<00:04:10.269> external

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:10.599
