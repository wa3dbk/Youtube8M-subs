00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.400 
and is very nice as a gold visor and the
main<00:00:53.670> reason<00:00:54.149> i<00:00:54.239> like<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.660> figure<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.170> much

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
main reason i like this figure so much

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.510 
main reason i like this figure so much
is<00:00:56.100> because<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.910> his<00:00:57.270> chest<00:00:57.980> to<00:00:58.980> your<00:00:59.219> right

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
is because of on his chest to your right

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.349 
is because of on his chest to your right
is<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.940> red<00:01:00.660> UNSC<00:01:01.590> emblem<00:01:02.340> i<00:01:02.520> think<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.180> is<00:01:03.239> a

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
is a red UNSC emblem i think this is a

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.810 
is a red UNSC emblem i think this is a
great<00:01:03.629> amount<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.320> detail<00:01:04.400> really<00:01:05.400> adds<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.700> lot

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
great amount of detail really adds a lot

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.090 
great amount of detail really adds a lot
of<00:01:05.970> character<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.110> figure<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:07.680> see<00:01:07.920> that

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
of character to the figure and see that

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.480 
of character to the figure and see that
the<00:01:08.220> Marine<00:01:08.520> has<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.270> his<00:01:10.049> arm<00:01:10.470> as<00:01:10.710> well<00:01:10.979> it

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
the Marine has it on his arm as well it

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.260 
the Marine has it on his arm as well it
really<00:01:11.760> adds<00:01:12.229> detail<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.500> unit<00:01:13.920> itself

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
really adds detail to the unit itself

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.170 
really adds detail to the unit itself
next<00:01:15.270> up<00:01:15.420> we<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.780> new<00:01:16.140> colored<00:01:17.180> ODST
