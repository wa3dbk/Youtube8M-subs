00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:10.100
 who are very nice to be at home and 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.930
 can do these kinds of things again 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.789
 well that is very nice and like one of them 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.949
 who didn't miss your fresh coffee 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.380
 for that matter, a problem your own 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.790
 coffee maker back home without 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.410
 to learn 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.390
 a little more becomes normal every day 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.250
 but certainly very nice at the beginning 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.560
 For example, I had had a crane 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.720
 just clean water it came from me 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.670
 could take a hot shower and that i would 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.870
 us went to the toilet and that in one 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.250
 hot tub came back stuff like that 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.170
 were very nice though 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.450
 and was again very soon at home 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.190
 view eric the film clips films that 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.170
 He made it himself and wanted it 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.460
 of the climbers 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.180
 a lot of people are already getting here 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.180
 dizzy from 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.780
 this is for a really good top 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.880
 mountain climber 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.530
 cleaner it's a typical for the 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.120
 men are level with those ladders 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.980
 you only there that you are such a normal 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.809
 spoken you would be such a rework leds 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.250
 you did not pass my op mount 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.750
 everest is the only route so it is 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.070
 unique just for that mountain 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.269
 pretty much it's not hard 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.479
 otherwise warm 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.399
 only went to 71 in the meantime 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.380
 100 meters height 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.870
 they number have been turned around 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.680
 and 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.420
 yes number have gone ahead and are now 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.490
 now it arrived 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.500
 we now turn on the fast and fast clove 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.980
 fled the way it really was 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.770
 Cook 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.090
 then heat the affected tablet i 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.630
 snow had i hear you maybe five 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.860
 meters in front of you and at the end 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.380
 it pulled it open around it 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.660
 snowing and he felt very weird up 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.800
 because of height, that one is 70 meters 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.600
 That is very important that you 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.730
 drink a lot of height to thin your blood 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.990
 so you avoid freezing 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.490
 and were faced here in the head 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.960
 go do only the burn works very 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.400
 bad and at that moment all you refuse 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.380
 So becomes the fires that were so going there and then 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.630
 and tossed it out the water 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.700
 sloshing and that we couldn't have water 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.290
 drink in the tent itself 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.720
 just two new burners that made me feel so 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.460
 only use yes at that height work 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.810
 I believe your memory as a 12 year old 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.550
 and just can not occur to me that I 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.020
 with those burners the problem of 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.670
 solving that took two to three hours 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.330
 before I saw the problem and that the 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.760
 solutions 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.650
 just lay in the same tent and that is 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.000
 also moment before I realized from to 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.700
 that height who really does something 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.250
 with your memory apparently after that heavy one 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.709
 day when eric 71 reached 100 meters 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.870
 climb trail up to 86 100 meters 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.580
 due to the harsh weather conditions 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.250
 he stopped his journey there 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.100
 a wind speed of almost 100 km per hour 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.200
 and the feeling temperature is minus 70 and 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.030
 that while he is only 250 meters away 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.560
 the top removed is the dominant 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.300
 emotion so far is a well 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.459
 disappointment about not making it 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.050
 the top but I think if you are talking about one 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.959
 few months on your request that I do 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.850
 more proudly look at the 86 100 meters 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.010
 have achieved deep but yes I am now 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.750
 rather disappointed him but there is reign 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.790
 not just disappointment on the 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.480
 return to base camp day erik 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.459
 other perished and dying climbers 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.570
 he wanted to stay on his retina 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.480
 I don't wake up screaming from that 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.830
 images but I don't often go one 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.690
 hour or two passed without not being 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.680
 shoot through my head for a moment 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.239
 yes that takes a while before you get it 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.960
 can lay all litters without 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.030
 that's a terrible thing 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.830
 it's not no trauma of you screaming 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.220
 wake up but yes it is absolutely in 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.530
 your head 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.810
 erik is definitely going to climb again or ever 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.760
 Mount Everest is here so I will 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.410
 something not finished but yes i would be there 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.090
 really need to think about that 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.370
 again simply means whole months 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.230
 train hard and if i put it on this now 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.700
 moment then my main motive 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.800
 is about revenge actually because it 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.930
 failed and if that's the only one 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.790
 is then that is a bit skinny 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.650
 if such a thing arises there must also be one 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.420
 go a bit spontaneously and then you have to go again 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.530
 slowly believe in the fun 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.660
 go find it 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.440
 yes it is just over now 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.250
 I think early 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.250
