 This one is already there once I get booted 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.060
 what he does not let enter because he entered a lot 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.180
 people and filled industry is full and 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:17.440
 as usually happens not change me 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:19.900

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.190
 people took my place and they do not let me 

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.070
 get in 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:29.830
 that's how I more or less earn the nickname 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:33.010
 peta server twitter 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:35.860

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:37.330

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:52.170

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.870
 trolling is that they get father now they 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:57.240
 may have been and is another server for the 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.940
 list that they leave in the description for 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:02.070
 the list of servers that we have been 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.810
 exploring more than anything because I think that 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:05.010
 I did not dedicate myself so much before now 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:07.320
 I'm dedicating a little more to this 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:08.760
 because they have told me a lot on twitter 

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.460
 more than anything lately with vigo more 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.729

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:15.440
 I have been told on twitter to be who 

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:19.580
 try this and he gave it to me too 

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:21.830
 thanks me net and this and well more than 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:24.680
 nothing that does not play with you for 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:27.020
 that they see that if they are taken into account 

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.840
 because they think what 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:31.190
 that as my administration they respond in 

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.050
 facebook they think that I do not take them in 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:34.699
 account but if not so much of that but of 

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.620
 that there are many are many and what is done 

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:38.599
 that you can and then nothing was left 

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.190
 recent video and if they liked it in 

00:07:38.599 --> 00:07:41.629
 comment to be written and for those who 

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:44.300
 they want to play the players in ex 

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:45.710
 departures east 

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.539
 this is dependent every weekend 

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.460
 on Saturdays at night I put 

00:07:47.539 --> 00:07:51.050
 when I'm going to enter and all this already yes 

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.220
 so they are on the lookout and sometimes 

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:53.360
 Sundays also in the afternoon but 

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:56.720
 usually on Saturdays because the 

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.340
 Sunday I go out then this to be 

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.930
 pending on twitter on facebook and 

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.330
 always check always always put 

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:04.930
 every weekend and so they do not say 

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.930
 not just because
