harley-davidson<00:02:44.090> beehive<00:02:44.930> Springs<00:02:45.410> just

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
harley-davidson beehive Springs just

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.100 
harley-davidson beehive Springs just
what<00:02:45.860> makes<00:02:46.130> them<00:02:46.340> too<00:02:46.489> light<00:02:46.700> because<00:02:47.390> it's

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
what makes them too light because it's

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.110 
what makes them too light because it's
just<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:49.100> spring<00:02:49.370> tension<00:02:49.760> isn't<00:02:49.910> over

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
just the spring tension isn't over

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.530 
just the spring tension isn't over
overly<00:02:51.400> isn't<00:02:52.400> too<00:02:52.549> much<00:02:52.790> so<00:02:53.060> it<00:02:53.180> doesn't<00:02:53.420> put

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
overly isn't too much so it doesn't put

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.039 
overly isn't too much so it doesn't put
too<00:02:54.319> much<00:02:54.440> stress<00:02:54.769> on<00:02:54.920> your<00:02:55.040> cams<00:02:55.810> just<00:02:56.810> bolt
