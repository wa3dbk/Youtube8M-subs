game and then just pay up front like any
other<00:06:15.689> game<00:06:15.929> instead<00:06:16.800> of<00:06:16.860> having<00:06:17.129> to<00:06:17.249> go<00:06:17.459> the

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 
other game instead of having to go the

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:19.879 
other game instead of having to go the
free-to-play<00:06:17.999> model<00:06:18.419> if<00:06:18.809> they'll<00:06:19.199> offer<00:06:19.529> both

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:19.889 
free-to-play model if they'll offer both

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:21.469 
free-to-play model if they'll offer both
choices<00:06:20.189> like<00:06:20.579> guess<00:06:20.819> that<00:06:21.029> would<00:06:21.119> be<00:06:21.149> okay

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
choices like guess that would be okay

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.749 
choices like guess that would be okay
but<00:06:21.509> that<00:06:21.749> doesn't<00:06:21.959> really<00:06:22.079> solve<00:06:22.409> the<00:06:22.769> influx

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 
but that doesn't really solve the influx

but that doesn't really solve the influx
of<00:06:24.059> people<00:06:24.509> who<00:06:24.719> don't<00:06:24.869> care<00:06:25.169> about<00:06:25.379> the<00:06:25.559> game
