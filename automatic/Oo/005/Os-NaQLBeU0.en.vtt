over<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.650> club<00:03:09.830> now<00:03:09.980> that<00:03:10.130> we're

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
over to the club now that we're

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.730 
over to the club now that we're
eventually<00:03:10.520> gonna<00:03:10.970> have<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:11.530> do<00:03:12.530> a<00:03:12.560> little

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
eventually gonna have to do a little

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.370 
eventually gonna have to do a little
switcheroo<00:03:13.520> action<00:03:14.000> on<00:03:14.180> here<00:03:14.510> but<00:03:14.750> we<00:03:15.350> also

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
switcheroo action on here but we also

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.060 
switcheroo action on here but we also
pick<00:03:16.070> up<00:03:16.310> this<00:03:17.180> 431<00:03:18.050> 2<00:03:18.320> card<00:03:18.620> I<00:03:18.709> think<00:03:18.740> for

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
pick up this 431 2 card I think for

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.640 
pick up this 431 2 card I think for
1,100<00:03:19.880> coins<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.390> those<00:03:20.510> if<00:03:20.870> I'm<00:03:21.080> not<00:03:21.290> correct

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
1,100 coins and those if I'm not correct

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.430 
1,100 coins and those if I'm not correct
go<00:03:22.100> for<00:03:22.340> sometimes<00:03:22.850> near<00:03:23.150> like<00:03:23.360> 3,000<00:03:24.260> coins

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
go for sometimes near like 3,000 coins

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.350 
go for sometimes near like 3,000 coins
so<00:03:24.769> adding<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.400> kind<00:03:25.580> of<00:03:25.700> value<00:03:26.000> to<00:03:26.090> Marco

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
so adding that kind of value to Marco

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.240 
so adding that kind of value to Marco
Royce<00:03:26.540> that's<00:03:27.260> what<00:03:27.620> I'm<00:03:27.769> talking<00:03:28.190> about

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
Royce that's what I'm talking about

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.490 
Royce that's what I'm talking about
that's<00:03:28.940> a<00:03:29.060> little<00:03:29.209> trading<00:03:29.570> dirty<00:03:29.959> talk<00:03:30.200> in<00:03:30.410> my

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
that's a little trading dirty talk in my

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.370 
that's a little trading dirty talk in my
mine<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.970> we<00:03:32.090> also<00:03:32.269> get<00:03:32.540> I<00:03:32.600> think<00:03:32.720> a<00:03:32.870> four<00:03:33.110> three

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:33.380 
mine so we also get I think a four three

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.890 
mine so we also get I think a four three
two<00:03:33.680> one<00:03:34.100> formation<00:03:34.489> card<00:03:34.820> here<00:03:35.000> 250<00:03:35.720> coins

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
two one formation card here 250 coins

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.470 
two one formation card here 250 coins
those<00:03:36.709> also<00:03:37.040> I<00:03:37.519> think<00:03:37.730> I<00:03:37.910> put<00:03:38.060> it<00:03:38.150> up<00:03:38.239> for<00:03:38.269> two

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
those also I think I put it up for two

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.940 
those also I think I put it up for two
thousand<00:03:38.870> coins<00:03:38.959> and<00:03:39.200> it<00:03:39.260> sells<00:03:39.500> like

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
thousand coins and it sells like

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.740 
thousand coins and it sells like
instantly<00:03:40.550> within<00:03:40.790> like<00:03:41.000> a<00:03:41.030> split<00:03:41.300> second<00:03:41.660> so

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
instantly within like a split second so

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.780 
instantly within like a split second so
that<00:03:41.780> obviously<00:03:42.440> was<00:03:43.160> not<00:03:43.280> the<00:03:43.459> right<00:03:43.610> place

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
that obviously was not the right place

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.160 
that obviously was not the right place
at<00:03:44.030> the<00:03:44.090> price<00:03:44.269> and<00:03:44.450> I<00:03:44.480> could<00:03:44.750> have<00:03:44.870> done<00:03:44.900> some

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
at the price and I could have done some

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.810 
at the price and I could have done some
more<00:03:45.290> background<00:03:45.769> research<00:03:45.920> but<00:03:46.340> as<00:03:46.459> you<00:03:46.670> guys

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
more background research but as you guys

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.610 
more background research but as you guys
all<00:03:47.030> know<00:03:47.239> looking<00:03:47.570> through<00:03:47.810> formation<00:03:48.350> cards

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
all know looking through formation cards

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.140 
all know looking through formation cards
is<00:03:48.769> oh<00:03:49.070> so<00:03:49.580> annoying

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
is oh so annoying

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.390 
is oh so annoying
hopefully<00:03:51.110> they<00:03:51.230> will<00:03:51.350> introduce<00:03:51.739> a<00:03:52.070> search

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
hopefully they will introduce a search

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.990 
hopefully they will introduce a search
feature<00:03:52.760> in<00:03:53.530> upcoming<00:03:54.530> fifa's<00:03:54.980> for<00:03:55.430> that<00:03:55.790> but

done<00:06:46.520> well<00:06:46.730> to<00:06:46.970> stop<00:06:47.270> me<00:06:47.450> up<00:06:47.660> until<00:06:48.020> that<00:06:48.290> point

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.350 
done well to stop me up until that point

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.640 
done well to stop me up until that point
because<00:06:49.220> I<00:06:50.020> this<00:06:51.020> game<00:06:51.230> could<00:06:51.440> have<00:06:51.530> been<00:06:51.620> a

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:51.650 
because I this game could have been a

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:53.680 
because I this game could have been a
lot<00:06:51.950> worse<00:06:52.220> than<00:06:52.460> the<00:06:52.580> final<00:06:52.910> three<00:06:53.240> no<00:06:53.420> score

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:53.690 
lot worse than the final three no score

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:55.900 
lot worse than the final three no score
but<00:06:53.840> he<00:06:53.930> decides<00:06:54.260> that<00:06:54.410> at<00:06:54.770> this<00:06:55.340> point<00:06:55.639> I

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:55.910 
but he decides that at this point I

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.190 
but he decides that at this point I
think<00:06:56.330> he<00:06:56.389> tries<00:06:56.570> to<00:06:56.690> take<00:06:56.780> a<00:06:56.840> shot<00:06:57.080> off

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:57.200 
think he tries to take a shot off

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.960 
think he tries to take a shot off
kickoff<00:06:57.590> you<00:06:57.800> I<00:06:57.830> will<00:06:58.160> let<00:06:58.250> it<00:06:58.400> run<00:06:58.550> because<00:06:58.790> he

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:58.970 
kickoff you I will let it run because he

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.320 
kickoff you I will let it run because he
ends<00:06:59.180> up<00:06:59.240> quitting<00:06:59.389> out<00:06:59.660> here<00:06:59.840> pretty<00:07:00.200> quickly

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330
