00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:07.259
 Hello everyone today I want to talk to 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.530
 you about tasty and healthy food 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.330
 namely, its cooking methods all 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.940
 we know that cooked 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.830
 food but better and faster digested than 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.050
 not prepared means your time 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.410
 first year of their sorties 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.250
 so to speak out of town on nature with 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.849
 pleasure marinated meat for 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.470
 kebabs 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.610
 but with the same pleasure of course 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.190
 it was eaten but after some 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.079
 years of some time I'm fried meat 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.930
 on they already just see quite a bit if 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.190
 honestly and want something for yourself so 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.660
 more homely 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.559
 natural environment something 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.809
 cooked but in the end I 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.039
 went to the choice 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.180
 any cooking is done 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.430
 food but as usual everything is all 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.199
 order means i'm pretty 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.050
 long time enjoyed such 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.019
 even for grilling is quite famous 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.430
 I will decide. 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.350
 when this lattice I for some 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.479
 reasons for me to leave incomprehensible 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.820
 at home that is in other words and just 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:15.030
 forgot we experimented and prop and 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.590
 about the sighting device wali that is, we did 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.470
 some kind of natural 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.280
 lattice that is out of any kind against 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.100
 we eventually cut the skewer out 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.259
 tree in general it is all pretty 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.079
 not bad all this is interesting but again 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.200
 I can tell you that the taste of meat is on fire 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:38.430
 just shone but in the end I 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.009
 went to the device buying from such is not 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:45.960
 The trunk of this item is called on 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.070
 English language mosquito two words well 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.140
 let's see what he is 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.479
 presents 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.380
 imagine the following of this 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.380
 pirate turn to 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.140
 pretty small 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.560
 frying pan for cooking in one 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.920
 he was also generally longing for 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.230
 supplied with such an interesting plate 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.890
 purely by the american ocean and all the time 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.310
 and videos 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.910
 for example about prisoners there for them were 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.510
 plates are divided into two sections also 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.750
 have seen 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.019
 and the military and American soldiers 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.940
 The films are also the same plates in 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.880
 in general 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.400
 To this I approached that set on the very 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.690
 really pretty 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:42.080
 compact he used mostly 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:45.500
 by american soldiers as i like 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:49.069
 pretty often experiment and 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.390
 they took a real nasty then 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.040
 Americans who cost $ 23 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.760
 he made what room to me also from 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.910
 stainless steel 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.290
 I went to the Chinese site and found 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.600
 Chinese crafts on American low 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:09.370
 made of this stray aluminum 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:14.120
 very light weight versus felt 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:16.670
 very compact well and the most important in 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.739
 in the end began to cook more 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.760
 less normal human food 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:27.500
 what is undoubtedly pleased in general if you 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.209
 like this here uncomplicated 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.310
 I will tell you a little bit about him 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.260
 more 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:36.620
 then worry much about capacity 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:40.340
 word backpack and your excess weight 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.910
 backpack I'll show you the size of the device 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:47.510
 it means its length is 20 and a half 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:50.959
 centimeters its width is 17 half 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:55.760
 centimeters ie this is a griddle 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:04:00.410
 implies a use so 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:04.299
 say to one person means I still 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:06.489
 I have such a big jar for 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.109
 sunflower oil 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.090
 Here is such a small jars until 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:13.669
 sunflower oil is quite enough for me 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.440
 for a long time almost all the time 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.440
 washing on the nature 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:24.050
 Well, basically, you see what it is yourself 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:26.180
 represents we will round out 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.120
 there is nothing to show off the console 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.020
 conventional aluminum pan with 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.949
 a plate the whole thing this way 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.949
 is revealed 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:44.150
 successful twitter all this is possible by genotype 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:47.389
 experimenting to push 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.490
 full closing the lid with a griddle 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:53.919
 it is absolutely not interesting to me therefore I 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:57.199
 I wear it all so pretty already 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:05:00.259
 repeatedly poyuzat product. 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:02.509
 I was worried about my time 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:05.540
 be and everything burns out because the name 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:07.430
 pretty thin well you know i 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:11.000
 I also use for seven eight 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:13.070
 months literally every week like 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.680
 see all pretty good 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:21.290
 that nothing else we have not lost weight 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.870
 I will not tell you but I will say that on the list 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:27.490
 that pretty Kisilenko is very very 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.020
 very light also we can still fold 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:33.169
 let's say the same group on you 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.000
 there with butter matches that is it 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:37.160
 It turns out the ease of great desire 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.600
 it can also boil true 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:43.639
 quite a bit rather 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.770
 Well, that's the principle I told a simple site 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.729
 presents 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:52.409
 american not skit 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:54.449
 Chinese manufacturing pro show you 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:06:10.889
 a little more detail and 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:06:13.110
 mounts and do not know for comparison here 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:16.229
 please ruled for you to understand 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:22.500
 approximately at least the size of it is 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:24.990
 the pan we still add that 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:27.180
 let's get pretty compact comes out 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.279
 none knew me well from stainless 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.810
 become 

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:34.050
 stainless steel calcium to me will weigh 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:35.460
 a little more and i think that to 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:38.219
 stainless steel will be food more 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.930
 overpaid you do not know and only mine 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:43.770
 guesses how much is real I am 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:46.099
 I do not have Well, that's basically all that's 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:48.539
 who will like a frying pan 

00:06:46.099 --> 00:06:51.199
 acquire will not be disappointed in 

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:51.199
 that's all for now
