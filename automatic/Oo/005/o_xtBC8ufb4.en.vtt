00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
going to talk about this is a Jensen 25

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.429 
going to talk about this is a Jensen 25
cast-iron<00:01:47.700> type<00:01:48.149> but<00:01:48.810> again<00:01:49.049> it's<00:01:49.229> all<00:01:49.350> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
cast-iron type but again it's all the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.020 
cast-iron type but again it's all the
same<00:01:49.619> mechanics<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:50.850> your

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
same mechanics that you have on your

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.990 
same mechanics that you have on your
your<00:01:51.600> hobby<00:01:51.810> type<00:01:52.460> what<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.490> want<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.790> first

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
your hobby type what I want to first

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.359 
your hobby type what I want to first
show<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:55.229> take<00:01:55.530> some<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.219> the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
show you is that we take some of the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.630 
show you is that we take some of the
steam<00:01:56.729> oil<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.619> very<00:01:58.619> few<00:01:58.860> people<00:01:59.040> do<00:01:59.399> this

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
steam oil and very few people do this

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.609 
steam oil and very few people do this
but<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.180> good<00:02:00.329> idea<00:02:00.689> if<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.049> can<00:02:01.290> see<00:02:01.469> my

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
but it's a good idea if you can see my

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.550 
but it's a good idea if you can see my
hand<00:02:02.040> over<00:02:02.250> here<00:02:02.640> I'm<00:02:03.000> inserting<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
hand over here I'm inserting this the

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.800 
hand over here I'm inserting this the
needle<00:02:05.100> oiler<00:02:05.520> right<00:02:06.030> there<00:02:06.240> I'm<00:02:06.420> inserting

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
needle oiler right there I'm inserting

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.979 
needle oiler right there I'm inserting
it<00:02:07.079> into<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.619> exhaust<00:02:08.129> port<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.629> engine

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
it into the exhaust port of the engine

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.300 
it into the exhaust port of the engine
it's<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.259> pipe<00:02:10.470> that<00:02:10.739> sticks<00:02:11.009> out<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.220> the

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
it's the pipe that sticks out of the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.640 
it's the pipe that sticks out of the
steam<00:02:11.580> chest<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.660> want<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.989> squeeze

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
steam chest and you want to squeeze

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.160 
steam chest and you want to squeeze
and<00:02:13.739> squirt<00:02:14.099> some<00:02:14.340> oil<00:02:14.610> in<00:02:14.849> there<00:02:15.060> turn<00:02:15.989> the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
and squirt some oil in there turn the

Jensen they don't have lubricators built

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.929 
Jensen they don't have lubricators built
into<00:02:25.110> them<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.739> at<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:25.950> start<00:02:26.159> of<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.400> run<00:02:26.640> do

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
into them so at the start of a run do

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.940 
into them so at the start of a run do
this<00:02:27.150> we're<00:02:27.569> at<00:02:27.629> a<00:02:27.659> few<00:02:27.840> drops<00:02:28.049> suck<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.620> in<00:02:28.739> by

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
this we're at a few drops suck it in by

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.490 
this we're at a few drops suck it in by
turning<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:30.329> flywheel<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.170> you'll<00:02:31.409> be

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
turning the the flywheel and you'll be

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.119 
turning the the flywheel and you'll be
good<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.709> go

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
good to go

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.460 
good to go
the<00:02:32.939> next<00:02:33.239> place<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.659> we<00:02:33.750> put<00:02:33.959> steamed<00:02:34.260> oil

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
the next place that we put steamed oil

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.490 
the next place that we put steamed oil
is<00:02:34.709> on<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.340> valve<00:02:35.670> slide<00:02:36.510> valve<00:02:36.780> right<00:02:37.200> here

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
is on the valve slide valve right here

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.410 
is on the valve slide valve right here
you<00:02:37.650> can<00:02:37.799> see<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:38.040> tip<00:02:38.250> of<00:02:38.280> what<00:02:38.939> I'm<00:02:39.060> pointing

you can see the tip of what I'm pointing

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.289 
you can see the tip of what I'm pointing
to<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:39.569> hope<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.959> can<00:02:40.489> you<00:02:41.489> squirt<00:02:41.849> a<00:02:41.909> little<00:02:42.150> on

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:42.299 
to I hope you can you squirt a little on

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.630 
to I hope you can you squirt a little on
there<00:02:42.540> rotate<00:02:43.439> the<00:02:43.560> flywheel<00:02:43.680> squirt<00:02:44.549> a

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
there rotate the flywheel squirt a

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.690 
there rotate the flywheel squirt a
little<00:02:44.670> more<00:02:45.030> rotate<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.870> flywheel<00:02:46.069> so<00:02:47.069> that

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
little more rotate the flywheel so that

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.369 
little more rotate the flywheel so that
is<00:02:47.879> in<00:02:48.060> contact<00:02:48.420> with<00:02:48.540> steam<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.049> we<00:02:49.139> need<00:02:49.290> to

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
is in contact with steam so we need to

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.449 
is in contact with steam so we need to
use<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.530> steam<00:02:49.859> oil<00:02:50.099> as<00:02:50.909> is<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.980> rod<00:02:53.190> that

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
use a steam oil as is the the rod that

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.940 
use a steam oil as is the the rod that
connects<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.090> piston<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:55.290> want<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.530> put<00:02:55.709> a

over<00:03:02.189> a<00:03:02.220> few<00:03:02.430> times<00:03:02.730> do<00:03:03.060> it<00:03:03.180> again<00:03:03.450> we<00:03:04.200> don't

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
over a few times do it again we don't

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:05.809 
over a few times do it again we don't
have<00:03:04.409> to<00:03:04.500> do<00:03:04.590> it<00:03:04.709> excessively<00:03:05.189> but<00:03:05.430> we<00:03:05.549> want<00:03:05.730> to

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
have to do it excessively but we want to

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.149 
have to do it excessively but we want to
get<00:03:05.909> it<00:03:06.060> coated<00:03:06.269> with<00:03:06.569> steam<00:03:07.109> oil<00:03:07.319> so<00:03:07.980> steam

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
get it coated with steam oil so steam

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:10.190 
get it coated with steam oil so steam
oil<00:03:08.430> goes<00:03:08.609> in<00:03:08.819> three<00:03:09.120> places<00:03:09.359> right<00:03:10.139> here

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.199 
through the exhaust port so that we get
it<00:03:24.870> into<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.109> piston<00:03:25.349> cylinder<00:03:25.709> area<00:03:26.209> okay

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
it into the piston cylinder area okay

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.659 
it into the piston cylinder area okay
now<00:03:27.419> for<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.720> conventional<00:03:28.650> kind<00:03:28.889> of<00:03:29.010> oil<00:03:29.190> it

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
now for the conventional kind of oil it

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.390 
now for the conventional kind of oil it
goes<00:03:30.000> as<00:03:30.359> I<00:03:30.540> said<00:03:30.780> any<00:03:31.079> ways<00:03:31.379> that<00:03:31.409> metal<00:03:32.159> is<00:03:32.280> in

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
goes as I said any ways that metal is in

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.939 
goes as I said any ways that metal is in
contact<00:03:32.819> with<00:03:32.940> metal<00:03:33.150> but<00:03:33.419> no<00:03:33.629> steam<00:03:33.989> so<00:03:34.829> we

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949 
contact with metal but no steam so we

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:37.670 
contact with metal but no steam so we
put<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.280> on<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.519> crankshaft<00:03:35.930> put<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.019> on<00:03:37.139> here

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
put it on the crankshaft put it on here

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.309 
put it on the crankshaft put it on here
we<00:03:38.609> put<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:38.909> on<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.150> eccentric<00:03:39.810> squirt<00:03:40.260> a

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
we put it on the eccentric squirt a

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:41.930 
we put it on the eccentric squirt a
little<00:03:40.349> bit<00:03:40.650> between<00:03:41.159> and<00:03:41.519> around<00:03:41.760> the

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
little bit between and around the

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.360 
little bit between and around the
eccentrics<00:03:42.479> rotate<00:03:43.379> it<00:03:43.530> or<00:03:43.650> each<00:03:43.769> time<00:03:44.069> you<00:03:44.220> do

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
eccentrics rotate it or each time you do

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.699 
eccentrics rotate it or each time you do
that<00:03:44.400> get<00:03:45.299> a<00:03:45.359> little<00:03:45.659> on<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.959> axle<00:03:46.680> shaft

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
that get a little on the axle shaft

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.009 
that get a little on the axle shaft
right<00:03:47.430> where<00:03:47.579> it<00:03:47.699> goes<00:03:47.849> through<00:03:48.180> these<00:03:48.359> these

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
right where it goes through these these

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.490 
right where it goes through these these
parts<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:49.799> stand<00:03:50.099> up<00:03:50.310> here<00:03:50.579> just<00:03:51.510> again<00:03:52.199> just
