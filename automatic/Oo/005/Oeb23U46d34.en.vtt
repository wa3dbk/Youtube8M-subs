 week it's called 1 week in 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.350
 nba already started with little damage 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.370
 as steel or goes into overtime 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.840
 very good team always I take this 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.629
 despite the fact that they were more about 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.879
 this year and at home we come when 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.129
 even to an emanation have a chance of 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.590
 win the match and I look good 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.680
 jeans match took then with utah 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.750
 home where I'm doing a good match it's 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:55.879
 unfortunately the team and loses but 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:59.940
 well you have a team that is improving and 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.829
 continue after with with atlanta to 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.580
 home and that for me is one of 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.890
 best teams in nba together and 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:11.280
 very nice match for me either 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.780
 offensively and defensively also I 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.180
 finished with 19 points I believe and then 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.070
 good famous three point shoot that we 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.280
 that makes me go from me I believe that a 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.420
 weight or three points in the stops of 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.490
 game and the match against chicago 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.460
 finally here I do not put a good one 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.070
 match but good the team in general 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.630
 offensively it was not 12 years old and 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.560
 in spite of that we may be in chicago 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.009
 Russian is still going to 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.440
 extensions where unfortunately open 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.119
 but hey I think the whole thing 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.830
 week very well the tale 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.210
 about another Cameroonian joël mg bid 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.159
 he plays with you in philadelphia you 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.840
 you knew him very young he made your 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:54.299
 camp in yaoundé it's just amazing 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.950
 how are you and all that but it's 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.010
 here a dream 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.170
 me I 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.590
 beings with a young person who 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:06.600
 I knew May 13 if successful who passed 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.220
 by the body seen growing up 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.140
 it may be I 'm writing myself one is 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.950
 well in the locker room right next to 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.920
 me in such a short time and it's a 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.530
 wonderful story to come back is played 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.160
 for I think that there's better he goes 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.770
 super good I think about 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.170
 we saw the video of his feelings 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.410
 internet circulate cold a week ago 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.560
 or two so that smelled it starts to 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.240
 so go there the fact he'll stay see 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.220
 card and who plays basketball that 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.660
 finally they come to run 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.690
 things are better mentally too 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:45.740
 because we see the license that goes 25 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:48.320
 usual and here it is missing who plays 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.450
 this year surely not but it is 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.150
 was selling this summer I think it would be 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:56.900
 not for that and a faith that comes back I 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.460
 think that the future potential and not the 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.930
 45 and do you have a message to 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.730
 Africa in particular 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.290
 cameroon and to all fans of nba channel 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.760
 but 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.299
 comes a ticket I think it's a 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.810
 emission that is gaining momentum in 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.930
 Africa 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:18.319
 so much they do not have me and there is 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.060
 a lot of 24-10 thanks for us 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.310
 African players try these simple 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.159
 who are happy to have messages 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.260
 on twitter or instagram or facebook 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:30.079
 where the fans they see and matches 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.670
 so we thank you all our supports 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:36.590
 and here I am lucky yesterday to 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.260
 congratulate the team from Cameroon who 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.989
 qualified for the african cup 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.400
 the Afrobasket it was not very beautiful but 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.060
 good the essential was strong the summer 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.980
 qualified so I congratulate my guys for 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.590
 the job and then that's all 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.239
 Cameroonian and African thanks for your 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.040
 support and continue to supplant 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.569
 a big thank you to him for that moment that 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.660
 you have just granted us 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.490
 thank you that's a pleasure 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.890
 friendly boy whoever does not like to 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.390
 mouthe and unef a beautiful story the 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.410
 caustic made the college of ucla 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.700
 by the way he played with russell 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.010
 westbrook with kevin love and this is the 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.650
 only player in college history 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.560
 made three finals strong since 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.180
 since a certain walton bill since 32 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.980
 years and after good then the story a 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.019
 jail mbinda the just gorgeous what 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.900
 he invites me to camp at yaounde 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:25.340
 and after good he becomes his mentor he 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.900
 does it come to the united states does two 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.610
 in high school a big flaw that makes 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.910
 the kansas college behind and after 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.440
 drafted number 3 and exceptional hazard 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.940
 is that they find themselves in the 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:39.050
 mailclub this year it's just a 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.760
 crazy story this is the big 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.770
 question what is he going to follow 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.550
 the same trajectory as ibaka and at 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.230
 the deputy or china who lives who is 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.010
 a tall player who a little 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:54.500
 missed for the moment his career his 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.820
 players who were injured and we get 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.530
 asks if he is not a bit fragile and 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.350
 there I see on the pictures that is not bad 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.870
 during this inactivity one can 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.650
 rely on lisandro's talent that 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:09.110
 will give him the best possible treatment 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:10.640
 for not having the player tag 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.440
 fragile that's why the six have 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.710
 decided not to make him play the 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.390
 season 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.590
 kabbara innovation and that's why 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:17.570
 also that it is important that 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.950
 African players make camps 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.830
 because we can always find the 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.660
 talent anywhere and it's thanks to a 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.810
 of those big ones that the young could 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.810
 go out
