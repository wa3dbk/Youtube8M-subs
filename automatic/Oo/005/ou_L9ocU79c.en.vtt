00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.500 
down to the end of her hair once I've
passed<00:00:58.640> her<00:00:59.059> hair<00:00:59.449> I<00:00:59.719> would<00:01:00.640> grab<00:01:01.640> a<00:01:01.670> piece<00:01:02.030> out

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.790 

wrap<00:01:05.510> it<00:01:05.690> around<00:01:05.770> and<00:01:06.770> just<00:01:07.400> pull<00:01:07.700> it<00:01:07.850> through

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
wrap it around and just pull it through

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.710 
wrap it around and just pull it through
this<00:01:09.800> high<00:01:10.040> top<00:01:10.370> of<00:01:10.580> my<00:01:10.670> hair<00:01:10.880> I<00:01:11.030> also<00:01:11.360> taught

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120 
my micro braids to and the reason why

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.750 
my micro braids to and the reason why
I'm<00:01:14.180> tying<00:01:14.540> off<00:01:14.900> her<00:01:15.710> pick<00:01:16.010> and<00:01:16.190> drop<00:01:16.340> bridge

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
I'm tying off her pick and drop bridge

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.910 
I'm tying off her pick and drop bridge
is<00:01:16.970> because<00:01:17.330> I<00:01:17.360> don't<00:01:17.720> want<00:01:17.900> them<00:01:18.110> to<00:01:18.260> unravel

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
is because I don't want them to unravel

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.460 
is because I don't want them to unravel
this<00:01:19.040> is<00:01:19.250> my<00:01:19.490> 6<00:01:20.300> year<00:01:20.510> old<00:01:20.600> daughter<00:01:20.750> and<00:01:21.290> I'm
