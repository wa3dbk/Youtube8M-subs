00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.060
 Hello, how are you? I hope it's good and I come with a video full of curiosities 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.700
 myths and urban legends in videogames good comments 

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:11.439
 the fastest selling console 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:15.739
 the console that has sold the most in less time is the sony playstation 2 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:19.970
 that managed to sell more than 900 thousand units in a single weekend in 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.890
 Japan stalling the previous record that was possessed by the dreamcast of 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.259
 sega that managed to sell 225 thousand units in just 24 hours 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.440
 thanks to the popularity of the first playstation since the station2 tower is 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.820
 compatible with the games of this one in 4h they were sold 98 thousand units what gives 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.240
 an average of 7 units per second 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.020
 In total to date February 4, 2006 more than 110 million have been sold 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.230
 of units of this console and still selling despite the imminent 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.730
 output of the new playstation 3 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.770
 number 2 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.600
 The super Mario red brosseter like many mushroom experts have already 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.810
 warned the mushroom that causes mario to um in that size is very similar to 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.090
 the amanita muscaria sect commonly known as kills flies since 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.950
 intoxicates the flies that perch on it 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.530
 other of its vulgar denominations are the ones of false red can confuse is 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.550
 with grapefruit when the hat is very washed pay ico painted and oronja 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:19.560
 graffiti 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.130
 in cataluña they refer to it as well as you can see in it orión reitero 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.480
 because he was a rich man 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.210
 in galicia and bordering areas like rebel cabo and nephew out and if in 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.330
 euskadi as complete false the pastor's parish 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.090
 the mushroom is very poisonous and although it is not deadly it has a great neurotoxic effect 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.140
 and hallucinogenic properties 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.220
 it will be that mario does not get bigger but is perceived as bigger 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.700
 number 3 the circle of death of xbox 360 this legend is well known 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.080
 and good said that it is not a mere legend is totally true 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.980
 the circle of death is the name that users put to the problem 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.630
 that ravaged the entire big run of the first xbox 360 consoles that came out 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:03.820
 for sale 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.789
 a large percentage jam alone rpp without warning stopped working by 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.990
 strange problems in the internal components and left only a circle 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.810
 red three lines around the power button on the console the 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.829
 called circle of death 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:23.159
 When this circle appeared on your console, you could say it was dead. 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.200
 ended after it appeared you could not make it work 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.620
 there have been people who have left them for good suddenly 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.259
 playing any game 

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:36.419
 others that nothing but understanding it have found the damn circle in their 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:39.779
 console and they have not been able to make it react if they even run by 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:43.609
 internet some rumors that covering the entire xbox with a towel once 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.629
 appeared this circle you can make it work for short periods of time 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.269
 about three hours and there are even people who say that after covering 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.849
 a towel for about 15 minutes they are repaired or completely 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.019
 but they are the least 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.169
 curious case where there are 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:03.530
 number 4 Haitian are heard we start with 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.459
 a set of the madonna and tyson funchal table 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.939
 the legend tells that if you press the button it is when there are 1 m 36 of the 

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:15.699
 second round Mario appears with a gun and shoots tyson in the face 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:18.149
 obviously this rumor is false 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:22.389
 Nintendo would never allow something like this to see the light as it would damage the 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.009
 picture of your pet 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:25.119
 number 5 

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:29.599
 in paghman's ark there is no way to pause the game but if there is a way to 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.139
 to take a brake 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.899
 there is a place within the labyrinth that can be reached when none of 

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:38.709
 the ghosts is close and that allows the player to hide in a place 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.579
 where nobody will find it 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:41.729
 number 6 

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:43.169
 the weirdest game of 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:47.510
 world is the nintendo world championships 1990 for month 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.989
 there are only 116 units in circulation 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.359
 every time one of these cartridges in auction on ebay the final price usually 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:56.849
 be stratospheric 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:57.959
 number 7 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:01.569
 In the secret of the month of the month, we have the chance to see in two locations 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.489
 of the game a mysterious effigy that corresponds to the frame face 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:06.959
 Number 8 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:07.840
 join make 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.340
 created by the American division of nintendo in 1994 for that month showed 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.349
 a menu for entering a character name 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:20.280
 If that name was sonic, the game showed a warning that the name was not 

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.279
 It was valid because he was not handsome enough 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:25.730
 in the mega man 2 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.030
 before facing us again we can take a break observing the 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.969
 constellation of the greater bear 

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:36.580
 in the block and against a triton we will close a direct attack 

00:04:36.579 --> 00:04:40.919
 to the competition, it should be remembered that at that time it seemed like a kind of 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.599
 nintendo's affiliate and therefore his enemies were the same at the end of the 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:49.699
 game we compared our score of collected coins with that of three 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:52.319
 famous nintendo characters 

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:56.529
 I followed the link while on the right of the screen we could see the boots 

00:04:56.529 --> 00:05:00.469
 sonic and the artur mas ciu gun next to a trash can and a poster 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:02.540
 that showed the message of nortes 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.180
 not the losers 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.240
 well here we finished little and I hope you liked to leave comments and 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.430
 five stars goodbye
