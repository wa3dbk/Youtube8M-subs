00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
might mean I haven't tried it yet so but

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.919 
might mean I haven't tried it yet so but
according<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.670> thread<00:00:15.000> quite<00:00:15.690> a<00:00:15.719> few

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
according to this thread quite a few

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.779 
according to this thread quite a few
people<00:00:16.109> are<00:00:16.289> saying<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.949> worked<00:00:17.279> for<00:00:17.460> them

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
people are saying it worked for them

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.260 
people are saying it worked for them
so<00:00:18.300> for<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.600> time<00:00:18.810> being<00:00:18.840> I'll<00:00:19.289> assume<00:00:19.650> that

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
so for the time being I'll assume that

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.650 
so for the time being I'll assume that
it's<00:00:21.380> legitimate<00:00:22.730> so<00:00:23.730> here<00:00:24.060> it<00:00:24.150> says<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.510> two

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
it's legitimate so here it says the two

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.540 
it's legitimate so here it says the two
things<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:24.990> can<00:00:25.109> do<00:00:25.289> our<00:00:25.560> disable<00:00:26.250> peer<00:00:26.430> to

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
things you can do our disable peer to

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.500 
things you can do our disable peer to
peer<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.650> uninstall<00:00:28.650> Pando<00:00:29.039> Media<00:00:29.160> Booster

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
peer and uninstall Pando Media Booster

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.910 
peer and uninstall Pando Media Booster

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
the gameplay just fine trim units a few

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.650 
the gameplay just fine trim units a few
minutes<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:34.800> you'll<00:00:34.980> DC<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.670> then<00:00:36.239> come<00:00:36.450> on

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
minutes and you'll DC and then come on

every few minutes it'll DC and it's very

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.440 
every few minutes it'll DC and it's very
very<00:00:43.170> aggravating<00:00:43.800> as<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.190> assume<00:00:44.460> so

have a check or a X in it right now as

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.630 
have a check or a X in it right now as
an<00:01:15.659> X<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.229> what<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:16.470> usually<00:01:16.619> have<00:01:16.920> out

an X this is what you usually have out
very<00:01:18.330> simple<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.930> think<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.409> can<00:01:19.560> follow<00:01:19.680> that

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
very simple I think you can follow that

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.550 
very simple I think you can follow that
instruction<00:01:20.330> okay<00:01:21.330> so<00:01:21.990> don't<00:01:22.290> allow

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
instruction okay so don't allow

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.950 
instruction okay so don't allow
peer-to-peer<00:01:23.009> transfer<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.240> second<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:24.750> is

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
peer-to-peer transfer the second one is

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.580 
peer-to-peer transfer the second one is

rid of your random disconnects now this
is<00:02:16.410> assuming<00:02:16.769> that<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.340> variable<00:02:17.850> isn't<00:02:18.269> your

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
is assuming that the variable isn't your

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.930 
is assuming that the variable isn't your
internet<00:02:18.780> because<00:02:19.050> my<00:02:19.200> internet<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:19.830> 90%<00:02:20.580> of

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
internet because my internet is 90% of

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.860 
internet because my internet is 90% of
the<00:02:21.060> time<00:02:21.239> perfectly<00:02:21.780> fine<00:02:21.959> so<00:02:22.940> I<00:02:23.940> know<00:02:24.510> that's

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
the time perfectly fine so I know that's

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.350 
the time perfectly fine so I know that's
not<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.110> variable<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:25.680> am<00:02:25.830> running<00:02:26.160> on

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
not the variable I am running on

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.490 
not the variable I am running on
practically<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.390> supercomputer<00:02:27.959> so<00:02:28.350> I<00:02:28.380> know

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
practically a supercomputer so I know

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.390 
practically a supercomputer so I know
that's<00:02:28.830> not<00:02:29.010> it

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
that's not it

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.490 
that's not it
so<00:02:29.670> this<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.420> only<00:02:30.600> variable<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.380> it's

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
so this is the only variable and it's

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.680 
so this is the only variable and it's
only<00:02:31.650> been<00:02:31.830> happening<00:02:32.220> recently<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:33.209> I<00:02:33.480> hope

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.060 
only been happening recently so I hope
