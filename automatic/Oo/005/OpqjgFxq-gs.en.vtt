37:51<00:00:11.509> now<00:00:12.509> before<00:00:12.900> I<00:00:12.929> begin<00:00:13.290> this<00:00:13.469> comparison

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
37:51 now before I begin this comparison

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.760 
37:51 now before I begin this comparison
I<00:00:14.400> had<00:00:14.880> originally<00:00:15.089> planned<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.809> use<00:00:16.080> Santa<00:00:16.590> Fe

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
I had originally planned to use Santa Fe

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.540 
I had originally planned to use Santa Fe
for<00:00:17.100> 8<00:00:17.220> for<00:00:17.869> 2926<00:00:18.869> but<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.710> good<00:00:19.980> friend<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.310> mine

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
for 8 for 2926 but a good friend of mine

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.400 
for 8 for 2926 but a good friend of mine
suggested<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.630> would<00:00:21.779> be<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:22.109> better<00:00:22.320> idea

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
suggested that it would be a better idea

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.720 
suggested that it would be a better idea
to<00:00:22.859> use<00:00:23.420> 3751<00:00:24.420> instead<00:00:25.019> while<00:00:25.859> doing<00:00:26.220> research

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
to use 3751 instead while doing research

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.929 
to use 3751 instead while doing research
I<00:00:26.970> quickly<00:00:27.060> realized<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.260> using<00:00:28.939> 3751

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
I quickly realized that using 3751

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.290 
I quickly realized that using 3751
instead<00:00:30.510> of<00:00:30.710> 2926<00:00:31.710> was<00:00:32.189> indeed<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> much<00:00:33.059> better

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
instead of 2926 was indeed a much better

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.660 
instead of 2926 was indeed a much better
idea<00:00:33.530> so<00:00:34.530> I<00:00:34.559> want<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.070> say<00:00:35.250> thank<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.640> very

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
idea so I want to say thank you very

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.000 
idea so I want to say thank you very
