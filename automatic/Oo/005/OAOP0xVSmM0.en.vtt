okay<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:33.840> that's<00:01:34.200> going<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.439> your<00:01:34.909> do<00:01:35.909> you

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
okay so that's going to be your do you

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.000 
okay so that's going to be your do you
right<00:01:36.360> there

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.010 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.730 

to<00:01:43.670> make<00:01:43.850> an<00:01:43.970> adjustment<00:01:44.060> I<00:01:44.780> didn't<00:01:45.500> account

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
to make an adjustment I didn't account

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.180 
to make an adjustment I didn't account
for<00:01:45.890> having<00:01:46.250> to<00:01:46.340> turn<00:01:46.520> my<00:01:46.730> head<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:48.190> look

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
for having to turn my head and look

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:57.370 
for having to turn my head and look
around<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.820> that<00:01:49.940> kind<00:01:50.180> of<00:01:50.240> thing<00:01:50.300> you<00:01:56.380> know

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
around and that kind of thing you know

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.730 
around and that kind of thing you know
and<00:01:57.740> really<00:01:57.890> this<00:01:58.160> this<00:01:58.550> probably<00:01:58.880> isn't<00:01:59.090> the

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
and really this this probably isn't the

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.110 
and really this this probably isn't the
safest<00:02:00.740> thing<00:02:01.190> to<00:02:01.220> do<00:02:01.460> because<00:02:01.640> it's<00:02:01.910> raining

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
safest thing to do because it's raining

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.390 
safest thing to do because it's raining
so<00:02:04.450> don't<00:02:05.450> try<00:02:05.630> this<00:02:05.690> at<00:02:05.870> home<00:02:06.040> I've<00:02:07.040> got<00:02:07.220> the

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
so don't try this at home I've got the

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.950 
so don't try this at home I've got the
traction<00:02:07.910> control<00:02:08.149> turned<00:02:08.840> on<00:02:10.420> so<00:02:11.420> I<00:02:11.450> may<00:02:11.750> not

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
traction control turned on so I may not

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.380 
traction control turned on so I may not
spend<00:02:12.230> tires<00:02:12.880> I'm<00:02:13.880> probably<00:02:14.540> not<00:02:16.150> spend<00:02:17.150> tires

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
spend tires I'm probably not spend tires

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.690 
spend tires I'm probably not spend tires
if<00:02:18.140> they<00:02:18.350> start<00:02:18.410> to<00:02:18.740> spend<00:02:19.040> i'm<00:02:19.370> going<00:02:19.520> to<00:02:19.580> let

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
if they start to spend i'm going to let

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.900 
if they start to spend i'm going to let

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
off right away that way things don't get

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.580 
off right away that way things don't get
out<00:02:22.970> of<00:02:23.120> control
