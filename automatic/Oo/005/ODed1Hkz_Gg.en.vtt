00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 and hi everyone today we get 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.370
 found for a video on the machined to 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:12.360
 snow 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.980
 the snow lean the snow generator 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.630
 it's called a little different 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.430
 ways then I'm going to make you a 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.920
 little demonstration and then a 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.300
 tutorial is a way I showed you 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.699
 the base and then a ways of 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.529
 improve it and have a lot of snow 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.990
 so that's what I got in one 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.269
 minute after a minute I stopped the 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.800
 chrono and I did all the blocks that 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.000
 so I had it took me more than one 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.130
 minute because in fact I still 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.780
 had to tow the blocks but that's so 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.840
 I got there was a little bit 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:44.129
 the less I really got 150 149 to little 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.629
 close 150 blocks of snow so it's okay 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.370
 it's really very fast then the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.469
 principle I ask myself here 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.480
 I support so I have three ways of doing 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.800
 either I stay pressed you see that it 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.510
 still well a flow that is when 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.979
 even okay either I stuff with 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.960
 my left click is going much faster 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.350
 and one way to do it is to do 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.030
 a very fast double click 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.290
 and that's it and I have the same thing as if I 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.520
 stuffing except that the fall just in 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.049
 train to stay pressed on the click 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.950
 left 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:22.049
 that's what I used to 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.409
 close on 50 block in a minute and and 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.430
 so that's how it works 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.509
 so it works with a golem of 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.570
 snow what you need for 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.310
 start this factory you need to 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.380
 blocks of snow so the blocks you the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.940
 did you break a little snow 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:43.470
 once you got 8.2 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:45.650
 snowball life you place them in 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.110
 quarters and you get some snow 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:54.240
 the blocks of snow and the base of this 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:57.860
 factory it's a block here after these two 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:05.250
 blocks the jelly would destroy I'm doing that 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:09.030
 so what's going on actually I 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.540
 take that one will say so what is this 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:15.090
 is happening here here this is where I'm going 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.950
 ask Mongolian m snow and it's going to be 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.810
 locked up by his rings all around at 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.150
 level of his head and he will not be able 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.490
 go out he will create snow in 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.190
 below his feet then he must 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.360
 first be in an area where there is already 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.710
 snow if I put myself 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.320
 here it will not work you have to be in 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.960
 an area where it snows these areas taiga 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.850
 snowy plains and so this is not the 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.590
 do not do in an area like this this name 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:42.300
 and you will not get any snow under 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:47.550
 under under your golem so I put a 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.230
 blog here hop a block here is above 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.910
 a pumpkin so two blocks of snow 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.290
 a pumpkin some blocks 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.970
 so there is no need for big 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.090
 thing and there you have other factory to 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.010
 snow and you can go there and 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.340
 apply it as a late command and where 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.880
 remain to be searched then I improved it 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.180
 in many ways firstly I 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.380
 put blocks around for design and 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.290
 in addition because it is not very beautiful and 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.630
 in addition because suddenly there if I if 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.730
 I put myself in front and that I click 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.260
 the snow will go everywhere around 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.940
 whereas if I put blocks that I 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:27.330
 actually lock it ie if I 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:30.780
 do that hop I'm closing here if I close 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:34.110
 all around this is exactly what 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.549
 that I did on the other side the snow 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.390
 will not be able to go through it's going 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:40.140
 leave on me actually 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.209
 that's all the snow is going to be 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.650
 find on me so that's what I have 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.480
 did I really lock them up in a 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.569
 block all the snow come only on 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.799
 I put a workbench here it's for 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.150
 simply can kraft and the 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.349
 snow directly because it takes 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.340
 a lot of room so to up if I 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:57.090
 go a little snow here it is directly 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.799
 I can crafter it and while being 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.109
 in that I need to be 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.519
 there she returned to me slap of kraft and 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.230
 I put an obsidian block because 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.400
 using the technique that I have you 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.430
 shown ie I'm doing a double 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.730
 what is a left double click and see the 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.930
 snow moves well very quickly then 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.129
 it is very painful but 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.010
 good you can use palanquÃ©es 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.299
 you if you do not have to do it and to 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.750
 Sail sailing and it happened 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.090
 kind shows that's what happened 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.280
 so here it works well 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.320
 in fact they pass through it's a 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.460
 little bit weird and see the block is 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.470
 just below it is getting 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.550
 break the block of stone cut for 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.410
 time and I'm trying to break it to 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:35.580
 the call so it's a I believe that in 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.249
 did it was a feat want because 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.749
 than 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:39.669
 in fact I pass through the snow 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:41.769
 think and what happened all to 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.219
 the hour - so here it is enough 

00:04:41.769 --> 00:04:44.469
 weird 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:47.079
 it is the blog broke regenerate or 

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:50.709
 I do not know what the block is 

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:51.909
 broken and and here he went to 

00:04:50.709 --> 00:04:54.969
 through it was a little bit 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:57.039
 what a way to stop 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:59.409
 completely that is to put 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:02.679
 obsidian so obsidian you the 

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:04.899
 neutered not with with with your shovel and 

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:07.329
 so here is double left click and you 

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:09.789
 wait too you just want with 

00:05:07.329 --> 00:05:10.829
 because you put the party they left and 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.749
 you do something else 

00:05:10.829 --> 00:05:17.649
 a little trick if you put yourself in 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:19.659
 peaceful in peaceful in the teeth in 

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:21.519
 the options your hunger bar does not 

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:23.979
 will not come down while if you're in 

00:05:21.519 --> 00:05:26.349
 normal in easy and it's your bar of 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:28.059
 hungry will go down when you go to do 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:29.919
 as you will use this 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:32.139
 technical so that's good it's a 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.369
 little technique to be quiet and 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:35.619
 not to be bothered by the clippers 

00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:37.809
 but that's usually a torch in one 

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:40.439
 little bit ok no problem so 

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:43.970
 this is the optimized snow factory 

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:46.080
 that's the design and two months 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.220
 the machining is not at all me 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.710
 know who it is at the base I 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.629
 I 'm sorry I can not I do not know 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.789
 at all the source 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:54.440
 but here it works at 1.3 and everything is going 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:56.789
 well 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.710
 if you liked the video do not hesitate 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:01.190
 to put a like to subscribe and I 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.190
 you say ciao ciao
