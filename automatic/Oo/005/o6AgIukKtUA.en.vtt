00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 customs service capabilities needed 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.270
 engage for economic development and 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.890
 support of domestic producers 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.769
 this was announced today by Alexander 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.759
 Lukashenko at a meeting with the staff 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.040
 State Customs Committee 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.109

 recent years thanks to modernization and 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.900
 reconstruction of inspection points 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.630
 managed to increase bandwidth 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.970
 almost 3 times there are other perspectives 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.619
 to improve the work created for this 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.320
 Institute for Advanced Studies and 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.350
 retraining of customs personnel 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.700
 but so far only each has 12 customs to 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.930
 profile education 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.690
 so the president ordered to create 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.920
 strict system of fixing frames on 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.809
 places after study 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.550
 also Alexander Lukashenko showed 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.590
 the latest equipment with which 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.590
 the same some smuggling contraband 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:55.379
 cost of contempt anti market 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:09.869
 the cost of all this 300 dollars 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:13.869
 About this we have calcite declares 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.100
 they generally saber hidden which 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.520
 therefore it is an object 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.590
 offense already in a meeting with a personal 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.479
 composition Alexander Lukashenko noted that 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.130
 in the present conditions the customs authorities 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.409
 must make every effort to 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.929
 support the economy to promote 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.149
 export and transit speech including 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.009
 goes about introducing modern technology 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.209
 inspection and electronic declaration 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:36.209
 goods and cargo 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:38.799
 the second thing the president noticed 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:40.929
 recent corruption committee 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.610
 state control opened a criminal case in 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.100
 attitude of customs officers 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.170
 stone log your monk it turned out that 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.060
 virtually all personnel on 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.299
 worked for several years 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.140
 criminal activities 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.539
 criminal scheme operated 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.479
 long term its defendants are 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.849
 about 20 officials total 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:04.780
 criminal profits are calculated 

00:01:59.849 --> 00:02:07.450
 Millions of dollars would like to 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.319
 someone answered why in the presence of 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.349
 experienced 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:14.470
 central apparatus of the selection system 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:16.110
 training and placement of 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.670
 internal control services 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.550
 own security and so on have 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.709
 such a gang formed near you 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.800
 bribery facts 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.319

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.810
 State Customs Service eyes 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.239
 public and moral damage from 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.319
 corruption cannot be measured by any 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.269
 in money 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.060
 dry what they presented to me 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.250
 photos during your search 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:47.190
 the staff is terrible this is awesome 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:51.790
 room completely lined with bundles 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.549
 bills of 10 thousand dollars each step 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.040

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:58.890
 Yes, the fact that they have withdrawn the committee 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.110
 state security 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.840
 I demanded to fundamentally understand 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.740
 within the criminal case who is all 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.830
 organized 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:11.190
 and who is involved in this, and even if 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.260
 he is allegedly not involved in the law because 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.870
 there are responsible people there but he 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.350
 chief he had to control 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:22.020
 these questions and processes and and those on 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.390
 surface we will write out the officials 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.240
 customs committee tried to take 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.540
 measures in particular two of 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:33.450
 often intermediaries they were previously 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.340
 customs shift officers were confident 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.310
 on the initiative of own service 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.680
 security or quietly fired in diana 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.370

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.640
 have it your guys say that we have 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.340
 Such a practice so that the person so that the noise 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.610
 there was no imprisonment 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.870
 there they pushed them apart because 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.270
 someone familiar 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.460
 relatives someone covers someone 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:03.990
 from picking everyone but but then add 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.670
 the president demanded to understand this 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.480
 stories bring the perpetrators to 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.790
 responsibility 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.740
 and here are bona fide employees who 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.370
