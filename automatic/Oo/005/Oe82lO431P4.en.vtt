opposed to in plastic or in the can that
they<00:03:33.420> come<00:03:33.630> from<00:03:33.660> because<00:03:33.990> I've<00:03:34.260> heard<00:03:34.500> that

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
they come from because I've heard that

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.240 
they come from because I've heard that
the<00:03:35.880> aluminium<00:03:36.420> can<00:03:36.660> can<00:03:37.050> kind<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.290> like<00:03:37.470> leach

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
the aluminium can can kind of like leach

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:39.980 
the aluminium can can kind of like leach
into<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:38.730> beans<00:03:38.970> and<00:03:39.210> make<00:03:39.390> them<00:03:39.630> like

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990

into the beans and make them like
poisonous<00:03:40.560> or<00:03:40.710> whatever<00:03:40.980> and<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.940> just<00:03:42.630> prefer

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
poisonous or whatever and I just prefer

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.780 
poisonous or whatever and I just prefer
glass<00:03:43.560> because<00:03:43.860> I<00:03:43.920> think<00:03:43.980> it's<00:03:44.220> safer<00:03:44.580> than

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
glass because I think it's safer than

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.540 
glass because I think it's safer than
plastic<00:03:46.910> in<00:03:47.910> behind<00:03:48.330> we<00:03:48.540> have<00:03:48.690> some<00:03:49.550> Dijon

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
mustard I've never ever had mustard

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.500 
mustard I've never ever had mustard
before<00:03:54.270> but<00:03:54.990> it<00:03:55.290> was<00:03:55.700> kind<00:03:56.700> of<00:03:56.790> called<00:03:57.060> for<00:03:57.360> in

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
before but it was kind of called for in

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.450 
before but it was kind of called for in
the<00:03:57.600> recipe<00:03:57.630> that<00:03:58.110> I<00:03:58.410> was<00:03:58.710> doing<00:03:59.130> last<00:03:59.310> night

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
the recipe that I was doing last night

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.010 
the recipe that I was doing last night
so<00:03:59.760> I<00:03:59.790> bought<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.090> little<00:04:00.270> tub<00:04:00.570> of<00:04:00.720> it<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:00.960> I

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
so I bought a little tub of it and I

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.080 
so I bought a little tub of it and I
thought<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.650> really<00:04:01.920> added<00:04:02.160> a<00:04:02.520> really<00:04:02.910> nice

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
thought it really added a really nice

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.750 
thought it really added a really nice
kind<00:04:03.330> of<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.600> just<00:04:04.500> a<00:04:04.590> hint<00:04:04.800> of<00:04:04.950> bitterness<00:04:05.160> to

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
kind of a just a hint of bitterness to

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.260 
kind of a just a hint of bitterness to
the<00:04:05.880> sauce<00:04:06.090> it<00:04:06.300> was<00:04:06.390> just<00:04:06.570> a<00:04:06.630> really<00:04:06.960> yummy

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
the sauce it was just a really yummy

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.900 
the sauce it was just a really yummy

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
next we have some cheese Lee let me just

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.860 
next we have some cheese Lee let me just
get<00:04:12.000> this<00:04:12.150> out<00:04:12.390> here<00:04:14.120> I<00:04:15.120> don't<00:04:15.300> know<00:04:15.510> if<00:04:15.570> any<00:04:15.750> of

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
get this out here I don't know if any of

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.300 
get this out here I don't know if any of
you<00:04:15.990> will<00:04:16.140> have<00:04:16.230> heard<00:04:16.470> of<00:04:16.530> cheese<00:04:16.770> Lee<00:04:16.950> before

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
but it's basically a dairy-free

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.460 
but it's basically a dairy-free
alternative<00:04:20.580> to<00:04:21.090> cheese<00:04:21.600> if<00:04:21.900> this<00:04:22.169> is<00:04:22.350> the

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
alternative to cheese if this is the

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.400 
alternative to cheese if this is the
mature<00:04:22.800> red<00:04:23.070> cheddar<00:04:23.370> soil<00:04:23.900> it's<00:04:24.900> not<00:04:25.169> the

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
mature red cheddar soil it's not the

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.180 
mature red cheddar soil it's not the
exact<00:04:25.830> same<00:04:25.919> as<00:04:26.250> cheese<00:04:26.490> it<00:04:26.669> is<00:04:26.760> a<00:04:26.790> little

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
exact same as cheese it is a little

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.370 
exact same as cheese it is a little
more<00:04:27.430> crumbly<00:04:27.850> than<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.240> kind<00:04:28.480> of<00:04:28.630> cheddar

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
more crumbly than the kind of cheddar

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.620 
more crumbly than the kind of cheddar
that<00:04:29.500> I'm<00:04:29.740> used<00:04:29.980> to<00:04:30.070> but<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.400> mature<00:04:31.000> style<00:04:31.390> is

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
that I'm used to but the mature style is

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.300 
that I'm used to but the mature style is
my<00:04:31.780> absolute<00:04:32.170> favorite<00:04:32.590> and<00:04:32.680> I<00:04:32.830> love<00:04:32.860> to<00:04:33.130> have
