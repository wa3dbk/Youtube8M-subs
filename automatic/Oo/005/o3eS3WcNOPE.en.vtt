mix<00:02:07.520> a<00:02:07.789> paddle<00:02:08.720> would<00:02:09.080> beat<00:02:09.349> it<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:09.740> death

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
mix a paddle would beat it to death

I<00:02:10.250> don't<00:02:10.700> want<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:11.030> do<00:02:11.180> that<00:02:11.360> using<00:02:11.569> a<00:02:11.750> hook<00:02:12.020> is

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
I don't want to do that using a hook is

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.380 
I don't want to do that using a hook is
better<00:02:12.440> to<00:02:12.770> slow<00:02:13.160> mix<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.730> slowly<00:02:14.090> bring

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
better to slow mix to slowly bring

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.550

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
rolling videos together

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.020

it<00:02:15.830> looks<00:02:16.010> quite<00:02:16.099> wet<00:02:16.370> at<00:02:16.520> the<00:02:16.610> moment<00:02:16.970> but

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
it looks quite wet at the moment but

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.300 
it looks quite wet at the moment but
eventually<00:02:17.630> they'll<00:02:18.260> get<00:02:18.530> quite<00:02:18.740> glutinous

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
eventually they'll get quite glutinous

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.100 
eventually they'll get quite glutinous
that<00:02:19.459> all<00:02:19.610> come<00:02:19.880> into<00:02:20.120> one<00:02:20.360> ball<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.050> the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
that all come into one ball and the

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.540 
that all come into one ball and the
mixer<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.590> that's<00:02:21.740> an<00:02:21.830> indication<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.490> it's

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
mixer and that's an indication and it's

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.670 
mixer and that's an indication and it's
actually<00:02:22.880> ready<00:02:23.060> but<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:24.230> thing<00:02:24.410> is<00:02:24.440> you<00:02:24.590> can

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
actually ready but the thing is you can

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.830 
actually ready but the thing is you can
add<00:02:24.770> butter<00:02:25.010> to<00:02:25.160> that<00:02:25.310> should<00:02:26.000> again<00:02:26.240> slacken

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
add butter to that should again slacken

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.809 
add butter to that should again slacken
it<00:02:26.959> down<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.530> then<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.980> whole<00:02:28.190> mix<00:02:28.520> will<00:02:28.700> go

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
it down and then the whole mix will go

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.390 
it down and then the whole mix will go
in<00:02:29.060> the<00:02:29.240> fridge<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.840> the<00:02:30.530> fridge<00:02:30.829> will<00:02:31.069> chill

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
in the fridge and the fridge will chill

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.860 
in the fridge and the fridge will chill
the<00:02:31.489> butter<00:02:31.700> down<00:02:31.939> chill<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.329> dough<00:02:32.360> down<00:02:32.689> and

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
the butter down chill the dough down and

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.339 
the butter down chill the dough down and
then<00:02:32.989> it<00:02:33.079> becomes<00:02:33.379> something<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.680> can<00:02:33.920> use

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
then it becomes something you can use

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.989 
then it becomes something you can use
at<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.129> moment<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.459> won't<00:02:35.579> be<00:02:35.670> able<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.819> use

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:35.999 
at the moment you won't be able to use

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.479 
at the moment you won't be able to use
that<00:02:36.180> it's<00:02:36.329> too<00:02:36.480> soft<00:02:36.749> so<00:02:36.989> you<00:02:37.409> put<00:02:37.680> three<00:02:38.040> in

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
that it's too soft so you put three in

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.209 
that it's too soft so you put three in
the<00:02:38.760> fridge<00:02:38.969> but<00:02:39.359> don't<00:02:40.049> break<00:02:40.230> putting<00:02:41.189> a

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.219 
the fridge but don't break putting a

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.160 
the fridge but don't break putting a
warm<00:02:41.430> place<00:02:41.670> maybe<00:02:42.540> they<00:02:42.689> put<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:42.930> in<00:02:43.019> a<00:02:43.049> warm

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
warm place maybe they put it in a warm

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.699 
warm place maybe they put it in a warm
place<00:02:44.239> that<00:02:45.239> would<00:02:45.420> be<00:02:45.629> this<00:02:46.319> is<00:02:46.499> are<00:02:46.650> you

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
place that would be this is are you

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.339 
place that would be this is are you
going<00:02:47.010> on<00:02:47.480> people<00:02:48.480> dare<00:02:48.659> in<00:02:48.749> a<00:02:48.810> warm<00:02:49.019> place<00:02:49.109> to

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349 
going on people dare in a warm place to

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.629 
going on people dare in a warm place to
rise<00:02:49.639> the<00:02:50.639> issue<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:52.109> rises<00:02:53.040> quickly<00:02:53.250> yeah

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:53.639 
rise the issue is it rises quickly yeah

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.780 
rise the issue is it rises quickly yeah
if<00:02:54.510> it<00:02:54.719> rises<00:02:54.959> quicker<00:02:55.530> you're<00:02:56.280> losing<00:02:56.700> the

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
if it rises quicker you're losing the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.259 
if it rises quicker you're losing the
flavor<00:02:57.469> the<00:02:58.469> longer<00:02:59.099> bread<00:02:59.459> takes<00:02:59.819> to<00:03:00.060> rise

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
flavor the longer bread takes to rise

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.990 
flavor the longer bread takes to rise
the<00:03:00.810> more<00:03:01.019> flavor<00:03:01.439> you<00:03:01.769> get<00:03:01.950> in<00:03:02.069> it<00:03:02.189> if<00:03:02.849> you

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
the more flavor you get in it if you

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.239 
the more flavor you get in it if you
rise<00:03:03.239> it<00:03:03.450> overnight<00:03:03.900> reduce<00:03:04.379> to<00:03:04.560> reduce<00:03:05.069> the

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:05.249 
rise it overnight reduce to reduce the

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:07.250 
rise it overnight reduce to reduce the
yeast<00:03:05.489> pop<00:03:05.819> it<00:03:05.999> in<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.239> fridge<00:03:06.689> and<00:03:07.139> the

yeast pop it in the fridge and the

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.890 
yeast pop it in the fridge and the
flavor<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:07.859> intense<00:03:08.609> can<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.209> actually<00:03:09.359> over

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
flavor is intense can you actually over

flavor is intense can you actually over
mix<00:03:10.109> it<00:03:10.349> it<00:03:10.950> is<00:03:11.159> possible<00:03:11.370> at<00:03:11.639> this<00:03:11.760> speed

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
mix it it is possible at this speed

straight<00:05:48.710> away<00:05:48.919> begin<00:05:49.909> to<00:05:50.030> fizz<00:05:50.270> and<00:05:50.389> they're

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:50.509 
straight away begin to fizz and they're

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:52.600 
straight away begin to fizz and they're
gonna<00:05:50.599> rise<00:05:50.900> up<00:05:51.229> because<00:05:51.500> the<00:05:51.680> air<00:05:51.979> has<00:05:52.310> been

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
gonna rise up because the air has been

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.390 
gonna rise up because the air has been
pushed<00:05:53.060> inside<00:05:53.539> the<00:05:53.690> doughnut<00:05:54.280> basically<00:05:55.280> the

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 
pushed inside the doughnut basically the

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.589 
pushed inside the doughnut basically the
more<00:05:55.520> that<00:05:55.699> you<00:05:55.819> put<00:05:56.000> in<00:05:56.090> obviously<00:05:56.449> it

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:56.599 
more that you put in obviously it

00:05:56.599 --> 00:05:58.629 
more that you put in obviously it
reduces<00:05:56.990> the<00:05:57.199> temperature<00:05:57.409> of<00:05:57.889> the<00:05:58.069> fat<00:05:58.310> so<00:05:58.490> be

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
reduces the temperature of the fat so be

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.100 
reduces the temperature of the fat so be
careful<00:05:59.060> of<00:05:59.120> that<00:05:59.180> I<00:05:59.300> may<00:05:59.509> now<00:05:59.629> fit<00:05:59.870> it<00:06:00.020> in

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:00.110 
careful of that I may now fit it in

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.469 
careful of that I may now fit it in
probably<00:06:00.379> about<00:06:00.530> 15<00:06:00.949> these<00:06:01.639> little<00:06:02.120> beauties

00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 
probably about 15 these little beauties

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:05.080 
probably about 15 these little beauties
take<00:06:02.900> around<00:06:03.199> three<00:06:03.500> minutes<00:06:03.710> to<00:06:03.979> fry<00:06:04.250> you<00:06:04.969> see

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:05.090 
take around three minutes to fry you see

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.760 
take around three minutes to fry you see
the<00:06:05.180> way<00:06:05.270> they<00:06:05.389> flip<00:06:05.599> it<00:06:05.719> over<00:06:05.840> what's

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
the way they flip it over what's

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.379 
the way they flip it over what's
happening<00:06:07.129> is<00:06:07.310> when<00:06:07.490> they<00:06:07.639> when<00:06:07.969> they<00:06:08.090> cook

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389 
happening is when they when they cook

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:11.350 
happening is when they when they cook
they<00:06:08.780> just<00:06:08.990> flip<00:06:09.259> over<00:06:09.409> so<00:06:09.909> it's<00:06:10.909> a<00:06:11.030> great<00:06:11.210> way

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
they just flip over so it's a great way

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.580 
they just flip over so it's a great way
of<00:06:11.389> doing<00:06:11.539> this<00:06:11.719> you<00:06:11.840> don't<00:06:11.930> actually<00:06:12.199> have<00:06:12.530> to

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
of doing this you don't actually have to

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.219 
of doing this you don't actually have to
do<00:06:12.919> anything<00:06:13.330> on<00:06:14.330> this<00:06:14.479> string

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229 
do anything on this string

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:17.890 
do anything on this string
I<00:06:15.699> think<00:06:16.699> the<00:06:16.789> brilliant<00:06:17.240> flip<00:06:17.449> over<00:06:17.719> do<00:06:17.870> it

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:17.900 
I think the brilliant flip over do it

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:21.149 
I think the brilliant flip over do it
