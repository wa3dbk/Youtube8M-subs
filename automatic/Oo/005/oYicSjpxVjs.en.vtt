00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.190
 this also goes for those who want 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.290
 develop muscles without accumulating fat 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.430
 here we have a combination of the three 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.080
 basic food protein here the 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.670
 we will use powder but you can use 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.710
 egg whites 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.619
 although I do not recommend it to you unless 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.099
 be on a desert island your friends will 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.170
 they will hate my girlfriend hated me you know 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:30.320
 because if you choose that path 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.260
 the following is fat we need good 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.890
 fat either olive oil or olive oil 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.600
 peanut 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.290
 and we also have two types of 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.930
 oatmeal carbohydrates that is low in 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.090
 sugars and fruit 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.340
 my favorite recipe is called lavÃ­n and 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.170
 classic and it carries chocolate protein in 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.170
 powder bananas and peanut butter 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.519
 you can do it as you want only 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.949
 make sure to use fat protein and 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.980
 carbohydrates and adjust the calories 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.110
 according to your goals 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.050
 let me show you how I do that 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.660
 You are here the film crew and 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.260
 They are hungry so I am going to make them 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.260
 one too 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.810
 first we add the protein 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.680
 for me 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:30.130
 Use of 40 to 60 grams of protein 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.040
 so I'm going to put two tablespoons 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.950
 for me 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.950
 and let's see if there is enough for all 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.340
 4 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.909
 5 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.220
 that should be enough 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.710
 let's put some olive oil 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.830
 Now I do not think you like the 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.310
 oats because it does not taste too good and does not 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.310
 we cooked it 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.830
 that's why we better put the fruit 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.179
 this is called a fruit explosion 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.129
 we will put the zamora 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.440
 that was like 25 or 30 grams of 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.440
 carbohydrates 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.610
 let's put some raspberries too 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.240
 lots of fruit 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.550
 we finish the milk 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.620
 here there are many calories 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.209
 ice is missing 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.209
 and it lacks water 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:57.490
 As I said, I always use water 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.770
 distilled this is because of my attitude of I will 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.770
 whatever it is to get those calories 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.600
 it is thick 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.680
 it takes a bit but there it is 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.250
 500 calories of healthy fat and 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.650
 clean carbohydrates 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:20.790
 I 'm going to take it and then I'll put my 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.489
 stopwatch to eat something in three hours 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.680
 after that meal I will return it to 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.680
 activate and I'll have another milkshake 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:34.020
 that way at the end of the day complete 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.030
 in my six meals and I would have used my 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:38.010
 milkshakes alone as a way to 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:40.700
 get the calories that I missed 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.700
 in the food 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:50.840
 it tastes delicious 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.840
 no kidding this one knows very well 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.520
 Well it is not homemade pasta but it works 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.990
 so I hope you enjoy it 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.990
 just one last thing 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:08.930
 here use fruit 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:11.930
 but if you want to grow fast, use oats 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.950
 nothing better than oats to climb 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:20.169
 weight has many calories and is more 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.169
 thick but it works a lot
