00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.369
 doctor digs but if my son should 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:20.919
 come an atp sv means a tachycardia 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:24.279
 paroxysmal ventricular sort yes 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:27.160
 face then psv sides is an arrhythmia 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.470
 fast heart tachycardia 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.720
 he begins to beat very quickly 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.820
 up to 300 beats per minute 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.350
 this because of a kind of short 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.750
 circuit that occurs in its fabric 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.089
 electric the child according to age 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.360
 he can breathe quickly and say he has 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:45.219
 chest pain pales in some cases 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.320
 looking at the chest it almost looks like the 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.480
 heart wants to come out but it is 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.440
 scary no it is not must not be done 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.059
 panic 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:54.430
 everything depends on the agreements made with the 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.829
 doctors but often it is not necessary 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.730
 call 118 and run to the hospital 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.680
 often it is enough to do vagal maneuvers what 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.479
 my daughter something so precise and serious 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.509
 and she tells me to do well that 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.720
 vague maneuvers not vague vagal holy 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.729
 valsalva the heart and circulation as 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.970
 the breath among other things and other functions 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.310
 of our body is regulated by the system 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.600
 this involuntary vegetative nervous system 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.270
 she knows it well 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.130
 this system many do not know is divided 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.009
 in two opposite poles the brake e 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.409
 the accelerator the sympathetic vegetable garden 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.829
 simply the accelerator is nice 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.990
 that of the Latin 3 to be clear on the 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.480
 parasympathetic or wagons instead is the brake 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.490
 and when there is a rhythm 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.500
 the accelerator to the maximum and then us 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.810
 what we do pull the exact brake 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.810
 let's go to stimulate the vagus nerve 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.540
 hence the name of vaguely understood maneuvers 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.570
 I begin to see more clearly and therefore 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.610
 as i am well it depends on the age at each 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.070
 age there is a specific answer to 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.050
 different stimulations for babies and children 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:02.330
 very small react positively 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.330
 to ice placed on the face 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.420
 like the crocodile she knows the 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.780
 crocodile as it does 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.670
 no there is no one who knows how to joke 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.560
 instead we know very well the 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.140
 crocodile before diving gets wet 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.819
 the face better to say the muzzle and with 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.980
 very cold water because this 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.470
 slows down his heart rate and 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.000
 it allows to go in apnea and the same one 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.190
 what happens on the very young child 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.230
 this ice on the face 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.390
 slow down at heart this maneuver can 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.580
 be continued for 20 or 30 seconds is 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.950
 repeated up to three four times a 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.930
 sometimes a soft tube also works 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.300
 in the bottom a teaspoon corners e 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.670
 this up to what age we say up to 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.940
 completion of the first year after must 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.430
 do other maneuvers other maneuvers 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.550
 which there are there are 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.800
 main is the valsalva nei maneuver 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.870
 younger children go with one 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.090
 hand on belly for a few seconds then 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.700
 it is released suddenly this is 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.170
 the passive maneuver the active maneuver 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.930
 instead it applies to children who are 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.640
 already collaborators get seated 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.010
 and he is told to push as if 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.730
 they should go from body to nose 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.739
 mouth closed 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.890
 this too is repeatable three or four 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.739
 times and then there's the former ten 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:25.110
 flipping feet up and head in 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.000
 low for safety and better to lay down 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.470
 first the child on a rug on a 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.290
 sofa and then with the help of an adult 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.970
 make it go upright with 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.209
 this position overturned andrea 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.549
 maintained for 15 20 seconds is repeated 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.329
 even this three or four times 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:45.000
 and then there is asi and sporting the sport the 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.730
 accompanied fast accompaniment o 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.390
 less from the jump or you can also 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:55.590
 tell the child to blow into a 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.750
 balloon vigorously so if it's not there 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.560
 the balloon is fine here too 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.510
 bottle 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.540
 or you can make shots of 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.310
 repeated and energetic cough extreme ratio 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.810
 you can also cause vomiting with a 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.810
 spoon a finger in the ass 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:19.720
 thank you doctor I feel better than I can 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.790
 do something before requesting the 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.979
 in short, I feel relieved 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:26.050
 they are all completely safe maneuvers 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.750
 and the only thing to remember is that they go 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.030
 made right away the sooner the better 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.710
 you can also avoid it if you switch to the symptom 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.600
 to go to the emergency room 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.600
 thank you doctor goodbye
