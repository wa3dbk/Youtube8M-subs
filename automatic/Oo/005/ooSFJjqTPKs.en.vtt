00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.150
 with the horses or other excellent competition of psv 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.990
 unfortunately a tie he is among other things in Sat. 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:11.349
 naja ever think very well started 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:13.899
 we put a good one under pressure 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:18.679
 audience can generate behind, so year 6 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.810
 they didn't seem impressed 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.619
 we did get a few chances and 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.319
 after that error free 

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:29.779
 understanding another acw also lost a bit 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:30.869
 think we still 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.050
 number of opportunities created in the first half 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.380
 and 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.850
 yes i feel we have all recovered recovered 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.760
 in came across psv 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.960
 we notice the light that I think of yes 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.550
 I think a few agents and three hundred percent opportunities 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.540
 we think if we tried to score it when they play there 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.490
 that things can still go far 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:58.490
 It's a shame you can finish them here in Eindhoven I have finished 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.650
 of course only 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.970
 a modern non-express 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.500
 just have to work on it and 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.340
 yes believe more have faith in that 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.510
 yes it will be fine with toppers 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.140
 a religious but you forget yourself also a reward of psv played at 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.560
 flurries like lego 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.140
 yes the village 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.420
 at times good football and 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.410
 yes that is nice and fresh 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.890
 So yes subject vittel how can we reward ourselves 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.570
 if we are going to do that there 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.000
 a great result 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.370
 shine small lesson is that a strict team plays as a minor mistake 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.030
 small determining 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.289
 yes you see that right away 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.789
 but the ball doubts about shooting away or with a good goalie 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.530
 so then 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.440
 then saw a climbing back 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.860
 jack straighten sure yes the light spots in the club 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.800
 finally through the chance of psv last week in milan 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.710
 although I said so I think so 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.820
 yes good feeling back 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.820
 in that we also know that we can be dangerous 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.590
 sustainable just go there us 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.269
 almost everything on everything to a thawed 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.239
 to get into the pot 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.299
 played an excellent game why is there not 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.289
 of course srs season 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:18.509
 Pictures taken to pay yourself again 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:21.509
 we can be proud of each other I am also happy that 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:25.479
 yes that we are still too short according to stern 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.539
 max that a little bit good of it 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:29.829
