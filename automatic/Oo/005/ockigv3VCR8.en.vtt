00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:04.060
 I read that I can see too long in the water with a bit of sun 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.189
 how beautiful the autumn to color the winter is still called it 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.710
 They only have other countries in Europe Austria is next 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.580
 Finance and heavy industry second is Alonso so imagine 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.289
 but on 7 40 percent of Austria's are wooded in Greenland they must 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:22.170
 about 33% and 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.409
 There are no fewer than 2,160 wooden houses per day 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:27.569
 of course, it is me 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:32.579
 symbolically meant but the amount of wood one for 2160 short sentence 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.609
 would need 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:37.470
 It grows per day in Austria and Holzmaden adjustability 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.129
 really huge amounts and 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.989
 What you can do with wood we deal with today 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.110
 broadcast 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.830
 dpa 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.830
 Dirk 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.630
 Austria is one of the densest of the two countries of Europe 31 million 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.730
 cubic meter 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.489
 Do not let up and put two thirds of it 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.070
 Wood can be used in many ways, not just for heating 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.880
 First of all, think of the construction industry and they fell with it 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.299
 The first advantage of DAX is the raw material wood immediately before 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.520
 Doorstep and is particularly environmentally friendly as a natural raw material 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.660
 For example, a wooden house scepter stores 75 tons of co2 and it drags 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.410
 large quantities of greenhouse gas from the atmosphere the units consultants 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.370
 Burgenland have made it their mission to give people the numerous 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.240
 Advantages of the building material to bring wood closer 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.960
 and already main task is 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.030
 TuS wooden churches and to increase the image of wood 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.540
 and, of course, build with wood to increase it 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.620
 We offer a hydrofoil applications 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.220
 outdated 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.280
 that in everyone's interest has to build with wood from students and cabinets 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.720
 and laid 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.720
 one in almost completely through the technical advice 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.450
 it works 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.950
 to private that we then communities back from outskirts 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.640
 and planners and architects for our services 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.870
 The most important and most widespread wood care is the spruce 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.430
 she has a nice straight line is light in weight and leaves 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.779
 well-edited alternatives are few 

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:25.129
 alternatively, maybe the depth is 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.709
 Pine please login 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.249
 all other woods are no longer singing in the nature of Franconia 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.480
 The tree blow takes place mainly in the winter months 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.819
 conventional methods 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.379
 The so-called harvester is also increasingly being used 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.109
 the most capable for the tree but the danger of the solid worldwide 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:01.159
 and cuts the trunk to the desired length 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.209
 in the thinning is currently also of under growth worldwide 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.829
 so far, the woodwork in the forest takes that has again 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.829
 she was always losing easily 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:15.579
 switching mainly in the summer only asks the post 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:19.759
 The Steelers are working from the Hearth Wettringen 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.259
 with concentrated power and met there on the table 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:26.249
 be mighty trees like the smallest field 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.249
 at the same time took place 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.189
 the wood is managed 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:42.009
 hopefully transported away as quickly as possible 

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:45.139
 we promise to be stored intermediately 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.049
 Pattern and her informant will be Ringgit 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.529
 Criticism instead of the the theft damage shop or on 

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:51.809
 Machinery 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:55.349
 and then it will wood according to the desired dimensions in the sawmill 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.119
 incised 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:58.139
 of course, too 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.419
 an appropriate lawsuit bomb revolution clock 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:03.729
 with a good one 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:06.279
 or favorable percent 

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:09.279
 a nursery 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.209
 It has long been known in Wilnsdorf both the only work 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.019
 as well as a carpentry 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.630
 How does Schulz manage to do so? 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:25.289
 on 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.599
 the rest should be delivered by the farmers us that Holzmann 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.620
 not only in the winter 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.999
 interested then bring in ours 

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:37.719
 also tortured 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:41.020
 - we need time to round off a fourth series 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:46.720
 the company's product range extends from roof truss to the top floor 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:48.230
 take and residential houses 

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:52.219
 as well as conservatories and everything else I have to do today 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:56.949
 in addition to the couple Fürst also 15 other employees are employed 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.150
 computerized machines are nowadays allowed 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.559
 and you have to be next to manual skill 

00:05:02.559 --> 00:05:05.010
 master the handling of these machines 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.240
 without machines until 10 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.999
 That's why should actually be allowed by CNC control 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.349
 because that's enough space 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.120
 she played in the office as now 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.479
 Drawn why 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.099
 Disk is saved and then 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.099
 robbed the computer of and machine 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.499
 a given 

00:05:27.499 --> 00:05:31.779
 The way is equally favorable for homeowners as private 

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:33.010
 also four communities 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.900
 Schools are also benefiting from timber construction, according to studies are targets in the 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.100
 Environment of wood 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.699
 power and concentration 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:44.840
 In addition, wooden structures also look very dangerous and are visually 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.520
 long outgrown the image of the log cabin 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.400
 many wooden houses are not allowed as such 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.349
 recognize 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:54.900
 Fischer Schir many houses 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.319
 when they are done 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:00.250
 Do not go outside or you do not assume that a wooden railing will take them 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:01.080
 plugged 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:04.990
 the bearing parts of a thrust are warned among the racing teams 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.770
 or even a school massive l 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.860
 were not there 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.659
 from the Burgenland Holzbach consultants you can still 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:17.800
 many more practical advantages of the building material wood experience for example 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.699
 when building a house 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:20.819
 the man with one 

00:06:20.819 --> 00:06:23.710
 Without a quick hand with a faster does not bring 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.589
 Percent the same 

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:28.939
 Characteristics or your values ​​reaches the men far stands 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:31.020
 stronger 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.120
 This will be the home coach Dudar chair edge one will be complaining about 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.120
 A smaller one comes by a small advantage 

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:44.000
 Also low energy house roofing thought boats off exits 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.220
 Cover terrace and and and the uses of wood are 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.320
 almost unlimited and there is virtually no waste wood there 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:56.939
 that is either burned directly or serves as fuel 

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:59.669
 biomass heating 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:03.629
 Incidentally, building with wood is not more expensive than conventional 

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:07.969
 Materials wood is good Werne demented and by the possibility of 4 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:09.919
 Manufacturing can save you time 

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:13.139
 when increasing the time factor is sometimes very important 

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:16.249
 there is great advantage of Holtz 

00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:20.869
 It is build up first sum due to the lower weight of the wooden wall 

00:07:21.369 --> 00:07:23.949
 The burden of the busy place is trained 

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:26.129
 relieved to install 

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:29.509
 and also have and express the benefit of saving that relatively quickly 

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:30.339
 money 

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:33.069
