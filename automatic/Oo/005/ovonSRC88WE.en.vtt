00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.609 
that's some issues that you know that
Fuji<00:01:21.799> has<00:01:22.970> it's<00:01:23.970> got<00:01:24.810> some<00:01:25.110> trouble<00:01:25.470> with

Fuji has it's got some trouble with
focusing<00:01:26.220> up<00:01:26.400> close<00:01:27.170> so<00:01:28.170> if<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.439> only<00:01:28.650> really

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
focusing up close so if you only really

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.219 
focusing up close so if you only really
want<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.310> take<00:01:29.490> an<00:01:29.610> image<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.240> something<00:01:30.780> that

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
want to take an image of something that

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.859 
want to take an image of something that
is<00:01:31.500> nice<00:01:32.340> and<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.880> want<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.180> take<00:01:33.509> your<00:01:33.659> time

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
is nice and you want to take your time

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.560 
is nice and you want to take your time
and<00:01:34.229> set<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.650> up<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:35.430> would<00:01:35.880> use<00:01:36.030> manual<00:01:36.329> focus

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
and set it up I would use manual focus

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.499 
and set it up I would use manual focus
even<00:01:37.079> with<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> current<00:01:38.060> update<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
even with the current update of the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.020 
even with the current update of the
firmware<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:40.200> still<00:01:41.040> find<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.850> not

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
firmware I still find the is not

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.420 
firmware I still find the is not
reliable<00:01:42.360> up<00:01:43.140> close<00:01:44.149> anything<00:01:46.130> like<00:01:47.130> more

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
reliable up close anything like more

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.780 
reliable up close anything like more
than<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.880> meter<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.770> out<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.340> fine

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
than the meter and and and out is fine

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.370 
than the meter and and and out is fine
but<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.299> know<00:01:51.390> it's<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:51.840> some<00:01:51.990> reason<00:01:52.259> like

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
but you know it's for some reason like

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.639 
but you know it's for some reason like
macro<00:01:52.799> stuff<00:01:53.070> there's<00:01:53.850> issues<00:01:54.240> with<00:01:54.649> with

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
macro stuff there's issues with with

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.569 
macro stuff there's issues with with
that<00:01:55.829> Fujifilm<00:01:56.430> okay<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.899> a

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
that Fujifilm okay so this is a

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.679 
that Fujifilm okay so this is a
rangefinder<00:01:59.579> of<00:01:59.909> an<00:01:59.969> overlay<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.479> reason

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
rangefinder of an overlay and the reason

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:01.999 
rangefinder of an overlay and the reason
I<00:02:00.750> said<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.200> because<00:02:01.469> when<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.710> look<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.979> a

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
I said it is because when you look to a

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.260 
I said it is because when you look to a
rangefinder<00:02:02.570> you'll<00:02:03.570> notice<00:02:04.049> that

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
rangefinder you'll notice that

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.249 
rangefinder you'll notice that
everything<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.420> going<00:02:06.600> to<00:02:06.659> be<00:02:06.719> in<00:02:06.780> focus<00:02:06.990> so

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
everything is going to be in focus so

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.859 
everything is going to be in focus so
you're<00:02:07.500> not<00:02:07.619> really<00:02:07.799> sure<00:02:07.950> if<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.300> image

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
you're not really sure if the image

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.330 
you're not really sure if the image
you're<00:02:10.080> actually<00:02:10.440> taking<00:02:10.709> is<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.099> focus

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
you're actually taking is in focus

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.820 
you're actually taking is in focus
see<00:02:12.849> like<00:02:13.090> for<00:02:13.239> example<00:02:13.330> see<00:02:14.230> I<00:02:14.260> keep<00:02:14.560> pressing

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
see like for example see I keep pressing

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.790 
see like for example see I keep pressing
and<00:02:15.280> I<00:02:15.760> keep<00:02:15.970> getting<00:02:16.120> that<00:02:16.300> message<00:02:17.430> see

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
and I keep getting that message see

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:29.940 
and I keep getting that message see
trying<00:02:20.800> to<00:02:21.010> focus<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:22.560> can't<00:02:23.560> get<00:02:23.770> it

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.640 

see<00:02:30.950> I've<00:02:31.159> tried<00:02:31.400> at<00:02:31.579> least<00:02:31.760> 10<00:02:32.000> times<00:02:32.650> you

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
see I've tried at least 10 times you

cannot get that ball in focus okay so
what<00:02:36.920> you<00:02:37.010> could<00:02:37.189> do<00:02:37.430> is<00:02:37.730> either<00:02:37.909> switch<00:02:38.269> to

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
what you could do is either switch to

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:45.490 
what you could do is either switch to
macro<00:02:38.840> mode<00:02:41.739> see<00:02:42.739> let's<00:02:43.340> switch<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:44.500> macro

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
macro mode see let's switch to macro

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.890 
macro mode see let's switch to macro
mode<00:02:45.680> okay<00:02:47.739> we<00:02:48.739> have<00:02:48.889> macro<00:02:49.250> mode<00:02:49.400> yeah<00:02:49.900> all

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
mode okay we have macro mode yeah all

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.899 
mode okay we have macro mode yeah all
right<00:02:51.079> now<00:02:51.109> let's<00:02:51.920> see<00:02:52.129> if<00:02:52.459> this<00:02:52.639> is<00:02:52.670> gonna

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:52.909 
right now let's see if this is gonna

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:56.920 
right now let's see if this is gonna
work<00:02:54.549> at<00:02:55.549> all<00:02:55.849> it's<00:02:56.090> telling<00:02:56.299> me<00:02:56.480> not<00:02:56.569> to<00:02:56.629> shake

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
work at all it's telling me not to shake

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.869 
work at all it's telling me not to shake
the<00:02:57.049> camera<00:02:58.900> okay<00:02:59.900> see<00:03:00.799> now<00:03:00.829> in<00:03:01.340> macro<00:03:01.849> mode

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
the camera okay see now in macro mode

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:08.789 
the camera okay see now in macro mode
when<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.269> switched<00:03:04.389> now<00:03:05.389> I<00:03:05.419> get<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:06.639> get<00:03:07.639> the<00:03:07.819> LCD

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
when I switched now I get I get the LCD

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.460 
when I switched now I get I get the LCD
turn<00:03:09.799> on<00:03:09.980> inside<00:03:10.639> the<00:03:10.790> preview<00:03:11.030> finder<00:03:11.659> so<00:03:12.290> now

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
turn on inside the preview finder so now

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.949 
turn on inside the preview finder so now
I<00:03:12.500> know<00:03:13.370> if<00:03:13.669> images<00:03:14.120> are<00:03:14.269> in<00:03:14.359> focus<00:03:14.750> this<00:03:14.900> is

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
I know if images are in focus this is

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.509 
I know if images are in focus this is
the<00:03:15.200> LCD<00:03:15.620> right<00:03:15.769> now<00:03:15.919> this<00:03:16.099> is<00:03:16.250> not<00:03:16.400> the

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:16.519 
the LCD right now this is not the

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.190 
the LCD right now this is not the
rangefinder<00:03:16.790> with<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.329> overlay<00:03:17.689> this<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:18.439> LCD

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
rangefinder with the overlay this is LCD

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.679 
rangefinder with the overlay this is LCD
see<00:03:21.200> there<00:03:21.590> you<00:03:21.889> go<00:03:22.040> now<00:03:22.280> we're<00:03:22.489> focused<00:03:22.909> you

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:23.689 
see there you go now we're focused you

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:27.849 
see there you go now we're focused you
see<00:03:24.400> now<00:03:25.400> if<00:03:25.790> using<00:03:26.269> LCD<00:03:26.780> it's<00:03:27.469> going<00:03:27.709> to<00:03:27.769> be

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
see now if using LCD it's going to be

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.740 
see now if using LCD it's going to be
easy<00:03:28.069> for<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.579> see<00:03:28.790> if<00:03:28.849> the<00:03:28.939> images<00:03:29.299> are<00:03:29.510> in

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
easy for you to see if the images are in

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.170 
easy for you to see if the images are in
focus<00:03:29.959> or<00:03:30.439> they're<00:03:30.739> not<00:03:31.000> because<00:03:32.000> you're

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
focus or they're not because you're

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.199 
focus or they're not because you're
basically<00:03:32.479> going<00:03:32.659> to<00:03:32.750> see<00:03:32.900> them<00:03:32.989> in<00:03:33.109> focus

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
basically going to see them in focus

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.219 
basically going to see them in focus
so<00:03:36.010> that's<00:03:37.479> that's<00:03:38.479> what<00:03:38.720> you<00:03:38.840> see<00:03:39.019> right<00:03:39.199> now

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:39.229 
so that's that's what you see right now

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:45.819 
so that's that's what you see right now
with<00:03:39.620> the<00:03:39.769> evie<00:03:40.310> II<00:03:42.040> EVF<00:03:43.040> turned<00:03:43.609> on<00:03:44.680> this<00:03:45.680> is

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
with the evie II EVF turned on this is

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.409 
with the evie II EVF turned on this is
different<00:03:46.280> kind<00:03:46.430> of<00:03:46.489> information<00:03:46.669> you<00:03:47.269> can

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
different kind of information you can

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:51.789 
different kind of information you can
turn<00:03:47.599> this<00:03:47.750> off<00:03:47.989> or<00:03:48.319> on<00:03:49.060> okay<00:03:50.439> so<00:03:51.439> let's<00:03:51.590> do<00:03:51.680> the

00:03:51.789 --> 00:03:51.799 
turn this off or on okay so let's do the

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.180 
turn this off or on okay so let's do the
ball<00:03:51.979> again

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.610 

there<00:03:56.790> you<00:03:56.880> go<00:03:57.060> and<00:03:57.450> focus<00:03:57.870> now<00:03:58.740> when<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.070> turn

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
there you go and focus now when I turn

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.050 
there you go and focus now when I turn
micro<00:04:01.620> off<00:04:04.100> see<00:04:05.100> now<00:04:05.280> I<00:04:05.310> go<00:04:05.580> back<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:05.940> my

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
micro off see now I go back to my

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.200 
micro off see now I go back to my
regular<00:04:06.270> rangefinder<00:04:07.140> with<00:04:07.290> no<00:04:07.500> valet<00:04:08.210> let's

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
regular rangefinder with no valet let's

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:17.300 
regular rangefinder with no valet let's
try<00:04:09.480> to<00:04:09.540> focus<00:04:09.810> again<00:04:12.200> no<00:04:13.200> good<00:04:14.300> no<00:04:15.300> good<00:04:16.310> all

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
try to focus again no good no good all

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.370 
try to focus again no good no good all
right<00:04:17.580> so<00:04:17.910> basically<00:04:18.510> what<00:04:18.959> I'm<00:04:19.050> trying<00:04:19.080> to

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
right so basically what I'm trying to

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.010 
right so basically what I'm trying to
say<00:04:19.590> is<00:04:20.060> for<00:04:21.060> people<00:04:21.270> who<00:04:21.360> have<00:04:21.480> problems<00:04:21.510> with

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
say is for people who have problems with

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
say is for people who have problems with
focusing<00:04:22.800> up<00:04:22.980> close<00:04:23.280> use<00:04:24.120> macro<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:25.110> you

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
focusing up close use macro and you

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.400 
focusing up close use macro and you
shouldn't<00:04:26.310> have<00:04:26.460> any<00:04:26.610> problems<00:04:27.180> so<00:04:27.450> this<00:04:28.200> is

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
shouldn't have any problems so this is

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.070 
shouldn't have any problems so this is
the<00:04:28.620> overlay<00:04:29.310> right<00:04:29.730> with<00:04:29.970> a<00:04:30.000> rangefinder<00:04:30.660> now

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
the overlay right with a rangefinder now

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.830 
the overlay right with a rangefinder now
when<00:04:31.290> I<00:04:31.320> flip<00:04:31.830> the<00:04:31.950> switch<00:04:31.980> in<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.430> front<00:04:32.840> this

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
when I flip the switch in the front this

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.920 
when I flip the switch in the front this
changes<00:04:34.320> into<00:04:34.590> LCD<00:04:35.240> and<00:04:36.240> now<00:04:36.420> you'll<00:04:36.690> notice

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
changes into LCD and now you'll notice

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.750 
changes into LCD and now you'll notice
without<00:04:37.350> the<00:04:37.650> macro<00:04:38.130> when<00:04:38.340> I<00:04:38.430> focus<00:04:40.550> it's<00:04:41.550> not

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
without the macro when I focus it's not

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.180 
without the macro when I focus it's not
in<00:04:41.880> focus<00:04:42.060> you<00:04:42.300> see<00:04:44.870> now<00:04:45.870> it<00:04:46.350> clicked<00:04:46.650> now<00:04:47.010> it's

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
in focus you see now it clicked now it's

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.810 
in focus you see now it clicked now it's
in<00:04:47.310> focus<00:04:48.290> okay<00:04:49.290> so<00:04:49.890> basically<00:04:50.130> you<00:04:50.460> know<00:04:50.580> just

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
in focus okay so basically you know just

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.260 
in focus okay so basically you know just
if<00:04:50.940> you<00:04:51.270> get<00:04:51.390> up<00:04:51.540> close<00:04:52.490> use<00:04:53.490> micro<00:04:53.940> mode<00:04:54.120> and

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
if you get up close use micro mode and

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.990 
if you get up close use micro mode and
you're<00:04:54.360> gonna<00:04:54.450> have<00:04:54.630> really<00:04:54.900> nice<00:04:55.140> images<00:04:56.000> so

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
you're gonna have really nice images so

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.980 
you're gonna have really nice images so
that's<00:04:57.180> how<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.390> viewfinder<00:04:57.630> looks<00:04:58.140> like<00:04:58.670> and

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
that's how the viewfinder looks like and

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.010 
that's how the viewfinder looks like and
I'll<00:05:00.990> show<00:05:01.560> you<00:05:01.620> -<00:05:01.980> I<00:05:02.520> have<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.630> camera<00:05:03.810> is

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
I'll show you - I have the camera is

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.860 
I'll show you - I have the camera is
pointing<00:05:04.380> down<00:05:04.590> so<00:05:04.620> you<00:05:05.130> will<00:05:05.370> not<00:05:05.520> see<00:05:05.880> the

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
pointing down so you will not see the

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.920 
pointing down so you will not see the
electronic<00:05:07.470> leveling<00:05:07.980> but<00:05:08.280> when<00:05:08.460> you<00:05:08.930> when

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
electronic leveling but when you when

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:15.320 
electronic leveling but when you when
you<00:05:10.050> move<00:05:11.180> when<00:05:12.180> you<00:05:12.390> move<00:05:12.630> it<00:05:12.840> up<00:05:13.790> see<00:05:14.790> now<00:05:15.090> it

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
you move when you move it up see now it
