00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
the note edge is an eye catcher because

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.799 
the note edge is an eye catcher because
it<00:00:10.559> has<00:00:10.740> one<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.160> kind<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.820> display<00:00:12.389> which<00:00:12.660> is

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
it has one of a kind a display which is

one of a kind as you can see here on the
side<00:00:14.940> now<00:00:15.179> if<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.480> turn<00:00:15.719> both<00:00:15.990> off<00:00:16.230> which<00:00:16.560> is

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
side now if you turn both off which is

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.800 
side now if you turn both off which is
actually<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:17.220> little<00:00:17.670> bit<00:00:17.850> easier<00:00:18.060> for<00:00:18.270> them<00:00:18.570> on

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
actually a little bit easier for them on

button on the side which of course

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.250 
button on the side which of course
doesn't<00:00:22.859> have<00:00:23.100> space<00:00:23.340> on<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:24.119> note<00:00:24.600> edge<00:00:24.869> but

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
before we go on with the display we show

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.509 
before we go on with the display we show
you<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.990> little<00:00:28.140> bit<00:00:28.230> around<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.830> harbor<00:00:29.369> which

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
you a little bit around the harbor which

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.849 
you a little bit around the harbor which
is<00:00:29.699> essentially<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.630> same<00:00:30.840> from<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.410> outside

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
is essentially the same from the outside

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.100 
is essentially the same from the outside
but<00:00:32.070> there's<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.399> few<00:00:32.460> little<00:00:32.700> minor<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.750> tea

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
chest and differ on the both devices

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.780 
chest and differ on the both devices
like<00:00:37.559> for<00:00:37.710> example<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:38.129> we<00:00:38.280> don't<00:00:38.520> have<00:00:38.760> a

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
like for example that we don't have a

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.569 
like for example that we don't have a
metal<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.719> bottom<00:00:40.559> here<00:00:40.860> like<00:00:41.040> on<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.399> one

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
metal and bottom here like on this one

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.869 
metal and bottom here like on this one
or<00:00:41.730> edge<00:00:41.940> it's<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.140> little<00:00:43.350> bit<00:00:43.440> plastic<00:00:43.980> then

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
or edge it's a little bit plastic then

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.459 
or edge it's a little bit plastic then
inside<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.390> course<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.750> batteries<00:00:46.200> same

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
inside of course a batteries same

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.799 
inside of course a batteries same
cameras<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.190> same<00:00:47.670> sensors<00:00:48.329> here<00:00:48.510> for<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
cameras and same sensors here for the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.779 
cameras and same sensors here for the
heart<00:00:49.050> rate<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.440> otherwise<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.399> can<00:00:50.520> see<00:00:50.700> of

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
heart rate and otherwise you can see of

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.910 
heart rate and otherwise you can see of
course<00:00:51.000> both<00:00:51.360> have<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.870> stylus<00:00:52.289> or<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.559> S<00:00:52.710> Pen

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
course both have a stylus or the S Pen

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.250 
course both have a stylus or the S Pen
because<00:00:53.309> there<00:00:53.550> are<00:00:53.789> load<00:00:54.539> devices<00:00:56.960> of<00:00:57.960> course

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
because there are load devices of course

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.110 
because there are load devices of course
both<00:00:58.649> use<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.949> AMOLED<00:00:59.370> screen<00:00:59.640> which<00:00:59.940> is

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
both use the AMOLED screen which is

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.439 
both use the AMOLED screen which is
looking<00:01:00.690> quite<00:01:00.899> amazing<00:01:01.730> with<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.969> high

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
looking quite amazing with a high

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.560 
looking quite amazing with a high
resolution<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:05.030> qhd<00:01:06.030> n<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.299> see<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
resolution of qhd n you can see the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.969 
resolution of qhd n you can see the
speed<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.869> also<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.170> same<00:01:07.350> since<00:01:07.619> both<00:01:07.799> have

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
speed is also the same since both have

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.550 
speed is also the same since both have
the<00:01:08.100> same<00:01:08.130> Snapdragon<00:01:08.700> processor<00:01:09.479> inside<00:01:09.840> but

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
the same Snapdragon processor inside but

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
the same Snapdragon processor inside but
you<00:01:10.650> can<00:01:10.770> see<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.130> software<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.549> a

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
you can see that the software is a

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.510 
you can see that the software is a
little<00:01:11.760> bit<00:01:11.850> different<00:01:12.240> here<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.110> bottom

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
little bit different here on the bottom

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.010 
little bit different here on the bottom
there<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.549> no<00:01:14.880> space<00:01:15.570> for<00:01:16.130> their<00:01:18.020> programs

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
there is no space for their programs

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.450 
there is no space for their programs
that<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.350> would<00:01:19.439> use<00:01:19.650> every<00:01:19.979> day<00:01:20.009> which<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
that you would use every day which is a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.429 
that you would use every day which is a
little<00:01:20.670> bit<00:01:20.759> strange<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.509> what's<00:01:21.780> also<00:01:22.049> of

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
little bit strange but what's also of

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.090 
little bit strange but what's also of
course<00:01:22.650> quite<00:01:22.920> interesting<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:24.979> here<00:01:25.979> on

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
course quite interesting that here on

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.800 
course quite interesting that here on
the<00:01:26.189> camera<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:26.880> some<00:01:27.270> extra<00:01:27.390> buttons

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
install you can see that we have really

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.120 
install you can see that we have really
a<00:01:48.930> little<00:01:49.259> bit<00:01:49.380> less<00:01:49.590> space<00:01:49.860> here<00:01:50.100> for

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
a little bit less space here for

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.039 
a little bit less space here for
everyday<00:01:50.520> tasks<00:01:51.060> but<00:01:51.630> what's<00:01:51.869> quite

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
everyday tasks but what's quite

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.690 
everyday tasks but what's quite
interesting<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.560> right<00:01:52.740> if<00:01:52.979> for<00:01:53.159> example<00:01:53.220> I

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
interesting is right if for example I

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.300 
interesting is right if for example I
want<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.060> open<00:01:54.119> or<00:01:54.659> write<00:01:54.869> something<00:01:55.320> then<00:01:55.860> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
want to open or write something then the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.039 
want to open or write something then the
edge<00:01:56.430> gets<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.820> little<00:01:56.969> bit<00:01:57.119> smaller<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.659> on<00:01:58.020> a

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
edge gets a little bit smaller so on a

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.050 
edge gets a little bit smaller so on a
lot<00:01:58.290> of<00:01:58.409> apps<00:01:58.619> then<00:01:59.130> this<00:01:59.369> notification<00:01:59.670> bar

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
lot of apps then this notification bar

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.780 
lot of apps then this notification bar
is<00:02:00.530> getting<00:02:01.530> smaller<00:02:01.649> if<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.159> don't<00:02:02.460> interact

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790
