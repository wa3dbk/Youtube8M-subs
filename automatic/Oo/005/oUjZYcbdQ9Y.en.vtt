 good afternoon friends here I am 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.980
 finishing an installation in a bathroom 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.280
 with pipe plus tube 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.230
 pipeline 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.230
 one-inch feed 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:22.690
 for cold water and this pipe 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.890
 half inch of half an inch 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.050

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.009

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.009
 hot water 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:35.350
 and the one-inch cold water 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.629
 until here leave it one inch 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.960
 here where it feeds the skeleton of the 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.960
 watering can 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:50.460
 how can they see their shape the skeleton 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.460
 of the shower 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.420
 on the left I left the hot water 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.430

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.930

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.890

 where will I install the rate w 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.380
 and here I am taking the installation 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.380

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.159

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.010
 all right 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.080
 This bathroom is very dark, that's why I bring 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.080
