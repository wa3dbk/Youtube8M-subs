Adam<00:01:36.620> we<00:01:36.770> had<00:01:36.980> the<00:01:37.160> light<00:01:37.460> show<00:01:37.760> module<00:01:38.180> which

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
Adam we had the light show module which

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.650 
Adam we had the light show module which
is<00:01:38.630> an<00:01:38.930> additional<00:01:39.770> 200<00:01:40.160> points<00:01:40.820> this<00:01:41.210> ad<00:01:41.450> on

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
is an additional 200 points this ad on

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.260 
is an additional 200 points this ad on
this<00:01:42.200> adds<00:01:42.440> on<00:01:42.650> three<00:01:42.980> rotating<00:01:43.400> lasers<00:01:43.940> on<00:01:44.150> to

this adds on three rotating lasers on to

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.910 
this adds on three rotating lasers on to
the<00:01:44.360> Vulcan<00:01:44.720> which<00:01:44.870> and<00:01:45.050> getting<00:01:45.410> allows<00:01:45.680> you

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
the Vulcan which and getting allows you

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.710 
the Vulcan which and getting allows you
to<00:01:46.370> fire<00:01:46.610> it<00:01:46.790> more<00:01:46.970> faster<00:01:47.420> without

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
to fire it more faster without

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.780 
to fire it more faster without
overheating<00:01:48.500> which<00:01:48.950> sounds<00:01:49.190> pretty<00:01:49.370> cool<00:01:49.610> if

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
overheating which sounds pretty cool if

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.120 
overheating which sounds pretty cool if
I<00:01:49.880> do<00:01:50.000> say<00:01:50.240> so<00:01:50.270> myself<00:01:50.450> moving<00:01:51.380> on<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:51.890> the<00:01:51.920> last

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
I do say so myself moving on to the last

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.830 
I do say so myself moving on to the last
add-on<00:01:52.670> for<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.060> score<00:01:53.330> sure<00:01:53.450> we<00:01:53.600> had<00:01:53.810> the

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
add-on for the score sure we had the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.380 
add-on for the score sure we had the
extra<00:01:54.350> burst<00:01:54.530> much<00:01:54.800> which<00:01:55.070> is<00:01:55.310> an<00:01:55.520> additional

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
extra burst much which is an additional

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.690 
extra burst much which is an additional
300<00:01:56.660> points<00:01:57.170> this<00:01:57.890> module<00:01:58.130> gives<00:01:58.280> you<00:01:58.580> an

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
300 points this module gives you an

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.400 
300 points this module gives you an
extra<00:01:58.880> beam<00:01:59.180> burst<00:01:59.450> which<00:01:59.690> could<00:01:59.990> pick<00:02:00.230> you<00:02:00.380> up

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
extra beam burst which could pick you up

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.160 
extra beam burst which could pick you up
a<00:02:00.590> few<00:02:00.740> more<00:02:00.920> kills<00:02:01.190> so<00:02:01.670> I'm<00:02:01.760> guessing<00:02:01.970> that

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
a few more kills so I'm guessing that

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.330 
a few more kills so I'm guessing that
going<00:02:03.170> off<00:02:03.290> this<00:02:03.410> out<00:02:03.590> on<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.800> excess<00:02:04.190> more

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
going off this out on the excess more

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.610 
going off this out on the excess more
volcom<00:02:04.760> will<00:02:04.910> have<00:02:05.030> around<00:02:05.480> about<00:02:05.780> four<00:02:06.410> to

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
volcom will have around about four to

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.520 
volcom will have around about four to
six<00:02:06.650> bursts<00:02:07.130> of<00:02:07.340> energy<00:02:07.520> that<00:02:07.970> lasts<00:02:08.330> between

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
six bursts of energy that lasts between

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.369 
six bursts of energy that lasts between
six<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:09.830> ten<00:02:10.369> seconds<00:02:10.879> which<00:02:11.060> is<00:02:11.870> pretty<00:02:12.140> cool

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
six to ten seconds which is pretty cool

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.290 
six to ten seconds which is pretty cool
if<00:02:12.560> I<00:02:12.650> do<00:02:12.769> say<00:02:12.980> so<00:02:13.010> myself<00:02:13.220> well<00:02:13.970> that<00:02:14.060> is<00:02:14.150> it

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
if I do say so myself well that is it

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.640 
if I do say so myself well that is it
