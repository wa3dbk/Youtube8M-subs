00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
actually take the pockets and if I am

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.420 
actually take the pockets and if I am
willing<00:01:06.880> to<00:01:07.030> sew<00:01:07.510> in<00:01:08.080> down<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.770> pocket<00:01:09.190> then

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
willing to sew in down the pocket then

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.700 
willing to sew in down the pocket then
it<00:01:09.550> doesn't<00:01:09.850> look<00:01:09.880> as<00:01:10.330> puffy<00:01:10.930> and<00:01:11.110> it'll<00:01:11.620> be

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
it doesn't look as puffy and it'll be

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.930 
it doesn't look as puffy and it'll be
okay<00:01:11.950> for<00:01:12.010> me<00:01:12.220> but<00:01:12.400> I<00:01:12.460> haven't<00:01:12.610> decided

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
whether I want to sew down the pockets

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.900

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.670 
it on with the dress I'm like this is no
look<00:04:44.760> right<00:04:45.030> so<00:04:45.300> I<00:04:45.539> just<00:04:45.720> tried<00:04:46.020> on<00:04:46.050> with<00:04:46.500> like

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
look right so I just tried on with like

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.529 
look right so I just tried on with like
one<00:04:46.800> of<00:04:46.889> my<00:04:46.949> regular<00:04:47.370> belts<00:04:47.729> and<00:04:48.000> I<00:04:48.240> find<00:04:48.479> that

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
one of my regular belts and I find that

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.420 
one of my regular belts and I find that
it<00:04:48.750> was<00:04:48.840> a<00:04:48.870> lot<00:04:48.990> better<00:04:49.110> it<00:04:49.710> is<00:04:49.949> a<00:04:49.979> little<00:04:50.280> bit

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
it was a lot better it is a little bit

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.710 
it was a lot better it is a little bit
shapeless<00:04:50.910> though<00:04:51.090> because<00:04:51.270> it's<00:04:51.510> kind<00:04:51.690> of

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
shapeless though because it's kind of

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.480 
shapeless though because it's kind of
like<00:04:51.780> a<00:04:51.900> just<00:04:52.380> a<00:04:52.470> flat<00:04:52.800> line<00:04:53.099> like<00:04:53.310> this

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
like a just a flat line like this

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.210 
like a just a flat line like this
against<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.060> side<00:04:54.270> so<00:04:54.750> you<00:04:55.320> definitely<00:04:55.560> need

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
against the side so you definitely need

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.790 
against the side so you definitely need
a<00:04:56.250> belt<00:04:56.729> to<00:04:57.660> kind<00:04:57.870> of<00:04:57.930> shape<00:04:58.380> it<00:04:58.560> together

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
a belt to kind of shape it together

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.469 
a belt to kind of shape it together
because<00:04:59.130> it's<00:04:59.310> a<00:04:59.430> little<00:04:59.610> bit<00:04:59.760> shapeless<00:05:00.300> in

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
because it's a little bit shapeless in

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:01.850 
because it's a little bit shapeless in
it's<00:05:00.570> a<00:05:00.599> little<00:05:00.840> bit<00:05:00.930> loose<00:05:01.260> here<00:05:01.530> so

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
it's a little bit loose here so

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:03.469 
it's a little bit loose here so
definitely<00:05:02.400> need<00:05:02.760> a<00:05:02.789> belt<00:05:03.000> like<00:05:03.090> that<00:05:03.150> but

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
definitely need a belt like that but

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:17.530 
definitely need a belt like that but
overall<00:05:03.810> is<00:05:04.050> really<00:05:04.289> really

00:06:58.180 --> 00:06:58.190 
like it'd just be every second one so

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.440 
like it'd just be every second one so
then<00:06:58.340> you<00:06:58.430> can<00:06:58.520> actually<00:06:58.670> see<00:06:59.060> your<00:06:59.210> feet

00:06:59.440 --> 00:06:59.450 
then you can actually see your feet

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:00.970 
then you can actually see your feet
because<00:06:59.960> I<00:07:00.170> think<00:07:00.230> it<00:07:00.440> looks<00:07:00.590> kind<00:07:00.740> of<00:07:00.800> weird

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:00.980 
because I think it looks kind of weird

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.980 
because I think it looks kind of weird
when<00:07:01.130> you<00:07:01.250> it's<00:07:01.550> all<00:07:01.670> black<00:07:02.000> here<00:07:02.300> and<00:07:02.570> then

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:02.990 
when you it's all black here and then

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:04.300 
when you it's all black here and then
you<00:07:03.080> can<00:07:03.200> see<00:07:03.350> your<00:07:03.410> toes<00:07:03.560> peeking<00:07:03.980> out

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:04.310 
you can see your toes peeking out

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:06.190 
you can see your toes peeking out
but<00:07:04.670> generally<00:07:05.210> I<00:07:05.240> do<00:07:05.390> like<00:07:05.630> the<00:07:05.750> shoes<00:07:05.930> like<00:07:06.110> I

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:06.200 
but generally I do like the shoes like I

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.250 
but generally I do like the shoes like I
will<00:07:06.380> be<00:07:06.500> wearing<00:07:06.710> them<00:07:07.600> but<00:07:08.600> it<00:07:08.780> is<00:07:08.930> a<00:07:08.960> little

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:09.260 
will be wearing them but it is a little

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:10.930 
will be wearing them but it is a little
bit<00:07:09.470> loose<00:07:09.710> back<00:07:09.920> here<00:07:10.220> as<00:07:10.310> well<00:07:10.520> when<00:07:10.670> I<00:07:10.730> zip

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
bit loose back here as well when I zip

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.540 
bit loose back here as well when I zip
it<00:07:11.060> up<00:07:11.150> and<00:07:11.690> when<00:07:11.900> I<00:07:11.930> walk<00:07:12.260> I<00:07:12.530> can<00:07:12.710> feel<00:07:13.010> my<00:07:13.160> heel

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:13.550 
it up and when I walk I can feel my heel

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:15.730 
it up and when I walk I can feel my heel
like<00:07:14.450> there's<00:07:14.630> just<00:07:14.780> so<00:07:14.900> much<00:07:15.050> room<00:07:15.410> right

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:15.740 
like there's just so much room right

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:16.990 
like there's just so much room right
here<00:07:16.010> so<00:07:16.130> I<00:07:16.160> can<00:07:16.310> feel<00:07:16.460> make<00:07:16.610> you're<00:07:16.760> lifting

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:17.000 
here so I can feel make you're lifting

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.060 
here so I can feel make you're lifting
up<00:07:17.270> of<00:07:17.390> it<00:07:17.540> but<00:07:17.900> it's<00:07:18.050> not<00:07:18.170> that<00:07:18.350> I<00:07:18.530> can't<00:07:18.860> walk

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:19.070 
up of it but it's not that I can't walk

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:21.880 
up of it but it's not that I can't walk
in<00:07:19.250> them<00:07:19.510> because<00:07:20.510> it's<00:07:21.080> a<00:07:21.200> claw<00:07:21.470> like<00:07:21.500> it's

00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:21.890 
in them because it's a claw like it's

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:23.380 
in them because it's a claw like it's
close<00:07:22.160> up<00:07:22.370> here<00:07:22.520> so<00:07:22.670> it's<00:07:22.790> easy<00:07:22.940> to<00:07:23.030> walk<00:07:23.240> in

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:23.390 
close up here so it's easy to walk in

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:24.550 
close up here so it's easy to walk in
there<00:07:23.480> but<00:07:23.510> you<00:07:23.690> can<00:07:23.810> just<00:07:23.900> kind<00:07:24.080> of<00:07:24.110> feel<00:07:24.380> your

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 
there but you can just kind of feel your

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:26.500 
there but you can just kind of feel your
heel<00:07:24.770> lifting<00:07:25.130> up<00:07:25.250> a<00:07:25.340> little<00:07:25.520> bit<00:07:25.700> and<00:07:26.390> even

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:26.510 
heel lifting up a little bit and even

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:27.790 
heel lifting up a little bit and even
when<00:07:26.750> I<00:07:26.780> changed<00:07:27.200> the<00:07:27.260> buckle<00:07:27.620> to<00:07:27.770> the

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:27.800 
when I changed the buckle to the

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:30.620 
when I changed the buckle to the
tightest<00:07:28.220> I<00:07:28.340> still<00:07:28.820> did<00:07:29.000> that<00:07:29.030> so<00:07:29.870> you<00:07:30.230> know
