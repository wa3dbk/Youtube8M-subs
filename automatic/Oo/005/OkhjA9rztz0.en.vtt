How to install drivers to enable flashing of N900 in Windows 7 64-bit

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.100
Open a browser and go to wiki.maemo.org

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.100
Click on the article, "Updating the tablet firmware".

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.400
Click on "Issues with 64-bit Windows and Workarounds".

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.400
We will use "Option 5" to make this work.

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:35.933
Click on the link.

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:41.133
You're supposed to see this post.

00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:47.933
Download the files we will need, by clicking on the link provided in the post...

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:53.133
...and then download the Zip file.

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:05.899
Save it to your computer and uncompress/unzip it.

00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:22.666
It's a good idea to open Device Manager so that you can see/monitor if what you're doing is sucessful or not.

00:01:26.266 --> 00:01:33.332
I connected my N900 (while it is turned on). On your N900 you will see a prompt to select Mass Storage or PC Suite. I did not select anything yet.

00:01:34.766 --> 00:01:38.766
I let MS Windows install the default drivers. Then I monitor through Device Manager and the pop-up notification.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:02:02.533
Once you hear the "familiar" sound, you will notice that Device Manager will show new devices (marked with Exclamation Point).

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.600
Once done, unplug the N900, re-connect and select PC Suite to insall needed drivers as well. Once done, you can unplug it.

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:28.066
Note: We have not turned off the N900, from the beginning of the tutorial, up to this point.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:03:00.633
Do the same step (re-connect it) and this time select Mass Storage to install needed drivers too. Once done, you can unplug it.

00:03:04.533 --> 00:03:12.033
Reminder: when unplugging the N900 from Mass Storage, always select "Safely Remove Device".

00:03:29.366 --> 00:03:51.066
Sorry, just double-checking. :) Checking both Mass Storage and PC Suite Modes...once you are sure, unplug and turn off the N900.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:04.633
Next, press and hold the "U" key, then plug the N900, to install the needed drivers (Update Mode).

00:04:07.666 --> 00:04:15.166
Default drivers are now installed. Time to start with the "special" drivers. :)

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:59.966
Go to where you saved the "special" drivers. Simply follow the instructions from the post in talk.maemo.org.

00:05:01.566 --> 00:05:07.066
In this step, save the .inf files to where you can remember. DO NOT save in system32 folder.

00:05:46.933 --> 00:05:56.899
You're done. :) Double-check with Device Manager as per the instructions on the post.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.900
You can now flash the N900 as usual.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.366
NOTE: When installing the Flasher Application you need to specify for it to be installed in C:/Program Files, not C:/Program Files (x86) anymore.

00:06:12.933 --> 00:06:16.933
