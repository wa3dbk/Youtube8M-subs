Josh<00:01:10.150> playing<00:01:10.510> the<00:01:10.720> two<00:01:10.979> are<00:01:11.979> those<00:01:12.220> are<00:01:12.760> those

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:12.910 
Josh playing the two are those are those

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.760

and<00:01:15.060> Josh<00:01:16.060> well<00:01:16.570> I<00:01:16.630> think<00:01:16.720> makes<00:01:17.380> this<00:01:17.530> big<00:01:17.830> so

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
and Josh well I think makes this big so

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.230 
and Josh well I think makes this big so
with<00:01:18.820> the<00:01:19.270> additions<00:01:19.690> of<00:01:19.840> matrix<00:01:20.740> area<00:01:21.640> that

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
with the additions of matrix area that

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.410 
with the additions of matrix area that
helps<00:01:22.570> us<00:01:22.750> you<00:01:23.140> can<00:01:23.290> play<00:01:23.470> Josh<00:01:24.070> at<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.430> two<00:01:24.640> or

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
helps us you can play Josh at the two or

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.020 
helps us you can play Josh at the two or
even<00:01:25.450> play<00:01:25.840> Shawn<00:01:26.140> at<00:01:26.350> the<00:01:26.470> two<00:01:26.710> so<00:01:27.250> with<00:01:27.850> that
