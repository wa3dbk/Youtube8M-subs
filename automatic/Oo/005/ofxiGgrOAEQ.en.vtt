00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:04.880
 start with fireworks because from today that may be officially sold again 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.960
 We can expect this year to hold around â‚¬ 65 million in fireworks 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.519
 in the air 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.719
 our reporter vlado lemic is at the fia werkhouding rijswijk 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:15.399
 grow up tomorrow 

00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:19.249
 there are to forty employees who have finished i have heard but i 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.249
 just sit there and look I don't see much 

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:27.699
 and see you look behind then they are there waiting because from 7 years is allowed 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:28.280
 the fireworks 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.749
 be officially sold 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:33.590
 and I even saw someone go and have a look and that is Porsche 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.700
 Harlequin from the first customers who will actually come here 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.870
 and they have stored quite a few fireworks here 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.480
 a thousand kilos 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.479
 And they expect it to be over the next three days 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:45.480
 the final result 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.830
 people that come here to buy fireworks 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.640
 so that's quite a bit 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.760
 And then you would think that people might wear a small bag of fireworks 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:53.960
 walk out over 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.340
 that is not the case 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.329
 in advance with that there are very many people who simply do not have the maximum number 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.120
 fireworks things that they can take with them indeed no longer leave no 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:07.030
 and that is 10 pounds 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.560
 good morning and what's going to be popular this year 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.110
 yes i will show it to you as popular this year is the decorative fireworks and 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.360
 especially this one 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.650
 in koksijde 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.250
 those are a kind of fireworks pots where all kinds of things from canada have 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.530
 the two beautiful names such as the m for the city lights 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.580
 his own house 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.680
 I had my bed tell a son fireworks 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.140
 gives 30 seconds of fireworks and you pay around 25 euros for that 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.370
 to be that the true enthusiasts 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.370
 and what is already popular this year chooses its 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.080
 So at least you protect the eyes from it and it is plenty especially popular 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.179
 among children because it seems that you can no longer be seen 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:53.229
 without this fireworks glasses competition finally someone else 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.520
 you had stabbed 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.420
 no I haven't lit anything yet and if all goes well no one can do that yet 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.150
 because Friday morning from ten o'clock 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.040
 but all this firework was ireland and everything that people were on were adjusted 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.529
 before and they may do so until two in the morning on Saturday morning 

00:02:11.529 --> 00:02:15.499
 alkema thank you for a year later so that today all that goes 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:16.269
 in it the right back
