 is in charge of making even an ornament 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.849
 Soup does not know Christmas is the ball is

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.350
 had grid in the natal area 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.990
 if you want to know how to make a 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.900
 christmas bowling ball 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.119
 come on you will need these 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.820
 red marbles that we use 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:35.300
 prefect of christmas acrylic paint 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:38.430
 white a brush ribbon crepe ruler the map 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.160
 can be tinetti or scissors for you in 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.160
 cut the paper later, it's okay 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.050
 you will use a stylus has given us 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:52.020
 this cutting board underneath paper 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.969
 black contact and platform for you 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.550
 To play ball for you, but I have 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.399
 one of the real and one of 10 cents and this 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:06.119
 here is a white sticker paper from 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:10.460
 pimaco and the ball 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.460
 you will see that half of the ball that 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.570
 I'm going to do it as fast as you can. 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.610
 see when you get to the end of the ball 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.869
 you leave and mouse on top and will 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.000
 stay like this 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.780
 This is the part that we are going to paint 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.450
 White 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:37.829
 good so now we will start 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:39.450
 assemble the underside of the ball 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.020
 role of preventing the emergence of 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.880
 You 're using it, it's just you. 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:50.640
 begin to paint it will be to see that neither 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:56.399
 the painting also does not have this 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:59.009
 strike will not get painted after three 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:04.229
 layers of white paint will look like this 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:06.030
 inside the aqmi is only you will stay every 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.069
 Since the second layer were 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:13.470
 accept that advises leaving her 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:18.330
 charge is in the dry it's just you now 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.849
 so come on, I came in carefully to 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.599
 that does not bark ink time that you 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:27.560
 pulling it will stay like this already got the 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:31.200
 ball actually 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.450
 now we need to run a strip 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.530
 black paper here with late 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.910
 so you can not get the ruler and media 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.180
 more or less too that you want 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:46.260
 either stick with pencil 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.370
 now in my case I'm going to take advantage of the 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.370
 lines to report 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.520
 the proposal is cut to tape 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.330
 we will lose the little ball our 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:07.210
 ball and will stick here in the middle between 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.020
 the two things we did to that 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.150
 Tevez time as the thickness of right 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.650
 depends on the size of the ball. 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.410
 what are you doing 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.750
 You can be like this, Denilson, just to 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.060
 see how it will look 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:26.640
 come Ana will stay this way 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.640
 everything was ready, it 's just you necklace 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.010
 everything is stuck 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.680
 now it seems like one more goal because 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:53.070
 the ball in fact just for those two 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.840
 center polka dots 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.690
 now we will have a piece of paper with 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.470
 black part new story the coin of a 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.270
 real 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.270
 and let's combine one side 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:21.010
 ready there is a hatred of our ball 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:23.590
 now it 's just cut the ball finished 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.600
 defeated stay like this 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:30.180
 We are going to take our 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.180
 little ball going to roll here 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:39.520
 after gluing it will stay like this now we will 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.150
 take that sheet of 500 to say with 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:46.030
 This quietly white farmhouse from here. 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.920
 We're going to report a little bit where the 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.610
 We will do this lower ball of the 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.600
 ball 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.220
 the little ball 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.220
 we will use the currency of 10 cents 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.700
 quoted to stay like this 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:12.760
 and then it's only you then paste ball and this 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:17.970
 It's a very beautiful result, people are 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:26.580
 little but like you and me neither 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:30.070
 I had my life christmas rn okay 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:35.820
 can through black contact paper 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.820
 was a walk that little girl xv 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:43.810
 it is also the idea here that it is logical that 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:48.640
 You're in a more yellow ball. 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:51.390

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.390

 time that the only one does not have much time
