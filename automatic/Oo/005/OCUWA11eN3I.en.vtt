00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
coarse than the sensitive brush and I

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.500 
coarse than the sensitive brush and I
actually<00:00:52.320> prefer<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.250> however<00:00:53.640> if<00:00:54.270> you're

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
actually prefer this however if you're

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.330 
actually prefer this however if you're
just<00:00:54.870> starting<00:00:55.140> off<00:00:55.350> with<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.680> Clarisonic

just starting off with the Clarisonic
it's<00:00:57.090> best<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.719> be<00:00:57.809> really<00:00:58.199> gentle<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.859> not

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
it's best to be really gentle and not

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.060 
it's best to be really gentle and not
apply<00:01:00.030> too<00:01:00.090> much<00:01:00.270> pressure<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:01.260> looks<00:01:01.890> like

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
apply too much pressure it looks like

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.280
