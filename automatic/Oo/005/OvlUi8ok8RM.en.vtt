00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.200
 with friends as they are I hope you are super 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.920
 well I am a lesson and here we are 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.430
 recording a game of bounce bogotÃ¡ a 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.430
 see how 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.340
 as I call it 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.529
 oh my god what a way is so stressful 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.030
 of the individual to shut up once and for all 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.030
 everyone who has a voice without her 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.860
 now so let's play bounces 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.449
 bounce to see how it goes we already know that 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.190
 I have a certain liking with the 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:46.920
 tomahawk and cuchi and others a little 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.320
 bloodthirsty and a little bit nothing but 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.930
 Well this I already tested it and I 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.440
 loved I loved several things the 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.500
 First of all, the knives and the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.940
 he shoots a lot faster than in black 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.979
 ops or in black ops or it does not take 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.409
 very low will be why I did not like 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:07.440
 the ballistic knife and almost never the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.200
 had in fact the rare ones that 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.970
 will use more than when I used francs or 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.700
 A) Yes 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.700
 but not the truth is that it was a 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.400
 the truth is that it was something very silly and 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.540
 Now, super fast, take out the 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.650
 knife 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.670
 incredible I loved it 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.670
 Well, yes, no way 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.530
 and good 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.180
 they saw that would take the individual that is 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.300
 he said ai wei what but with her I say 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.550
 how suddenly there I get a 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:55.980
 what other rudeness are you going to have 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:02:00.860
 What made him really false 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.860
 well the thing is close 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.130
 ok to another thing that surpasses my charm 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.640
 fascinated and the net wow 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.640
 yes 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.450
 what 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.500
 that already picks up the tomahawk 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.500
 alone 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.180
 that's what they should do should not 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.500
 be so aware of just a pretty 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.420
 remember to always be aware of the 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.180
 map and so on because even though you 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.940
 you're super super concentrated just with 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:42.580
 a person nothing else damn I thought that 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.070
 had humiliated me around you have 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.100
 so many more then that's why 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.610
 I then despite not having killed my 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.610
 White 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.950
 although I bring the whole better 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.980
 perfect 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:09.730
 and I put him as emotions moves 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:09.730
 from side to side very realistic and I'm going 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.490
 how mean 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.850
 the truth is out there this Sunday 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.360
 Miguel is given 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.360
 dices 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.820
 he has not wanted to humiliate a good many times 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:32.550
 that guy I do not know if it's the same but 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:35.330
 have a certain desire to humiliate me but 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.330
 you are not going to do 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:45.720
 ok second back and how silly I thought that 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.720
 yes it was with the tomahawk 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.120
 but I'm nervous 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:03.150
 no tomatoes or potatoes 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.150
 no good 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.780
 well, we fought it, we fought 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.780
 there our our dead sound 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.660
 damned 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.639
 although there is perfect perfect 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.180
 and beggar there we go there we go what 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.490
 What happened is that they humiliated me right now 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.090
 but well little by little there is that 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.639
 view 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.610
 Sarita is also a girl gamer, so if 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:41.240
 they do not know her, I recommend their channel 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.130
 a pretty pretty girl ay darn 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.949
 how is it that I tell them I can not 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.360
 talk and tell things about everything in 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:50.599
 this type of modality that you need 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.949
 have the reflections to one hundred I can not the 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:53.949
 It's true that if I have a hard time 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.449
 and then know 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.569
 I bless 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:05.150

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:09.800
 I think he needs a humiliated time 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:11.990
 reality pull and they saw the reflections of 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:15.880
 guy or he just turned around and I 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:18.610
 shot with his thing without flirting without something 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.810
 Pigs are a tes you then 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.810

 It 's what you do in the other 

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:46.929
 taste
