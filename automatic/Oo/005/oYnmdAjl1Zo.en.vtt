pond ecology forestry rare breeds

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.830 
pond ecology forestry rare breeds
because<00:00:35.399> we<00:00:35.610> do<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:35.910> several<00:00:36.239> rare<00:00:36.570> breeds

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
because we do have several rare breeds

because we do have several rare breeds
at<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.440> farm<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.040> there's<00:00:38.219> lots<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.550> things

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
at the farm so there's lots of things

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.610 
at the farm so there's lots of things
for<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.149> children<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.600> do<00:00:39.750> based<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
for the children to do based on the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.350 
for the children to do based on the
needs<00:00:40.829> of<00:00:41.010> their<00:00:41.190> classroom<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:41.910> what<00:00:42.210> their

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
needs of their classroom and what their

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.000 
needs of their classroom and what their
teachers<00:00:42.750> would<00:00:42.870> like<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.079> get<00:00:43.200> out<00:00:43.410> of<00:00:43.649> this

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
teachers would like to get out of this

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.440 
teachers would like to get out of this
day<00:00:45.649> we<00:00:46.649> live<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.370> society<00:00:47.520> where<00:00:48.030> children

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
day we live in a society where children

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.540 
day we live in a society where children
are<00:00:48.539> increasingly<00:00:49.110> divorced<00:00:49.829> from<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.340> kind

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
are increasingly divorced from this kind

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.299 
are increasingly divorced from this kind
of<00:00:50.700> experience<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.739> farm<00:00:52.980> experience

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
of experience and so the farm experience

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.910 
of experience and so the farm experience
is<00:00:53.640> particularly<00:00:54.449> important<00:00:55.079> because<00:00:55.170> they

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
is particularly important because they

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.590 
is particularly important because they
need<00:00:56.100> to<00:00:56.129> understand<00:00:56.730> this<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.180> know<00:00:57.300> this<00:00:57.449> is

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
need to understand this you know this is

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.529 
need to understand this you know this is
all<00:00:57.719> about<00:00:57.750> sustainability<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:59.300> we<00:01:00.300> talked<00:01:00.510> a

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
all about sustainability and we talked a

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.209 
all about sustainability and we talked a
lot<00:01:00.719> about<00:01:00.870> ecology<00:01:01.260> in<00:01:01.649> our<00:01:01.800> own<00:01:01.920> little

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
lot about ecology in our own little

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.830 
lot about ecology in our own little
worlds<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:02.730> they<00:01:03.210> can<00:01:03.359> actually<00:01:03.629> come<00:01:03.809> out

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
worlds but they can actually come out

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.359 
worlds but they can actually come out
here<00:01:04.140> and<00:01:04.260> see<00:01:04.470> what<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.710> really<00:01:04.860> means<00:01:05.129> I

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
here and see what it really means I

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.050 
here and see what it really means I
think<00:01:05.580> that's<00:01:05.729> essential<00:01:07.549> the<00:01:08.549> students<00:01:08.939> walk

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
think that's essential the students walk

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.480 
think that's essential the students walk
away<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.930> real<00:01:10.320> connection<00:01:11.130> with<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
away with a real connection with the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.399 
away with a real connection with the
animals<00:01:11.909> they<00:01:12.180> just<00:01:12.390> had<00:01:12.600> no<00:01:12.630> idea<00:01:13.049> what<00:01:13.380> it

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
animals they just had no idea what it

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.120 
animals they just had no idea what it
took<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:14.100> be<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> farmer<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:14.939> work<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> farm<00:01:15.659> I

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
took to be a farmer and work on a farm I

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.440 
took to be a farmer and work on a farm I
like<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.310> because<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.670> don't<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.000> do<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
like it because you don't just do the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.670 
like it because you don't just do the
fun<00:01:18.780> stuff<00:01:18.810> like<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.229> petting<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
fun stuff like the petting and the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.410 
fun stuff like the petting and the
feeding<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.189> actually<00:01:20.490> have<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.729> get<00:01:20.880> down

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
feeding you actually have to get down

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.200 
feeding you actually have to get down
and<00:01:21.600> dirty<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.990> clean<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.860> stalls<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.790> take

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
and dirty and clean the stalls and take

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.789 
and dirty and clean the stalls and take
care<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.540> all<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> animals<00:01:24.869> so<00:01:25.259> it's<00:01:25.380> not<00:01:25.530> just

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
care of all the animals so it's not just

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.770 
care of all the animals so it's not just
it's<00:01:26.310> not<00:01:26.369> what<00:01:26.520> I<00:01:26.580> expected<00:01:27.119> initially<00:01:27.630> but

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
it's not what I expected initially but

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.560 
it's not what I expected initially but
it's<00:01:27.900> really<00:01:28.049> fun

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.930 

what<00:01:32.200> I<00:01:32.230> think<00:01:32.710> is<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:33.010> best<00:01:33.190> thing<00:01:33.370> about<00:01:33.520> the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
what I think is the best thing about the

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.450 
what I think is the best thing about the
farm<00:01:34.210> school<00:01:34.600> is<00:01:34.930> actually<00:01:35.740> seeing<00:01:36.070> the

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
farm school is actually seeing the

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.210 
farm school is actually seeing the
children<00:01:36.700> get<00:01:37.120> a<00:01:37.150> hands-on<00:01:37.750> approach<00:01:37.960> to<00:01:38.590> what

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
children get a hands-on approach to what

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.400 
children get a hands-on approach to what
we<00:01:39.370> do<00:01:39.550> to<00:01:39.820> learning<00:01:40.300> where<00:01:40.630> the<00:01:40.990> milk<00:01:41.290> comes

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
we do to learning where the milk comes

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.460 
we do to learning where the milk comes
from<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.610> whole<00:01:42.850> process<00:01:43.150> of<00:01:43.630> splitting<00:01:44.290> wood

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
from the whole process of splitting wood

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.719 
from the whole process of splitting wood
to<00:01:44.860> stacking<00:01:45.520> it<00:01:45.729> at<00:01:45.910> the<00:01:46.000> composting<00:01:47.040> how<00:01:48.040> we

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
to stacking it at the composting how we

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.530 
to stacking it at the composting how we
use<00:01:49.240> and<00:01:49.750> recycle<00:01:50.470> foods<00:01:50.830> grout<00:01:51.280> adding<00:01:51.880> some

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
use and recycle foods grout adding some

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:53.940 
use and recycle foods grout adding some
of<00:01:52.660> your<00:01:52.840> banana<00:01:53.170> peels

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
of your banana peels

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.670 
of your banana peels
I<00:01:54.119> explain<00:01:55.119> and<00:01:55.360> show<00:01:55.600> them<00:01:55.869> that<00:01:56.259> what<00:01:56.650> they

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
I explain and show them that what they

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.950 
I explain and show them that what they
don't<00:01:57.040> eat<00:01:57.369> on<00:01:57.550> their<00:01:57.729> table<00:01:58.210> goes<00:01:58.479> into

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.440 
don't eat on their table goes into
certain<00:01:59.430> composting<00:02:00.430> buckets<00:02:00.880> I<00:02:01.030> show<00:02:01.270> them

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
certain composting buckets I show them

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:03.150 
certain composting buckets I show them
the<00:02:01.540> whole<00:02:01.720> procedure<00:02:02.110> it's<00:02:02.530> used<00:02:02.830> in<00:02:03.009> our

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
the whole procedure it's used in our

are put on their plate and it they can

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.859 
are put on their plate and it they can
see<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:08.890> whole<00:02:09.039> cycle<00:02:09.459> I've<00:02:10.450> always<00:02:10.720> known

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
see the whole cycle I've always known

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.750 
see the whole cycle I've always known
that<00:02:10.899> you<00:02:11.170> know<00:02:11.290> food<00:02:11.560> doesn't<00:02:11.770> just<00:02:12.040> appear

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
that you know food doesn't just appear

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.000 
that you know food doesn't just appear
out<00:02:13.030> of<00:02:13.060> thin<00:02:13.180> air<00:02:13.390> but<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:14.110> know<00:02:14.350> like<00:02:14.739> being

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
out of thin air but you know like being

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.440 
out of thin air but you know like being
on<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.250> farm<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.550> realizing<00:02:16.060> some<00:02:16.270> of<00:02:16.360> the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
on the farm and realizing some of the

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.390 
on the farm and realizing some of the
turkey<00:02:16.900> that<00:02:17.260> we've<00:02:17.440> been<00:02:17.560> eating<00:02:17.680> or<00:02:17.950> chicken

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
turkey that we've been eating or chicken

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.970 
turkey that we've been eating or chicken
or<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.940> bread<00:02:19.360> that<00:02:19.540> we<00:02:19.750> made<00:02:19.989> that<00:02:20.200> actually

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
or the bread that we made that actually

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.190 
or the bread that we made that actually
comes<00:02:21.400> from<00:02:21.580> here<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.090> do<00:02:22.300> think<00:02:22.780> about<00:02:22.989> food

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
comes from here I do think about food

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.720 
comes from here I do think about food
differently<00:02:23.530> now<00:02:23.680> because<00:02:24.010> I'm<00:02:24.310> not<00:02:24.459> just

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
differently now because I'm not just

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.150 
differently now because I'm not just
thinking<00:02:24.790> about<00:02:25.150> it<00:02:25.420> showing<00:02:25.810> up<00:02:26.080> that's<00:02:26.410> how

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
thinking about it showing up that's how

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.400 
thinking about it showing up that's how
it<00:02:27.370> was<00:02:27.489> raised<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:28.209> what<00:02:28.720> pesticides<00:02:29.230> were

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
it was raised and what pesticides were

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.740 
it was raised and what pesticides were
used<00:02:29.650> or<00:02:29.890> things<00:02:30.280> that<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.790> animals<00:02:31.540> eat

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
used or things that the animals eat

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.020 
used or things that the animals eat
affects<00:02:32.170> what<00:02:32.590> we<00:02:32.620> so<00:02:33.220> I<00:02:33.400> definitely<00:02:33.610> think<00:02:33.910> of

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
affects what we so I definitely think of

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.440 
affects what we so I definitely think of
food<00:02:34.209> differently<00:02:34.630> now<00:02:38.940> we<00:02:39.940> did<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:40.150> fantastic

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
food differently now we did a fantastic

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.990 
food differently now we did a fantastic
mushroom<00:02:41.410> walk<00:02:41.650> today<00:02:42.160> out<00:02:42.580> through<00:02:42.910> the

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
mushroom walk today out through the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.729 
mushroom walk today out through the
woods<00:02:43.150> where<00:02:43.390> they<00:02:43.510> collected<00:02:43.930> all<00:02:44.110> kinds<00:02:44.680> of

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
woods where they collected all kinds of

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.009 
woods where they collected all kinds of
mushrooms<00:02:44.950> and<00:02:45.489> we<00:02:46.090> did<00:02:46.269> have<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.450> specialist

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
mushrooms and we did have a specialist

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.240 
mushrooms and we did have a specialist
that<00:02:47.079> was<00:02:47.350> with<00:02:47.500> us<00:02:47.650> that<00:02:47.680> was<00:02:47.890> able<00:02:48.160> to

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
that was with us that was able to

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.300 
that was with us that was able to
explain<00:02:48.579> that<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.180> walk<00:02:49.570> them<00:02:49.810> through<00:02:49.840> it

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
explain that and walk them through it

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.400 
explain that and walk them through it
there's<00:02:51.310> deadly<00:02:51.790> mushrooms<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.959> there's

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
there's deadly mushrooms and there's

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.319 
there's deadly mushrooms and there's
regular<00:02:53.920> mushrooms<00:02:54.430> and<00:02:54.610> that<00:02:54.700> all<00:02:54.910> mushrooms

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
regular mushrooms and that all mushrooms

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.900 
regular mushrooms and that all mushrooms
aren't<00:02:55.510> those<00:02:55.720> like<00:02:55.980> little<00:02:56.980> brown<00:02:57.340> things<00:02:57.700> we

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
aren't those like little brown things we

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.220 
aren't those like little brown things we
all<00:02:58.060> think<00:02:58.390> that<00:02:58.450> they<00:02:58.690> are<00:02:58.840> there<00:02:59.019> can<00:02:59.200> be

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 
all think that they are there can be

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.960 
all think that they are there can be
huge<00:02:59.560> runs<00:02:59.920> there<00:03:00.100> can<00:03:00.220> be<00:03:00.250> small<00:03:00.579> ones<00:03:00.790> they

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
huge runs there can be small ones they

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.729 
huge runs there can be small ones they
don't<00:03:01.090> even<00:03:01.390> they<00:03:01.840> might<00:03:02.019> not<00:03:02.140> even<00:03:02.200> have<00:03:02.560> the

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
don't even they might not even have the

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.350 
don't even they might not even have the
stems<00:03:03.040> they<00:03:03.220> could<00:03:03.370> just<00:03:03.519> be<00:03:03.640> attached<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.180> a

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
stems they could just be attached to a

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.220 
stems they could just be attached to a
tree

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
tree

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.680 
tree
I<00:03:05.319> learned<00:03:06.190> that<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.700> takes<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:06.970> lot<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.480> raise

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
I learned that it takes a lot to raise

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.720 
I learned that it takes a lot to raise
these<00:03:08.050> animals<00:03:08.500> and<00:03:08.739> it's<00:03:09.190> not<00:03:09.370> just<00:03:09.489> feeding

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
these animals and it's not just feeding

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.830 
these animals and it's not just feeding
them<00:03:09.909> but<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.060> have<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.299> take<00:03:10.420> care<00:03:10.629> of<00:03:10.659> where

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
them but you have to take care of where

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.360 
them but you have to take care of where
they<00:03:10.959> live<00:03:11.290> and<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:11.739> have<00:03:11.799> to<00:03:11.980> constantly

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
they live and you have to constantly

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.089 
they live and you have to constantly
monitor<00:03:12.580> they<00:03:13.450> have<00:03:13.569> enough<00:03:13.780> food<00:03:13.989> and<00:03:14.290> so<00:03:14.860> it

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
monitor they have enough food and so it

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:16.710 
monitor they have enough food and so it
takes<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.430> lot<00:03:15.610> of<00:03:15.640> work<00:03:15.940> and<00:03:16.330> I<00:03:16.390> didn't<00:03:16.629> expect

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
takes a lot of work and I didn't expect

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.979 
takes a lot of work and I didn't expect
that<00:03:17.230> initially<00:03:17.709> coming<00:03:18.040> in<00:03:18.220> I<00:03:18.629> think<00:03:19.629> many<00:03:19.870> of

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:19.989 
that initially coming in I think many of

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:21.509 
that initially coming in I think many of
the<00:03:20.170> tasks<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:20.620> they're<00:03:20.769> doing<00:03:21.069> are<00:03:21.310> things

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
the tasks that they're doing are things

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:22.979 
the tasks that they're doing are things
that<00:03:21.700> they<00:03:21.819> wouldn't<00:03:22.000> get<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.360> opportunity

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
that they wouldn't get the opportunity

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.140 
that they wouldn't get the opportunity
to<00:03:23.019> do<00:03:23.290> otherwise<00:03:23.620> I'm<00:03:24.160> excited<00:03:24.760> to<00:03:24.849> see<00:03:25.030> how

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
to do otherwise I'm excited to see how

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.880 
to do otherwise I'm excited to see how
they<00:03:25.299> embrace<00:03:25.629> them<00:03:25.900> I<00:03:26.170> mean<00:03:26.650> they<00:03:26.769> are<00:03:26.860> going

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
they embrace them I mean they are going

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.059 
they embrace them I mean they are going
after<00:03:27.370> every<00:03:27.970> single<00:03:28.390> opportunity<00:03:29.140> to<00:03:29.920> learn

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
after every single opportunity to learn

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.670 
after every single opportunity to learn
and<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.819> be<00:03:31.090> a<00:03:31.239> part<00:03:31.599> of<00:03:31.810> what<00:03:32.079> the<00:03:32.200> farmers<00:03:32.530> are

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
and to be a part of what the farmers are

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.289 
and to be a part of what the farmers are
asking<00:03:32.980> them<00:03:33.099> to<00:03:33.160> do<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:33.519> I<00:03:33.579> think<00:03:34.180> that

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
asking them to do and I think that

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:35.460 
asking them to do and I think that
