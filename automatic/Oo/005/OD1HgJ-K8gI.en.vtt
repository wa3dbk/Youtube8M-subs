it says hello master that is because my
reed<00:01:52.350> switch<00:01:52.619> turn<00:01:53.430> positive<00:01:54.649> let's<00:01:55.649> try<00:01:56.280> it

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
reed switch turn positive let's try it

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.880 
reed switch turn positive let's try it
again

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.360 

now<00:02:02.890> it<00:02:02.950> says<00:02:04.260> determining<00:02:05.260> current<00:02:05.890> position

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
now it says determining current position

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.220 
now it says determining current position
of<00:02:06.970> I<00:02:07.240> seconds<00:02:08.399> once<00:02:09.399> it<00:02:09.550> reaches<00:02:09.910> 60<00:02:10.780> seconds

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
of I seconds once it reaches 60 seconds

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.940 
of I seconds once it reaches 60 seconds
and<00:02:11.410> it<00:02:12.250> still<00:02:12.640> hasn't<00:02:12.790> gotten<00:02:13.120> that<00:02:13.420> lock<00:02:13.950> it

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
and it still hasn't gotten that lock it

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.660 
and it still hasn't gotten that lock it
turns<00:02:15.190> off<00:02:15.459> and<00:02:16.740> yeah<00:02:17.740> you<00:02:17.980> can<00:02:18.070> try<00:02:18.370> it<00:02:18.430> again

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.850 

the<00:02:21.670> voltage<00:02:22.300> regulator<00:02:22.750> gets<00:02:23.170> pretty<00:02:23.560> hot

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
the voltage regulator gets pretty hot

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.229 
the voltage regulator gets pretty hot
yeah<00:02:24.550> that's<00:02:25.030> what's<00:02:25.270> the<00:02:25.560> cooling<00:02:27.090> rack<00:02:28.090> is

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
yeah that's what's the cooling rack is

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.970 
yeah that's what's the cooling rack is
for<00:02:28.920> servo<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:30.220> in<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.550> off<00:02:30.760> position<00:02:31.980> so

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
for servo is in the off position so

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.580 
for servo is in the off position so
closed<00:02:33.430> I<00:02:34.830> mean<00:02:35.830> closed<00:02:36.340> yeah<00:02:37.050> or<00:02:38.050> what<00:02:38.260> else

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
closed I mean closed yeah or what else

show you guys safety mechanism this is a
reach<00:03:29.980> which<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:31.410> I've<00:03:32.410> gotten<00:03:32.769> a<00:03:32.860> bunch<00:03:33.040> of

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
reach which and I've gotten a bunch of

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:39.030 
reach which and I've gotten a bunch of
magnets<00:03:33.730> here<00:03:36.180> drivin<00:03:37.180> off<00:03:37.360> yeah<00:03:38.170> they're

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
magnets here drivin off yeah they're

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.870 
magnets here drivin off yeah they're
pretty<00:03:39.190> strong<00:03:43.590> very<00:03:44.590> easy<00:03:44.860> to<00:03:45.130> do<00:03:45.280> by<00:03:45.489> video

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
pretty strong very easy to do by video

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.809 
pretty strong very easy to do by video
but<00:03:47.160> I've<00:03:48.160> gotten<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:49.000> magnet<00:03:49.599> on<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:50.819> I'll

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
but I've gotten the magnet on and I'll

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:57.509 
but I've gotten the magnet on and I'll
push<00:03:52.120> the<00:03:52.329> button<00:03:52.629> again<00:03:55.860> no<00:03:56.860> did<00:03:57.160> not<00:03:57.190> work

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
push the button again no did not work

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:00.150 
push the button again no did not work
the<00:03:57.849> magnet<00:03:58.569> is<00:03:58.599> not<00:03:58.870> in<00:03:59.019> a<00:03:59.140> good<00:03:59.920> position

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
the magnet is not in a good position

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.410 
the magnet is not in a good position
I'll<00:04:00.910> reset<00:04:01.540> Arduino<00:04:03.150> turning<00:04:04.150> the<00:04:04.239> power

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
I'll reset Arduino turning the power

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
I'll reset Arduino turning the power
below<00:04:04.900> that<00:04:05.500> way<00:04:05.680> turning<00:04:06.040> off<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.310> geocache

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
below that way turning off the geocache

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:14.970 
below that way turning off the geocache
maybe<00:04:08.440> it<00:04:08.590> works<00:04:08.829> this<00:04:09.130> way<00:04:11.220> turn<00:04:12.220> it<00:04:12.370> on<00:04:13.980> hello

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
maybe it works this way turn it on hello

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.289 
maybe it works this way turn it on hello
master<00:04:15.220> that's<00:04:16.060> it<00:04:16.329> and<00:04:17.070> that<00:04:18.070> servo<00:04:18.970> is<00:04:19.150> in

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
master that's it and that servo is in

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.330 
master that's it and that servo is in
the<00:04:19.419> open<00:04:19.750> position<00:04:19.780> so<00:04:20.650> the<00:04:20.889> Box<00:04:21.070> can<00:04:21.310> be

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
the open position so the Box can be

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:28.110 
the open position so the Box can be
accessed<00:04:21.810> and<00:04:22.810> open<00:04:24.300> turns<00:04:25.300> off<00:04:25.510> and<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:27.880> surf

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
accessed and open turns off and the surf

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.969 
accessed and open turns off and the surf
of<00:04:28.300> state<00:04:28.539> open<00:04:29.460> now<00:04:30.460> if<00:04:30.639> I<00:04:30.820> couldn't<00:04:31.300> move

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
of state open now if I couldn't move

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:38.640 
of state open now if I couldn't move
like<00:04:32.979> that<00:04:35.250> we're<00:04:36.250> gonna<00:04:36.430> hear<00:04:36.760> I<00:04:37.470> push<00:04:38.470> the

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
like that we're gonna hear I push the

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.200 
like that we're gonna hear I push the
switch<00:04:38.830> again<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.729> servo<00:04:40.330> should<00:04:40.620> go<00:04:41.620> into

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
switch again the servo should go into

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:47.180 
switch again the servo should go into
closed<00:04:43.210> and<00:04:44.370> it<00:04:45.370> should<00:04:45.610> continuous<00:04:46.270> cycle

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
closed and it should continuous cycle

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.330 
closed and it should continuous cycle
yeah<00:04:48.900> all<00:04:49.900> you<00:04:50.260> won't<00:04:50.500> get<00:04:50.680> a<00:04:50.710> lock<00:04:50.979> out<00:04:51.160> here

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
yeah all you won't get a lock out here

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.210 
yeah all you won't get a lock out here
so<00:04:51.580> I<00:04:51.610> cannot<00:04:52.000> show<00:04:52.300> the<00:04:52.630> number<00:04:53.560> of<00:04:53.830> drives

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
so I cannot show the number of drives

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.600 
so I cannot show the number of drives
with<00:04:54.580> got<00:04:54.789> a<00:04:54.820> lap<00:04:55.030> but<00:04:55.840> I<00:04:56.220> think<00:04:57.220> we've<00:04:57.370> gotten

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
with got a lap but I think we've gotten

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.290 
with got a lap but I think we've gotten
ten<00:04:58.030> tries<00:04:58.270> left<00:04:58.479> I<00:04:59.099> don't<00:05:00.099> know<00:05:00.220> sure<00:05:00.610> maybe

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
ten tries left I don't know sure maybe

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.640 
ten tries left I don't know sure maybe
nine<00:05:01.660> and<00:05:02.910> every<00:05:03.910> time<00:05:04.120> it<00:05:04.750> gets<00:05:05.020> a<00:05:05.169> position

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
nine and every time it gets a position

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.850 
nine and every time it gets a position
and<00:05:05.919> it<00:05:06.039> shows<00:05:06.250> the<00:05:06.430> distance<00:05:06.820> to<00:05:07.000> start<00:05:07.360> it

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 
and it shows the distance to start it

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.510 
and it shows the distance to start it
not<00:05:08.860> one<00:05:09.130> try<00:05:09.669> is<00:05:09.930> remove<00:05:10.930> from<00:05:11.289> list<00:05:11.320> list<00:05:12.190> or

not one try is remove from list list or

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.119 
not one try is remove from list list or

gotten one try less

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:18.510 
gotten one try less
you<00:05:15.489> once<00:05:16.330> you've<00:05:16.539> gotten<00:05:16.869> zero<00:05:17.110> tries<00:05:17.520> said

you once you've gotten zero tries said
in<00:05:18.729> the<00:05:18.819> beginning<00:05:18.939> that<00:05:19.479> you've<00:05:20.080> gotten<00:05:20.349> zero

in the beginning that you've gotten zero

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:22.199 
in the beginning that you've gotten zero
tries<00:05:20.919> it<00:05:21.309> should<00:05:21.550> return<00:05:21.879> through<00:05:22.179> the

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:22.209 
tries it should return through the
