00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
I suppose that's where the real

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
engineering heft of those cars gets

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.550 
engineering heft of those cars gets
revealed<00:04:31.850> yeah<00:04:32.270> it<00:04:32.510> amazes<00:04:33.020> me<00:04:33.050> as<00:04:33.260> well<00:04:33.410> and

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
revealed yeah it amazes me as well and

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.440 
revealed yeah it amazes me as well and
you<00:04:33.620> know<00:04:33.680> what<00:04:33.770> that<00:04:34.040> KN<00:04:34.340> was<00:04:34.700> two<00:04:34.940> seconds<00:04:35.390> a

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
you know what that KN was two seconds a

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.410 
you know what that KN was two seconds a
lap<00:04:35.480> quicker<00:04:35.990> than<00:04:36.650> a<00:04:36.770> Vauxhall<00:04:37.190> vxr8<00:04:37.430> it's
