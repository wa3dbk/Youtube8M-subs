would<00:00:46.500> really<00:00:47.010> just<00:00:47.579> only<00:00:48.120> make<00:00:48.300> up<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.570> limit

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
would really just only make up a limit

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.510 
would really just only make up a limit
the<00:00:48.930> whole<00:00:49.050> crop<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.500> wet<00:00:49.829> start<00:00:50.370> all<00:00:50.489> over

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the whole crop and wet start all over

the whole crop and wet start all over
again<00:00:50.760> working<00:00:51.539> with<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.960> New<00:00:52.079> South<00:00:52.289> Wales

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
again working with the New South Wales

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.470 
again working with the New South Wales
Department<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:53.219> Primary<00:00:53.520> Industries<00:00:53.670> and

Department of Primary Industries and
independent<00:00:55.260> auditors<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:56.070> system<00:00:56.820> was

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
independent auditors a system was

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.660 
independent auditors a system was
devised<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.629> capture<00:00:58.109> filter<00:00:58.829> treat<00:00:59.430> and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
devised to capture filter treat and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
devised to capture filter treat and
reuse<00:01:00.420> runoff<00:01:00.930> most<00:01:01.920> importantly<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:03.180> removes

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
reuse runoff most importantly it removes

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.380 
reuse runoff most importantly it removes
pathogens<00:01:04.530> which<00:01:04.920> could<00:01:05.159> harm<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.580> crop<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
pathogens which could harm the crop the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.870 
pathogens which could harm the crop the
systems<00:01:06.750> definitely<00:01:07.560> are<00:01:07.880> achieving

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
systems definitely are achieving

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.429 
systems definitely are achieving
objectives<00:01:09.000> it's<00:01:09.990> definitely<00:01:10.290> worth<00:01:10.409> looking

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
objectives it's definitely worth looking

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.460 
objectives it's definitely worth looking
for<00:01:10.770> us<00:01:10.950> very<00:01:11.159> well<00:01:11.930> it's<00:01:12.930> probably<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.320> best

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
for us very well it's probably the best

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.710 
for us very well it's probably the best
thing<00:01:13.680> we've<00:01:13.799> done<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.640> farm<00:01:14.880> since<00:01:15.600> we

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
thing we've done on the farm since we

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.719 
thing we've done on the farm since we
started<00:01:15.930> what<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.259> smart<00:01:16.530> farms<00:01:17.130> made<00:01:17.610> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
started what is smart farms made the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.330 
started what is smart farms made the
recycling<00:01:18.360> system<00:01:18.630> a<00:01:19.020> reality<00:01:19.740> yeah<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
recycling system a reality yeah the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.260 
recycling system a reality yeah the
water<00:01:20.490> smart<00:01:20.700> farm<00:01:20.850> project<00:01:21.150> actually

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
water smart farm project actually

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.899 
water smart farm project actually
enabled<00:01:22.170> us<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.290> take<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> initiative<00:01:23.700> and

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
enabled us to take the initiative and

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.080 
enabled us to take the initiative and
make<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.900> recycling<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.909> runoff

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
make this recycling of the runoff

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.690 
make this recycling of the runoff
actually<00:01:27.780> happen<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.229> demonstration<00:01:28.979> farm<00:01:29.400> for

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
actually happen a demonstration farm for

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.120 
actually happen a demonstration farm for
the<00:01:29.790> water<00:01:29.970> smart<00:01:30.270> farms<00:01:30.720> project<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.740> system

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the water smart farms project the system

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.770 
the water smart farms project the system
is<00:01:32.250> drawing<00:01:32.549> interest<00:01:32.790> from<00:01:32.970> other<00:01:33.270> farmers

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
is drawing interest from other farmers

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.440 
is drawing interest from other farmers
who<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.470> see<00:01:34.680> for<00:01:34.860> themselves<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.909> benefits

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
who can see for themselves the benefits

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.990 
who can see for themselves the benefits
of<00:01:36.689> an<00:01:36.810> efficient<00:01:37.259> recycling<00:01:37.920> system<00:01:38.400> Hawk

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.240 
of an efficient recycling system Hawk
Lam<00:01:39.329> says<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:39.960> important<00:01:40.500> for<00:01:40.710> farmers<00:01:40.890> to

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
Lam says it's important for farmers to

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.609 
Lam says it's important for farmers to
first<00:01:41.520> evaluate<00:01:42.270> what<00:01:42.840> they<00:01:43.020> need<00:01:43.320> their

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
first evaluate what they need their

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
system to deliver the DPR actually

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.149 
system to deliver the DPR actually
worked<00:01:47.549> with<00:01:47.610> us<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.360> give<00:01:48.689> us<00:01:48.869> a<00:01:49.159> directive

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
worked with us to give us a directive

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.510 
worked with us to give us a directive
focus<00:01:50.549> on<00:01:50.759> where<00:01:51.299> we<00:01:51.479> should<00:01:51.659> be<00:01:51.750> heading<00:01:52.020> and

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
focus on where we should be heading and

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.749 
focus on where we should be heading and
what<00:01:53.520> aims<00:01:53.759> what<00:01:54.420> aims<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:55.350> should<00:01:55.560> be

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
what aims what aims we should be

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:57.830 
what aims what aims we should be
achieving<00:01:56.759> we<00:01:57.149> were<00:01:57.270> able<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.479> work<00:01:57.689> together

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
achieving we were able to work together

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.170 
achieving we were able to work together
to<00:01:58.049> find<00:01:58.409> exactly<00:01:59.100> what<00:01:59.549> we<00:01:59.670> needed<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.939> do

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
to find exactly what we needed to do

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.450 
to find exactly what we needed to do
building<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.140> success<00:02:01.590> of<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> recycling

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
building on the success of the recycling

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.609 
building on the success of the recycling
system<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.299> plan<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.780> look<00:02:03.990> at<00:02:04.170> new<00:02:04.380> ways

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
system the plan is to look at new ways

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.859 
system the plan is to look at new ways
of<00:02:05.009> harvesting<00:02:05.250> water<00:02:05.790> yeah<00:02:06.570> we're<00:02:06.780> always

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
of harvesting water yeah we're always

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.210 
of harvesting water yeah we're always
looking<00:02:07.020> for<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> while<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.740> know<00:02:07.770> new

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
looking for a while you know new

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.479 
looking for a while you know new
improved<00:02:08.670> methods<00:02:08.970> of<00:02:09.090> harvesting<00:02:09.209> water

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
improved methods of harvesting water
