00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
want to you can cut these pieces here

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.230 
want to you can cut these pieces here
just<00:01:51.979> to<00:01:52.039> allow<00:01:52.220> even<00:01:52.399> more<00:01:52.549> air<00:01:52.819> flow<00:01:53.030> but

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
just to allow even more air flow but

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.029 
just to allow even more air flow but
sometimes<00:01:53.840> it's<00:01:54.020> good<00:01:54.200> that<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.740> air<00:01:54.860> flow

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
sometimes it's good that the air flow

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.740 
sometimes it's good that the air flow
isn't<00:01:55.310> doesn't<00:01:55.880> all<00:01:56.000> come<00:01:56.149> at<00:01:56.270> once

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
isn't doesn't all come at once

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.719 
isn't doesn't all come at once
it's<00:01:57.410> a<00:01:57.500> little<00:01:57.679> bit<00:01:57.800> more<00:01:57.920> gradual<00:01:58.429> that<00:01:58.580> way

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
it's a little bit more gradual that way

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.279 
it's a little bit more gradual that way
it<00:01:58.940> pushes<00:01:59.239> the<00:01:59.390> dart<00:01:59.569> all<00:01:59.690> the<00:01:59.810> way<00:01:59.929> as<00:02:00.140> it

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
it pushes the dart all the way as it

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:01.869 
it pushes the dart all the way as it
comes<00:02:00.410> out<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.560> barrel<00:02:00.920> those<00:02:01.340> is<00:02:01.550> relation

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:01.879 
comes out the barrel those is relation

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:03.820 
comes out the barrel those is relation
or<00:02:01.940> barrel<00:02:02.179> so<00:02:02.509> after<00:02:02.750> that<00:02:02.899> all<00:02:03.319> you<00:02:03.649> need<00:02:03.770> to

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
or barrel so after that all you need to

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.290 
or barrel so after that all you need to
do<00:02:03.920> is<00:02:04.039> you'll<00:02:04.399> notice<00:02:04.580> this<00:02:04.789> is<00:02:04.940> that<00:02:05.149> the

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
do is you'll notice this is that the

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.690 
do is you'll notice this is that the
front<00:02:05.509> piece<00:02:05.660> and<00:02:05.899> you<00:02:06.349> do<00:02:06.679> need<00:02:06.950> this<00:02:07.220> I<00:02:07.429> do

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
front piece and you do need this I do

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.979 
front piece and you do need this I do
believe<00:02:08.090> because<00:02:08.270> if<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:08.569> put<00:02:08.720> this<00:02:08.840> on

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
believe because if you put this on

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.749 
believe because if you put this on
without<00:02:09.170> it<00:02:09.319> you<00:02:09.979> don't<00:02:10.129> have<00:02:10.250> a<00:02:10.280> seal<00:02:10.580> there

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
without it you don't have a seal there

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.479 
without it you don't have a seal there
anymore<00:02:10.940> so<00:02:11.270> putting<00:02:11.750> this<00:02:11.930> on<00:02:12.140> is<00:02:12.489> important

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
anymore so putting this on is important

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.600 
anymore so putting this on is important
just<00:02:13.819> because<00:02:13.879> you<00:02:14.390> keep<00:02:14.540> your<00:02:14.720> seal<00:02:14.989> there<00:02:15.610> so

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
just because you keep your seal there so

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.010 
just because you keep your seal there so
all<00:02:17.060> you<00:02:17.180> have<00:02:17.270> to<00:02:17.330> do<00:02:17.390> is<00:02:17.450> snap<00:02:17.569> it<00:02:17.720> back<00:02:17.810> on

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
all you have to do is snap it back on

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:21.280 
all you have to do is snap it back on
and<00:02:18.290> it's<00:02:19.099> done<00:02:19.430> you<00:02:19.940> have<00:02:20.150> good<00:02:20.569> air<00:02:20.720> flow<00:02:20.750> and

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
and it's done you have good air flow and

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.990 
and it's done you have good air flow and
there's<00:02:21.560> they<00:02:21.800> don't<00:02:22.010> have<00:02:22.280> any<00:02:22.459> holes<00:02:22.760> in<00:02:22.879> it

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
there's they don't have any holes in it

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.869 
there's they don't have any holes in it
so<00:02:23.780> that's<00:02:24.739> pretty<00:02:24.860> much<00:02:25.160> all<00:02:25.340> you<00:02:25.370> need<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.700> do

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
so that's pretty much all you need to do

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.699 
so that's pretty much all you need to do
put<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:26.569> back<00:02:26.690> together<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:27.110> slide<00:02:27.560> it

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
put it back together you slide it

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:29.979 
put it back together you slide it
together<00:02:28.010> just<00:02:28.250> like<00:02:28.310> this<00:02:28.690> you'll<00:02:29.690> notice

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
together just like this you'll notice

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.490 
together just like this you'll notice
these<00:02:30.110> holes<00:02:30.410> line<00:02:30.709> up<00:02:30.739> just<00:02:31.069> perfectly<00:02:32.500> it's

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
these holes line up just perfectly it's

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.839 
these holes line up just perfectly it's
very<00:02:33.800> very<00:02:34.040> cool<00:02:34.250> what<00:02:34.400> they<00:02:34.489> do<00:02:34.550> with<00:02:34.730> this

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
very very cool what they do with this

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.199 
very very cool what they do with this
gun<00:02:35.030> how<00:02:35.180> easy<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.569> is<00:02:35.660> to<00:02:35.870> modify<00:02:36.140> it<00:02:36.319> and<00:02:37.209> just

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
gun how easy it is to modify it and just

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.770 
gun how easy it is to modify it and just
the<00:02:38.450> simplicity<00:02:38.720> of<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.950> gun<00:02:40.069> altogether<00:02:40.489> so

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
the simplicity of the gun altogether so

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.869 
the simplicity of the gun altogether so
there's<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.989> catch<00:02:42.200> here<00:02:42.590> for<00:02:43.129> the<00:02:43.550> plunger

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:43.879 
there's the catch here for the plunger

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.190 
there's the catch here for the plunger
and<00:02:43.910> that's<00:02:44.239> kind<00:02:44.540> of<00:02:44.569> important<00:02:44.989> so<00:02:45.170> I

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
and that's kind of important so I

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.500 
and that's kind of important so I
wouldn't<00:02:45.470> remove<00:02:45.769> that<00:02:46.060> you<00:02:47.060> can<00:02:47.180> put<00:02:47.360> the

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
wouldn't remove that you can put the

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.369 
wouldn't remove that you can put the
plunger<00:02:47.870> or<00:02:48.440> this<00:02:48.890> back<00:02:49.129> in<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:50.450> you<00:02:51.200> don't

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
plunger or this back in and you don't

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:52.839 
plunger or this back in and you don't
need<00:02:51.530> to<00:02:51.590> lubricate<00:02:51.769> it<00:02:52.159> though<00:02:52.340> if<00:02:52.489> you<00:02:52.640> want

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
need to lubricate it though if you want

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.979 
need to lubricate it though if you want
to<00:02:53.030> you<00:02:53.659> can<00:02:53.989> so<00:02:55.239> you'll<00:02:56.239> notice<00:02:56.420> that<00:02:56.540> I'm

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
to you can so you'll notice that I'm

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.260 
to you can so you'll notice that I'm
putting<00:02:57.470> it<00:02:57.650> upwards<00:02:58.069> like<00:02:58.370> this

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
putting it upwards like this

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.310 
putting it upwards like this
and<00:02:59.390> that's<00:02:59.930> simply<00:03:00.410> because<00:03:01.810> this<00:03:02.810> needs<00:03:03.140> to

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
and that's simply because this needs to

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.620 
and that's simply because this needs to
make<00:03:03.770> contact<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:04.820> so<00:03:05.090> when<00:03:05.240> you<00:03:05.300> pull<00:03:05.510> the

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
make contact that so when you pull the

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.090 
make contact that so when you pull the
slide<00:03:05.840> back<00:03:05.870> is<00:03:06.260> actually<00:03:06.440> pulling<00:03:06.740> this<00:03:06.890> back

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
slide back is actually pulling this back

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.370 
slide back is actually pulling this back
the<00:03:08.000> spring<00:03:08.210> needs<00:03:08.480> to<00:03:08.600> stay<00:03:08.780> on<00:03:08.810> this<00:03:09.110> catch

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
the spring needs to stay on this catch

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.430 
the spring needs to stay on this catch
here<00:03:09.410> this<00:03:09.890> built-in<00:03:10.340> catch<00:03:10.580> so<00:03:11.480> do<00:03:12.050> not<00:03:12.230> move

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
here this built-in catch so do not move

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.410 
here this built-in catch so do not move
it<00:03:12.620> from<00:03:12.800> this<00:03:12.950> piece<00:03:13.190> right<00:03:13.400> here<00:03:13.460> the<00:03:14.180> Spree

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
it from this piece right here the Spree

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.870 
it from this piece right here the Spree
needs<00:03:14.600> to<00:03:14.660> stay<00:03:14.780> behind<00:03:14.960> there<00:03:15.490> all<00:03:16.490> right<00:03:16.670> so

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
needs to stay behind there all right so

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.100 
needs to stay behind there all right so
now<00:03:16.970> you've<00:03:17.090> just<00:03:17.180> got<00:03:17.360> to<00:03:17.390> put<00:03:17.570> the<00:03:17.600> slide<00:03:17.930> on

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
now you've just got to put the slide on

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.770 
now you've just got to put the slide on
just<00:03:18.650> go<00:03:18.770> on<00:03:18.860> really<00:03:19.070> easily<00:03:19.510> there's<00:03:20.510> a<00:03:20.570> few

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
just go on really easily there's a few

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.900 
just go on really easily there's a few
things<00:03:20.990> that<00:03:21.080> might<00:03:21.610> give<00:03:22.610> you<00:03:22.700> little

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
things that might give you little

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:28.450 
things that might give you little
problems<00:03:24.100> but<00:03:25.690> should<00:03:26.690> go<00:03:26.870> on<00:03:27.080> just<00:03:27.740> fine<00:03:27.980> it's

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
problems but should go on just fine it's

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.920 
problems but should go on just fine it's
a<00:03:28.490> lot<00:03:28.610> easier<00:03:28.910> than<00:03:29.030> some<00:03:29.240> other<00:03:29.390> mods<00:03:29.660> you

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
a lot easier than some other mods you

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.650
