some<00:01:09.450> plaster<00:01:10.100> um<00:01:11.100> some<00:01:11.939> rope<00:01:12.770> different

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
some plaster um some rope different

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.330 
some plaster um some rope different
sizes<00:01:14.219> depending<00:01:14.369> on<00:01:14.789> how<00:01:15.020> wide<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.859> gap<00:01:17.069> is

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.429 
sizes depending on how wide the gap is
here<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:18.390> cap<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.899> going<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.109> be<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.229> little

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
here this cap is going to be a little

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.359 
here this cap is going to be a little
wider<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.009> I'll<00:01:20.130> probably<00:01:20.369> use<00:01:20.840> a<00:01:22.130> bigger<00:01:23.130> role

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
wider so I'll probably use a bigger role

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.770 
wider so I'll probably use a bigger role
but<00:01:23.700> we'll<00:01:23.880> see<00:01:24.530> some<00:01:25.530> plaster<00:01:26.039> too<00:01:26.280> smooth

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
but we'll see some plaster too smooth

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.279 
but we'll see some plaster too smooth
smooth<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.929> out

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:28.289 
smooth it out

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
half-inch plywood and some guys like

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.109 
half-inch plywood and some guys like
mounting<00:01:50.039> them<00:01:50.159> down<00:01:50.369> you'll<00:01:50.700> have<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:51.090> use

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
mounting them down you'll have to use

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.019 
mounting them down you'll have to use
shims<00:01:52.039> I<00:01:53.039> like<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.729> up<00:01:53.880> more<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:55.429> if<00:01:56.429> we<00:01:56.819> just

00:01:57.019 --> 00:01:57.029 
shims I like it up more so if we just

00:01:57.029 --> 00:02:00.679 
shims I like it up more so if we just
want<00:01:57.209> to<00:01:57.299> get<00:01:57.359> it<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.749> center<00:01:57.959> and<00:01:59.539> you<00:02:00.539> can

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
want to get it in the center and you can

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.059 
want to get it in the center and you can
just<00:02:00.869> mark<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:02.209> and<00:02:03.409> that's<00:02:04.409> basically<00:02:04.590> how

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
just mark it and that's basically how

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.309 
just mark it and that's basically how
it's<00:02:05.249> going<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.459> sit<00:02:05.639> now<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.179> you<00:02:06.389> have

to secure your
turns<00:02:17.799> to<00:02:18.010> the<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:20.010> half-inch<00:02:21.010> plywood<00:02:21.189> here

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
turns to the the half-inch plywood here

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.349 
turns to the the half-inch plywood here
so<00:02:22.060> just<00:02:22.780> top<00:02:22.989> three<00:02:23.319> holes<00:02:23.560> in<00:02:23.739> there

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
so just top three holes in there

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.880 
so just top three holes in there
just<00:02:25.359> so<00:02:25.510> it's<00:02:25.659> secure<00:02:26.049> you'll<00:02:26.349> have<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.650> find

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
just so it's secure you'll have to find

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.729 
just so it's secure you'll have to find
a<00:02:27.069> screw<00:02:27.549> length<00:02:27.819> that<00:02:28.060> fits<00:02:28.590> obviously<00:02:29.590> these

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
a screw length that fits obviously these

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.580 
a screw length that fits obviously these
two<00:02:29.799> will<00:02:30.040> be<00:02:30.159> longer<00:02:30.400> you<00:02:31.090> might<00:02:31.299> have<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.719> cut

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
two will be longer you might have to cut

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.379 
two will be longer you might have to cut
them<00:02:32.769> off<00:02:32.920> on<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.219> back<00:02:33.400> they<00:02:33.730> stick<00:02:34.000> out<00:02:34.180> if

third this is just sawdust just makes it
more<00:05:03.889> easy<00:05:03.949> to<00:05:04.870> work<00:05:05.870> with<00:05:07.810> that's<00:05:08.810> probably

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
more easy to work with that's probably

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:27.460 
more easy to work with that's probably
good<00:05:10.210> just<00:05:11.210> add<00:05:11.509> water<00:05:23.650> okay<00:05:24.650> so<00:05:26.110> now<00:05:27.110> that<00:05:27.259> you

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
good just add water okay so now that you

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.969 
good just add water okay so now that you
have<00:05:27.610> you<00:05:28.610> don't<00:05:28.729> want<00:05:28.940> it<00:05:29.060> soupy<00:05:29.830> this<00:05:30.830> is

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
have you don't want it soupy this is

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:34.540 
have you don't want it soupy this is
pretty<00:05:31.219> good<00:05:32.500> if<00:05:33.500> you<00:05:33.560> make<00:05:34.009> it<00:05:34.159> too<00:05:34.310> runny

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
pretty good if you make it too runny

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.350 
pretty good if you make it too runny
just<00:05:34.849> add<00:05:35.030> more<00:05:35.330> sawdust<00:05:36.759> or<00:05:37.759> compound

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
just add more sawdust or compound

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.129 
just add more sawdust or compound
whatever<00:05:39.009> and<00:05:40.009> that's<00:05:40.280> it<00:05:40.690> now<00:05:41.690> you<00:05:41.840> start

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
whatever and that's it now you start

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:52.779 
whatever and that's it now you start
putting<00:05:42.620> it<00:05:42.680> on<00:05:50.979> and<00:05:51.979> you<00:05:52.099> can<00:05:52.159> sand<00:05:52.520> this<00:05:52.729> down

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
putting it on and you can sand this down

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:55.450 
putting it on and you can sand this down
after<00:05:53.479> so<00:05:53.840> it<00:05:54.020> doesn't<00:05:54.320> have<00:05:54.530> to<00:05:54.680> be<00:05:54.800> exact

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
after so it doesn't have to be exact

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:04.149 
after so it doesn't have to be exact
I<00:06:01.930> remember<00:06:02.930> you<00:06:03.020> putting<00:06:03.319> a<00:06:03.409> rope<00:06:03.620> back<00:06:03.860> here

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:04.159 
I remember you putting a rope back here

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:38.559 
I remember you putting a rope back here
so<00:06:04.400> you<00:06:04.490> don't<00:06:04.580> want<00:06:04.759> to<00:06:04.819> get<00:06:04.969> it<00:06:05.060> up<00:06:05.180> tight

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:38.569 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:40.629
