out with that we don't think a lot about

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.940 
out with that we don't think a lot about
is<00:02:47.670> its<00:02:48.120> ability<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.600> teach<00:02:48.900> us<00:02:49.170> how<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.650> time

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
is its ability to teach us how to time

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.300 
is its ability to teach us how to time
our<00:02:50.130> breath<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:51.060> absorb<00:02:51.540> an<00:02:51.720> impact<00:02:52.320> so<00:02:53.010> if

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
our breath to absorb an impact so if

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.370 
our breath to absorb an impact so if
you'll<00:02:53.610> notice<00:02:53.880> when<00:02:54.300> I<00:02:54.360> do<00:02:54.480> this<00:02:54.870> my<00:02:55.050> breath

going to catch that weight and use that

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.250 
going to catch that weight and use that
my<00:03:16.920> breath<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.940> create<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.510> compression<00:03:19.140> at

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
my breath to create the compression at

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.590 
my breath to create the compression at
the<00:03:19.380> moment<00:03:19.830> that<00:03:19.950> I<00:03:19.980> catch<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.550> so<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.420> I'm

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
the moment that I catch it so that I'm

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.220 
the moment that I catch it so that I'm
nice<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:21.959> braced<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:22.680> tight<00:03:23.280> for<00:03:23.910> that

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
nice and braced and tight for that

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.140 
nice and braced and tight for that
impact<00:03:25.230> so<00:03:25.530> what<00:03:26.040> this<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.250> doing<00:03:26.400> for<00:03:26.880> us<00:03:26.940> on

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
impact so what this is doing for us on

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.930 
impact so what this is doing for us on
the<00:03:27.269> bike<00:03:27.510> is<00:03:27.810> teaching<00:03:28.650> us<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:29.010> basic<00:03:29.640> skill

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
the bike is teaching us the basic skill

the bike is teaching us the basic skill
of<00:03:30.060> how<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.269> use<00:03:30.600> our<00:03:30.780> breath<00:03:31.019> to<00:03:31.230> absorb

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
of how to use our breath to absorb
