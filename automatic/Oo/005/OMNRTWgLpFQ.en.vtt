about<00:04:54.780> 45<00:04:55.260> minutes<00:04:55.860> or<00:04:56.100> so<00:04:56.160> since<00:04:56.610> I<00:04:56.850> applied

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
about 45 minutes or so since I applied

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.490 
about 45 minutes or so since I applied
it<00:04:57.570> and<00:04:59.060> everything<00:05:00.060> seems<00:05:00.480> to<00:05:00.630> be<00:05:00.810> set<00:05:01.380> in

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
it and everything seems to be set in

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.570 
it and everything seems to be set in
place<00:05:01.880> I<00:05:02.880> did<00:05:03.270> use<00:05:03.540> a<00:05:03.570> setting<00:05:04.290> spray<00:05:04.580> today

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
place I did use a setting spray today

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.220 
place I did use a setting spray today
because<00:05:06.060> I'm<00:05:06.210> also<00:05:06.390> doing<00:05:06.690> a<00:05:06.930> first

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
because I'm also doing a first

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.540 
because I'm also doing a first
impression<00:05:07.640> for<00:05:08.640> another<00:05:09.180> product<00:05:10.010> so<00:05:11.010> I

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
impression for another product so I

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.980 
impression for another product so I
needed<00:05:11.970> to<00:05:12.060> use<00:05:12.150> a<00:05:12.180> setting<00:05:12.540> spray<00:05:12.660> which<00:05:12.900> I

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
needed to use a setting spray which I

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.150 
needed to use a setting spray which I
think<00:05:13.200> will<00:05:13.320> help<00:05:13.500> and<00:05:13.740> it<00:05:13.830> won't<00:05:13.980> really

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
think will help and it won't really

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.400 
think will help and it won't really
counteract<00:05:14.730> with<00:05:15.270> the<00:05:15.420> CC<00:05:15.870> cream<00:05:16.140> so<00:05:16.320> I'm

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410
