to him I think that's how you have to

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.170 
to him I think that's how you have to
use<00:03:39.650> him<00:03:39.830> now<00:03:39.980> I<00:03:40.010> wonder<00:03:40.340> the<00:03:40.550> fit<00:03:40.850> because

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
use him now I wonder the fit because

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
they have Shawn Goldson it's a very good

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.800 
they have Shawn Goldson it's a very good
safety<00:03:43.370> there<00:03:43.610> right<00:03:43.850> now<00:03:44.060> who<00:03:44.300> plays<00:03:44.570> that

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
a hole on their defense I think they got

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.780 
a hole on their defense I think they got
Bowman<00:03:59.290> who<00:03:59.410> has<00:03:59.590> some<00:04:00.220> off-the-field<00:04:00.340> issues

as well as some issues with his tackling

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.920 
as well as some issues with his tackling
technique<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:05.709> how<00:04:06.190> he<00:04:06.250> plays<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.209> game<00:04:07.240> you

technique and how he plays the game you

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.320 
technique and how he plays the game you
know<00:04:08.110> he's<00:04:08.500> good<00:04:08.920> upside<00:04:09.310> he's<00:04:09.880> pretty<00:04:10.180> good

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
know he's good upside he's pretty good

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.150

rushing<00:04:10.870> the<00:04:10.959> passer<00:04:11.170> as<00:04:11.560> well<00:04:11.800> which<00:04:12.010> is

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
rushing the passer as well which is

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.740 
rushing the passer as well which is
something<00:04:12.370> that<00:04:12.550> you<00:04:13.150> can<00:04:13.180> definitely<00:04:13.540> use

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
something that you can definitely use

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.449 
something that you can definitely use
from<00:04:14.080> an<00:04:14.170> inside<00:04:14.440> linebacker<00:04:14.680> in<00:04:15.160> a<00:04:15.220> 3-4

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
from an inside linebacker in a 3-4

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:16.650 
from an inside linebacker in a 3-4
though<00:04:15.790> that<00:04:15.940> shouldn't<00:04:16.269> be<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:16.419> primary

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
though that shouldn't be the primary

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.319 
though that shouldn't be the primary
goal<00:04:17.169> it's<00:04:17.650> not<00:04:17.739> exactly<00:04:17.890> a<00:04:18.310> thumper<00:04:18.820> but<00:04:19.269> he

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
goal it's not exactly a thumper but he

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.030 
goal it's not exactly a thumper but he
can<00:04:19.419> get<00:04:19.510> sideline<00:04:19.900> to<00:04:20.049> sideline<00:04:20.079> and<00:04:20.739> I<00:04:20.799> think

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
can get sideline to sideline and I think

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.470 
can get sideline to sideline and I think
you<00:04:21.130> can<00:04:21.160> kind<00:04:21.400> of<00:04:21.430> clean<00:04:21.760> up<00:04:21.940> what<00:04:22.120> Patrick

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
you can kind of clean up what Patrick

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.150 
you can kind of clean up what Patrick
Willis<00:04:22.690> doesn't<00:04:23.230> and<00:04:23.410> I<00:04:23.710> think<00:04:23.770> it<00:04:23.980> will<00:04:24.040> be<00:04:24.100> a

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
Willis doesn't and I think it will be a

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.550 
Willis doesn't and I think it will be a
nice<00:04:24.280> fit<00:04:24.340> for<00:04:24.760> them<00:04:24.880> also<00:04:25.840> pretty<00:04:26.320> good<00:04:26.500> and

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
nice fit for them also pretty good and

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.110 
nice fit for them also pretty good and
