banning raw milk what happened was in
the<00:02:07.829> 80s<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.520> this<00:02:09.000> should<00:02:09.209> sound<00:02:09.390> familiar

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
the 80s and this should sound familiar

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.510 
the 80s and this should sound familiar
the<00:02:10.530> FDA<00:02:11.039> argued<00:02:11.730> that<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:12.000> wasn't

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
the FDA argued that it wasn't

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.340 
the FDA argued that it wasn't
their<00:02:12.940> time<00:02:13.240> or<00:02:13.570> the<00:02:13.750> energy<00:02:13.930> or<00:02:14.320> the

their time or the energy or the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.770 
their time or the energy or the
taxpayers<00:02:14.920> dollars<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.850> regulate<00:02:16.330> this<00:02:16.540> well

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
taxpayers dollars to regulate this well

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.350 
taxpayers dollars to regulate this well
they<00:02:16.960> were<00:02:17.020> sued<00:02:17.470> and<00:02:17.830> they<00:02:18.640> lost<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.180> lawsuit

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
they were sued and they lost the lawsuit

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.900 
they were sued and they lost the lawsuit
so<00:02:20.200> they<00:02:20.320> were<00:02:20.380> basically<00:02:20.950> forced<00:02:21.640> by<00:02:21.850> the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
so they were basically forced by the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.600 
so they were basically forced by the
courts<00:02:22.420> to<00:02:22.630> ban<00:02:23.320> raw<00:02:23.650> milk<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.190> interstate

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
courts to ban raw milk the interstate

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.030 
courts to ban raw milk the interstate
transport<00:02:25.150> of<00:02:25.330> raw<00:02:25.480> milk<00:02:25.780> so<00:02:26.410> this<00:02:26.590> is<00:02:26.740> not<00:02:26.980> a

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
transport of raw milk so this is not a

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.980 
transport of raw milk so this is not a
law<00:02:27.340> that's<00:02:27.520> ever<00:02:27.760> been<00:02:27.910> passed<00:02:28.210> by<00:02:28.330> Congress
