up on so forth I got another one in the
garage<00:00:16.470> I'm<00:00:16.800> gonna<00:00:16.920> be<00:00:17.009> replacing<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.580> with

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
garage I'm gonna be replacing this with

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.490 
garage I'm gonna be replacing this with
and<00:00:18.119> ultimately<00:00:18.990> we're<00:00:19.110> gonna<00:00:19.200> do<00:00:19.290> a<00:00:19.320> quick

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
and ultimately we're gonna do a quick

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.890 
and ultimately we're gonna do a quick
blast<00:00:19.829> with<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.820> old<00:00:20.939> stuff<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.360> it<00:00:21.509> now<00:00:21.660> and

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
blast with the old stuff on it now and

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.339 
blast with the old stuff on it now and
run<00:00:22.079> at<00:00:22.200> 2's<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:22.770> have<00:00:23.279> 3s<00:00:23.669> on<00:00:23.880> charge<00:00:24.239> now<00:00:24.570> so

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
run at 2's I have 3s on charge now so

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.200 
run at 2's I have 3s on charge now so
hopefully<00:00:25.890> that's<00:00:26.220> up<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.579> running<00:00:26.669> before<00:00:26.970> I

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
hopefully that's up and running before I

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.780 
hopefully that's up and running before I
get<00:00:27.419> a<00:00:27.450> chance<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.810> burn<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.230> one<00:00:28.410> out<00:00:28.560> and

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:28.790 
get a chance to burn this one out and

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.690 
get a chance to burn this one out and
he'll<00:00:29.790> see<00:00:30.239> I<00:00:30.270> got<00:00:30.509> a<00:00:30.619> 19-15<00:00:31.619> Yin<00:00:31.739> in<00:00:31.860> there<00:00:32.040> so

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
he'll see I got a 19-15 Yin in there so

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.370 
he'll see I got a 19-15 Yin in there so
I<00:00:32.730> can't<00:00:33.390> remember<00:00:33.480> when<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.720> had<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.020> geared

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
I can't remember when I had this geared

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.380 
I can't remember when I had this geared
with<00:00:34.620> last<00:00:35.040> time<00:00:35.280> which<00:00:35.519> is<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.730> beast<00:00:36.000> but

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
with last time which is a beast but

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.119 
with last time which is a beast but
we'll<00:00:36.539> see<00:00:36.719> if<00:00:36.929> this<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.379> going<00:00:37.620> thermal<00:00:38.070> or

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
we'll see if this is going thermal or

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.830 
we'll see if this is going thermal or
not<00:00:38.280> hopefully<00:00:39.090> not<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.269> a<00:00:39.480> day<00:00:39.629> like<00:00:39.660> today

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
not hopefully not on a day like today

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.630 
not hopefully not on a day like today

the rigs I'd like to say it's probably
ones<00:01:43.759> got<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.090> biggest<00:01:44.270> beatings<00:01:44.720> I<00:01:48.280> know<00:01:49.280> it

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
ones got the biggest beatings I know it

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.180 
ones got the biggest beatings I know it
was<00:01:49.880> a<00:01:49.910> leap<00:01:50.690> in<00:01:50.929> it<00:01:51.080> if<00:01:51.440> I<00:01:51.560> pin<00:01:51.800> it<00:01:51.830> off<00:01:52.039> the

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
was a leap in it if I pin it off the

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.950 
was a leap in it if I pin it off the
jump<00:01:52.460> give<00:01:53.179> me<00:01:53.270> I<00:01:53.330> don't<00:01:53.479> have<00:01:53.509> all<00:01:53.720> the<00:01:53.750> wheel

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
jump give me I don't have all the wheel

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.020 
jump give me I don't have all the wheel
speed<00:01:54.229> that<00:01:54.410> I<00:01:54.440> need<00:01:54.679> it's<00:01:55.610> gonna<00:01:55.759> nosedive

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
speed that I need it's gonna nosedive

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.520 
speed that I need it's gonna nosedive
and<00:01:56.300> I<00:01:56.509> still<00:01:56.780> need<00:01:56.929> to<00:01:57.050> have<00:01:57.140> a<00:01:57.200> little<00:01:57.320> bit<00:01:57.470> of

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
and I still need to have a little bit of

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.350 
and I still need to have a little bit of
throttle<00:01:57.710> second<00:01:58.780> throttle<00:01:59.780> up<00:01:59.869> with<00:02:00.020> it<00:02:01.360> so

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
throttle second throttle up with it so

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.609 
throttle second throttle up with it so
that's<00:02:02.539> why<00:02:02.659> I'm<00:02:02.750> not<00:02:02.810> hitting<00:02:03.140> it<00:02:03.200> full<00:02:03.380> tilt

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
that's why I'm not hitting it full tilt

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.139 
that's why I'm not hitting it full tilt
cuz<00:02:03.830> it's<00:02:04.009> really<00:02:04.070> just<00:02:04.280> gonna<00:02:04.460> catapult<00:02:04.880> in

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
cuz it's really just gonna catapult in

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.260 
cuz it's really just gonna catapult in
my<00:02:05.270> ramps<00:02:05.630> don't<00:02:05.810> have<00:02:05.929> much<00:02:06.080> of<00:02:06.110> a<00:02:06.410> way<00:02:06.619> of

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
my ramps don't have much of a way of

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.850 
my ramps don't have much of a way of
much<00:02:08.270> lip<00:02:08.869> or<00:02:09.110> angular<00:02:09.349> face<00:02:09.679> a<00:02:09.940> so<00:02:11.709> I'm<00:02:12.709> gonna

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
much lip or angular face a so I'm gonna

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.030 
much lip or angular face a so I'm gonna
go<00:02:13.040> for<00:02:13.250> a<00:02:13.340> long<00:02:14.000> distance<00:02:14.180> jump<00:02:15.760> Heights<00:02:16.760> a

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
go for a long distance jump Heights a

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
go for a long distance jump Heights a
distance<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:19.160> covers<00:02:19.430> a<00:02:19.459> good<00:02:19.640> distance

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
distance that covers a good distance

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.970 
distance that covers a good distance
just<00:02:20.480> doesn't<00:02:20.750> go<00:02:20.810> up<00:02:20.930> there

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
just doesn't go up there

rubber on there is anacondas have seen a
better<00:06:09.990> today

00:06:44.799 --> 00:06:44.809 

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:47.179 

you<00:06:45.809> know<00:06:45.899> I<00:06:45.960> think<00:06:46.319> that's<00:06:46.469> enough<00:06:46.740> of<00:06:46.830> a<00:06:46.979> run

00:06:47.179 --> 00:06:47.189 
you know I think that's enough of a run

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:49.429 
you know I think that's enough of a run
what<00:06:47.909> I<00:06:47.939> will<00:06:48.210> do<00:06:48.449> is<00:06:48.719> I'll<00:06:48.869> say<00:06:49.050> the<00:06:49.199> three

00:06:49.429 --> 00:06:49.439 
what I will do is I'll say the three

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:52.189 
what I will do is I'll say the three
years<00:06:49.649> run<00:06:49.860> for<00:06:50.069> next<00:06:50.309> time<00:06:50.490> and<00:06:50.990> I'll<00:06:51.990> take

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:52.199 
years run for next time and I'll take

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:53.629 
years run for next time and I'll take
out<00:06:52.319> the<00:06:52.409> radar<00:06:52.680> gun<00:06:52.830> next<00:06:53.039> time<00:06:53.249> so<00:06:53.399> you<00:06:53.520> got

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 
out the radar gun next time so you got

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:55.519 
out the radar gun next time so you got
some<00:06:53.789> readings<00:06:54.119> so<00:06:54.779> the<00:06:54.990> gearing<00:06:55.199> right<00:06:55.379> now

00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:55.529 
some readings so the gearing right now

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:57.920 
some readings so the gearing right now
for<00:06:55.800> the<00:06:55.889> 2s<00:06:56.189> you<00:06:56.339> know<00:06:56.430> what<00:06:56.550> I'm<00:06:57.180> not<00:06:57.330> -<00:06:57.689> I

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930 
for the 2s you know what I'm not - I

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.209 
for the 2s you know what I'm not - I
think<00:06:58.050> I'm<00:06:58.169> gonna<00:06:58.259> stick<00:06:58.409> with<00:06:58.469> a<00:06:58.589> 19<00:06:58.919> for<00:06:59.099> that

00:06:59.209 --> 00:06:59.219 
think I'm gonna stick with a 19 for that

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:01.279 
think I'm gonna stick with a 19 for that
test<00:06:59.909> it<00:06:59.999> up<00:07:00.119> with<00:07:00.210> the<00:07:00.270> three<00:07:00.509> c4<00:07:00.930> getting<00:07:01.139> in

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:01.289 
test it up with the three c4 getting in

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:03.320 
test it up with the three c4 getting in

a gain zero for sure ting it gains
weight<00:07:03.569> gains<00:07:04.349> -<00:07:04.949> is<00:07:05.159> a<00:07:05.479> heat<00:07:06.479> might<00:07:06.719> not<00:07:06.930> be

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 
weight gains - is a heat might not be

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:08.809 
weight gains - is a heat might not be
worth<00:07:07.710> it<00:07:07.889> right<00:07:08.099> so<00:07:08.399> we'll<00:07:08.550> see<00:07:08.699> how<00:07:08.759> that

00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:08.819 
worth it right so we'll see how that

00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:11.510 
worth it right so we'll see how that
goes<00:07:08.969> and<00:07:09.529> we'll<00:07:10.529> be<00:07:10.619> back<00:07:10.800> at<00:07:11.009> it<00:07:11.039> in<00:07:11.279> a<00:07:11.369> bit

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 
goes and we'll be back at it in a bit
