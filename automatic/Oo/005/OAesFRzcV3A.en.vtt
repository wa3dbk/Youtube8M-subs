00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
seems like a thing you could do where'd

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.920 
seems like a thing you could do where'd
that<00:00:56.500> come<00:00:56.739> from<00:00:56.800> a<00:00:57.730> lot<00:00:58.180> just<00:00:58.330> coming<00:00:58.780> with

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
that come from a lot just coming with

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.630 
that come from a lot just coming with
the<00:00:59.050> fish<00:00:59.379> it's<00:00:59.980> like<00:01:00.129> the<00:01:00.250> person<00:01:00.430> who

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
the fish it's like the person who

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.790 
the fish it's like the person who
designed<00:01:00.910> these<00:01:01.120> levels<00:01:01.360> hated<00:01:01.900> damage<00:01:02.610> I

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
designed these levels hated damage I

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.060 
designed these levels hated damage I
have<00:01:05.800> the<00:01:06.010> feeling<00:01:06.250> that<00:01:06.430> boost<00:01:06.850> is<00:01:07.119> not<00:01:07.330> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
have the feeling that boost is not the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.320 
have the feeling that boost is not the
prominent<00:01:09.540> concern<00:01:10.540> for<00:01:10.900> a<00:01:10.930> lot<00:01:10.990> of<00:01:11.140> things

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
prominent concern for a lot of things

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.370 
prominent concern for a lot of things
should<00:01:13.330> be

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:24.120 

shall<00:01:16.380> we<00:01:16.409> start<00:01:16.950> making<00:01:17.100> these<00:01:17.869> with<00:01:18.869> what<00:01:19.080> I

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.139 

excuse<00:01:24.820> our<00:01:24.939> fun<00:01:25.210> and<00:01:26.399> these<00:01:27.399> papers<00:01:27.789> are<00:01:27.820> kind

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
excuse our fun and these papers are kind

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:34.680 
excuse our fun and these papers are kind
of<00:01:28.240> long<00:01:28.390> her<00:01:28.600> cheeks<00:01:29.170> are<00:01:29.289> kind<00:01:29.500> of<00:01:29.590> large

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.960 

so<00:01:35.350> one<00:01:35.530> of<00:01:35.560> the<00:01:35.740> start<00:01:36.070> point<00:01:36.280> is<00:01:36.490> in<00:01:36.640> kind<00:01:36.880> of

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
so one of the start point is in kind of

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.380 
so one of the start point is in kind of
a<00:01:37.060> weird<00:01:37.090> place<00:01:37.660> if<00:01:37.930> I<00:01:38.050> recall<00:01:38.200> correctly<00:01:39.390> it's

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
a weird place if I recall correctly it's

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.420 
a weird place if I recall correctly it's
like<00:01:40.660> coins<00:01:41.140> will<00:01:41.380> fall<00:01:41.620> down<00:01:41.860> from<00:01:42.010> the<00:01:42.160> sky

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
like coins will fall down from the sky

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.100 
like coins will fall down from the sky
and<00:01:42.730> then<00:01:42.850> eventually<00:01:43.060> more<00:01:43.660> than<00:01:43.870> was<00:01:44.080> a

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
and then eventually more than was a

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.560 
and then eventually more than was a
start<00:01:44.530> point

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
start point

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:53.780 
start point
I<00:01:45.659> believe<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.650> is<00:01:46.710> here<00:01:49.070> yep<00:01:52.640> so<00:01:53.640> yeah
