00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.520 

so<00:00:08.880> I'm<00:00:08.940> now<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.179> the<00:00:09.389> Sigma<00:00:09.780> booth<00:00:10.200> where<00:00:10.440> they

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
so I'm now in the Sigma booth where they

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.870 
so I'm now in the Sigma booth where they
just<00:00:10.830> announced<00:00:11.219> something<00:00:11.370> cool<00:00:11.700> they

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
just announced something cool they

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.600 
just announced something cool they
announced<00:00:12.150> three<00:00:12.599> new<00:00:12.630> lines<00:00:13.559> of<00:00:13.920> lenses<00:00:14.400> I

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
announced three new lines of lenses I

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.860 
announced three new lines of lenses I
don't<00:00:14.849> have<00:00:14.940> their<00:00:15.059> lines<00:00:15.269> but<00:00:15.450> they've<00:00:15.690> got

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
don't have their lines but they've got

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.750 
don't have their lines but they've got
the<00:00:15.990> sport<00:00:16.410> they've<00:00:16.830> got<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.070> contemporary

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
the sport they've got the contemporary

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.849 
the sport they've got the contemporary
and<00:00:17.970> they<00:00:18.240> have<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.510> art<00:00:18.750> different<00:00:19.710> things

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
and they have the art different things

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.130 
and they have the art different things
new<00:00:20.039> moniker<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.730> one<00:00:20.880> has<00:00:21.029> an<00:00:21.150> S<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.570> C<00:00:21.900> and

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
new moniker so this one has an S a C and

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.380 
new moniker so this one has an S a C and
an<00:00:22.470> A<00:00:22.619> on<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:23.039> lens<00:00:23.220> as<00:00:23.430> well<00:00:23.670> as<00:00:23.820> a<00:00:23.880> sigma

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
an A on the lens as well as a sigma

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.820 
an A on the lens as well as a sigma

optimization tool

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.560 
optimization tool
I<00:00:25.859> believe<00:00:26.550> that's<00:00:26.670> what<00:00:26.789> they<00:00:26.910> called<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.240> it

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
I believe that's what they called it it

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.439 
I believe that's what they called it it
has<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> USB<00:00:27.990> port<00:00:28.349> on<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.039> side<00:00:29.429> why<00:00:30.029> because

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
has a USB port on the side why because

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.870 
has a USB port on the side why because
you<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:30.720> optimize<00:00:31.140> each<00:00:31.619> lens<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.610> certain

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
you can optimize each lens to certain

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.639 
you can optimize each lens to certain
specifications<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.809> would<00:00:34.050> like<00:00:34.290> if

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
specifications that you would like if

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.229 
specifications that you would like if
you<00:00:34.770> want<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.040> tweak<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.370> focus<00:00:35.730> limiter<00:00:35.910> if

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
you want to tweak the focus limiter if

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.600 
you want to tweak the focus limiter if
you<00:00:36.360> want<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.600> tweak<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.230> focus<00:00:37.739> speed<00:00:38.040> you

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
you want to tweak the focus speed you

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.520 
you want to tweak the focus speed you
now<00:00:38.820> have<00:00:39.030> control<00:00:39.210> through<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> Sigma<00:00:40.140> app<00:00:40.290> and

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
now have control through a Sigma app and

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.130 
now have control through a Sigma app and
this<00:00:41.100> optimizer<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.270> make<00:00:42.450> those<00:00:42.690> changes

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
this optimizer to make those changes

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.040 
this optimizer to make those changes
happen<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:43.950> what<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.070> love<00:00:44.399> here<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:45.719> lens

are<00:01:23.799> going<00:01:24.070> they<00:01:24.369> have<00:01:24.399> a<00:01:24.520> nice<00:01:24.880> feel<00:01:25.390> to<00:01:25.630> them

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
are going they have a nice feel to them

are going they have a nice feel to them
this<00:01:26.350> one<00:01:26.590> being<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:26.979> prototype<00:01:28.079> really<00:01:29.079> has

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
this one being the prototype really has

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.559 
this one being the prototype really has
a<00:01:29.380> nice<00:01:29.590> smooth<00:01:30.039> feel<00:01:30.610> so<00:01:31.030> I<00:01:31.060> can't<00:01:31.390> wait<00:01:31.509> to

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
a nice smooth feel so I can't wait to

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:34.139 
a nice smooth feel so I can't wait to
try<00:01:31.990> one<00:01:32.020> of<00:01:32.259> these<00:01:32.409> 122<00:01:33.100> 300s<00:01:33.670> they<00:01:34.030> I<00:01:34.060> know

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
try one of these 122 300s they I know

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:36.090 
try one of these 122 300s they I know
they're<00:01:34.479> expensive<00:01:34.689> but<00:01:35.380> to<00:01:35.530> get<00:01:35.709> something

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
they're expensive but to get something

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.639 
they're expensive but to get something
in<00:01:36.189> this<00:01:36.310> range<00:01:36.640> in<00:01:36.880> a<00:01:36.969> 2.8<00:01:37.600> you<00:01:38.259> don't<00:01:38.409> find

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
in this range in a 2.8 you don't find

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:41.090 
in this range in a 2.8 you don't find
that<00:01:38.829> every<00:01:39.039> day<00:01:39.429> so<00:01:39.850> it<00:01:40.360> feels<00:01:40.569> really<00:01:40.810> good

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
that every day so it feels really good

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:26.139 
you some nice low-light capability at

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.770

2.8<00:02:26.680> all<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.100> way<00:02:27.190> at<00:02:27.280> 17<00:02:27.819> but<00:02:28.060> then<00:02:28.569> moving

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
2.8 all the way at 17 but then moving

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.410 
2.8 all the way at 17 but then moving
through<00:02:29.079> it<00:02:29.200> f4<00:02:29.739> you<00:02:30.250> can<00:02:30.459> use<00:02:30.609> the<00:02:30.819> optical

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
through it f4 you can use the optical

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.479 
through it f4 you can use the optical
stabilization<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:32.590> could<00:02:32.829> work<00:02:32.980> well<00:02:33.250> and

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
stabilization that could work well and

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.129 
stabilization that could work well and
