a<00:02:16.030> pretty<00:02:16.239> good<00:02:16.420> match<00:02:16.630> for<00:02:16.870> this<00:02:16.989> engine<00:02:17.340> yeah

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
a pretty good match for this engine yeah

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.720 
a pretty good match for this engine yeah
it's<00:02:18.610> not<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:19.750> most<00:02:19.959> pleasant<00:02:20.410> car<00:02:21.040> sound<00:02:21.459> at

it's not the most pleasant car sound at
the<00:02:21.940> maximum<00:02:22.750> redline<00:02:23.140> but<00:02:23.819> it<00:02:24.819> really<00:02:25.209> makes

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
the maximum redline but it really makes

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.839 
the maximum redline but it really makes
