00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
same in the game class because you know

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.220 
same in the game class because you know
of<00:03:14.010> course<00:03:14.640> just<00:03:15.300> like<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.630> examples<00:03:16.080> before

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
of course just like the examples before

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.960 
of course just like the examples before
this<00:03:16.650> game<00:03:16.830> is<00:03:16.950> going<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.100> have<00:03:17.250> two<00:03:17.430> states<00:03:17.760> a

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
this game is going to have two states a

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.910 
this game is going to have two states a
menu<00:03:18.209> state<00:03:18.570> which<00:03:18.990> is<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.170> main<00:03:19.410> menu<00:03:19.740> in<00:03:19.890> the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
menu state which is the main menu in the

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.860 
menu state which is the main menu in the
place<00:03:20.250> state<00:03:20.520> where<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.090> play<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.510> game<00:03:21.690> and

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
place state where you play the game and

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.930 
place state where you play the game and
basically<00:03:22.740> everything<00:03:23.070> else<00:03:23.250> is<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.520> same<00:03:23.730> so

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
basically everything else is the same so

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.490 
basically everything else is the same so
there's<00:03:24.120> no<00:03:24.300> reason<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.840> touch<00:03:24.959> that<00:03:25.170> at<00:03:25.350> all

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
there's no reason to touch that at all

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.380 
there's no reason to touch that at all
so<00:03:25.650> again<00:03:25.860> keep<00:03:26.310> your<00:03:26.340> game<00:03:26.670> class<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.120> same

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
so again keep your game class the same

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.140 
so again keep your game class the same
and<00:03:27.630> clean<00:03:28.350> out<00:03:28.500> everything<00:03:28.860> in<00:03:29.250> menu<00:03:29.880> class

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
and clean out everything in menu class

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.110 
and clean out everything in menu class
and<00:03:30.450> play<00:03:31.260> class<00:03:31.620> and<00:03:31.950> once<00:03:32.459> you<00:03:32.610> do<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:32.790> and

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
and play class and once you do that and

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.699 
and play class and once you do that and
once<00:03:33.330> you<00:03:33.450> have<00:03:33.600> all<00:03:33.780> your<00:03:33.810> images<00:03:34.440> imported

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
once you have all your images imported

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.070 
once you have all your images imported
then<00:03:35.459> you're<00:03:35.640> ready<00:03:35.820> to<00:03:35.910> go<00:03:36.030> ready<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.720> start

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
then you're ready to go ready to start

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.230 
then you're ready to go ready to start
