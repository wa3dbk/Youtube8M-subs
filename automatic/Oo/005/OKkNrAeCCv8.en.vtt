00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.090
 hello here we are in another floor of my 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.520
 channel a bit of everything they are going to 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.170
 teach how this is done to put the 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.450
 pencils and make it much more comfortable to 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.600
 write to start we need a 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:17.890
 Loom a crochet and gummies we need 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:21.080
 six dwellings about 618 dwellings other eight 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.980
 four green blues 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.720
 yellow 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:30.349
 4 red orange 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:33.020
 8 you will deny then to begin with we have to 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.480
 take the loom and the loom we just go to 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.540
 need four of these so let's go 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:43.269
 to start by taking blacks doing 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.269
 an X and putting them in this way 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:55.510
 we take another black we make an X and 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.510
 we put it here 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.390
 and here 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.390
 again another black 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.340
 we have to be careful how they are 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.290
 here by putting one on top of another and 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.240
 all that is worth because that for the end 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.470
 It's very important 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.470
 we put the other 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.880
 and now it is now from now on 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.159
 have to put more like this way 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.290
 Now everything is there to put the standard 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.290
 so let's start with the abodes 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.600
 we expose normal 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.729
 and so 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:57.060
 now we put up now let's 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.950
 start what I call braid good 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.409
 or expensive as you want to call it 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:05.480
 and this is a pretty simple thing is 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.480
 catch the rubber band below 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.610
 and pass it up I advise you 

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.050
 that the moon passes for better 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.110
 result but you can also spend 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.280
 one at a time 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.280
 I look from here 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.300
 we take one and we pass it up 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.540
 we take the other one and step 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.150
 we take a 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.230
 and we had it 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:40.400
 we take the other one does not get caught and the 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.990
 we went through cold 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.050
 we take the one below 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:48.860
 and we had them then we have to go 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.860
 being that way 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.829
 Now it's time to put the blues on, I'm going 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.970
 to put also 4 then we put them 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.950
 normal 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.650
 this can also be made containers 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.720
 just that doing it containers 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.080
 a little harder so better if you 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.080
 we do it this way 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.230
 and then we put them like that and take the 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.890
 from below 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.890
 one 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.960
 we put it through the little hole the crochet 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:27.470
 and 2 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.510
 Well, I'm going to keep doing it and 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.820
 when I have it more or less done already 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.250
 almost everything comes back and teaches you how 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:37.900
 put it in the pencil how to make the end 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:41.330
 and all that, so remember the one below 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.390
 up and one at a time for better 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.390
 results 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.980
 Well, we see all the colors and I'm going to 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.190
 put the last one is like everything without 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.190
 plus 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.870
 and we put them all and had a normal 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.410
 Here it costs us a little more because 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.880
 as it is the last because if you are caught 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.880
 how it's up to us with this 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.440
 from bottom to top 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.639
 so now we have everything 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:36.460
 then let's take the all 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:39.420
 I'm going to start with this 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:44.750
 in this way 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.750
 we went through here too and we took it out 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.050
 bar we already have two let's take the 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:57.009
 next 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:05:00.400
 and now the last one here is good 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:03.449
 we already have it here cogidito 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.509
 it's shorter than this 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:08.909
 and I'm going to put it in the pencil so I'm going 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:11.400
 to remove this to teach you how to 

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:14.249
 puts when we have it like this all the 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.950
 crochet we have to pass the pencil by 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:19.810
 the middle 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.810
 and raising it carefully 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.380
 until we get here 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.580
 and it has to go through the middle ie 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.030
 here 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:34.240
 it's worth it like this now when we have like this 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:37.110
 we have to pass the rubbers by the pencil 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.110
 in this way 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.949
 well until we have all 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.120
 well that's how it is 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.060
 It looks very nice and also makes very 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.860
 comfortable when writing equal principles 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.600
 it seems that they do it as dp actually 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.810
 It makes it very comfortable and now I'm going to 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.570
 say a little something I wanted to tell you is that 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:14.720
 of a little bit they already have twitter and they 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.070
 so called everything a little grandfather of everything 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.080
 a little bit but whatever channels 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:20.000
 all a little because they did not leave me for 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:23.330
 all a little I still only have one 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.090
