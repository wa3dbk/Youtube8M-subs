00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.140
Every child in Valoran has heard the tale before,

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.729
About the cursed mummy boy who felt his heart no more.

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:04.280
So sad and lorn, the helpless lad, Amumu was
his name,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:10.000
He ventured out to find a friend and learn
about his bane.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:12.500
For many years, young Amumu traveled through
the lands,

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.640
Determined to make friends, if only they would
understand,

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.560
But even when Amumu stood upon the ledge of home,

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.260
His hope would disappoint him, and he would
remain alone.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.200
But then the curse began to whisper in his ear,

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.020
And would confirm what was Amumuâ€™s biggest fear,

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.200
It pledged that never shall someone become
his friend,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.200
It pledged that he shall be alone until his end.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.800
The sorrow and despair, became too much to bear.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:42.080
The moment when Amumu realized what he had done,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.640
Too late it was, for him, for them, the evil
curse had won.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.400
The anger and the anguish overwhelmed his
fragile soul,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.780
And caused a wicked tantrum that he never
could control.
