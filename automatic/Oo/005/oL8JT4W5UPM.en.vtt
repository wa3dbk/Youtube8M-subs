00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.190 
honest if they are designing this 2-bike
then<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.790> think<00:01:45.090> that's<00:01:45.299> pretty<00:01:45.509> poor<00:01:45.869> but<00:01:46.049> what

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200

because<00:01:55.020> their<00:01:55.170> stuff<00:01:55.380> falls<00:01:55.619> apart<00:01:56.750> and<00:01:57.750> is

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
because their stuff falls apart and is

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.389 
because their stuff falls apart and is
badly<00:01:58.259> designed<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:58.979> meant<00:01:59.159> to<00:01:59.219> be<00:01:59.280> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
badly designed this is meant to be the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.920 
badly designed this is meant to be the
pinnacle<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.880> their<00:02:00.030> design<00:02:00.360> range<00:02:00.600> they<00:02:00.750> said

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
pinnacle of their design range they said

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:01.819 
pinnacle of their design range they said
that<00:02:01.079> they<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:01.380> stopped<00:02:01.649> manufacturing

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
that they have stopped manufacturing

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.880 
that they have stopped manufacturing
these<00:02:02.460> because<00:02:02.909> ah<00:02:03.350> because<00:02:04.350> people<00:02:04.740> weren't

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
these because ah because people weren't

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.490 
these because ah because people weren't
prepared<00:02:04.979> to<00:02:05.280> pay<00:02:05.460> 20<00:02:05.820> pounds<00:02:06.119> appear<00:02:06.439> but<00:02:07.439> I

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
prepared to pay 20 pounds appear but I

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.570 
prepared to pay 20 pounds appear but I
think<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:07.979> reason<00:02:08.129> they<00:02:08.340> stopped

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
think the reason they stopped

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.309 
think the reason they stopped
manufacturing<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:09.270> makes<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.629> best<00:02:10.110> you've

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
manufacturing it makes the best you've

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.360 
manufacturing it makes the best you've
got<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> design<00:02:10.739> flaw

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
got a design flaw

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.430 
got a design flaw
but<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.239> reason<00:02:12.569> that<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:12.720> say<00:02:13.170> that<00:02:13.379> you

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
but the the reason that I say that you

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.410 
but the the reason that I say that you
shouldn't<00:02:13.680> go<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.860> roses<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.580> don't<00:02:15.060> buy<00:02:15.239> any

products and roses at all is because

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.089 
products and roses at all is because
