00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
to have and on which I grew a keiki from

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.010 
to have and on which I grew a keiki from
that<00:00:16.949> spike<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.580> there<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> keiki<00:00:18.720> growing

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
that spike and there is a keiki growing

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.480 
that spike and there is a keiki growing
in<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.289> pot<00:00:19.550> now<00:00:21.859> while<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.980> keiki<00:00:23.340> was

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
in that pot now while the keiki was

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.599 
in that pot now while the keiki was
growing<00:00:23.820> there<00:00:24.949> you<00:00:25.949> know<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.099> used<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.400> water

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
growing there you know I used to water

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.490 
growing there you know I used to water
it<00:00:26.939> trying<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.630> water<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.050> roots<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
it trying to water the roots of the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.519 
it trying to water the roots of the
keiki<00:00:28.859> but<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.820> see<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.689> orchid<00:00:31.199> has<00:00:31.320> not

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
keiki but I see that this orchid has not

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:32.930 
keiki but I see that this orchid has not
been<00:00:31.740> doing<00:00:31.920> well<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.399> I've<00:00:32.489> been<00:00:32.610> struggling

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
been doing well and I've been struggling

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.060 
been doing well and I've been struggling
with<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.329> for<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.600> while<00:00:33.890> wondering<00:00:34.890> what's

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
with it for a while wondering what's

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.030 
with it for a while wondering what's
wrong<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.620> leaves<00:00:37.829> have<00:00:38.010> been

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
wrong and the the the leaves have been

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.190 
wrong and the the the leaves have been
yellowing<00:00:38.610> or<00:00:38.879> reddening<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.629> falling<00:00:40.020> off

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
yellowing or reddening and falling off

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.110 
yellowing or reddening and falling off
and<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.620> thought<00:00:40.800> or<00:00:41.040> maybe<00:00:41.250> it's<00:00:41.460> aging<00:00:41.969> or

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
and I thought or maybe it's aging or

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.979 
and I thought or maybe it's aging or
something<00:00:42.590> but<00:00:44.030> you<00:00:45.030> know<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.360> second<00:00:45.809> leaf

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
something but you know the second leaf

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.190 
something but you know the second leaf
the<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:47.250> second<00:00:47.579> last<00:00:47.730> leaf<00:00:48.000> fell<00:00:48.210> off<00:00:48.420> and

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the the second last leaf fell off and

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200 
the the second last leaf fell off and
said<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.890> something<00:00:50.100> else<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.879> is<00:00:50.910> not

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
said this is something else this is not

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.389 
said this is something else this is not
just<00:00:51.510> aging<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.559> looked<00:00:52.770> at<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.980> leaf<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.309> I

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
just aging so looked at the leaf and I

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.660 
just aging so looked at the leaf and I
found<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.800> little<00:00:55.800> bit<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.010> black<00:00:56.250> there

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
found that a little bit of black there

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.650 
found that a little bit of black there
at<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.239> end

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
at the end

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.790 
at the end
this<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.289> maturity<00:00:59.300> yes<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.809> see<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.170> and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
this is maturity yes you see that and

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.640 
this is maturity yes you see that and
then<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.219> looked<00:01:02.430> at<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.670> crown<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.530> there<00:01:04.530> in

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
then I looked at the crown and there in

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.260 
then I looked at the crown and there in
the<00:01:04.769> center<00:01:05.129> also<00:01:05.339> you<00:01:05.549> can<00:01:05.700> see<00:01:05.850> some<00:01:06.060> black

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
the center also you can see some black

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.440 
the center also you can see some black
stuff<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.909> also<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.030> stem<00:01:10.280> so<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:12.270> is

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
stuff and also the stem so this is

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.100 
stuff and also the stem so this is
something<00:01:12.659> wrong<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.549> you<00:01:14.780> know<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.810> sort<00:01:16.049> of

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
something wrong and you know I sort of

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.840 
something wrong and you know I sort of
pulled<00:01:16.320> out<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.650> orchid<00:01:17.090> from<00:01:19.220> its<00:01:20.220> medium

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
pulled out the orchid from its medium

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.810 
pulled out the orchid from its medium
and<00:01:21.060> looked<00:01:21.240> at<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.479> roots<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.670> the<00:01:23.670> roots

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
and looked at the roots and the roots

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.460 
and looked at the roots and the roots
don't<00:01:24.150> look<00:01:24.330> too<00:01:24.509> good<00:01:24.540> either<00:01:25.700> they're<00:01:26.700> not

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
don't look too good either they're not

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.460 
don't look too good either they're not
yellowing<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.710> dying<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.490> black<00:01:30.119> stuff<00:01:30.470> so

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
yellowing and dying and black stuff so

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.390 
yellowing and dying and black stuff so
um<00:01:32.840> this<00:01:33.840> looks<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.290> me<00:01:34.320> like<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.829> orchid<00:01:35.250> is

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
um this looks to me like this orchid is

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.810 
um this looks to me like this orchid is
dying<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:37.380> seems<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.220> severe<00:01:38.549> case<00:01:38.759> of

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
dying and it seems like a severe case of

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.109 
dying and it seems like a severe case of
crown<00:01:39.390> rot<00:01:39.890> so<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.130> happens<00:01:41.520> when<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.850> water

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
crown rot so this happens when you water

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.490 
crown rot so this happens when you water
the<00:01:42.390> orchid<00:01:43.070> from<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.220> top<00:01:44.750> you<00:01:45.750> know<00:01:45.869> and

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.080 

assume<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.890> dry<00:01:50.130> out<00:01:50.159> this<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> most

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
assume that it dry out this is the most

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.399 
assume that it dry out this is the most
common<00:01:51.689> reason<00:01:52.280> cited<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:54.240> watering<00:01:54.930> here

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
common reason cited that watering here

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.910 
common reason cited that watering here
and<00:01:55.649> then<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.909> crown<00:01:57.270> here<00:01:57.719> it's<00:01:58.110> not<00:01:58.560> letting

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
and then the crown here it's not letting

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.069 
and then the crown here it's not letting
the<00:01:59.009> water<00:01:59.189> dry<00:01:59.490> up<00:01:59.640> from<00:01:59.850> here<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.930> is

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
the water dry up from here and this is

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.630 
the water dry up from here and this is
what<00:02:01.200> happens<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.860> think<00:02:02.100> had<00:02:02.219> been<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.430> bit

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
what happens and I think had been a bit

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.870 
what happens and I think had been a bit
careless<00:02:02.939> with<00:02:03.360> watching<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.380> keiki<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.549> this

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
careless with watching the keiki so this

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.320 
careless with watching the keiki so this
is<00:02:06.060> my<00:02:06.240> first<00:02:06.659> case<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:07.200> crown<00:02:07.770> rot<00:02:07.799> or<00:02:08.330> maybe

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
is my first case of crown rot or maybe

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.540 
is my first case of crown rot or maybe
have<00:02:09.539> had<00:02:09.780> one<00:02:10.020> before<00:02:10.410> them<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.979> sake<00:02:11.160> orchid

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
have had one before them the sake orchid

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.130 
have had one before them the sake orchid
that<00:02:11.700> died

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
that died

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.420 
that died
with<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.319> cinnamon<00:02:13.680> dusting<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.220> looked

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
with the cinnamon dusting it looked

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.990 
with the cinnamon dusting it looked
similar<00:02:14.900> so<00:02:15.900> I<00:02:16.200> think<00:02:16.319> this<00:02:16.590> is<00:02:16.800> what<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:17.790> going

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
similar so I think this is what is going

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.380 
similar so I think this is what is going
on<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:19.200> treatment<00:02:19.680> for<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:20.240> looked<00:02:21.240> up

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
on the treatment for it looked up

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.420 
on the treatment for it looked up
although<00:02:21.600> all<00:02:22.020> over<00:02:22.380> researched<00:02:22.770> it<00:02:22.980> is

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
although all over researched it is

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.790 
although all over researched it is
hydrogen<00:02:23.910> peroxide<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.870> that's<00:02:25.560> what<00:02:25.680> I'm

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
hydrogen peroxide and that's what I'm

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.370 
hydrogen peroxide and that's what I'm
going<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.040> try<00:02:26.220> but<00:02:26.880> this<00:02:27.630> looks<00:02:27.900> like<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.170> very

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
going to try but this looks like a very

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.710 
going to try but this looks like a very
severe<00:02:28.800> case<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:29.400> don't<00:02:30.180> know<00:02:30.330> if<00:02:30.480> it<00:02:30.600> will

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
severe case I don't know if it will

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.400 
severe case I don't know if it will
survive<00:02:31.020> or<00:02:31.230> not<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.280> cause<00:02:32.520> of<00:02:32.550> death<00:02:32.940> is

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
survive or not so the cause of death is

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.010 
survive or not so the cause of death is
a<00:02:34.410> fungus<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.190> gets<00:02:35.610> hold<00:02:35.910> of<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.780> growing

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
a fungus that gets hold of the growing

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.670 
a fungus that gets hold of the growing
end<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.400> orchid<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:40.080> growing<00:02:40.380> part

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
end of the orchid and the growing part

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.440 
end of the orchid and the growing part
in<00:02:40.860> or<00:02:41.010> this<00:02:41.130> inside<00:02:41.670> part<00:02:41.880> where<00:02:42.150> they<00:02:42.239> puts

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
in or this inside part where they puts

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.920 
in or this inside part where they puts
out<00:02:42.600> new<00:02:42.810> leaves<00:02:42.989> and<00:02:44.000> then<00:02:45.000> it<00:02:45.239> spreads<00:02:45.630> down

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
out new leaves and then it spreads down

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:51.170 
out new leaves and then it spreads down
the<00:02:46.170> stem<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:47.540> into<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.660> roots<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.970> it<00:02:50.970> looks

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
the stem and into the roots so it looks

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.870 
the stem and into the roots so it looks
pretty<00:02:51.390> bad<00:02:51.570> right<00:02:52.260> there

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
pretty bad right there

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.620 
pretty bad right there
alright<00:02:53.880> so<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.870> continue<00:02:56.000> so<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.030> was<00:02:57.330> looking

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
alright so to continue so I was looking

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.729 
alright so to continue so I was looking
at<00:02:57.750> with<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.170> roots<00:02:58.500> and<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:01.230> rest<00:03:01.440> of<00:03:01.620> the

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
at with the roots and the rest of the

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.900 
at with the roots and the rest of the
leaves<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:03.680> really<00:03:04.680> inside<00:03:05.340> there<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:05.760> can

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
leaves and really inside there you can

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.720 
leaves and really inside there you can
see<00:03:06.090> the<00:03:06.269> blackened<00:03:06.720> area<00:03:06.989> and<00:03:07.650> that's<00:03:08.519> where

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
see the blackened area and that's where

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.660 
see the blackened area and that's where
the<00:03:09.290> problem<00:03:10.290> is<00:03:10.440> right<00:03:10.950> on<00:03:11.160> there

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
the problem is right on there

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.150 
the problem is right on there
so<00:03:12.480> I<00:03:12.870> think<00:03:14.090> this<00:03:15.090> is<00:03:15.269> my<00:03:15.420> first<00:03:15.660> case<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:16.160> root

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
so I think this is my first case of root

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.560 
so I think this is my first case of root
rot<00:03:17.430> or<00:03:18.060> sorry<00:03:18.480> crown<00:03:19.200> rot<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.769> the<00:03:20.220> stem<00:03:20.570> also

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
rot or sorry crown rot and the stem also

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.900 
rot or sorry crown rot and the stem also
turned<00:03:21.840> black<00:03:22.110> so<00:03:22.799> this<00:03:22.950> is<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.160> why<00:03:23.310> this

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
turned black so this is the why this

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.240 
turned black so this is the why this
orchid<00:03:24.420> is<00:03:24.540> dying<00:03:24.810> I'm<00:03:25.110> going<00:03:25.799> to<00:03:25.860> see<00:03:26.010> if<00:03:26.130> I

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
orchid is dying I'm going to see if I

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.830 
orchid is dying I'm going to see if I
can<00:03:26.459> save<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:26.940> some<00:03:27.269> hydrogen<00:03:27.570> peroxide

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
can save it that some hydrogen peroxide

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.710 
can save it that some hydrogen peroxide
which<00:03:28.500> is<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.769> recommended<00:03:28.950> treatment

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
which is the recommended treatment

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.680 
which is the recommended treatment
although<00:03:30.720> this<00:03:31.530> case<00:03:31.860> looks<00:03:32.130> pretty<00:03:32.400> bad

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
although this case looks pretty bad

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.150 
although this case looks pretty bad
we'll<00:03:34.530> give<00:03:34.709> it<00:03:34.799> a<00:03:34.890> shot<00:03:35.750> alright<00:03:37.130> thanks<00:03:38.130> for

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
we'll give it a shot alright thanks for

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.610 
we'll give it a shot alright thanks for
watching
