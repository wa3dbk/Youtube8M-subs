00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.040 
it is a mouth and then she has her
little<00:02:28.340> towel<00:02:28.760> in<00:02:29.300> it<00:02:29.540> that<00:02:29.960> she<00:02:30.140> comes<00:02:30.350> with

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
little towel in it that she comes with

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.860 
little towel in it that she comes with
no<00:02:33.310> he<00:02:34.310> will<00:02:34.400> get<00:02:34.580> onto<00:02:34.970> her<00:02:35.180> but<00:02:35.450> Irvine's

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
no he will get onto her but Irvine's

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.770 
no he will get onto her but Irvine's
like<00:02:36.590> I<00:02:36.740> said<00:02:37.010> it's<00:02:37.280> just<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:38.030> same<00:02:38.300> with<00:02:38.480> her

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
like I said it's just the same with her

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.080 
like I said it's just the same with her
arm<00:02:39.350> vines<00:02:41.050> then<00:02:42.050> her<00:02:42.320> shoes<00:02:42.850> they<00:02:43.850> have

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
arm vines then her shoes they have

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.120 
arm vines then her shoes they have
they're<00:02:44.690> all<00:02:44.810> kind<00:02:45.050> of<00:02:45.170> pointy<00:02:45.560> at<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.709> bottom

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
they're all kind of pointy at the bottom

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.530 
they're all kind of pointy at the bottom
so<00:02:46.340> I'm<00:02:46.490> thinking<00:02:46.880> those<00:02:47.000> are<00:02:47.060> kind<00:02:47.330> of<00:02:47.390> like

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540

so I'm thinking those are kind of like
teeth<00:02:47.780> too<00:02:48.640> then<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.850> little<00:02:50.090> straps<00:02:51.370> let's

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
teeth too then the little straps let's

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.360 
teeth too then the little straps let's
see<00:02:52.640> I<00:02:52.880> not<00:02:53.540> sure<00:02:53.840> what<00:02:54.020> those<00:02:54.200> are<00:02:54.440> but<00:02:54.709> they
