00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.110
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.110
 new motto view today with your head 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.170
 their name and a correct name 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.320
 awesome device is the use of new 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.140
 technologies revising wood now 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.340
 Can you put the wood in chips? 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.369
 industrial scale behavior 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.130
 now this monster is also small 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.440
 eat leftovers 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.010
 now this monster is also small 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.010
 eat 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.450
 Germany must be German, too 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.879
 writing in gibberish also does 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.469
 are the maintenance costs per day 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:56.820
 amount or 504,000 exactly 155 euro per 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:59.280
 day itself costs us 600 1500 euro 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.199
 Price is quite okay for what the thing 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.760
 can already really hammer watching us 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.350
 first of all a little bit 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.220
 the detail in detail to the sgm details 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.729
 share were processed here 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:19.049
 On it you can read halfway so that 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:21.600
 and with chips always with working 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.090
 after him such an industry for 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.299
 woodworking in England would 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.740
 Here are my beavers are the bamboo flute 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:35.009
 or always have it back here 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.350
 We chopped up the little shreds 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.470
 Rundumleuchte here is also from dot 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.470
 com 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.270
 here was on the other side too 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.270
 in the back we have a lumberjack on it 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:02:02.340
 I do not calm down left newspaper 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.890
 only the tracks have been correct in the past 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.360
 depeche mode ideas completely correct 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.970
 they each should it for themselves 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.490
 so cool is the whole log 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.860
 and all 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.240
 is invited up here you can 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.470
 Manually make a junk or one 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.000
 method I'll show you soon 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.220
 will 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.990
 then two of his witches are drumming the 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.130
 the stuff possible in nullkommanix 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.990
 chop that'll be you right now 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.330
 see and here but the ejection 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.790
 I'll get through to my own 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.310
 trecker we made responsible 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.840
 have exactly here is a method 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.920
 as this depended best-run 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.050
 this one needs this 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:44.370
 Working day is called the part but it 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.450
 annoys me once to see him 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.260
 well the scorpion king 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:52.050
 I'm coming to harvester now no matter 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.880
 ten times a bit a tree 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:03:00.600
 was quite manually the link many of us 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.600
 had once on 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:23.940
 then you have the tree the first time 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.940
 fall like that 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.769
 because first time and dad only be ca 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.989
 piece over the trailer so the 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:37.410
 cut length is now at 1 cm 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:41.580
 Carpet set or on a meter 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:51.569
 1 centimeter lcd tv back 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:52.860
 manu xxxx again you could too 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.599
 of course a little bigger branches 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.670
 but I have it now 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:59.209
 perceived as necessary because such a match 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.209
 a little bit more pure 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.610
 such a player snip veteran 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.959
 fast 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:09.480
 This technique is up and yet 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:12.420
 not perfect yet 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.860
 somehow faulted for it 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.930
 now not as it should come 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.430
 and especially the thing shows are because 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.000
 really even if you were in there 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.530
 he changes on my first love it 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.539
 here about a channel about the 15 children 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.550
 one where i also share such a witch 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:28.229
 I have imagined but he has everything 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.000
 other than a task that has done 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:31.260
 then afterward building however 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.810
 I think that was the meanwhile 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.510
 trailer was full of trailers is also 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:40.169
 be the same thing if fully follow 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:44.400
 hexel will change team so will the 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:47.330
 displacement and all one meter high 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.960
 already almost fully booked out these fans now 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.960
 my knowledge 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:59.230
 maybe get some first 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.600
 left expected whether it had in mind 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:02.500
 always wanted 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.420
 we can then also so there 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.550
 maybe the text of the so synonymous small 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.700
 so now slope forward the trek 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:08.700
 on 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:27.580
 we rise again from then we see 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:28.990
 here on b we can the next 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.550
 turn on and now fits that too 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.410
 boat just go damn fast 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.000
 Eighth we have to go to the trailer so 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.180
 where now the whole thing really fast 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.010
 is equal to just switch 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:44.400
 everything changes and zack is trailer 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.400
 as well as from the truck purely if this is so 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:51.880
 some pressure for this game as day 4 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.500
 98% full as well as follows 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.150
 and where are you ? 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.740
 fast on the trailer but me full 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.870
 have two trees now with me 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:03.130
 this part without problems normally 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:04.930
 would you make such a fabric from the 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.880
 original game or various mods 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.620
 there are already for that for now 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.810
 handling and frankly 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.610
 I think that makes small logs 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.900
 honestly that parts here really am 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.270
 best and with this technique i you 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.530
 showed in her aquarium today 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.440
 this technology works too 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.210
 once poor and easy to collect you can 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:27.190
 the whole forest a few minutes 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:30.130
 small part I just call it again 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:33.880
 crasher i like this murder 

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:35.890
 Really really recommend if now here 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.030
 times of school grades from 1 to 6 get 

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:41.200
 this murder clearly a 1 course 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.490
 there you are with these trees 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.940
 showing with the power saw can turn out 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:48.460
 those in front but there this first one 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.230
 does not like it so much but is 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.910
 no matter now this technique is not 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.280
 have applied or you just invite 

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:56.590
 Manually over these took the tree trunks 

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.730
 one can you make as you want 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.460
 everything works fine 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.990
 And yes, I can definitely 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.300
 I will only recommend him 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:06.180
 the benefit when it comes to 

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.729
 This is how wood chips are handled here 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.930
 works really 1a and yes I can 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:11.669
 just recommend 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.800
 I hope you liked the motto 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:14.280
 if yes then there is a thumb 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.229
 up 

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:18.419
 rather, it could also be an abo da 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:19.770
 would of course be nice and yes then until the 

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:23.479
 next motto view or until 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:23.479
 next video bye bye
