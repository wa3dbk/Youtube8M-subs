00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello my great friends on youtube today 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.770
 in day there is practically everything and 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.200
 becomes increasingly difficult to memorize 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.540
 all of course you can note in a 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.000
 notebook but is at great risk of 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.109
 someone find this notebook and steal the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.270
 your password 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.430
 I'm leandro felipe in this video I'm going 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.279
 show you how to hide your 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.619
 most secret information in one place 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:31.310
 that nobody will imagine that they can 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.310
 being there is just after the sticker goes 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.969
 and to carry out this project we will 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.239
 need a pencil that has a 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:46.059
 rubber at one of its ends 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.250
 with a fine piece of wire an 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.730
 the drill with a finer bit than the 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:55.180
 pencils and a few more things that you 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.530
 will see throughout this video gives only one 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.989
 look 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.909
 to start very carefully I'll go 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:05.890
 separate the eraser from the pencil and 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:10.470
 then I'll make a pencil hole with 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.470
 be careful not to damage it. 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.270
 If you are a child, do not forget to ask. 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.270
 help an adult 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:30.550
 and with a piece of cotton stuck in the 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.550
 tip of the wire I'll clean pure 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.000
 the next step will be to cut a 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.440
 bit of wire a little bigger than 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.440
 the pure done in acre 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.130
 right after I 'm going to cut a piece 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.130
 of paper a little smaller than the wire 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.880
 undertake the role of the wire using tape 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.880
 adhesive 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.599
 done, just write the information 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.599
 secrets on paper 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:23.810
 and finally roll the paper in the 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:27.250
 tight wire and put inside the 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.250
 hole made of pencil 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.920
 the rubber in place of the 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.920
 source
