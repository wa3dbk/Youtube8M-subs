bad<00:01:56.590> I<00:02:00.360> like<00:02:01.360> that<00:02:01.390> it's<00:02:01.720> a<00:02:01.810> no<00:02:01.990> one<00:02:02.230> has<00:02:02.560> the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
bad I like that it's a no one has the

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.950 
bad I like that it's a no one has the
newer<00:02:03.070> I<00:02:03.460> think<00:02:04.210> this<00:02:04.330> is<00:02:04.480> the<00:02:04.540> first<00:02:04.810> year

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
newer I think this is the first year

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.310 
newer I think this is the first year
they<00:02:05.290> put<00:02:05.530> in<00:02:05.650> this<00:02:05.770> newer<00:02:06.010> style<00:02:06.430> on<00:02:07.320> climate

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
they put in this newer style on climate

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.970 
they put in this newer style on climate
control<00:02:08.679> and<00:02:08.710> radio<00:02:10.320> little<00:02:11.320> stuff<00:02:11.560> but<00:02:11.860> you

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
control and radio little stuff but you

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:20.570 
control and radio little stuff but you
know<00:02:12.330> so<00:02:13.330> I<00:02:13.390> point<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.870> out<00:02:16.080> pretty<00:02:17.080> clean<00:02:18.450> I

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
know so I point that out pretty clean I

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.260 
know so I point that out pretty clean I
think<00:02:21.580> it'll<00:02:21.820> do<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.090> job<00:02:22.120> but<00:02:23.550> which<00:02:24.550> let's

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
think it'll do the job but which let's

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:49.770 
think it'll do the job but which let's
start<00:02:25.600> er<00:02:25.690> up

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.630 

it<00:02:50.780> runs<00:02:51.020> a<00:02:51.200> little<00:02:51.230> rough<00:02:51.890> but<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:52.310> think

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
it runs a little rough but I think

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.420 
it runs a little rough but I think
that's<00:02:52.790> because<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.510> owner<00:02:54.250> probably<00:02:55.250> never

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
that's because the owner probably never

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.010 
that's because the owner probably never
went<00:02:55.700> on<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.940> highway<00:02:56.360> and<00:02:56.540> this<00:02:56.690> carbon

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
went on the highway and this carbon

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.290 
went on the highway and this carbon
build<00:02:57.410> up<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:01.430> exhaust<00:03:01.670> isn't<00:03:02.120> anything

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
build up the exhaust isn't anything

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.130 
build up the exhaust isn't anything
fancy<00:03:02.990> but<00:03:03.020> I'll<00:03:04.450> give<00:03:05.450> you<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.630> little<00:03:05.720> sample

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
fancy but I'll give you a little sample

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:41.340 
fancy but I'll give you a little sample
anyway

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.230 

so

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
so

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.000 
so
this<00:03:43.840> is<00:03:43.990> what<00:03:44.170> I'll<00:03:44.290> be<00:03:44.410> driving<00:03:44.650> in<00:03:44.920> the

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
this is what I'll be driving in the

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.120 
this is what I'll be driving in the
winter<00:03:45.310> for<00:03:45.850> a<00:03:45.880> little<00:03:46.030> while<00:03:46.300> and<00:03:46.810> then<00:03:47.130> we'll

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
winter for a little while and then we'll

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.760 
winter for a little while and then we'll
see<00:03:48.340> if<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:48.550> like<00:03:48.700> it
