have<00:00:03.710> you<00:00:03.889> ever<00:00:04.100> wondered<00:00:04.600> what<00:00:05.859> UV<00:00:06.859> light<00:00:07.099> in

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:07.399 
have you ever wondered what UV light in

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.499 
have you ever wondered what UV light in
sunlight<00:00:07.880> does<00:00:08.300> to<00:00:08.990> cause<00:00:09.200> skin<00:00:09.710> cancer<00:00:10.509> what

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:11.509 
sunlight does to cause skin cancer what

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.009 
sunlight does to cause skin cancer what
the<00:00:11.809> UV<00:00:12.169> let<00:00:12.410> the<00:00:12.530> energy<00:00:12.709> in<00:00:13.040> the<00:00:13.160> UV<00:00:13.519> light

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:14.019 
the UV let the energy in the UV light

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.099 
the UV let the energy in the UV light

causes damage to the DNA what we

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.890 
causes damage to the DNA what we

skin cancer now we're going to look and

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.110 
skin cancer now we're going to look and
see<00:02:54.540> how<00:02:55.650> sunscreens<00:02:56.650> can<00:02:56.950> protect<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:57.790> from

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
see how sunscreens can protect you from

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.599 
see how sunscreens can protect you from
the<00:02:58.359> UV<00:02:58.689> light<00:02:58.900> in<00:02:59.079> the<00:02:59.200> Sun<00:02:59.439> these<00:03:00.189> little

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
exposed to UV light and you can see now

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.270 
exposed to UV light and you can see now
when<00:03:10.780> you're<00:03:10.930> inside<00:03:11.349> and<00:03:11.650> out<00:03:11.769> of<00:03:11.919> the<00:03:12.010> Sun

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
when you're inside and out of the Sun

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.780 
when you're inside and out of the Sun
they're<00:03:13.090> pretty<00:03:13.840> much<00:03:13.930> white<00:03:14.530> I<00:03:14.859> have<00:03:15.430> some

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
they're pretty much white I have some

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.899 
they're pretty much white I have some
that<00:03:16.150> I've<00:03:16.269> got<00:03:16.599> in<00:03:16.840> a<00:03:16.930> baggie<00:03:17.909> with

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:18.909 
that I've got in a baggie with

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.909 
that I've got in a baggie with
absolutely<00:03:19.419> no<00:03:19.690> sunscreen<00:03:20.139> in<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.709> baggie

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:20.919 
absolutely no sunscreen in the baggie

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:25.259 
absolutely no sunscreen in the baggie
and<00:03:21.250> then<00:03:22.150> I<00:03:22.180> have<00:03:22.599> some<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:24.430> i<00:03:24.489> have<00:03:24.970> in<00:03:25.209> a

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
and then I have some that i have in a

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.119 
and then I have some that i have in a
baggie<00:03:25.540> with<00:03:26.849> 50<00:03:27.849> SPF<00:03:28.290> sunscreen<00:03:29.290> in<00:03:29.799> it<00:03:29.829> you

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129 
baggie with 50 SPF sunscreen in it you

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.390 
baggie with 50 SPF sunscreen in it you
can<00:03:30.159> see<00:03:30.579> the<00:03:31.019> beads<00:03:32.019> floating<00:03:32.560> around<00:03:32.650> in<00:03:33.190> the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
can see the beads floating around in the

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.580 
can see the beads floating around in the
liquid<00:03:33.609> I<00:03:34.030> can't<00:03:34.810> just<00:03:34.989> spray<00:03:35.260> them<00:03:35.349> on<00:03:35.500> the

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
liquid I can't just spray them on the

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.740 
liquid I can't just spray them on the
beads<00:03:35.769> because<00:03:35.979> it<00:03:36.190> tends<00:03:36.370> to<00:03:36.519> fall<00:03:36.699> off<00:03:36.940> so<00:03:37.720> I

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
beads because it tends to fall off so I

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.409 
beads because it tends to fall off so I
have<00:03:37.989> them<00:03:38.169> sitting<00:03:38.440> in<00:03:38.620> this<00:03:38.769> little<00:03:39.150> sea<00:03:40.150> of

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
have them sitting in this little sea of

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.360 
have them sitting in this little sea of
sunscreen<00:03:41.109> I'm<00:03:41.680> going<00:03:41.799> to<00:03:41.859> take<00:03:42.069> them<00:03:42.220> outside

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
sunscreen I'm going to take them outside

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.020 
sunscreen I'm going to take them outside
in<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.510> Sun<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.159> we're<00:03:45.159> going<00:03:45.280> to<00:03:45.340> see<00:03:45.579> how

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
in the Sun and we're going to see how

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.750 
in the Sun and we're going to see how
well<00:03:46.419> this<00:03:46.840> sunscreen<00:03:47.290> protects<00:03:47.919> these<00:03:48.220> UV

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
well this sunscreen protects these UV

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.420 
well this sunscreen protects these UV
light<00:03:49.000> beads<00:03:49.329> from<00:03:50.139> the<00:03:50.229> UV<00:03:50.680> light<00:03:50.889> in<00:03:51.069> the<00:03:51.190> Sun

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
light beads from the UV light in the Sun

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.640 
light beads from the UV light in the Sun
and<00:03:51.729> compare<00:03:52.239> it<00:03:52.269> to<00:03:52.479> what<00:03:52.510> happens<00:03:53.049> to<00:03:53.500> the

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
and compare it to what happens to the

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.860 
and compare it to what happens to the
beads<00:03:53.949> that<00:03:54.250> don't<00:03:55.060> have<00:03:55.299> that<00:03:55.479> sunscreen

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
beads that don't have that sunscreen

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.360 
beads that don't have that sunscreen
protection<00:03:56.729> ok<00:03:58.139> so<00:03:59.139> I'm<00:03:59.260> going<00:03:59.590> to<00:03:59.650> put<00:03:59.739> the

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
protection ok so I'm going to put the

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.189 
protection ok so I'm going to put the
two<00:04:00.579> baggies<00:04:00.879> of<00:04:01.859> beads<00:04:02.859> on<00:04:03.340> these<00:04:03.760> plates<00:04:04.199> at

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:05.199 
two baggies of beads on these plates at

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:08.909 
two baggies of beads on these plates at
the<00:04:05.260> same<00:04:06.239> virtually<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.419> same<00:04:07.449> time<00:04:07.959> and

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
the same virtually the same time and

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.009 
the same virtually the same time and
we'll<00:04:09.069> compare<00:04:09.220> and<00:04:09.970> see<00:04:10.299> how<00:04:10.479> well<00:04:10.810> the

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
we'll compare and see how well the

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.790 
we'll compare and see how well the
sunscreen<00:04:11.560> protects

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
sunscreen protects

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:20.770

let's give it a few seconds and compared

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:41.020 
let's give it a few seconds and compared
to<00:04:33.890> see<00:04:34.070> how<00:04:34.220> long<00:04:38.680> again<00:04:39.680> you<00:04:40.280> see<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:40.670> UV
