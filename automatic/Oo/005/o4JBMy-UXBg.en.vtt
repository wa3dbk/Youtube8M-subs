and<00:00:59.370> what<00:00:59.879> you're<00:01:00.000> gonna<00:01:00.090> do<00:01:00.329> now<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:00.780> you're

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
and what you're gonna do now is you're

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.869 
and what you're gonna do now is you're
going<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.199> start<00:01:01.559> by<00:01:01.739> folding<00:01:02.100> your<00:01:02.399> paper<00:01:02.460> now

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
going to start by folding your paper now

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.200 
going to start by folding your paper now
if<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.180> want<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.559> want<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:04.979> use<00:01:05.250> a

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
if you want to and you want to use a

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.420 
if you want to and you want to use a
ruler<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.110> actually<00:01:07.409> divide<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.950> into<00:01:08.130> thirds

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
ruler and actually divide it into thirds

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.640 
ruler and actually divide it into thirds
you<00:01:09.000> can<00:01:09.270> but<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.630> gets<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.960> little<00:01:10.110> tricky

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
you can but that gets a little tricky

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.580 
you can but that gets a little tricky
because<00:01:10.740> 17<00:01:11.340> doesn't<00:01:11.700> divide<00:01:11.939> evenly<00:01:12.590> very

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
because 17 doesn't divide evenly very

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.200 
because 17 doesn't divide evenly very
nicely<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.159> what<00:01:14.310> I'm<00:01:14.400> gonna<00:01:14.549> tell<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.030> do

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
nicely so what I'm gonna tell you to do

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.929 
nicely so what I'm gonna tell you to do
is<00:01:15.420> take<00:01:15.930> your<00:01:16.049> paper<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.619> I'm<00:01:17.369> gonna<00:01:17.549> hold<00:01:17.759> it

the left hand over but I'm not gonna

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.850 
the left hand over but I'm not gonna
fold<00:01:24.360> them<00:01:24.630> yet<00:01:24.869> I'm<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.020> gonna<00:01:25.290> roll<00:01:25.560> them

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
fold them yet I'm just gonna roll them

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.830 
fold them yet I'm just gonna roll them
and<00:01:26.460> if<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.700> notice<00:01:27.090> here<00:01:27.450> here's<00:01:27.689> how

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
and if you notice here here's how

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.690 
and if you notice here here's how
they're<00:01:28.020> rolled<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.619> what<00:01:29.159> I'm<00:01:29.250> gonna<00:01:29.400> do<00:01:29.579> is

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
they're rolled and what I'm gonna do is

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.760 
they're rolled and what I'm gonna do is
I'm<00:01:29.820> gonna<00:01:29.939> just<00:01:30.150> kind<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.450> guess<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:31.619> not

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
I'm gonna just kind of guess it's not

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.800 
I'm gonna just kind of guess it's not
gonna<00:01:31.950> be<00:01:32.130> perfect<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:32.880> I'm<00:01:33.000> gonna<00:01:33.150> guess<00:01:33.390> I'm

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
gonna be perfect but I'm gonna guess I'm

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.490 
gonna be perfect but I'm gonna guess I'm
gonna<00:01:33.990> keep<00:01:34.200> those<00:01:34.500> so<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.250> piece<00:01:35.640> here

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
gonna keep those so that this piece here

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.870 
gonna keep those so that this piece here
points<00:01:37.500> up<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.860> edge<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.579> piece

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
points up to the edge and this piece

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.870 
points up to the edge and this piece
here<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.600> about<00:01:40.229> at<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.619> edge<00:01:40.770> there<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.400> so

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
here is about at the edge there and so

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.630 
here is about at the edge there and so
you<00:01:41.970> can<00:01:42.090> kind<00:01:42.299> of<00:01:42.420> see<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:44.100> rolled

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
you can kind of see that like rolled

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.420

you're gonna take that curve of the

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.439 
you're gonna take that curve of the
Japanese<00:05:07.439> bridge<00:05:07.770> and<00:05:08.039> curve<00:05:08.729> it<00:05:08.909> down<00:05:09.120> like

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
Japanese bridge and curve it down like

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:13.700

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
you're gonna put a parallel curved line

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.869 
you're gonna put a parallel curved line
there<00:05:22.229> and<00:05:22.529> so<00:05:22.979> I'm<00:05:23.069> just<00:05:23.250> gonna<00:05:23.340> start<00:05:23.669> here

that's gonna be like the handrail of the

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:33.290 
that's gonna be like the handrail of the
bridge<00:05:30.889> all<00:05:31.889> right<00:05:32.039> then

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
bridge all right then

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.149 
bridge all right then

you're gonna give yourself in two or

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:37.399 
you're gonna give yourself in two or
three<00:05:35.400> fingers<00:05:35.580> so<00:05:36.240> that<00:05:36.419> you're<00:05:36.539> just<00:05:36.990> above

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:37.409 
three fingers so that you're just above

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.339 
three fingers so that you're just above
that<00:05:37.830> middle<00:05:38.759> line<00:05:38.969> here<00:05:39.000> of<00:05:39.449> your<00:05:39.870> fold<00:05:40.139> and

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:40.349 
that middle line here of your fold and

00:05:40.349 --> 00:05:42.260 
that middle line here of your fold and
you're<00:05:40.800> gonna<00:05:40.889> do<00:05:41.129> a<00:05:41.159> parallel<00:05:41.789> line<00:05:42.000> you<00:05:42.150> want

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
you're gonna do a parallel line you want

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.700 
you're gonna do a parallel line you want
have<00:05:42.360> to<00:05:42.419> be<00:05:42.509> parallel<00:05:43.020> with<00:05:43.199> that<00:05:43.229> handrail

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710

have to be parallel with that handrail
this<00:05:43.919> is<00:05:44.069> the<00:05:44.190> part<00:05:44.460> of<00:05:44.550> the<00:05:44.639> bridge<00:05:44.849> where<00:05:45.330> you

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:45.419 
this is the part of the bridge where you

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.959 
this is the part of the bridge where you
would<00:05:45.539> actually<00:05:45.960> walk<00:05:46.259> upon<00:05:46.710> your<00:05:47.400> feet<00:05:47.729> would

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:47.969 
would actually walk upon your feet would

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:51.079 
would actually walk upon your feet would
like<00:05:48.240> tread<00:05:48.690> upon<00:05:48.900> that<00:05:49.349> part<00:05:49.650> and<00:05:49.889> so<00:05:50.580> here<00:05:50.969> is

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:51.089 
like tread upon that part and so here is

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:55.129 
like tread upon that part and so here is
my<00:05:52.279> curved<00:05:53.279> line<00:05:53.699> it's<00:05:53.909> pretty<00:05:54.449> parallel<00:05:54.810> not

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
my curved line it's pretty parallel not

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:57.589 
my curved line it's pretty parallel not
perfect<00:05:55.680> but<00:05:55.860> pretty<00:05:56.009> close<00:05:56.279> and<00:05:56.610> then<00:05:57.210> right

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:57.599 
perfect but pretty close and then right

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:00.350 
perfect but pretty close and then right
above<00:05:57.900> that<00:05:58.229> you're<00:05:58.949> gonna<00:05:59.039> do<00:05:59.279> another<00:05:59.490> line

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
above that you're gonna do another line

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.749 
above that you're gonna do another line
like<00:06:00.389> this

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:04.759 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:06.760 

so<00:06:05.360> we<00:06:05.479> have<00:06:05.599> our<00:06:05.749> two<00:06:05.930> curves<00:06:06.259> and<00:06:06.529> that's

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
so we have our two curves and that's

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.439 
so we have our two curves and that's
where<00:06:06.979> our<00:06:07.009> little<00:06:07.699> curves<00:06:07.939> are<00:06:08.150> gonna<00:06:08.300> be

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:08.449 
where our little curves are gonna be

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:12.179 
where our little curves are gonna be
then<00:06:09.550> we're<00:06:10.550> gonna<00:06:10.639> draw<00:06:10.999> in

00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:12.189 
then we're gonna draw in

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:15.850 
then we're gonna draw in
ever-so-slightly<00:06:13.189> just<00:06:13.909> these<00:06:14.860> banisters

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
ever-so-slightly just these banisters

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.589 
ever-so-slightly just these banisters
that<00:06:16.129> are<00:06:16.249> kind<00:06:16.490> of<00:06:16.580> like<00:06:16.819> holding<00:06:17.539> the

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 
that are kind of like holding the

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:20.769 
that are kind of like holding the
handrail<00:06:18.169> up<00:06:18.589> all<00:06:19.430> right<00:06:19.610> take<00:06:19.999> your<00:06:20.210> time<00:06:20.449> and

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:20.779 
handrail up all right take your time and

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:24.820 
handrail up all right take your time and
draw<00:06:21.469> at<00:06:21.949> least<00:06:22.430> four<00:06:23.059> if<00:06:23.449> not<00:06:23.719> five<00:06:24.020> and<00:06:24.289> those

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
draw at least four if not five and those

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.980 
draw at least four if not five and those
should<00:06:25.189> be<00:06:25.219> completely<00:06:25.819> vertical<00:06:26.419> there's

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
should be completely vertical there's

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.700 
should be completely vertical there's
one<00:06:27.319> it's<00:06:27.589> vertical<00:06:27.939> here's<00:06:28.939> another<00:06:29.210> one<00:06:29.919> two

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
one it's vertical here's another one two

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:39.219 
one it's vertical here's another one two
three<00:06:36.520> four<00:06:37.520> and<00:06:38.330> I'm<00:06:38.689> kind<00:06:38.899> of<00:06:38.960> trying<00:06:39.139> to

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:39.229 
three four and I'm kind of trying to

00:06:39.229 --> 00:06:42.820 
three four and I'm kind of trying to
evenly<00:06:39.559> space<00:06:39.919> these<00:06:40.509> five<00:06:41.509> so<00:06:42.379> there's<00:06:42.589> I

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
evenly space these five so there's I

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.040 
evenly space these five so there's I
have<00:06:43.039> five<00:06:43.370> on<00:06:43.580> that<00:06:43.789> one<00:06:44.029> whereas<00:06:44.659> on<00:06:44.839> my

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:45.050 
have five on that one whereas on my

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.589 
have five on that one whereas on my
original<00:06:45.439> painting<00:06:46.159> I<00:06:46.370> have<00:06:46.550> the<00:06:47.059> four<00:06:47.330> there

00:06:47.589 --> 00:06:47.599 
original painting I have the four there

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:52.029 
original painting I have the four there
okay<00:06:48.469> so<00:06:49.249> that<00:06:49.729> being<00:06:50.059> done<00:06:50.360> now<00:06:50.620> it's<00:06:51.620> really

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:52.039 
okay so that being done now it's really

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:55.889 
okay so that being done now it's really
hard<00:06:52.219> to<00:06:53.029> get<00:06:53.210> that<00:06:53.360> to<00:06:53.419> be<00:06:53.749> exactly<00:06:54.349> pair

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:55.899 
hard to get that to be exactly pair

00:06:55.899 --> 00:07:01.450 
hard to get that to be exactly pair
exactly<00:06:58.719> reflective<00:06:59.719> over<00:07:00.229> that<00:07:00.680> line

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:01.460 
exactly reflective over that line

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.969 
exactly reflective over that line
without<00:07:01.819> having<00:07:02.300> to<00:07:03.080> hold<00:07:03.229> it<00:07:03.469> up<00:07:03.589> into<00:07:03.860> the

00:07:03.969 --> 00:07:03.979 
without having to hold it up into the

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:06.639 
without having to hold it up into the
light<00:07:04.159> you<00:07:04.279> can<00:07:04.399> kind<00:07:04.580> of<00:07:04.669> see<00:07:05.499> through<00:07:06.499> my

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:06.649 
light you can kind of see through my

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:08.320 
light you can kind of see through my
paper<00:07:06.919> right<00:07:07.279> there<00:07:07.309> you<00:07:07.610> can<00:07:07.729> kind<00:07:07.939> of<00:07:07.999> see

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.330 
paper right there you can kind of see

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.329 
paper right there you can kind of see
the<00:07:08.990> lines<00:07:09.229> but<00:07:09.589> what<00:07:09.740> we're<00:07:09.889> gonna<00:07:09.979> do<00:07:10.219> is

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:10.339 
the lines but what we're gonna do is

00:07:10.339 --> 00:07:11.379 
the lines but what we're gonna do is
we're<00:07:10.459> actually<00:07:10.550> gonna<00:07:10.789> leave<00:07:11.089> that<00:07:11.120> there

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:11.389 
we're actually gonna leave that there

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:14.739 
we're actually gonna leave that there
and<00:07:11.870> when<00:07:12.349> we<00:07:12.499> start<00:07:12.770> painting<00:07:13.129> and<00:07:13.749> flipping

00:07:14.739 --> 00:07:14.749 
and when we start painting and flipping

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:16.269 
and when we start painting and flipping
it<00:07:14.899> down<00:07:15.080> we're<00:07:15.349> going<00:07:15.439> to<00:07:15.499> be<00:07:15.620> transferring

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:16.279 
it down we're going to be transferring

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:18.909 
it down we're going to be transferring
that<00:07:16.520> on<00:07:16.729> to<00:07:17.300> the<00:07:17.810> painting<00:07:18.229> so<00:07:18.409> for<00:07:18.680> today

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:18.919 
that on to the painting so for today

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:21.279 
that on to the painting so for today
that's<00:07:19.490> all<00:07:19.819> we're<00:07:20.060> gonna<00:07:20.180> draw<00:07:20.509> and<00:07:20.779> that's

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:21.289 
that's all we're gonna draw and that's

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:23.019 
that's all we're gonna draw and that's
where<00:07:21.770> we'll<00:07:21.949> leave<00:07:22.159> off<00:07:22.399> and<00:07:22.669> we'll<00:07:22.759> start

00:07:23.019 --> 00:07:23.029 
where we'll leave off and we'll start

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:26.800 
where we'll leave off and we'll start
our<00:07:23.180> painting<00:07:23.629> in<00:07:23.810> the<00:07:23.930> next<00:07:24.229> section
