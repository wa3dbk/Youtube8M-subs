 illusionist conjurer you 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.719
 show objects most of the time 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.739
 you'll notice it with a gesture all to 

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:02.739
 banal and everyday 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.950
 the gesture is not devoid of some 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.950
 sensuality not rich 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.900
 you did well to put yourself there 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.249
 and yet when you look at it more 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.450
 we can discover things 

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:18.719
 fun and that's what is 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.719

 many philosophical thinkers poets 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:27.480
 have addressed these issues of 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.000
 reality or illusion like for example the 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.889
 big lahou above lahoud this famous 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.710
 Chinese philosopher of the fourth century before 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.700
 Jesus Christ Tzu who says in himself 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:41.490
 waking up from a dream or summer butterfly 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:45.840
 am I a man who dreams to be a 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:48.050
 butterfly or a butterfly that dreams to be a 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.050
 man 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:58.250
 there is an atmosphere what about the other 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:01.020
 famous Chinese philosopher confucius 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.100

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.100

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.200

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.290
 pockets because when you have a little hard 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:48.290
