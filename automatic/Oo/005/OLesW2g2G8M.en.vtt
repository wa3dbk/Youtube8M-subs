 tucci says 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.180
 for that the Brazilian joÃ£o olavo souza rocked the net 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.220
 this simpler way has passed and that within the universe works the same sex 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.759
 was in 1920 by 1080 pixels 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.599
 the captured image but the cameras is very good with the same resolution as the 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.789
 kings on the river if you have a tv with full HD resolution will understand a lot 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.439
 well what I'm talking about is something that caught my eye on this new line cm 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.720
 is that the panasonic and nike village of the train system and six days already 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.300
 used ammunition to strive earnestly millions all promptly to 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.050
 difference naked eye the acronym is insignificant and memory other dwelling 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.210
 and Portuguese medium with reference to the fact of these cameras save images 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.109
 both in external memory they have sd cards and out of them in day with the 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:51.600
 payments larger than the back of my hand 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.400
 but still comfortable enough to wield I was distracted in almost 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.360
 completely in both directions 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.130
 the commands are all triggered with a touch on the screen I confess I do not like 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.800
 much of this besides being a bit uncomfortable in moments of pressure to 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.870
 making adjustments to beaded accounts ends up giving way and after that 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.990
 disrupts viewing of images during recording 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.570
 even young men have a good variety of connections and all are well protected 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.770
 for as many as these to be considered but unprofessional only 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.830
 lacked the same footage between organ harvesting 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.810
 by the way the camera has microphone with system 5 point just above average 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.080
 despite the fact that it has a noise suppression feature shot with the 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.080
 camera outside the car caused a lot of noise 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.430
 to shoot you can use the intelligent auto mode that was 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.750
 imported from wet photographic cameras or enter the module 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.450
 Power management adjust the white speed control and they up the body 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.710
 It will be a pity that despite our focus we need 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.930
 if this happens by touching the screen as in a logic would be more 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.930
 efficient 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.430
 a cool thing about my farm want to incorporate in front of the camcorder two 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.330
 units of light a continuous for the filming in another institution to 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.300
 This alias is a well-designed resource for improving 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.930
 dark as pm 20 suffers from strong high-image noise 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.219
 it works on both the battery and the battery outlet lasts two 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:27.669
 hours but if you turn on the light this time it drops a lot
