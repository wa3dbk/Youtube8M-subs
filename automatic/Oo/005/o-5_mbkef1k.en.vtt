00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
trailers are they really don't give

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.600 
trailers are they really don't give
anything<00:00:38.640> away<00:00:39.320> well<00:00:40.320> they<00:00:40.649> do<00:00:40.710> give<00:00:41.250> things

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
anything away well they do give things

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.420 
anything away well they do give things
away<00:00:41.790> I'll<00:00:42.090> say<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.360> much<00:00:42.690> but<00:00:43.280> you<00:00:44.280> know<00:00:44.370> I

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
away I'll say that much but you know I

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.310 
away I'll say that much but you know I
get<00:00:44.579> flashes<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.450> they<00:00:45.480> give<00:00:45.719> us<00:00:45.870> an<00:00:45.989> idea<00:00:46.050> of

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
get flashes and they give us an idea of

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.750 
get flashes and they give us an idea of
where<00:00:46.620> it's<00:00:46.800> going<00:00:47.190> at<00:00:47.309> least<00:00:47.430> for<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
where it's going at least for the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.910 
where it's going at least for the
earlier<00:00:48.300> part<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.110> season<00:00:50.270> so<00:00:51.270> i

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
earlier part of the season so i

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.869 
earlier part of the season so i
definitely<00:00:52.920> recommend<00:00:53.129> checking<00:00:53.460> out<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
definitely recommend checking out the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.950 
definitely recommend checking out the
trailer<00:00:54.090> before<00:00:54.390> watching<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.170> video<00:00:55.620> and

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
trailer before watching this video and

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.849 
trailer before watching this video and
you<00:00:57.960> know<00:00:58.050> we<00:00:58.170> see<00:00:58.350> things<00:00:58.590> like<00:01:00.559> we<00:01:01.559> see<00:01:01.739> all

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
you know we see things like we see all

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.070 
you know we see things like we see all
the<00:01:02.039> group<00:01:02.219> members<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.730> know<00:01:02.789> bound<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.480> or

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
the group members you know bound and or

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.800 
the group members you know bound and or
at<00:01:04.439> least<00:01:04.619> gagged<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.369> you<00:01:06.360> know<00:01:06.450> they're<00:01:06.659> all

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
at least gagged and you know they're all

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.690 
at least gagged and you know they're all
being<00:01:07.049> there<00:01:07.830> all<00:01:07.950> kneeling<00:01:08.250> down<00:01:08.369> from

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
being there all kneeling down from

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.950 
being there all kneeling down from
something<00:01:09.060> i'm<00:01:09.240> guessing<00:01:09.540> something<00:01:09.780> that's

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
something i'm guessing something that's

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.080 
something i'm guessing something that's
going<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.140> take<00:01:10.290> their<00:01:10.470> heads<00:01:10.710> off<00:01:11.090> or

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
going to take their heads off or

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.700 
going to take their heads off or
something<00:01:12.510> along<00:01:12.600> those<00:01:12.869> lines<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.439> could<00:01:13.619> be

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
something along those lines it could be

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.010 
something along those lines it could be
wrong<00:01:13.890> but<00:01:14.509> and<00:01:15.860> right<00:01:16.860> there<00:01:17.070> it<00:01:17.189> looks<00:01:17.340> like

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
wrong but and right there it looks like

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.630 
wrong but and right there it looks like
or<00:01:19.020> very<00:01:19.290> early<00:01:19.409> prediction<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.250> think<00:01:20.460> Bob's

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
or very early prediction I think Bob's

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.179 
or very early prediction I think Bob's
probably<00:01:21.180> going<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.390> die<00:01:21.920> within<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.070> first

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
probably going to die within the first

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.210 
probably going to die within the first
episode<00:01:24.200> because<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.500> haven't<00:01:25.680> all<00:01:25.830> lined<00:01:26.070> up

gotta<00:01:37.799> take<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.070> or<00:01:38.369> something<00:01:38.670> like<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.850> you

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
gotta take it or something like that you

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.010 
gotta take it or something like that you
know<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.829> I<00:01:40.829> need<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.280> see<00:01:41.490> a<00:01:41.520> flash<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.479> you

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
know and I need to see a flash of you

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.749 
know and I need to see a flash of you
know<00:01:43.110> Gareth<00:01:43.439> looking<00:01:43.710> at<00:01:43.799> Rick<00:01:44.040> because<00:01:44.579> they

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
know Gareth looking at Rick because they

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.639 
know Gareth looking at Rick because they
use<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.119> hands<00:01:45.540> on<00:01:45.659> Bob<00:01:45.869> or<00:01:46.200> something<00:01:46.530> like

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
use like hands on Bob or something like

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.710 
use like hands on Bob or something like
that<00:01:46.820> so<00:01:47.820> yeah<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.000> think<00:01:48.060> that's<00:01:48.420> probably

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
that so yeah I think that's probably

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.530 
that so yeah I think that's probably
going<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.020> die<00:01:49.110> pretty<00:01:49.829> quickly<00:01:50.540> early

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
going to die pretty quickly early

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.120 
going to die pretty quickly early
prediction<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.049> don't<00:01:52.259> know<00:01:52.350> for<00:01:52.500> sure<00:01:52.560> but<00:01:53.009> it

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
prediction I don't know for sure but it
