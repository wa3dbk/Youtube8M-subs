okay<00:00:04.049> now<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:05.250> amiga<00:00:05.790> emulator<00:00:06.120> already<00:00:06.690> got

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
okay now the amiga emulator already got

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.259 
okay now the amiga emulator already got
some<00:00:07.140> nice<00:00:07.410> gaming<00:00:07.740> settings<00:00:08.250> for<00:00:09.240> example

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
some nice gaming settings for example

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.430 
some nice gaming settings for example
this<00:00:09.929> here<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.290> Tarkin<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:11.750> scale<00:00:12.750> basically

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
this here is Tarkin to scale basically

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.390 
this here is Tarkin to scale basically
with<00:00:14.429> correct<00:00:14.849> aspect<00:00:15.000> ratio<00:00:15.920> to<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:16.949> whole

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
with correct aspect ratio to a whole

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.390 
with correct aspect ratio to a whole
screen<00:00:18.830> at<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.070> Pandora<00:00:20.490> as<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.939> can<00:00:21.150> see

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 
screen at the Pandora as you can see

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:31.690 
screen at the Pandora as you can see
smooth<00:00:23.400> nice<00:00:25.849> playing<00:00:26.849> really<00:00:27.269> cool

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.660 

another<00:00:32.700> nice<00:00:32.940> filter<00:00:33.270> the<00:00:34.170> new<00:00:34.440> emulator<00:00:35.040> has

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
another nice filter the new emulator has

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.139 
another nice filter the new emulator has
here

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
here

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:43.520 
here
yes<00:00:39.170> scanlines<00:00:41.450> so<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.690> looks<00:00:42.870> similar<00:00:43.079> to

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
yes scanlines so it looks similar to

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.220 
yes scanlines so it looks similar to
your<00:00:44.129> old<00:00:44.520> Amiga<00:00:45.000> screen<00:00:45.329> or<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.440> TV<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:48.230> hope

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
your old Amiga screen or to a TV I hope

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.470 
your old Amiga screen or to a TV I hope
you<00:00:49.350> can<00:00:49.559> actually<00:00:49.800> see<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.489> but<00:00:50.850> I'm<00:00:51.239> sure

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
you can actually see this but I'm sure

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.229 
you can actually see this but I'm sure
you<00:00:51.600> have<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.930> switch<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.399> HDTV<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.699> won't<00:00:53.940> see

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
you have to switch to HDTV you won't see

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.380 
you have to switch to HDTV you won't see
that<00:00:54.530> video<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.890> scan<00:00:56.850> lines<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
that video in the scan lines in the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:13.190 
that video in the scan lines in the
normal<00:00:57.660> resolutions<00:00:58.289> at<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.500> video

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.150 

okay<00:01:14.200> another<00:01:14.470> nice<00:01:14.710> example<00:01:14.740> of<00:01:15.400> what

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
okay another nice example of what

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.660 
okay another nice example of what
hardware<00:01:18.160> filtering<00:01:18.640> is<00:01:18.790> useful<00:01:19.210> for<00:01:20.550> if<00:01:21.550> you

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
hardware filtering is useful for if you

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.820 
hardware filtering is useful for if you
take<00:01:21.880> a<00:01:21.910> look<00:01:22.210> at<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.480> left<00:01:22.660> ramp<00:01:23.050> they'd

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
take a look at the left ramp they'd

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.030 
take a look at the left ramp they'd
always<00:01:24.040> click<00:01:24.430> as<00:01:24.580> Y<00:01:24.760> scrolling<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:26.830> is

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
always click as Y scrolling this is

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.740 
always click as Y scrolling this is
because<00:01:29.160> this<00:01:30.160> game<00:01:30.670> uses<00:01:31.120> a<00:01:31.240> check<00:01:31.510> a<00:01:31.540> box

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
because this game uses a check a box

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.610 
because this game uses a check a box
effect<00:01:32.230> and<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:34.150> checker<00:01:34.420> box<00:01:34.660> effect<00:01:35.140> on<00:01:35.560> a

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
effect and the checker box effect on a

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:42.870 
effect and the checker box effect on a
Glary<00:01:37.770> TV<00:01:39.240> looked<00:01:40.240> okay<00:01:40.660> but<00:01:41.620> on<00:01:41.860> LCDs<00:01:42.580> it

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
Glary TV looked okay but on LCDs it

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.110 
Glary TV looked okay but on LCDs it
leads<00:01:43.090> to<00:01:43.210> flickering<00:01:43.810> as<00:01:43.960> you<00:01:44.080> can<00:01:44.290> see<00:01:44.560> here

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:48.120 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.080 

okay<00:01:49.120> now<00:01:49.360> watch<00:01:49.630> this<00:01:49.960> this<00:01:50.890> is<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.340> same

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
okay now watch this this is the same

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:00.830 
okay now watch this this is the same
emulator<00:01:53.910> it's<00:01:54.910> the<00:01:55.210> same<00:01:55.800> LCD<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.810> same<00:01:59.110> game

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
emulator it's the same LCD the same game

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.130 
emulator it's the same LCD the same game
but<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.050> flickering<00:02:02.590> is<00:02:03.040> gone<00:02:03.720> since<00:02:04.720> the

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
but the flickering is gone since the

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.350 
but the flickering is gone since the
filter<00:02:05.860> simulates<00:02:07.560> basically<00:02:08.560> a<00:02:08.590> TV<00:02:09.010> screen

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
filter simulates basically a TV screen

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.970 
filter simulates basically a TV screen
or<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.630> old<00:02:10.869> monitor<00:02:11.290> screen<00:02:11.590> which<00:02:11.739> was<00:02:11.920> a

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
or the old monitor screen which was a

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.759 
or the old monitor screen which was a
bit<00:02:12.220> blurry<00:02:12.489> and<00:02:13.180> therefore<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.290> left<00:02:14.470> Ram

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
bit blurry and therefore the left Ram

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.430 
bit blurry and therefore the left Ram
now<00:02:15.130> looks<00:02:15.459> like<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.760> chip<00:02:16.060> like<00:02:16.269> a<00:02:16.570> bit

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
now looks like a chip like a bit

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.430 
now looks like a chip like a bit
transparent<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:19.390> don't<00:02:19.600> really<00:02:19.840> notice<00:02:20.140> the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
transparent you don't really notice the

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.130 
transparent you don't really notice the
checker<00:02:20.680> box<00:02:20.920> attack<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.750> that's<00:02:22.750> how<00:02:22.989> it

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
checker box attack and that's how it

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.320 
checker box attack and that's how it
should<00:02:23.170> be<00:02:23.380> in<00:02:23.590> how<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:23.920> was<00:02:24.190> on<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.550> automaker

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
should be in how it was on the automaker

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.790 
should be in how it was on the automaker
screens<00:02:25.660> -<00:02:27.900> they<00:02:28.900> used<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.260> check<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.560> box

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
screens - they used to check a box

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.949 
screens - they used to check a box
effect<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.550> simulate<00:02:31.110> transparency<00:02:32.110> oh<00:02:33.959> that

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
effect to simulate transparency oh that

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.040 
effect to simulate transparency oh that
works<00:02:35.320> pretty<00:02:35.650> well<00:02:35.880> just<00:02:36.880> because<00:02:37.269> of<00:02:37.450> that

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
works pretty well just because of that

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.710 
works pretty well just because of that
nice<00:02:38.290> filtering<00:02:39.000> so<00:02:40.000> this<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.300> just<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.570> quick

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
nice filtering so this is just a quick

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.810 
nice filtering so this is just a quick
overview<00:02:41.050> of<00:02:42.390> first<00:02:43.800> the<00:02:44.800> first<00:02:45.010> filters<00:02:45.550> here

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
overview of first the first filters here

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.199 
overview of first the first filters here
included<00:02:46.739> there's<00:02:47.739> a<00:02:47.860> lot<00:02:48.010> more<00:02:48.310> possible

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
included there's a lot more possible

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.199 
included there's a lot more possible
with<00:02:49.420> Hardware<00:02:49.840> pilgrims<00:02:50.610> but<00:02:51.610> I<00:02:51.670> think<00:02:52.090> on

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
with Hardware pilgrims but I think on

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.050 
with Hardware pilgrims but I think on
the<00:02:52.360> Amiga<00:02:52.750> me<00:02:52.900> later<00:02:53.080> you<00:02:53.170> can<00:02:53.470> see<00:02:53.769> pretty<00:02:54.190> go

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
the Amiga me later you can see pretty go

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.720 
the Amiga me later you can see pretty go
why<00:02:55.959> they<00:02:56.170> are<00:02:56.320> useful<00:02:56.800> you<00:02:57.100> can<00:02:57.250> spare<00:02:57.580> the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
why they are useful you can spare the

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.400 
why they are useful you can spare the
full<00:02:57.940> screen<00:02:58.330> you<00:02:58.360> can<00:02:58.660> make<00:02:58.840> it<00:02:58.959> look<00:02:59.110> like<00:02:59.290> on

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
full screen you can make it look like on

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.440 
full screen you can make it look like on
the<00:02:59.500> TV<00:02:59.709> and<00:03:00.430> well<00:03:01.269> as<00:03:02.200> you<00:03:02.350> can<00:03:02.530> see<00:03:03.090> games<00:03:04.090> run

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
the TV and well as you can see games run

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:07.920 
the TV and well as you can see games run
pretty<00:03:04.989> well<00:03:05.320> spot-on
