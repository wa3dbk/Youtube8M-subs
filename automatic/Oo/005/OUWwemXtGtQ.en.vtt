okay so I'm gonna guide you step by step
and<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.570> easiest<00:00:09.809> way<00:00:10.110> to<00:00:10.950> master<00:00:11.639> this

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
and the easiest way to master this

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.350 
and the easiest way to master this
tutorial<00:00:12.920> so<00:00:13.920> before<00:00:14.219> you<00:00:14.280> start<00:00:14.340> what<00:00:15.269> you

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
tutorial so before you start what you

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.240 
tutorial so before you start what you
need<00:00:15.540> is<00:00:15.750> a<00:00:16.080> pencil<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.970> paper<00:00:18.109> an<00:00:19.109> eraser<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.859> a

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
need is a pencil a paper an eraser and a

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.859 
need is a pencil a paper an eraser and a
ruler<00:00:20.670> okay<00:00:21.380> so<00:00:22.380> now<00:00:22.970> every<00:00:23.970> time<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.300> start

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
ruler okay so now every time you start

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.589 
ruler okay so now every time you start
drawing<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.230> one-point<00:00:25.650> perspective<00:00:26.449> you<00:00:27.449> need

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
drawing a one-point perspective you need

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.859 
drawing a one-point perspective you need
to<00:00:27.689> always<00:00:27.779> start<00:00:28.199> with<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:29.779> horizontal<00:00:30.779> line

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
to always start with a horizontal line

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.910 
to always start with a horizontal line
okay<00:00:31.199> and<00:00:32.570> this<00:00:33.570> horizontal<00:00:34.170> line<00:00:34.200> represent

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
okay and this horizontal line represent

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.869 
okay and this horizontal line represent
our<00:00:35.309> eye<00:00:35.579> level<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:37.280> if<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.430> draw<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> horizontal

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
our eye level so if I draw a horizontal

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.529 
our eye level so if I draw a horizontal
line<00:00:42.620> so<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.800> our<00:00:43.950> horizontal<00:00:44.250> line<00:00:44.610> and

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
line so this our horizontal line and

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.590 
line so this our horizontal line and
every<00:00:46.200> horizontal<00:00:46.440> line<00:00:46.770> there's<00:00:47.070> a

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
every horizontal line there's a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.580 
every horizontal line there's a
vanishing<00:00:48.600> point<00:00:50.840> so<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:51.870> put<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> vanishing

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
vanishing point so I put a vanishing

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.410 
vanishing point so I put a vanishing
point<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.920> middle<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.640> it's<00:00:53.969> easier<00:00:54.390> for

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
point in the middle so it's easier for

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.119 
point in the middle so it's easier for
you<00:00:54.750> guys<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.989> understand<00:00:55.379> for<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:55.680> tutorial

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
you guys to understand for this tutorial

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.860 
you guys to understand for this tutorial
and<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:57.360> would<00:00:57.480> now<00:00:57.719> talk<00:00:58.079> more<00:00:58.350> about<00:00:58.410> this

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
and I would now talk more about this

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.000 
and I would now talk more about this
horizontal<00:01:00.870> line<00:01:01.020> or<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.530> eye<00:01:01.559> level

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
horizontal line or the eye level

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.759 
horizontal line or the eye level
so<00:01:02.820> a<00:01:02.850> lot<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.270> where<00:01:03.719> our<00:01:03.750> eyes<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.379> looking

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
so a lot is where our eyes is looking

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.350 
so a lot is where our eyes is looking
okay<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:05.790> for<00:01:06.479> example<00:01:06.510> if<00:01:07.049> you're<00:01:07.290> looking

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
okay so for example if you're looking

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.740 
okay so for example if you're looking
something<00:01:10.040> higher<00:01:11.040> than<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.510> that<00:01:12.510> means

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
something higher than you that means

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.990 
something higher than you that means
your<00:01:13.140> olive<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.560> low<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.580> if<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.729> look<00:01:14.880> in

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
your olive is low so if you look in

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.899 
your olive is low so if you look in
something<00:01:15.390> lower<00:01:15.600> than<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:16.490> that<00:01:17.490> means<00:01:17.759> your

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
something lower than you that means your

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.300 
something lower than you that means your
high<00:01:18.060> level<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.479> high<00:01:19.020> level<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.409> high<00:01:19.619> okay<00:01:20.250> so

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
high level is high level is high okay so

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.760 
high level is high level is high okay so
this<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:22.110> easiest<00:01:22.860> way<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.040> explain<00:01:24.770> and

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
this is the easiest way to explain and

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.289 
this is the easiest way to explain and
now<00:01:26.009> for<00:01:26.189> this<00:01:26.340> story<00:01:26.580> let's<00:01:26.759> say<00:01:27.090> we're

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
now for this story let's say we're

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.429 
now for this story let's say we're
looking<00:01:27.420> at<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.720> hallway

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
looking at a hallway

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.350 
looking at a hallway
so<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.610> hallway<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:30.119> got<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.479> can<00:01:30.509> see<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:32.360> door

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
so in a hallway we got we can see a door

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.760 
so in a hallway we got we can see a door
or<00:01:33.600> wall<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.229> front<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.500> us<00:01:35.750> so<00:01:36.750> now<00:01:37.110> we're

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:13.770 
wall so please make sure that you just
you<00:03:12.519> don't<00:03:12.849> just<00:03:13.150> draw<00:03:13.359> the<00:03:13.419> wall<00:03:13.659> like

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
you don't just draw the wall like

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.220 
you don't just draw the wall like
anywhere<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:14.650> want<00:03:15.419> because<00:03:16.419> we<00:03:16.959> need<00:03:17.109> to

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
anywhere you want because we need to

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.819 
anywhere you want because we need to
draw<00:03:17.379> the<00:03:17.439> wall<00:03:17.739> from<00:03:18.699> this<00:03:18.909> vanishing<00:03:19.329> point

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
draw the wall from this vanishing point

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.159 
draw the wall from this vanishing point
so<00:03:20.829> put<00:03:21.250> your<00:03:21.400> ruler<00:03:22.060> according<00:03:23.019> to<00:03:23.109> the

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:23.169 
so put your ruler according to the

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.039 
so put your ruler according to the
vanishing<00:03:23.379> point<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:24.389> to<00:03:25.389> the<00:03:25.510> south<00:03:25.719> the<00:03:25.840> war

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
vanishing point and to the south the war

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.170 
vanishing point and to the south the war
and<00:03:26.349> start<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.099> draw<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.340> line<00:03:27.639> from<00:03:27.849> the

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
and start to draw the line from the

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.030 
and start to draw the line from the
vanishing<00:03:28.540> point<00:03:29.819> so<00:03:30.819> this<00:03:31.000> is<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.239> wall<00:03:31.419> okay

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
vanishing point so this is the wall okay

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.129 
vanishing point so this is the wall okay
we<00:03:33.040> do<00:03:33.219> the<00:03:33.340> same<00:03:33.519> thing<00:03:33.760> for<00:03:34.389> the<00:03:34.650> below<00:03:35.650> part

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
we do the same thing for the below part

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:41.990 
we do the same thing for the below part
some<00:03:38.139> vanishing<00:03:38.530> point<00:03:38.769> to<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.129> wall<00:03:40.590> cool

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
some vanishing point to the wall cool

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.599 
some vanishing point to the wall cool
now<00:03:43.259> for<00:03:44.259> the<00:03:44.379> app<00:03:44.500> on<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:44.919> other<00:03:45.009> side<00:03:45.280> we<00:03:45.489> do

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
now for the app on the other side we do

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:53.520 
now for the app on the other side we do
a<00:03:45.639> same<00:03:45.879> thing<00:03:46.060> also<00:03:47.909> here<00:03:52.079> okay<00:03:53.079> now<00:03:53.409> we<00:03:53.470> have

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
a same thing also here okay now we have

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.240 
a same thing also here okay now we have
a<00:03:53.620> wall<00:03:54.419> so<00:03:55.419> now<00:03:56.139> maybe<00:03:56.319> say<00:03:56.620> yeah<00:03:56.829> it's<00:03:57.099> so

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
a wall so now maybe say yeah it's so

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.429 
a wall so now maybe say yeah it's so
plain<00:03:57.549> I<00:03:57.729> want<00:03:57.909> to<00:03:58.000> put<00:03:58.269> some<00:03:58.389> detail<00:03:58.750> okay<00:03:59.259> we

00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 
plain I want to put some detail okay we

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:02.189 
plain I want to put some detail okay we
can<00:03:59.560> put<00:03:59.739> a<00:03:59.769> door<00:04:00.009> here<00:04:00.629> now<00:04:01.629> here's<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:01.959> tips

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:02.199 
can put a door here now here's the tips

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:06.990 
can put a door here now here's the tips
okay<00:04:03.930> if<00:04:04.930> you<00:04:05.079> draw<00:04:05.530> a<00:04:05.560> door<00:04:05.949> you're<00:04:06.939> gonna

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
okay if you draw a door you're gonna

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.170 
okay if you draw a door you're gonna
start<00:04:07.359> with<00:04:07.449> a<00:04:07.479> straight<00:04:07.689> line<00:04:07.900> a<00:04:09.180> straight

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
start with a straight line a straight

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.199 
start with a straight line a straight
line<00:04:10.689> and<00:04:11.430> all<00:04:12.430> you<00:04:12.519> have<00:04:12.639> to<00:04:12.759> do<00:04:12.849> is<00:04:12.909> remember

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
line and all you have to do is remember

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.420 
line and all you have to do is remember
when<00:04:13.509> you<00:04:13.599> draw<00:04:13.810> draw<00:04:14.079> you<00:04:14.799> must<00:04:15.009> be<00:04:15.129> another

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
when you draw draw you must be another

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.560 
when you draw draw you must be another
line<00:04:15.699> or<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:17.109> second<00:04:17.530> door<00:04:17.709> so<00:04:18.489> you<00:04:19.209> just<00:04:19.389> draw

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
line or the second door so you just draw

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.629 
line or the second door so you just draw
a<00:04:19.599> parallel<00:04:20.019> line<00:04:20.049> from<00:04:20.769> this<00:04:20.949> line<00:04:21.159> to<00:04:21.340> here

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:21.639 
a parallel line from this line to here

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.110 
a parallel line from this line to here
ok<00:04:21.940> as<00:04:22.150> long<00:04:22.210> as<00:04:22.419> parallel<00:04:23.520> so<00:04:24.520> we<00:04:24.699> do<00:04:24.849> another

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
ok as long as parallel so we do another

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.330 
ok as long as parallel so we do another
straight<00:04:25.300> line<00:04:25.449> I'm<00:04:25.719> gonna<00:04:25.930> stop<00:04:26.199> until<00:04:27.070> this

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
straight line I'm gonna stop until this

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.320 
straight line I'm gonna stop until this
line<00:04:27.960> so<00:04:28.960> this<00:04:29.080> line<00:04:29.259> we<00:04:29.349> stopped<00:04:29.560> until<00:04:29.800> here

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
line so this line we stopped until here

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.260 
line so this line we stopped until here
okay<00:04:31.330> so<00:04:31.360> now<00:04:31.780> we<00:04:31.840> say<00:04:32.050> yeah<00:04:32.289> I<00:04:33.219> stopped<00:04:34.060> here

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
okay so now we say yeah I stopped here

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.800 
okay so now we say yeah I stopped here
but<00:04:34.449> what<00:04:34.810> about<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.139> top<00:04:35.349> of<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.650> door<00:04:36.810> now

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
but what about the top of the door now

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.709 
but what about the top of the door now
grab<00:04:38.680> your<00:04:38.800> ruler<00:04:39.159> again<00:04:39.610> and<00:04:39.849> start<00:04:40.719> to<00:04:42.719> draw

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:43.719 
grab your ruler again and start to draw

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:44.629 
grab your ruler again and start to draw
the

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
the

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.850 
the
of<00:04:44.819> the<00:04:45.030> door<00:04:45.270> with<00:04:45.719> this<00:04:45.960> from<00:04:46.770> this

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
of the door with this from this

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.659 
of the door with this from this
vanishing<00:04:47.280> point<00:04:48.919> so<00:04:49.919> now<00:04:50.099> let's<00:04:50.310> start<00:04:52.669> and

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
vanishing point so now let's start and

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:54.290 
vanishing point so now let's start and
there<00:04:53.909> you<00:04:53.969> go

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
there you go

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:59.689 
there you go
you<00:04:54.509> gotta<00:04:54.689> top<00:04:54.900> of<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.050> door<00:04:56.360> and<00:04:58.430> then<00:04:59.430> I<00:04:59.490> say

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
you gotta top of the door and then I say

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.640 
you gotta top of the door and then I say
yeah<00:04:59.909> for<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.449> I<00:05:00.810> just<00:05:01.110> I<00:05:01.169> want<00:05:01.349> to<00:05:01.379> put<00:05:01.620> a

now for the below part great wall game
and<00:05:49.289> start<00:05:50.190> to<00:05:52.669> drag<00:05:53.669> the<00:05:53.909> line<00:05:54.089> from<00:05:54.990> the

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
and start to drag the line from the

00:05:55.139 --> 00:06:03.019 
and start to drag the line from the
vanishing<00:05:55.349> point<00:05:55.770> and<00:06:01.279> there<00:06:02.279> you<00:06:02.370> go<00:06:02.520> you've

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:03.029 
vanishing point and there you go you've

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.570 
vanishing point and there you go you've
got<00:06:03.180> another<00:06:03.330> line<00:06:03.650> so<00:06:04.650> now<00:06:04.830> put<00:06:05.430> a<00:06:05.490> handle

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580 
got another line so now put a handle

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:11.570 
got another line so now put a handle
here<00:06:07.250> okay<00:06:09.349> if<00:06:10.349> you<00:06:10.469> want<00:06:10.710> a<00:06:10.800> handle<00:06:11.129> to<00:06:11.279> be<00:06:11.310> the

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
here okay if you want a handle to be the

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.570 
here okay if you want a handle to be the
longer<00:06:12.389> one<00:06:12.889> do<00:06:13.889> the<00:06:14.039> same<00:06:14.189> thing<00:06:14.430> the

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
longer one do the same thing the

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.249 
longer one do the same thing the
perspective<00:06:15.060> is<00:06:15.180> you<00:06:15.270> will<00:06:15.569> also<00:06:15.810> need<00:06:16.139> to

00:06:16.249 --> 00:06:16.259 
perspective is you will also need to

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:20.300 
perspective is you will also need to
drag<00:06:16.560> from<00:06:17.180> the<00:06:18.180> vanishing<00:06:18.569> point<00:06:19.069> so<00:06:20.069> there

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:20.310 
drag from the vanishing point so there

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.209 
drag from the vanishing point so there
you<00:06:20.370> go<00:06:20.460> I<00:06:20.610> got<00:06:20.759> a<00:06:20.819> handle<00:06:21.150> so<00:06:22.009> another<00:06:23.009> the

you go I got a handle so another the
whole<00:06:23.400> door<00:06:23.669> looks<00:06:23.909> more<00:06:24.240> 3d<00:06:24.719> more
