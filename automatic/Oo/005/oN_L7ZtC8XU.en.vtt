I just don't know how to do the question

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.770 
I just don't know how to do the question
aye<00:01:17.700> sir<00:01:17.970> minus<00:01:18.450> the<00:01:18.750> square<00:01:19.080> root<00:01:19.700> of<00:01:20.700> C

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.870 

okay<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:25.740> why<00:01:25.890> would<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.159> mean<00:01:26.400> math<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.729> get<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
okay but why would I mean math to get a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.980 
okay but why would I mean math to get a
business<00:01:27.180> degree<00:01:27.210> like<00:01:27.570> what<00:01:27.690> does<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.840> have
