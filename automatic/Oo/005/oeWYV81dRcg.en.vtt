00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
different videos so I'm not really sure

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.580 
different videos so I'm not really sure
who<00:00:17.609> to<00:00:17.640> credit<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.150> with<00:00:18.359> for<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.140> channels

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
who to credit this with for the channels

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.000 
who to credit this with for the channels
but<00:00:19.830> anyway<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:21.359> just<00:00:21.930> did<00:00:22.199> I<00:00:22.439> looked<00:00:22.890> at

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
but anyway so I just did I looked at

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.410 
but anyway so I just did I looked at
their<00:00:23.189> their<00:00:23.550> design<00:00:23.850> and<00:00:24.029> went<00:00:24.180> with<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.330> I

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
their their design and went with it I

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.740 
their their design and went with it I
had<00:00:24.570> an<00:00:24.720> ammo<00:00:25.019> box<00:00:26.180> I'm<00:00:27.180> not<00:00:27.330> sure<00:00:27.390> which

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
had an ammo box I'm not sure which

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.810 
had an ammo box I'm not sure which
caliber<00:00:28.170> ammo<00:00:28.320> box<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.830> was<00:00:29.039> but<00:00:29.279> anyway<00:00:29.640> I

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
caliber ammo box this was but anyway I

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.030 
caliber ammo box this was but anyway I
cut<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.330> bottom<00:00:30.630> off<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.929> ammo<00:00:31.080> box<00:00:31.380> because

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
cut the bottom off the ammo box because

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.100 
cut the bottom off the ammo box because
then<00:00:32.250> you<00:00:32.340> have<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.700> flip<00:00:33.540> lid<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.079> a

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
then you have the flip lid this is a

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.069 
then you have the flip lid this is a
hinge<00:00:34.440> here<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.850> will<00:00:36.059> actually<00:00:36.239> you

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
hinge here so this will actually you

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.360 
hinge here so this will actually you
know<00:00:37.140> any<00:00:37.230> pop<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.829> falls<00:00:38.040> down<00:00:38.190> I

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
know any pop it and it falls down I

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.010 
know any pop it and it falls down I
drilled<00:00:38.790> some<00:00:38.879> holes<00:00:38.969> around<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.480> sides<00:00:39.780> of

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
drilled some holes around the sides of

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.060 
drilled some holes around the sides of
it<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.890> water<00:00:41.129> comes<00:00:41.430> out<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.950> you<00:00:43.950> know

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
it so the water comes out and you know

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.560 
it so the water comes out and you know
you've<00:00:44.280> seen<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.520> briquettes<00:00:44.969> being<00:00:45.270> pressed

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
you've seen the briquettes being pressed

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.630 
you've seen the briquettes being pressed
already<00:00:45.960> by<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.200> other<00:00:46.590> guy<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.070> this<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.430> my

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
already by the other guy but this is my

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.520 
already by the other guy but this is my
end<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.270> it<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.539> same<00:00:48.809> principle<00:00:49.050> I'm<00:00:49.410> not

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
end of it the same principle I'm not

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:50.630 
end of it the same principle I'm not
going<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.739> put<00:00:49.860> any<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.190> at<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> moment

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
going to put any in at the moment

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.250 
going to put any in at the moment
because<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.000> don't<00:00:51.149> have<00:00:51.239> any<00:00:51.390> paper<00:00:51.629> made<00:00:52.079> up

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
because I don't have any paper made up

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.410 
because I don't have any paper made up
but<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.070> did<00:00:53.370> want<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.670> show<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.940> here<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.360> I'll

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
metal press and you can see that it's a

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.050 
metal press and you can see that it's a
relatively<00:01:05.970> thin<00:01:06.360> very<00:01:07.140> large<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.909> dried<00:01:08.909> it

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
that's that's what the output looks like

that's that's what the output looks like
and<00:01:14.600> I'm<00:01:15.600> going<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.869> burn<00:01:16.080> it<00:01:16.200> now<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.560> see
