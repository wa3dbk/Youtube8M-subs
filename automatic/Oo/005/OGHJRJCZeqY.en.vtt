00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
for planet minecraft so I thought that

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:10.980 
for planet minecraft so I thought that
um<00:01:09.060> I'll<00:01:10.060> just<00:01:10.119> take<00:01:10.360> a<00:01:10.390> little<00:01:10.600> minute<00:01:10.720> and

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
um I'll just take a little minute and

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.950 
um I'll just take a little minute and
I'll<00:01:11.590> show<00:01:11.799> you<00:01:11.860> what<00:01:12.039> I<00:01:12.070> made<00:01:12.280> and<00:01:12.960> basically

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
I'll show you what I made and basically

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.260 
I'll show you what I made and basically
let's<00:01:14.710> change<00:01:14.920> our<00:01:15.100> view<00:01:15.869> we<00:01:16.869> had<00:01:17.049> to<00:01:17.170> make<00:01:17.380> a

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
let's change our view we had to make a

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.770 
let's change our view we had to make a
spaceship<00:01:19.270> and<00:01:19.539> I<00:01:20.789> don't<00:01:21.789> know<00:01:21.909> why<00:01:22.119> when<00:01:22.750> I

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:22.780 
spaceship and I don't know why when I

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.730 
spaceship and I don't know why when I
saw<00:01:23.050> it<00:01:23.080> I<00:01:23.470> thought<00:01:23.950> of<00:01:25.020> equal<00:01:26.020> five<00:01:26.200> from

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
saw it I thought of equal five from

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.149 
saw it I thought of equal five from
space<00:01:27.310> balls<00:01:27.610> but<00:01:28.000> I<00:01:28.300> did<00:01:29.259> decide<00:01:29.920> that<00:01:29.979> that

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
space balls but I did decide that that

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.320 
space balls but I did decide that that
was<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.429> spaceship<00:01:30.819> I<00:01:30.970> was<00:01:31.090> gonna<00:01:31.210> make<00:01:31.479> and<00:01:31.929> I

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
was the spaceship I was gonna make and I

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.960 
was the spaceship I was gonna make and I
really<00:01:34.330> have<00:01:34.720> no<00:01:34.929> illusions<00:01:35.560> that<00:01:35.920> I'm<00:01:36.789> gonna

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
really have no illusions that I'm gonna

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:37.949 
really have no illusions that I'm gonna
win<00:01:37.209> at<00:01:37.479> all

00:01:37.949 --> 00:01:37.959 
win at all

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:40.889 
win at all
I<00:01:38.190> mean<00:01:39.190> I've<00:01:39.399> seen<00:01:39.580> some<00:01:39.640> of<00:01:39.909> the<00:01:40.000> other<00:01:40.240> stuff

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
I mean I've seen some of the other stuff

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.460 
I mean I've seen some of the other stuff
people<00:01:41.140> have<00:01:41.289> made<00:01:41.560> like<00:01:41.979> just<00:01:42.340> massive<00:01:43.470> space

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
people have made like just massive space

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.520 
people have made like just massive space
stations<00:01:44.979> and<00:01:45.100> stuff<00:01:45.399> so<00:01:45.700> I<00:01:46.319> know<00:01:47.319> I'm

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
stations and stuff so I know I'm

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.820 
stations and stuff so I know I'm
probably<00:01:47.679> not<00:01:47.860> gonna<00:01:48.009> win<00:01:48.509> but<00:01:49.709> it<00:01:50.709> was

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
probably not gonna win but it was

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.889 
probably not gonna win but it was
something<00:01:51.009> I<00:01:51.099> wanted<00:01:51.250> to<00:01:51.459> make<00:01:51.610> anyway<00:01:52.000> so<00:01:52.569> I

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
something I wanted to make anyway so I

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.900 
something I wanted to make anyway so I
probably<00:01:53.289> would<00:01:53.500> have<00:01:53.530> made<00:01:53.709> it<00:01:53.890> anyway<00:01:54.849> but

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
probably would have made it anyway but

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.479 
probably would have made it anyway but
the<00:01:55.330> idea<00:01:55.989> was<00:01:56.289> sparked<00:01:57.280> by<00:01:57.489> the<00:01:57.550> contest<00:01:58.090> so

00:01:59.479 --> 00:01:59.489 
the idea was sparked by the contest so

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:03.749 
the idea was sparked by the contest so
here<00:02:00.489> it<00:02:00.580> is<00:02:00.700> yeah<00:02:00.940> check<00:02:01.660> it<00:02:01.780> out<00:02:02.550> and<00:02:03.550> down

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
here it is yeah check it out and down

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.740 
here it is yeah check it out and down
here<00:02:04.030> we<00:02:04.179> have<00:02:05.129> princess<00:02:06.390> Vespas<00:02:07.530> Oh<00:02:09.750> know

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
here we have princess Vespas Oh know

what you call it I get a star car I

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.250 
what you call it I get a star car I
guess<00:02:12.849> that's<00:02:13.090> I<00:02:13.420> guess<00:02:13.780> that's<00:02:13.989> what<00:02:14.140> they

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
guess that's I guess that's what they

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.790 
guess that's I guess that's what they
call<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.760> movie<00:02:17.970> sniper<00:02:19.019> bombs<00:02:20.019> so<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.620> can

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
call it the movie sniper bombs so I can

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.600 
call it the movie sniper bombs so I can
point<00:02:21.190> things<00:02:23.760> but<00:02:24.760> yes<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.239> has<00:02:25.510> um<00:02:26.519> you<00:02:27.519> know

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
five on the on the sides versus low star

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.420 
five on the on the sides versus low star
icon<00:02:35.099> on<00:02:36.099> the<00:02:36.340> front<00:02:36.640> here<00:02:38.069> actually<00:02:39.069> probably

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
icon on the front here actually probably

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.550 
icon on the front here actually probably
what<00:02:39.640> I'll<00:02:39.730> do<00:02:39.909> so<00:02:40.209> probably<00:02:40.810> because<00:02:41.440> I'm

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
what I'll do so probably because I'm

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.149 
what I'll do so probably because I'm
doing<00:02:41.709> my<00:02:41.890> my<00:02:42.430> series<00:02:42.819> of<00:02:43.290> let's<00:02:44.290> build<00:02:44.530> cars

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:45.159 
doing my my series of let's build cars

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:48.300 
doing my my series of let's build cars
and<00:02:45.430> trucks<00:02:45.610> stuff<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.769> eventually<00:02:47.769> we're

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
and trucks stuff and eventually we're

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.300 
and trucks stuff and eventually we're
gonna<00:02:48.370> get<00:02:48.610> two<00:02:48.849> movie<00:02:49.510> Cars<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:50.310> I'll

gonna get two movie Cars and I'll

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.430 
gonna get two movie Cars and I'll
probably<00:02:51.580> add<00:02:51.849> this<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:53.290> that<00:02:53.319> set<00:02:53.829> of

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
probably add this to that set of

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.690 
probably add this to that set of
builds<00:02:56.050> so<00:02:57.050> actually<00:02:57.410> I'll<00:02:57.800> actually<00:02:58.220> wind<00:02:58.460> up

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
builds so actually I'll actually wind up

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.430 
builds so actually I'll actually wind up
showing<00:02:59.300> you<00:02:59.420> all<00:02:59.540> had<00:02:59.690> to<00:02:59.780> build<00:02:59.960> it<00:03:00.140> in<00:03:00.320> a

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
showing you all had to build it in a

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:06.100 
showing you all had to build it in a
future<00:03:00.830> video<00:03:02.920> but<00:03:03.920> yeah<00:03:04.100> I'm<00:03:04.400> really<00:03:05.110> proud

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
future video but yeah I'm really proud

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.750 
future video but yeah I'm really proud
of<00:03:06.620> the<00:03:06.770> way<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:07.010> came<00:03:07.190> out<00:03:07.400> I<00:03:07.430> was<00:03:07.640> really

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
of the way it came out I was really

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.580 
of the way it came out I was really
surprised<00:03:08.270> at<00:03:08.600> how<00:03:10.600> accurate<00:03:11.600> I<00:03:12.080> think<00:03:12.350> it<00:03:12.440> is

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
surprised at how accurate I think it is

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.910 
surprised at how accurate I think it is
I<00:03:12.980> mean<00:03:13.130> it's<00:03:13.400> pretty<00:03:14.200> pretty<00:03:15.200> dead-on<00:03:15.560> the

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
I mean it's pretty pretty dead-on the

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.980 
I mean it's pretty pretty dead-on the
way<00:03:16.040> it<00:03:16.190> looks<00:03:16.400> in<00:03:16.640> the<00:03:16.760> in<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.600> movie<00:03:17.900> and

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
way it looks in the in the movie and

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
way it looks in the in the movie and
I'll<00:03:18.080> go<00:03:18.230> ahead<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:19.150> throw<00:03:20.680> up<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.710> picture

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
I'll go ahead and throw up a picture

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.520 
I'll go ahead and throw up a picture
just<00:03:22.340> so<00:03:22.460> y'all<00:03:22.730> can<00:03:22.940> see<00:03:23.200> what<00:03:24.200> it<00:03:24.260> looks<00:03:24.440> like

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
just so y'all can see what it looks like

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.580 
just so y'all can see what it looks like
in<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.490> movie<00:03:25.850> and<00:03:26.360> compare<00:03:26.780> it<00:03:29.110> so<00:03:30.110> yeah<00:03:30.290> I
