up<00:00:21.449> jewelcrafting<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.350> we're<00:00:22.680> just<00:00:22.769> going<00:00:22.859> to

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
up jewelcrafting and we're just going to

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.710 
up jewelcrafting and we're just going to
be<00:00:23.750> using<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:25.789> orange<00:00:26.789> recipes<00:00:27.269> which<00:00:27.539> we

have for alexandrite to start and we'll
see<00:00:30.420> how<00:00:30.750> far<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.140> gets<00:00:31.380> us

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.430 

so<00:02:01.220> at<00:02:01.370> 580<00:02:01.820> these<00:02:02.330> recipes<00:02:02.660> will<00:02:03.050> go<00:02:03.200> green

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
so at 580 these recipes will go green

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.680 
so at 580 these recipes will go green
and<00:02:03.650> you<00:02:04.100> have<00:02:04.280> to<00:02:04.370> move<00:02:04.550> on<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.940> using<00:02:05.510> your

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
and you have to move on to using your

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.650 
and you have to move on to using your
research<00:02:06.140> now<00:02:06.530> this<00:02:06.830> is<00:02:07.040> why<00:02:07.160> you<00:02:07.220> want

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
research now this is why you want

surplus<00:02:08.660> of<00:02:08.690> one<00:02:09.290> rare<00:02:09.619> because<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.250> will<00:02:10.369> use

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
surplus of one rare because you will use

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.700

red<00:02:12.890> gem<00:02:13.100> and<00:02:13.520> then<00:02:13.850> you<00:02:13.970> can<00:02:14.150> then<00:02:14.300> create

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
red gem and then you can then create

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.200 
red gem and then you can then create
that<00:02:14.810> red<00:02:15.020> gem<00:02:15.230> I'm<00:02:15.740> just<00:02:16.160> going<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.400> create<00:02:17.120> a

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
that red gem I'm just going to create a

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.970 
that red gem I'm just going to create a
few<00:02:17.630> more<00:02:17.810> of<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:17.990> green<00:02:18.170> recipes<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.800> boost

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
few more of the green recipes to boost

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.320 
few more of the green recipes to boost
me<00:02:19.070> up<00:02:19.160> a<00:02:19.280> little<00:02:19.400> bit<00:02:19.580> as<00:02:19.730> i<00:02:19.760> do<00:02:19.970> not<00:02:20.270> have

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
me up a little bit as i do not have

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.310 
me up a little bit as i do not have
enough<00:02:20.660> red<00:02:21.200> gems<00:02:21.440> currently<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:23.810> can<00:02:23.840> buy

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
enough red gems currently you can buy

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.770 
enough red gems currently you can buy
another<00:02:24.650> rare<00:02:25.040> gem<00:02:25.280> here<00:02:25.520> or<00:02:25.700> another<00:02:26.420> one<00:02:26.630> or

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
two but this way actually probably saves

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.430 
two but this way actually probably saves
you<00:02:29.090> money<00:02:29.540> as<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.920> rare<00:02:31.130> gems<00:02:31.900> 100<00:02:32.900> to<00:02:33.020> 200

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
you money as the rare gems 100 to 200

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.360 
you money as the rare gems 100 to 200
gold<00:02:33.650> the<00:02:33.860> cheapest<00:02:34.310> at<00:02:34.910> least<00:02:35.150> on<00:02:35.300> my<00:02:35.330> server

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
gold the cheapest at least on my server

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.500 
gold the cheapest at least on my server
so<00:02:37.370> after<00:02:37.640> that<00:02:37.910> we'll<00:02:38.209> just<00:02:38.240> create<00:02:39.140> the<00:02:39.860> last

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
so after that we'll just create the last

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.940 
so after that we'll just create the last
few<00:02:41.510> points<00:02:43.780> actually<00:02:44.780> I'm<00:02:45.200> a<00:02:45.260> rare<00:02:45.500> gem<00:02:45.709> shot

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
few points actually I'm a rare gem shot

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.170 
few points actually I'm a rare gem shot
so<00:02:46.190> I'll<00:02:46.310> just<00:02:46.340> head<00:02:46.640> to<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.790> auction<00:02:47.090> house
