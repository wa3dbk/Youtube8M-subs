00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.840 
if I wanted to use my iPhone
to<00:01:45.869> pick<00:01:46.619> up<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.859> Wi-Fi<00:01:47.159> signal<00:01:47.520> from<00:01:47.700> my

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
to pick up the Wi-Fi signal from my

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.120 
to pick up the Wi-Fi signal from my
macbook<00:01:48.090> over<00:01:48.719> bluetooth<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.469> could<00:01:49.799> do<00:01:49.950> that

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
macbook over bluetooth I could do that

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.609 
macbook over bluetooth I could do that
it's<00:01:50.429> overly<00:01:51.030> complicated<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.810> kind<00:01:52.560> of

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
it's overly complicated and kind of

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.380 
it's overly complicated and kind of
useless<00:01:53.159> but<00:01:53.399> if<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.520> had<00:01:53.939> two<00:01:54.060> people<00:01:54.329> who

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
useless but if you had two people who

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.149 
useless but if you had two people who
were<00:01:54.420> sharing<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.869> connection<00:01:55.259> it's<00:01:55.890> kind<00:01:56.130> of

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
were sharing a connection it's kind of

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.340 
were sharing a connection it's kind of
nice<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:57.119> if<00:01:57.210> one<00:01:57.360> person<00:01:57.689> has<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.840> data<00:01:58.110> card

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
nice but if one person has a data card

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.569 
nice but if one person has a data card
near<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.679> person<00:01:59.009> does<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.490> you're

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
near the person does it and you're

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.859 
near the person does it and you're
working<00:01:59.729> you<00:02:00.149> know<00:02:00.210> within<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.479> few<00:02:00.600> feet<00:02:00.689> of

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
working you know within a few feet of

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.270 
working you know within a few feet of
each<00:02:01.020> other<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.409> can<00:02:01.560> piggyback<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:02.069> data

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
each other you can piggyback the data

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.010 
each other you can piggyback the data
card<00:02:02.520> which<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.729> kind<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.030> cool<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.929> then

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
card which is kind of cool and then

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.779 
card which is kind of cool and then
Bluetooth<00:02:04.350> sharing<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.829> shows<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.579> what<00:02:05.700> I'll

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
Bluetooth sharing it shows you what I'll

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.059 
Bluetooth sharing it shows you what I'll
to<00:02:05.880> do<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:07.229> all<00:02:07.289> set<00:02:07.500> up<00:02:07.590> on<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:07.770> one<00:02:07.979> so

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
to do so it's all set up on this one so

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.820 
to do so it's all set up on this one so
I'm<00:02:08.129> going<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.280> go<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.489> close<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.830> the

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
I'm going to go and close it and the

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.380 
I'm going to go and close it and the
next<00:02:10.860> clip<00:02:11.280> I'll<00:02:11.430> actually<00:02:11.580> show<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.940> how<00:02:12.269> it

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
next clip I'll actually show you how it

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.540 
next clip I'll actually show you how it
works
