bass drum puts base strokes in between

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.350 
bass drum puts base strokes in between
the<00:01:21.750> hi-hat<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.400> for<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.549> part<00:01:24.150> of<00:01:24.270> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
the hi-hat and for this part of the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.460 
the hi-hat and for this part of the
series<00:01:24.570> we're<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:24.960> going<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.110> keep<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
series we're just going to keep the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.620 
series we're just going to keep the
snare<00:01:25.710> on<00:01:25.950> two<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.369> four<00:01:26.460> like<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.090> Lesson<00:01:27.420> one

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
snare on two and four like in Lesson one

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.840 
snare on two and four like in Lesson one
so<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.350> hand<00:01:28.590> pattern<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.250> going<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.490> be<00:01:29.640> just

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
so the hand pattern is going to be just

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.980 
so the hand pattern is going to be just
like<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.180> lesson<00:01:30.509> 1<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:33.320> the<00:01:34.320> bass<00:01:34.560> strokes

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
like in lesson 1 and the bass strokes

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.420 
like in lesson 1 and the bass strokes
some<00:01:36.990> are<00:01:37.110> going<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.290> fall<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.680> between<00:01:40.430> what's

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
some are going to fall in between what's

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.950 
some are going to fall in between what's
called<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.820> ease<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.299> us<00:01:42.479> because

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
called on the ease and us because

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.410 
called on the ease and us because

sixteenth notes are counted a one-e-and

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.350

one and two and three and four E and

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.050 
one and two and three and four E and
that<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:53.009> actually<00:01:53.310> create<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.610> pretty<00:01:53.850> cool

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
that can actually create a pretty cool

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.330 
that can actually create a pretty cool
beat<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.540> by<00:01:54.659> putting<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> two<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.290> four

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.130 

but<00:02:01.340> that's<00:02:01.490> a<00:02:01.580> lot<00:02:01.760> of<00:02:01.790> sixteenth<00:02:02.330> phrasing

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
but that's a lot of sixteenth phrasing

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.570 
but that's a lot of sixteenth phrasing
on<00:02:03.230> the<00:02:03.320> base<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:04.070> don't<00:02:04.220> want<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.400> include

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
on the base you don't want to include

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.150
