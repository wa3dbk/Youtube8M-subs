00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.130
 some time we are going to have to 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.929
 improvise 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.610
 so that makes me happy to you 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:58.450

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.549
 damn but what's this hell how 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.549
 I can skip that it's impossible 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:14.280
 a little bit how it goes and if we 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:21.120

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:26.260

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.930
 sometimes I do not see anything at all 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.950
 this is where we will go to do like 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.620
 if we had succeeded the first time 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.570

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.300
 take his surprise is to yens maps 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.670
