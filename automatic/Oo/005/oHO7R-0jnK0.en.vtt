00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
a video about my pitch door this is not

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.800 
a video about my pitch door this is not
a<00:00:25.769> very<00:00:26.039> cool<00:00:26.310> free<00:00:26.699> by<00:00:26.849> freed<00:00:27.180> or<00:00:27.420> creation

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
a very cool free by freed or creation

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.669 
a very cool free by freed or creation
the<00:00:28.710> original<00:00:29.400> idea<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:30.000> by<00:00:30.240> a<00:00:30.269> guy<00:00:30.510> called

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
the original idea is by a guy called

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.799 
the original idea is by a guy called
cranberry<00:00:31.679> jelly<00:00:32.009> but<00:00:32.759> yeah<00:00:32.940> let's<00:00:33.450> see<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
cranberry jelly but yeah let's see the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.620 
cranberry jelly but yeah let's see the
door<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.170> action<00:00:34.590> as<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:35.430> can<00:00:35.610> see<00:00:35.760> it<00:00:35.969> opens

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
door in action as you can see it opens

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.250 
door in action as you can see it opens
very<00:00:37.079> fast<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.680> also<00:00:37.800> closed<00:00:38.309> as<00:00:38.489> fast<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
very fast and also closed as fast and

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.049 
very fast and also closed as fast and
yet<00:00:40.260> let's<00:00:40.890> take<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.129> closer<00:00:41.430> look<00:00:41.579> at<00:00:41.879> your

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
yet let's take a closer look at your

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.810 
yet let's take a closer look at your
redstone<00:00:43.219> as<00:00:45.410> you<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.530> see<00:00:46.710> it's<00:00:46.920> very<00:00:47.460> small

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
redstone as you can see it's very small

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.569 
redstone as you can see it's very small
it's<00:00:48.059> basically<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.079> same<00:00:49.350> size<00:00:49.739> as<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
it's basically the same size as the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.760 
it's basically the same size as the
piston<00:00:51.000> layout<00:00:51.329> which<00:00:51.930> means<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.440> can't

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
piston layout which means that it can't

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.029 
piston layout which means that it can't
be<00:00:52.949> compacted<00:00:53.489> anymore<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.710> when<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.829> see<00:00:55.980> it

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
be compacted anymore and when you see it

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.279 
be compacted anymore and when you see it
in<00:00:56.160> action<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:57.000> clearly<00:00:57.270> see<00:00:57.539> with<00:00:58.079> all

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
in action you can clearly see with all

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.650 
in action you can clearly see with all
the<00:00:58.469> top<00:00:58.649> pistons<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.520> extend<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.539> retract

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
the top pistons and extend and retract

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.500 
the top pistons and extend and retract
at<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.170> exact<00:01:01.590> same<00:01:01.859> time<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.550> that's

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
at the exact same time and that's

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.660 
at the exact same time and that's
because<00:01:03.930> you're<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.739> top<00:01:04.949> there<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.189> no

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
because you're on top there is no

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.300 
because you're on top there is no
repeater<00:01:06.090> all<00:01:06.450> these<00:01:06.869> pistons<00:01:07.470> are<00:01:07.710> connected

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
repeater all these pistons are connected

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.050 
repeater all these pistons are connected
directly<00:01:08.939> through<00:01:09.630> redstone<00:01:10.200> dust<00:01:10.790> only<00:01:11.790> here

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
directly through redstone dust only here

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.090 
directly through redstone dust only here
on<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.299> top<00:01:12.479> bar<00:01:12.689> there<00:01:13.080> are<00:01:13.229> some<00:01:13.560> repeaters

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
on the top bar there are some repeaters

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.950 
on the top bar there are some repeaters
and<00:01:14.130> torches<00:01:14.670> which<00:01:14.939> slowed<00:01:15.390> down<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.810> red

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
and torches which slowed down the red

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.370 
and torches which slowed down the red
stone<00:01:16.229> but<00:01:17.070> yeah<00:01:17.310> let's<00:01:18.049> get<00:01:19.049> straight<00:01:19.229> on

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
stone but yeah let's get straight on

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.539 
stone but yeah let's get straight on
with<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.890> tutorial<00:01:21.650> ok<00:01:22.650> let's<00:01:22.950> start<00:01:23.130> with

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
with the tutorial ok let's start with

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.440 
with the tutorial ok let's start with
the<00:01:23.729> piston<00:01:24.150> layout<00:01:24.950> this<00:01:25.950> here<00:01:26.310> is<00:01:26.340> your<00:01:26.880> door

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
the piston layout this here is your door

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.300 
the piston layout this here is your door
and<00:01:27.659> then<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.020> go<00:01:28.200> down<00:01:28.650> beneath<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.189> and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
and then you go down beneath it and

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.760 
and then you go down beneath it and
place<00:01:29.790> some<00:01:30.210> Pistons<00:01:31.079> won<00:01:31.560> over<00:01:32.030> here<00:01:33.030> and

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
place some Pistons won over here and

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.850 
place some Pistons won over here and
then<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.159> over<00:01:35.579> here<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.270> is<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:37.470> double

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
then to over here this is the double

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.950 
then to over here this is the double
piston<00:01:38.070> extender<00:01:38.280> which<00:01:38.790> reflects<00:01:39.720> this

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
piston extender which reflects this

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.470 
piston extender which reflects this
block<00:01:40.320> away<00:01:40.500> yet

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
block away yet

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.630 
block away yet
then<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:44.010> go<00:01:44.370> out<00:01:45.770> three<00:01:46.770> blocks<00:01:47.070> over<00:01:47.250> here

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
then you go out three blocks over here

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.950 
then you go out three blocks over here
and<00:01:47.840> place<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:49.100> piston<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.340> another<00:01:51.300> piston

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
and place a piston and another piston

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.600 
and place a piston and another piston
like<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:53.480> then<00:01:54.480> you<00:01:54.600> go<00:01:54.720> on<00:01:54.870> top<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.460> go<00:01:56.460> out

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
like this then you go on top and go out

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.150 
like this then you go on top and go out
three<00:01:56.850> blocks<00:01:57.150> and<00:01:57.450> place<00:01:57.870> two<00:01:58.200> Pistons<00:01:58.740> over

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
three blocks and place two Pistons over

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.090 
three blocks and place two Pistons over
here<00:02:01.940> now<00:02:02.940> you<00:02:03.000> need<00:02:03.300> to<00:02:03.330> blaze<00:02:03.720> free<00:02:04.530> more

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
here now you need to blaze free more

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.670 
here now you need to blaze free more
Pistons<00:02:05.730> one<00:02:06.240> here<00:02:06.750> one<00:02:07.550> here<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:09.440> the<00:02:10.440> last

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
Pistons one here one here and the last

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.180 
Pistons one here one here and the last
one<00:02:11.040> is<00:02:11.250> over<00:02:12.500> no<00:02:13.500> sorry<00:02:14.250> I'm<00:02:14.520> is<00:02:15.030> over<00:02:15.690> here

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
one is over no sorry I'm is over here

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.460 
one is over no sorry I'm is over here
okay<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.180> your<00:02:18.360> basic<00:02:18.930> piston

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
okay and that is your basic piston

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.090 
okay and that is your basic piston
layout<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.600> also<00:02:21.600> your<00:02:21.750> redstone<00:02:22.050> i'll<00:02:22.470> start

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
layout and also your redstone i'll start

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.880 
layout and also your redstone i'll start
with<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.570> double<00:02:24.570> piston<00:02:24.750> extender<00:02:24.990> circuit

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
with the double piston extender circuit

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.970 
with the double piston extender circuit
and<00:02:26.070> that's<00:02:26.790> very<00:02:26.970> simple<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.540> do<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:28.650> just

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
and that's very simple to do you just

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.940 
and that's very simple to do you just
place<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.250> block<00:02:29.580> over<00:02:29.790> here<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.680> like<00:02:31.680> this

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
place a block over here and like this

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.320 
place a block over here and like this
with<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.250> torch<00:02:32.760> on<00:02:32.910> it<00:02:34.130> then<00:02:35.130> you<00:02:35.880> place

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
with a torch on it then you place

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.060 
with a torch on it then you place
another<00:02:36.510> torch<00:02:37.050> on<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.440> other<00:02:37.590> side<00:02:37.830> of<00:02:37.860> the

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
another torch on the other side of the

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.610 
another torch on the other side of the
block<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:39.740> you're<00:02:40.740> a<00:02:40.770> repeater<00:02:41.340> on<00:02:41.490> two<00:02:41.820> jigs

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
block and you're a repeater on two jigs

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.090 
block and you're a repeater on two jigs
redstone<00:02:44.390> which<00:02:45.390> goes<00:02:45.660> into<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:46.140> piston<00:02:46.770> with<00:02:47.070> a

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
redstone which goes into a piston with a

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
repeater and here redstone dust and that

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.190 
repeater and here redstone dust and that
should<00:03:01.560> be<00:03:01.860> your<00:03:02.370> elf<00:03:03.060> is<00:03:03.450> next<00:03:03.840> and<00:03:03.989> they're

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
should be your elf is next and they're

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.300 
should be your elf is next and they're
done<00:03:04.500> now<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:06.720> power<00:03:07.140> this<00:03:07.440> piston<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.010> just

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
done now to power this piston you just

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.070 
done now to power this piston you just
place<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:08.610> redstone<00:03:09.390> torch<00:03:10.010> with<00:03:11.010> a<00:03:11.040> repeater
