00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.540
 especially guys this video tutorials 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.540
 can explain how the 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:09.540
 smartphone 20 cambur east 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.260
 framework 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:18.770
 it is good for 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.840
 penetrate smartphones 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.440
 smart quotes 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.660
 smartphones 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:29.810
 and to penetrate androids god 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.540
 well let's come to the description 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.170
 Bull Security Dam Puntocom that is 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.970
 the project we come to smartphone 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.150
 pentes framework that comes out of a form 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.440
 different as bridge already doubled to us 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.070
 we come to bend they have to have 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.440
 installed the notice once you 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.010
 it's here so we're going to give it a loud 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.150
 spf uve 0.1 which are acronyms 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.150
 smartphone skills 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.840
 we have here we will leave the iut had 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.450
 that having the heat installed is what it is 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.940
 that I usually use to do 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.970
 to download files and they are still so 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.980
 you can download the muncipio 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.110
 but I do not download it municipality 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:17.540
 rhythm networks option 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.680
 we come, you know the password 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:24.040
 he always forgives her 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.580
 always to install and as typical 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.100
 to enter suspend install and now what 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.890
 I have installed so nothing 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.050
 good git cloud 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.040
 let's go to do it on the desk 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.040
 for you to see 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.290
 the installation is very simple and we are going to 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.080
 put space spf bar as if outside 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.700
 a folder I put him in because 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.360
 the abbreviation really the world with the 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.360
 name of sacred 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.479
 I the settlers always in or peten but 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:00.630
 they do not have to surround it what 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:05.130
 we have to me the plans always not pt 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.130
 is where I have everything more ordered 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.900
 good 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.410
 keep a good dish I will explain 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.990
 a little curve 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.900
 as I said I do not know if I said it as 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.540
 I'm recording already second third video 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.450
 because more solid longer before then 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.270
 this framework is for what they are for 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.830
 hack smart phones has its 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.320
 exploits your console 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:35.240
 everything has its app the android drug app 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.770
 which is the one that can be infected is 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:39.069
 the one that is for testing and the one that is for 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.170
 infect people 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.170
 specific good 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.920
 once it's clearing I 'm not going 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.990
 to stop the video because well I do not know 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.340
 here you can see that we have the spf and 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.270
 here at the desk has been 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.270
 protected against 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.840
 we enter 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.359
 and it's very easy to install it very very very 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.670
 sensitivity is not exaggerated is the 

00:03:07.359 --> 00:03:11.500
 installation of cali the distro this new 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.409
 below the bar track to go 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.069
 track and by chance they put him side 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:20.349
 world and that of saints 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.239
 in the case we have talked a lot so that 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.510
 see that it's a sh I think it was the 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.750
 last time 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:32.760
 it is a this year a script is done this h 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:34.470
 let's give it executable permission now 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.290
 we could execute it and now for 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.080
 install it this will take a while but 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.510
 I for example I have installed bulls to 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.580
 start to install and it will start 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.580
 install the dependencies everything 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.410
 is asking in my case is it to be 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.630
 is already downloading the android again 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:56.300
 sdk enlisted is going to be all I 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.300
 all installed as I said in open 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:03.760
 There is already little to explain, I'm going to do 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.050
 now a tutorial on the first 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.730
 uses that we are going to give to this 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.140
 tool that as is logical that as 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.090
 he has already said is to hack phone 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.780
 smart so that's why 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:17.410
 we had a virtual machine installed 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.420
 with what was android 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.820
 why install it so that 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.090
 you would see the operation of everything 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.090
 this 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.760
 good and to execute it 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.150
 to execute it is simple because we are going to 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.150
 come to 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:43.809
 framework with solÃ© once here they have 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:46.059
 have payton installed but man 

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:49.110
 is it clearly if they have windows what 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:50.790
 they will have to download but yes no 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.200
 they should have this if they have 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:54.729
 windows is better that they do not use this 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.360
 program because it 's a coast 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:57.360
 a little 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:06.210
 and you can start the bulls 

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:06.210
 segurity julian white man 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:12.620
 and here they have all explained them a 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.300
 video something something here time 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.670
 I was not there when we go to 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.090
 see I'm going to explain what this is for 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:22.250
 compiling code to use metasploit is 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.290
 for the iphone to create to create and 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.180
 clean up a database that this is 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:30.310
 a database is like a kind of 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.310
 Trojan we are also connections 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.360
 or social engineering attack from the 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:42.210
 client side 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:46.020
 the remote attack to attach a 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:47.729
 framework to the mobile phone to see the 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.680
 information that you can collect 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.210
 to send a command to people this 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.039
 it's like the little screen is going to come out 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.409
 of the people you have infected and for 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:59.900
 that because nobody infected because 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:59.900
 I can not devote to doing that either 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:04.780
 and that's it, I'm going to stop it
