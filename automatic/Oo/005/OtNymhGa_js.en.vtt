you two different ways to doing some

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.330 
you two different ways to doing some
pros<00:00:27.760> and<00:00:27.970> cons<00:00:28.179> of<00:00:28.449> each<00:00:29.099> typically<00:00:30.099> what

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
then if I go over here to the design tab

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.290 
then if I go over here to the design tab
and<00:00:40.269> do<00:00:40.390> move<00:00:40.660> chart<00:00:41.110> I<00:00:41.440> can<00:00:42.280> move<00:00:42.550> chart<00:00:43.059> and

set it as an object in PI of pie or as a

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.080 
set it as an object in PI of pie or as a
new<00:00:47.200> sheet<00:00:47.649> I'm<00:00:48.219> going<00:00:48.430> to<00:00:48.520> put<00:00:48.670> it<00:00:48.760> as<00:00:48.910> an

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
move now i'm on the dashboard chart i

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.389 
move now i'm on the dashboard chart i
can<00:00:57.280> scroll<00:00:57.699> this<00:00:58.120> and<00:00:59.010> drag<00:01:00.010> it<00:01:00.190> someplace

that<00:01:13.090> I<00:01:13.119> was<00:01:13.240> working<00:01:13.509> on<00:01:13.570> a<00:01:13.720> dashboard<00:01:14.020> this

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
that I was working on a dashboard this

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.109 
that I was working on a dashboard this
is<00:01:14.590> kind<00:01:14.770> of<00:01:14.830> a<00:01:15.009> difficult<00:01:15.460> example<00:01:16.000> because

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
is kind of a difficult example because

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.060 
is kind of a difficult example because
there's<00:01:16.299> so<00:01:16.390> much<00:01:16.509> information<00:01:16.810> but<00:01:17.320> I<00:01:17.890> could

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
there's so much information but I could

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.469 
there's so much information but I could
say<00:01:18.189> hey<00:01:18.340> you<00:01:18.400> know<00:01:18.490> it's<00:01:18.700> too<00:01:18.939> big<00:01:19.150> or<00:01:19.450> too

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
say hey you know it's too big or too

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.649 
say hey you know it's too big or too
small<00:01:19.630> or<00:01:19.900> whatever<00:01:20.229> you<00:01:20.380> can<00:01:20.500> size<00:01:20.770> it<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
small or whatever you can size it the

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.230 
small or whatever you can size it the
other<00:01:22.900> way<00:01:23.080> to<00:01:23.320> get<00:01:23.740> information<00:01:24.369> on<00:01:25.000> to<00:01:25.119> this

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
other way to get information on to this

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.090 
other way to get information on to this
dashboard<00:01:25.509> as<00:01:25.930> I<00:01:26.020> can<00:01:26.170> use<00:01:26.320> the<00:01:26.470> camera<00:01:26.740> tool

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100

commands and they're listed

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.389 
commands and they're listed
alphabetically<00:01:43.860> so<00:01:44.860> i'm<00:01:44.920> gonna<00:01:45.009> scroll<00:01:45.220> down

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
alphabetically so i'm gonna scroll down

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:47.660 
alphabetically so i'm gonna scroll down
so<00:01:45.579> i<00:01:45.610> see<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:45.909> camera<00:01:46.149> tool<00:01:46.509> and<00:01:46.780> add<00:01:47.140> it<00:01:47.350> and

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
so i see the camera tool and add it and

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.569 
so i see the camera tool and add it and
then<00:01:49.590> drag<00:01:50.590> this<00:01:50.740> up<00:01:50.890> so<00:01:51.040> you<00:01:51.100> can<00:01:51.220> see<00:01:51.250> part<00:01:51.520> of

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
then drag this up so you can see part of

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.289 
then drag this up so you can see part of
it<00:01:51.700> will<00:01:51.790> click<00:01:51.939> ok<00:01:53.040> then<00:01:54.040> what<00:01:54.280> i<00:01:54.310> can<00:01:54.579> do<00:01:54.790> is<00:01:55.030> i

yeah that's better and then what i can
do<00:02:23.230> is<00:02:23.260> when<00:02:23.500> I've<00:02:23.590> got<00:02:23.739> cells<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.190> can<00:02:24.340> take<00:02:24.519> a

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
do is when I've got cells I can take a

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.960 
do is when I've got cells I can take a
picture<00:02:26.319> of<00:02:26.349> it<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:26.890> come<00:02:27.610> over<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.849> the

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
picture of it I come over to the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.750 
picture of it I come over to the
dashboard<00:02:28.709> if<00:02:29.709> we<00:02:29.860> put<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.160> about<00:02:30.310> right<00:02:30.519> there

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
dashboard if we put it about right there

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.180 
dashboard if we put it about right there
and<00:02:31.030> paste<00:02:31.300> that's<00:02:32.110> way<00:02:32.379> too<00:02:32.440> big<00:02:32.739> so<00:02:33.099> I'm

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
and paste that's way too big so I'm

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.880 
and paste that's way too big so I'm
going<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.370> come<00:02:33.519> over<00:02:33.550> here<00:02:34.739> we'll<00:02:35.739> do<00:02:36.010> this

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
going to come over here we'll do this

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.009 
going to come over here we'll do this
shrink<00:02:38.890> it<00:02:39.010> down<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.519> fair<00:02:40.480> amount<00:02:40.599> just<00:02:40.840> for

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
shrink it down a fair amount just for

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.650 
shrink it down a fair amount just for
the<00:02:41.080> sake<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.349> argument<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:42.450> pull<00:02:43.450> it<00:02:43.540> over

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
the sake of argument and pull it over

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.920 
the sake of argument and pull it over
here<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.860> difference<00:02:45.459> between<00:02:45.790> getting<00:02:46.720> a

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
here the difference between getting a

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.050 
here the difference between getting a
copy<00:02:47.230> of<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.980> removing<00:02:48.519> the<00:02:48.610> chart<00:02:48.819> over<00:02:49.030> here

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.900 
copy of the removing the chart over here
and<00:02:49.480> getting<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.260> copy<00:02:50.470> this<00:02:50.739> camera<00:02:51.220> idea<00:02:51.610> here

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
and getting a copy this camera idea here

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.809 
and getting a copy this camera idea here
is<00:02:51.940> this<00:02:52.810> is<00:02:53.019> a<00:02:53.049> picture<00:02:53.290> so<00:02:53.650> if<00:02:53.890> you<00:02:54.069> if<00:02:54.640> you
