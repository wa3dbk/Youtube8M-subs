fine<00:03:47.730> lines<00:03:47.970> and<00:03:48.330> pores<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:48.900> everything<00:03:49.200> like

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
fine lines and pores and everything like

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.050 
fine lines and pores and everything like
that<00:03:49.350> the<00:03:49.650> next<00:03:49.799> thing<00:03:50.100> I<00:03:50.220> see<00:03:50.519> is

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
that the next thing I see is

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.250 
that the next thing I see is
MDM<00:03:51.480> flow<00:03:52.140> greater<00:03:52.950> than<00:03:53.690> volumizing<00:03:54.690> mascara

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
MDM flow greater than volumizing mascara

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.089 
MDM flow greater than volumizing mascara
21<00:03:55.980> like<00:03:56.220> euros<00:03:56.610> or<00:03:56.849> something<00:03:57.000> but<00:03:57.360> it's<00:03:58.099> $35

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
21 like euros or something but it's $35

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.820 
21 like euros or something but it's $35
so<00:03:59.730> it's<00:04:00.120> just<00:04:00.300> a<00:04:00.569> black<00:04:00.989> mascara<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.770> they

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
so it's just a black mascara and they

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.320 
so it's just a black mascara and they
actually<00:04:01.980> sent<00:04:02.340> me<00:04:02.459> an<00:04:02.520> email<00:04:02.730> about<00:04:02.910> this

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
eyebrow pencil or Foe cosmetics

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.820 
eyebrow pencil or Foe cosmetics
Universal<00:05:08.850> eyebrow<00:05:09.150> pencil<00:05:09.539> and<00:05:09.630> it's<00:05:09.780> $13<00:05:10.590> so

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
Universal eyebrow pencil and it's $13 so

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.440 
Universal eyebrow pencil and it's $13 so
it's<00:05:11.190> a<00:05:11.400> universal<00:05:12.060> color

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
it's a universal color

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.630 
it's a universal color
apparently<00:05:13.200> so<00:05:13.440> it<00:05:13.530> specific<00:05:14.070> like<00:05:14.220> everyone

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
apparently so it specific like everyone

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.360 
apparently so it specific like everyone
but<00:05:14.669> it<00:05:15.570> looks<00:05:15.750> dark<00:05:16.229> so<00:05:16.800> I<00:05:16.830> don't<00:05:17.070> think<00:05:17.220> it

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
but it looks dark so I don't think it

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.730 
but it looks dark so I don't think it
would<00:05:17.520> work<00:05:17.550> for<00:05:17.820> my<00:05:18.510> eyebrows<00:05:18.990> I<00:05:19.289> don't<00:05:19.650> know

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
would work for my eyebrows I don't know

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.250 
would work for my eyebrows I don't know
why<00:05:19.860> we<00:05:20.039> think<00:05:20.160> would<00:05:20.280> make<00:05:20.340> a<00:05:20.490> universal

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
why we think would make a universal

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.500 
why we think would make a universal
eyebrow<00:05:22.260> color<00:05:22.680> pencil<00:05:23.430> because<00:05:23.639> obviously

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
eyebrow color pencil because obviously

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:26.390 
eyebrow color pencil because obviously
some<00:05:24.720> people<00:05:24.840> have<00:05:25.080> blonde<00:05:25.380> eyebrows<00:05:25.830> then

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
some people have blonde eyebrows then

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.430 
some people have blonde eyebrows then
some<00:05:26.580> people<00:05:26.820> have<00:05:26.940> like<00:05:27.150> black<00:05:27.539> ones<00:05:27.900> I<00:05:28.229> mean

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
some people have like black ones I mean

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.779 
some people have like black ones I mean
I<00:05:28.500> guess<00:05:28.680> I<00:05:28.800> could<00:05:29.010> like<00:05:29.160> work<00:05:29.400> with<00:05:29.550> it<00:05:29.700> in

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
I guess I could like work with it in

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.600 
I guess I could like work with it in
China<00:05:29.970> we<00:05:30.120> blended<00:05:30.539> and<00:05:30.720> such<00:05:30.960> but<00:05:31.610> whatever

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
China we blended and such but whatever

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.950 
China we blended and such but whatever
so<00:05:32.910> that<00:05:33.090> is<00:05:33.210> the<00:05:33.300> boxycharm

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
so that is the boxycharm

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.629 
so that is the boxycharm
I<00:05:34.080> think<00:05:34.320> box<00:05:34.650> of<00:05:34.830> charm<00:05:34.979> is<00:05:35.070> definitely<00:05:35.460> worth

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:35.639 
I think box of charm is definitely worth

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.750 
I think box of charm is definitely worth
the<00:05:35.880> value<00:05:36.450> it's<00:05:36.690> like<00:05:36.979> $21<00:05:37.979> I'm<00:05:38.280> pretty<00:05:38.550> sure

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
the value it's like $21 I'm pretty sure

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.790 
the value it's like $21 I'm pretty sure
