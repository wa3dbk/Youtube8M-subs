00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.000
 a school has three classes and 90 students 

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:11.619
 the first has twice as much as the second 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:14.419
 and the third has three times the second 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:17.119
 how many students are there in each class 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.560
 The first thing we are going to do is identify the data and the unknown 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.560
 is telling us that there are three classes and 90 students in total 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.549
 the first class has twice as much as the second 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.390
 the third has three times the second 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.550
 and who knows how to do 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.110
 the students 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:40.540
 what's in each class 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.710
 if we make a scheme 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.710
 we have three classes 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.770
 which are a total of 90 students 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.440
 class 1 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.300
 class 2 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.920
 and class 3 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.830
 the class of references the second one because it tells us that in the first 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.210
 there twice as much as in the second 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.470
 Well, it's already 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.030
 nor do we love equinox 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.030
 tells us that the first aedile twice 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.170
 therefore 2x and that the third and triple that in the second therefore 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.490
 three times what is in the second 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.540
 it's as if we were dividing the total of students into three 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.810
 +1 4 + 2 six parts 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.780
 Thus 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.810
 let's divide the 90 students 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.140
 in six parts 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.720
 this division gives us 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.950
 15 results 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.950
 that means that there 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.430
 15 students 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.430
 in each part 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.430
 this number of students would correspond to those in the second class 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.430
 that is, in the second class 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:16.759
 there 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:17.889
 fifteen 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:20.889
 students 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:25.219
 yes in the first and double 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:26.649
 two 

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:28.189
 fifteen 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:30.369
 They are 30 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:33.289
 Thus 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:36.459
 there thirty students 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:39.929
 in the second class 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:41.929
 and in the third class 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:43.769
 multiply 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:44.779
 3 

00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:46.919
 hoskins 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:48.439
 and it gives us 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.379
 Four. Five 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.339
 students 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:57.909
 to check that it is well done we add the students of the first class 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:00.549
 in the second 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.519
 and the third 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.950
 thorny a total of 90 therefore 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:08.559
 It's well done 

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:11.559
 the answer would be 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:19.269
 thirty students 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.799
 in the first 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.799
 class 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.680
 15 students in the second 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.999
 and 45 students in the third 

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:35.409
 class
