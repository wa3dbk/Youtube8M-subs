00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:06.720 
didn't want to stick around

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.660 
didn't want to stick around
let's<00:02:07.320> not<00:02:07.500> like<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.860> new<00:02:07.979> stadium<00:02:08.429> but<00:02:08.549> hey

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
let's not like the new stadium but hey

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.850 
let's not like the new stadium but hey
at<00:02:08.970> least<00:02:09.030> he<00:02:09.569> got<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.840> finished<00:02:10.470> his<00:02:10.679> career

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
at least he got to finished his career

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.710 
at least he got to finished his career
with<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.459> Minnesota<00:02:11.849> Vikings<00:02:12.269> so<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:12.450> guess

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
with the Minnesota Vikings so I guess

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.990 
with the Minnesota Vikings so I guess
that<00:02:12.959> in<00:02:13.530> a<00:02:13.590> way<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:14.040> win<00:02:14.340> but<00:02:14.610> it's<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.819> fail

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
that in a way is a win but it's a fail

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.550 
that in a way is a win but it's a fail
for<00:02:15.030> me<00:02:15.390> since<00:02:15.659> I<00:02:15.749> paid<00:02:15.900> him<00:02:16.049> 3<00:02:16.349> mil<00:02:16.529> to<00:02:16.709> do<00:02:16.829> that

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560
