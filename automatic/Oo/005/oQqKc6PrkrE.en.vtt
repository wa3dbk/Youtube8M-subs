00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
was going through a point where I felt

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.270 
was going through a point where I felt
like<00:00:51.989> the<00:00:52.260> whole<00:00:52.379> weight<00:00:52.590> lifting<00:00:52.980> kind<00:00:53.190> of

like the whole weight lifting kind of

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.310 
like the whole weight lifting kind of
thing<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:54.360> community<00:00:54.809> behind<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:55.199> was

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
thing in the community behind it was

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.990 
thing in the community behind it was
more<00:00:55.559> superficial<00:00:56.809> more<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:58.379> how<00:00:59.340> your<00:00:59.699> body

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
more superficial more just how your body

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.990 
more superficial more just how your body
looks<00:01:00.120> instead<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.260> how<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.469> function<00:01:01.949> how<00:01:02.940> do

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
looks instead of how you function how do

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.810 
looks instead of how you function how do
you<00:01:03.090> move<00:01:03.480> how<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.619> can<00:01:04.769> actually<00:01:04.890> benefit<00:01:05.580> you

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
you move how it can actually benefit you

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.320 
you move how it can actually benefit you
and<00:01:06.170> I<00:01:07.170> remember<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.000> martial<00:01:09.000> arts<00:01:09.210> is

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330

something<00:01:09.630> that's<00:01:09.750> just<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.200> tangible<00:01:10.650> and

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
something that's just so tangible and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.170 
something that's just so tangible and

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
during this season although you can't

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.430 
during this season although you can't
really<00:03:49.959> calculate<00:03:50.650> it<00:03:51.160> I<00:03:51.570> mean<00:03:52.570> as<00:03:52.750> long<00:03:53.230> as

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
really calculate it I mean as long as

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.670 
really calculate it I mean as long as
it's<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.739> same<00:03:54.040> amount<00:03:54.519> of<00:03:54.610> time

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
it's the same amount of time

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.620 
it's the same amount of time
consistently<00:03:56.820> you<00:03:57.820> kind<00:03:58.120> of<00:03:58.180> work<00:03:58.360> with<00:03:58.510> it

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
consistently you kind of work with it

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.080 
consistently you kind of work with it
from<00:03:58.750> there<00:03:58.930> I<00:03:59.110> guess<00:03:59.380> but<00:04:00.340> the<00:04:00.850> cool<00:04:01.060> thing

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
from there I guess but the cool thing

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.509 
from there I guess but the cool thing
about<00:04:01.269> this<00:04:01.630> is<00:04:01.690> that<00:04:02.140> it's<00:04:02.410> cardio<00:04:02.799> and<00:04:03.130> it's

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
about this is that it's cardio and it's

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.660 
about this is that it's cardio and it's
it's<00:04:03.850> fun<00:04:04.269> cardio<00:04:04.950> which<00:04:05.950> you<00:04:06.489> don't<00:04:06.579> really

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
it's fun cardio which you don't really

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.250 
it's fun cardio which you don't really
come<00:04:06.970> by<00:04:07.090> I<00:04:07.120> don't<00:04:07.390> like<00:04:07.480> doing<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.810> stairs<00:04:08.079> I

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
come by I don't like doing the stairs I

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.229
