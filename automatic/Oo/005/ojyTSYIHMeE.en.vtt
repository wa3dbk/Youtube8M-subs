00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
doing is we're talking about

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.439 
doing is we're talking about

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
under security layer what we're going to

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.399 
under security layer what we're going to
do<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:42.030> we're<00:00:42.420> going<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.750> do<00:00:43.250> SSL<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.460> TLS<00:00:45.409> TLS

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:46.409 
do is we're going to do SSL and TLS TLS

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:48.410 
do is we're going to do SSL and TLS TLS
is<00:00:46.620> transport<00:00:47.129> layer<00:00:47.220> security<00:00:47.309> SSL<00:00:48.269> is

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
is transport layer security SSL is

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.799 
is transport layer security SSL is
secure<00:00:48.750> socket<00:00:49.140> layer<00:00:49.170> uses<00:00:50.070> port<00:00:50.280> 443<00:00:50.820> for

secure socket layer uses port 443 for
the<00:00:51.960> authentication<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.949> would<00:00:53.159> select

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:53.369 
the authentication so you would select

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:56.810 
the authentication so you would select
that<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.320> this<00:00:55.320> means<00:00:55.650> that<00:00:55.890> not<00:00:56.220> only<00:00:56.430> are<00:00:56.759> we

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
that and this means that not only are we

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.259 
that and this means that not only are we
going<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:58.040> authenticate<00:00:59.040> the<00:00:59.100> user<00:00:59.430> but<00:01:00.059> we're

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
going to authenticate the user but we're

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.660 
going to authenticate the user but we're
also<00:01:00.449> going<00:01:00.869> to<00:01:01.019> go<00:01:01.530> in<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.920> set<00:01:02.070> up<00:01:02.220> a<00:01:02.339> secure

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
also going to go in and set up a secure

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.859 
also going to go in and set up a secure
pipeline<00:01:03.470> between<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:05.040> client<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:06.630> host

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
pipeline between the client and the host

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.200 
pipeline between the client and the host
and<00:01:07.320> again<00:01:07.830> one<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> requirements<00:01:09.030> of

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
and again one of the requirements of

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.929 
and again one of the requirements of
secure<00:01:09.630> socket<00:01:10.049> layer<00:01:10.079> is<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.490> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
secure socket layer is that the the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.550 
secure socket layer is that the the
remote<00:01:12.150> desktop<00:01:12.540> server<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.530> client

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
remote desktop server and the client

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.840 
remote desktop server and the client
have<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.549> be<00:01:14.759> in<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.720> same<00:01:15.990> domain<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.850> so

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
have to be in the same domain and so

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.830 
have to be in the same domain and so
what<00:01:18.030> we're<00:01:18.150> going<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.299> do<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.570> we're<00:01:18.659> going<00:01:18.780> to

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.690 
what we're going to do is we're going to
move<00:01:18.960> over<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.560> client<00:01:20.040> machine<00:01:20.159> I'm

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
move over to the client machine I'm

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.940 
move over to the client machine I'm
actually<00:01:21.450> going<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.810> set<00:01:21.990> up<00:01:22.049> group<00:01:22.200> policy<00:01:22.710> so

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
actually going to set up group policy so

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.039 
actually going to set up group policy so
the<00:01:23.130> client<00:01:23.490> machine<00:01:23.579> will<00:01:24.450> go<00:01:24.569> in<00:01:24.749> and<00:01:24.899> allow

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
the client machine will go in and allow

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.959 
the client machine will go in and allow
us<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.350> delegate<00:01:25.770> credentials<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.700> way<00:01:26.789> that

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
us to delegate credentials in a way that

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:29.359 
us to delegate credentials in a way that
credential<00:01:27.509> delegation<00:01:28.200> works<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.590> that

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
credential delegation works is that

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.849 
credential delegation works is that
we're<00:01:29.579> going<00:01:29.789> to<00:01:29.880> go<00:01:30.119> through<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.740> let<00:01:31.740> me

00:01:31.849 --> 00:01:31.859 
we're going to go through and let me

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:35.660 
we're going to go through and let me
tell<00:01:32.789> us<00:01:32.850> straight<00:01:33.179> this<00:01:34.369> we're<00:01:35.369> going<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.549> go

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
tell us straight this we're going to go

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.510 
tell us straight this we're going to go
through<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.840> right<00:01:36.990> machine<00:01:37.319> here<00:01:37.560> there

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
through to the right machine here there

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.809 
through to the right machine here there
we<00:01:38.670> go<00:01:38.960> we're<00:01:39.960> going<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.109> go<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.499> and<00:01:40.799> we<00:01:41.579> will

00:01:41.809 --> 00:01:41.819 
we go we're going to go in and we will

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:44.749 
we go we're going to go in and we will
authenticate<00:01:42.240> so<00:01:43.109> here's<00:01:43.499> our<00:01:43.770> we'll<00:01:44.549> say

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
authenticate so here's our we'll say

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.940 
authenticate so here's our we'll say
that<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.359> remote<00:01:45.810> desktop<00:01:46.289> server<00:01:46.590> one

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
that this is remote desktop server one

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.999 
that this is remote desktop server one
and<00:01:47.280> then<00:01:47.999> we<00:01:48.090> have<00:01:48.119> another<00:01:48.659> remote<00:01:49.530> desktop

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
and then we have another remote desktop

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.419 
and then we have another remote desktop
server<00:01:51.139> let's<00:01:52.139> say<00:01:52.319> that<00:01:52.469> this<00:01:52.679> one<00:01:52.889> has<00:01:53.100> all

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
server let's say that this one has all

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.849 
server let's say that this one has all
of<00:01:53.459> our<00:01:53.670> little<00:01:53.880> applications<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.869> it<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.679> we

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:55.859 
of our little applications in it that we

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:58.489 
of our little applications in it that we
want<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.280> share<00:01:56.999> out<00:01:57.209> on<00:01:57.539> the<00:01:57.840> clients<00:01:58.289> desktop

00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:58.499 
want to share out on the clients desktop

00:01:58.499 --> 00:02:01.789 
want to share out on the clients desktop
so<00:01:59.490> when<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.969> client<00:02:00.209> machine<00:02:00.450> comes<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.590> and

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
so when the client machine comes in and

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.199 
so when the client machine comes in and
connects<00:02:02.069> up<00:02:02.279> to<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.520> remote<00:02:02.759> desktop

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:03.209 
connects up to this remote desktop

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:04.760 
connects up to this remote desktop
server<00:02:03.479> they<00:02:03.719> have<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:04.079> authenticate<00:02:04.350> and

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
server they have to authenticate and

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.069 
server they have to authenticate and
usually<00:02:05.159> it's<00:02:05.310> done<00:02:05.399> when<00:02:06.329> they<00:02:06.450> authenticate

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
usually it's done when they authenticate

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.109 
usually it's done when they authenticate
via<00:02:07.109> Active<00:02:07.889> Directory<00:02:08.009> they<00:02:08.490> come<00:02:08.880> and<00:02:09.030> get

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
via Active Directory they come and get

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.150 
via Active Directory they come and get
their<00:02:09.300> permissions<00:02:09.750> on<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.929> lab<00:02:10.170> but<00:02:10.860> then<00:02:11.039> when

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
their permissions on a lab but then when

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.570 
their permissions on a lab but then when
they<00:02:11.250> want<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.550> pull<00:02:11.730> down<00:02:11.940> this<00:02:12.450> remote<00:02:13.110> app

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
they want to pull down this remote app

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.250 
they want to pull down this remote app
they<00:02:14.580> have<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:15.000> authenticate<00:02:15.300> again<00:02:15.959> and

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
they have to authenticate again and

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.559 
they have to authenticate again and
it'll<00:02:16.890> pop<00:02:17.130> up<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.459> dialog<00:02:17.880> box<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.300> what<00:02:18.450> we

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
that pop up a dialog box so we're going

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.090 
that pop up a dialog box so we're going
to<00:02:23.340> allow<00:02:24.110> delegation<00:02:25.110> and<00:02:25.290> what<00:02:25.410> delegation

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
to allow delegation and what delegation

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.310 
to allow delegation and what delegation
does<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.580> it<00:02:27.090> means<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.600> when<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.750> connect<00:02:28.200> to

does is it means that when I connect to
this<00:02:28.470> particular<00:02:28.830> machine

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
this particular machine

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.449 
this particular machine
it<00:02:30.409> is<00:02:30.860> going<00:02:31.280> to<00:02:31.489> pretend<00:02:32.330> to<00:02:32.629> be<00:02:32.810> me<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.530> then

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
it is going to pretend to be me and then

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.520 
it is going to pretend to be me and then
it<00:02:34.819> will<00:02:35.060> go<00:02:35.329> in<00:02:35.569> and<00:02:35.720> do<00:02:35.989> the<00:02:36.140> authentication

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
it will go in and do the authentication

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.280 
it will go in and do the authentication
and<00:02:37.280> it<00:02:37.370> hides<00:02:37.670> the<00:02:37.939> dialog<00:02:38.390> box<00:02:38.659> because<00:02:39.170> it

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
and it hides the dialog box because it

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.440 
and it hides the dialog box because it

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.170 
would be a bad thing he would end up
with<00:04:00.260> machines<00:04:00.620> pretending<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.459> be<00:04:01.549> users<00:04:01.940> and

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
with machines pretending to be users and

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.819 
with machines pretending to be users and
gaining<00:04:02.449> access<00:04:02.629> to<00:04:02.989> stuff<00:04:03.199> that<00:04:03.440> they<00:04:03.620> really

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
gaining access to stuff that they really

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.490 
gaining access to stuff that they really
shouldn't<00:04:04.549> gain<00:04:04.730> access<00:04:04.940> to<00:04:05.329> so<00:04:05.569> you<00:04:06.079> have<00:04:06.290> the

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
shouldn't gain access to so you have the

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.900 
shouldn't gain access to so you have the
ability<00:04:06.889> to<00:04:06.949> go<00:04:07.160> in<00:04:07.340> here<00:04:07.549> and<00:04:07.609> you<00:04:07.760> can

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
ability to go in here and you can

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.479 
ability to go in here and you can

specify the particular servers that you

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:13.449 
want to add for example I can say SLC

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:19.240 
want to add for example I can say SLC
PDC<00:04:14.449> zero<00:04:15.349> one<00:04:16.209> and<00:04:17.209> we'll<00:04:17.479> say<00:04:17.659> ok<00:04:17.989> now<00:04:18.919> I<00:04:18.979> have

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
PDC zero one and we'll say ok now I have

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.300 
PDC zero one and we'll say ok now I have
my<00:04:19.489> server<00:04:19.940> SLC<00:04:20.570> PDC<00:04:21.049> zero<00:04:21.260> one<00:04:21.440> it's<00:04:22.010> not<00:04:22.280> a

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
my server SLC PDC zero one it's not a

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.250 
my server SLC PDC zero one it's not a
great<00:04:22.669> interface<00:04:22.940> it's<00:04:23.479> not<00:04:23.659> something<00:04:24.139> that

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
great interface it's not something that

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.980 
great interface it's not something that
Microsoft<00:04:24.860> has<00:04:25.190> has<00:04:26.030> really<00:04:26.330> polished<00:04:26.780> yet

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
Microsoft has has really polished yet

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.110 
Microsoft has has really polished yet
but<00:04:27.229> it<00:04:27.349> pretty<00:04:27.889> much<00:04:27.979> does<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.340> job<00:04:28.639> so

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
but it pretty much does the job so

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.029 
but it pretty much does the job so
you'll<00:04:29.240> say<00:04:29.389> enable<00:04:29.599> allow<00:04:30.139> delegation<00:04:30.860> of

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
you'll say enable allow delegation of

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.610 
you'll say enable allow delegation of
default<00:04:31.610> credentials<00:04:31.990> and<00:04:32.990> you<00:04:33.080> have<00:04:33.260> to<00:04:33.440> have

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
default credentials and you have to have

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.060 
default credentials and you have to have

at least Vista to to allow you to do

at least Vista to to allow you to do
that<00:04:37.250> so<00:04:37.520> and<00:04:38.300> that's<00:04:38.539> how<00:04:38.690> we<00:04:38.750> can<00:04:39.050> do<00:04:39.169> it
