now<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.170> walk-around<00:00:28.410> isn't<00:00:29.070> going<00:00:29.220> to

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
now the walk-around isn't going to

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.070 
now the walk-around isn't going to
really<00:00:29.460> have<00:00:29.670> much<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.179> besides<00:00:30.300> obvious

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
really have much in it besides obvious

because<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.470> tried<00:00:31.859> researching<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.610> machine

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
because I tried researching this machine

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.389 
because I tried researching this machine
online<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.800> there<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:34.890> absolutely<00:00:35.010> nothing

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
the bucket will just go into it and then

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.640 
the bucket will just go into it and then
they<00:01:09.600> tie<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.140> down<00:01:11.570> here's<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.990> large<00:01:13.320> large

bucket you can see they where they
welded<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.020> they<00:01:16.320> extended<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> sides

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
welded and they extended the sides

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.679 
welded and they extended the sides
forward<00:01:17.580> which<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.700> great<00:01:18.030> idea<00:01:18.180> when<00:01:18.540> you're

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
forward which is great idea when you're

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.870 
forward which is great idea when you're
styling<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.890> lot<00:01:20.840> over<00:01:21.840> here<00:01:21.869> are<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.200> holes

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
styling a lot over here are the holes

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.510 
styling a lot over here are the holes
where<00:01:23.880> they<00:01:24.000> will<00:01:24.180> attach<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.540> chain<00:01:25.080> for<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
where they will attach the chain for the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.140 
where they will attach the chain for the
box<00:01:26.790> plow<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.450> over<00:01:28.380> here<00:01:28.770> all<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.460> arms<00:01:29.880> now

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
box plow and over here all the arms now

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.999 
box plow and over here all the arms now
like<00:01:30.479> I<00:01:30.600> said<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:31.229> only<00:01:31.380> reason<00:01:31.590> why<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.799> was

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
like I said the only reason why I was

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.569 
like I said the only reason why I was
able<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.369> identify<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.970> as<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> 22<00:01:33.840> SB<00:01:34.439> is<00:01:35.040> right

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
able to identify it as a 22 SB is right

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.390 
able to identify it as a 22 SB is right
there<00:01:35.820> it's<00:01:35.970> kind<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.360> hard<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.720> tell<00:01:37.189> but<00:01:38.189> it

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
there it's kind of hard to tell but it

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.789 
there it's kind of hard to tell but it
does<00:01:38.610> say<00:01:38.820> 22<00:01:39.390> s<00:01:39.509> be<00:01:39.720> on<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:39.930> decal<00:01:40.380> under<00:01:40.680> all

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
does say 22 s be on a decal under all

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.780 
does say 22 s be on a decal under all
the<00:01:40.920> paint

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
the paint

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:44.820 
the paint
right<00:01:43.390> there<00:01:43.600> are<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.840> buckets<00:01:44.020> tops<00:01:44.470> and

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
right there are the buckets tops and

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.490 
right there are the buckets tops and
here's<00:01:45.790> Z<00:01:46.060> bar<00:01:46.240> linkage<00:01:46.630> I<00:01:46.810> found<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.200> Z<00:01:47.350> bar

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
here's Z bar linkage I found the Z bar

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.340 
here's Z bar linkage I found the Z bar
pretty<00:01:48.220> interesting<00:01:49.020> they're<00:01:50.020> actually

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
pretty interesting they're actually

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.350 
pretty interesting they're actually
they're<00:01:50.560> mounted<00:01:50.830> in<00:01:50.980> the<00:01:51.130> machine<00:01:51.460> in<00:01:52.180> the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
they're mounted in the machine in the

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.140 
they're mounted in the machine in the
loader<00:01:52.540> arms<00:01:53.310> now<00:01:54.310> you<00:01:54.370> can<00:01:54.580> see<00:01:54.790> even<00:01:54.940> though

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
loader arms now you can see even though

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.260 
loader arms now you can see even though
this<00:01:55.270> is<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:55.450> very<00:01:55.800> old<00:01:56.800> machine<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.790> arms<00:01:58.120> are

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
this is a very old machine the arms are

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.160 
this is a very old machine the arms are
pretty<00:01:58.570> much<00:01:58.900> new<00:01:59.200> so<00:01:59.530> I'm<00:02:00.010> guessing<00:02:00.580> it's<00:02:00.760> a

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
pretty much new so I'm guessing it's a

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.440 
pretty much new so I'm guessing it's a
late<00:02:02.170> 90<00:02:02.740> lead<00:02:03.340> early<00:02:04.260> no<00:02:05.260> uh<00:02:05.290> what<00:02:06.040> is<00:02:06.160> um<00:02:06.450> well

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
late 90 lead early no uh what is um well

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.880 
late 90 lead early no uh what is um well
I'm<00:02:07.540> assuming<00:02:08.369> late<00:02:09.369> 80s<00:02:09.880> early<00:02:10.270> 90s<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.830> you

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
I'm assuming late 80s early 90s and you

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.770 
I'm assuming late 80s early 90s and you
can<00:02:12.850> see<00:02:13.000> right<00:02:13.120> here<00:02:13.360> which<00:02:13.510> had<00:02:13.660> just

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
can see right here which had just

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.190 
can see right here which had just
figured<00:02:14.080> out<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.410> bend<00:02:14.650> 22s<00:02:15.310> be<00:02:15.630> two<00:02:16.630> cylinders

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
figured out a bend 22s be two cylinders

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.630 
figured out a bend 22s be two cylinders
the<00:02:17.380> curl<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.740> bucket<00:02:18.070> which<00:02:18.250> isn't<00:02:18.430> really

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
the curl the bucket which isn't really

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.190 
the curl the bucket which isn't really
that<00:02:18.820> common<00:02:19.330> on<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.480> machine<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:19.900> this<00:02:20.020> saw

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
that common on the machine of this saw

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.380 
that common on the machine of this saw
is<00:02:20.230> not<00:02:20.560> saying<00:02:20.800> it's<00:02:20.950> small<00:02:21.310> but<00:02:21.520> I've<00:02:22.150> never

the<00:02:41.110> other<00:02:41.260> side<00:02:41.530> of<00:02:41.560> it

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
the other side of it

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.140 
the other side of it
ladder<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.660> get<00:02:43.780> up<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.170> top<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:45.150> there's

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
ladder to get up to the top and there's

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.520 
ladder to get up to the top and there's
the<00:02:46.690> articulation<00:02:47.380> cylinder<00:02:49.290> now<00:02:50.290> there's

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
the articulation cylinder now there's

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.810 
the articulation cylinder now there's
the<00:02:50.709> engine<00:02:50.830> in<00:02:51.070> there<00:02:51.190> like<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.400> said<00:02:51.700> I'm

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
the engine in there like I said I'm

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.780 
the engine in there like I said I'm
assuming<00:02:52.300> a<00:02:52.360> Detroit<00:02:53.310> if<00:02:54.310> they're<00:02:54.520> hearing

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
assuming a Detroit if they're hearing

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.190 
assuming a Detroit if they're hearing
one<00:02:55.000> I'm<00:02:55.120> not<00:02:55.209> sure<00:02:55.420> if<00:02:55.510> this<00:02:55.630> one<00:02:55.780> is<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:55.930> quick

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
one I'm not sure if this one is a quick

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.710 
one I'm not sure if this one is a quick
but<00:02:56.380> most<00:02:56.650> of<00:02:56.739> these<00:02:56.830> machines<00:02:57.220> are<00:02:57.630> here's<00:02:58.630> a

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
but most of these machines are here's a

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.120 
but most of these machines are here's a
back<00:02:58.930> counterweight<00:02:59.470> and<00:02:59.650> the<00:03:00.310> radiator<00:03:02.130> now

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
back counterweight and the radiator now

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.490 
back counterweight and the radiator now
here's<00:03:03.340> this<00:03:03.519> side<00:03:03.760> of<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:03.910> machine<00:03:04.500> you'd

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
here's this side of the machine you'd

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.870 
here's this side of the machine you'd
see<00:03:05.650> what<00:03:05.800> really<00:03:05.980> sticks<00:03:06.340> out<00:03:06.489> is<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.730> air

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
see what really sticks out is the air

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.400 
see what really sticks out is the air
cleaner<00:03:07.180> it's<00:03:07.420> mounted<00:03:07.780> right<00:03:07.930> on<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.200> side

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
cleaner it's mounted right on the side

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:15.229 
cleaner it's mounted right on the side
there<00:03:08.709> and<00:03:09.900> there<00:03:10.900> is<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.019> exhaust<00:03:13.709> and

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
there and there is the exhaust and

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.580 
there and there is the exhaust and
pretty<00:03:16.239> much<00:03:16.420> just<00:03:17.340> this<00:03:18.340> side<00:03:18.610> again<00:03:19.590> now

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
pretty much just this side again now

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:29.110 
pretty much just this side again now
I'll<00:03:20.950> take<00:03:21.160> you<00:03:21.310> up<00:03:21.489> on<00:03:21.730> it

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.150 

now<00:03:29.660> here's<00:03:29.989> the<00:03:30.200> view<00:03:30.349> that<00:03:30.500> you<00:03:30.620> get<00:03:30.769> up<00:03:30.890> from

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
now here's the view that you get up from

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.080 
now here's the view that you get up from
up<00:03:31.340> on<00:03:31.580> it<00:03:31.790> here's<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.720> operator<00:03:33.140> station

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
up on it here's the operator station

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.979 
up on it here's the operator station
pretty<00:03:35.090> much<00:03:35.300> just<00:03:35.540> standard<00:03:37.629> and<00:03:38.629> here's<00:03:38.870> the

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
pretty much just standard and here's the

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:49.250 
pretty much just standard and here's the
air<00:03:39.110> cleaner<00:03:39.410> and<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.860> back

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.949 

so<00:03:50.260> I<00:03:50.760> mean<00:03:51.760> that's<00:03:51.849> pretty<00:03:52.150> much<00:03:52.270> it<00:03:52.630> like<00:03:52.840> I

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
so I mean that's pretty much it like I

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.229 
so I mean that's pretty much it like I
said<00:03:53.140> sorry<00:03:53.410> there's<00:03:53.650> no<00:03:53.739> specs<00:03:54.160> on<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:54.430> but<00:03:55.209> I

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:55.239 
said sorry there's no specs on it but I

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.059 
said sorry there's no specs on it but I
thought<00:03:55.510> it'd<00:03:55.690> be<00:03:55.720> cool<00:03:56.170> even<00:03:56.470> just<00:03:56.680> to<00:03:56.770> show

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:57.069 
thought it'd be cool even just to show

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.580 
thought it'd be cool even just to show
it<00:03:57.280> because<00:03:57.790> people<00:03:58.599> barely<00:03:59.140> even<00:03:59.230> know<00:03:59.440> what

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
it because people barely even know what

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.220 
it because people barely even know what
it<00:03:59.709> is<00:04:00.270> there<00:04:01.270> you<00:04:01.300> have<00:04:01.480> it<00:04:01.599> a<00:04:01.660> Benari<00:04:01.989> 22<00:04:02.650> SB
