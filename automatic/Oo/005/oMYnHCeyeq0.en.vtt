00:01:09.279 --> 00:01:09.289 
north of the Big Island then it could be

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.200 
north of the Big Island then it could be
a<00:01:09.320> lot<00:01:09.860> stronger<00:01:10.310> than<00:01:10.520> we<00:01:10.729> were<00:01:10.850> thinking

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
a lot stronger than we were thinking

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.630 
a lot stronger than we were thinking
before<00:01:11.390> and<00:01:11.840> indeed<00:01:12.530> that<00:01:12.950> appears<00:01:13.340> to<00:01:13.520> be

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
before and indeed that appears to be

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.790 
before and indeed that appears to be
what<00:01:14.330> is<00:01:14.450> going<00:01:14.720> to<00:01:14.750> occur<00:01:15.140> with<00:01:15.380> this<00:01:15.560> system

what is going to occur with this system

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.779 
what is going to occur with this system
as<00:01:16.160> a<00:01:16.640> five<00:01:17.090> a.m.<00:01:17.300> eastern<00:01:17.840> time<00:01:18.110> was<00:01:18.740> at<00:01:18.890> 18.4

00:01:26.589 --> 00:01:26.599 
the 90 is moving west-northwest at 11 so

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:28.930 
the 90 is moving west-northwest at 11 so
it<00:01:26.720> slowed<00:01:27.050> down<00:01:27.289> but<00:01:27.530> it<00:01:27.649> has<00:01:27.860> continued<00:01:28.729> to

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
it slowed down but it has continued to

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.419 
it slowed down but it has continued to
have<00:01:29.360> a<00:01:29.390> northwest<00:01:30.140> component<00:01:30.830> to<00:01:30.950> its<00:01:31.099> track

were<00:02:17.659> in<00:02:17.780> Florida<00:02:18.290> I'd<00:02:18.379> be<00:02:18.560> a<00:02:18.590> little<00:02:18.799> bit<00:02:19.010> more

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:19.189 
were in Florida I'd be a little bit more

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:20.620 
were in Florida I'd be a little bit more
on<00:02:19.430> edge<00:02:19.700> just

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
on edge just

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.060 
on edge just
because<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:21.110> the<00:02:21.200> fact<00:02:21.440> that<00:02:21.590> some<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:22.010> the

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
because of the fact that some of the

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.980 
because of the fact that some of the
model<00:02:22.370> guidance<00:02:22.550> is<00:02:22.970> hinting<00:02:23.390> that<00:02:23.570> this

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
model guidance is hinting that this

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.300

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
ridging than originally thought

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.890

nonetheless<00:02:27.880> if<00:02:28.880> it<00:02:29.090> were<00:02:29.210> to<00:02:29.330> take<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.660> right

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
good you can see but obviously it just

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.880 
good you can see but obviously it just
spent<00:03:10.160> you<00:03:10.970> know<00:03:11.230> most<00:03:12.230> of<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.470> night<00:03:12.620> over

storm<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.220> fact<00:03:16.430> that<00:03:16.520> it<00:03:16.700> intensified<00:03:17.510> into

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
storm the fact that it intensified into

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.450 
storm the fact that it intensified into
that<00:03:18.050> is<00:03:18.290> very<00:03:19.220> very<00:03:20.290> concerning<00:03:21.290> for<00:03:22.040> areas

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:22.460 
that is very very concerning for areas

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.330 
that is very very concerning for areas
further<00:03:22.850> to<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.270> west<00:03:23.510> no<00:03:23.780> doubt<00:03:23.990> about<00:03:24.140> that

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
further to the west no doubt about that

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.950 
further to the west no doubt about that
Irene<00:03:25.340> is<00:03:25.370> a<00:03:25.520> hurricane<00:03:25.940> the<00:03:26.420> first<00:03:26.690> of<00:03:26.870> the

Irene's<00:03:34.910> intensity<00:03:35.600> will<00:03:35.780> depend<00:03:36.140> on<00:03:36.230> a<00:03:36.260> few

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
Irene's intensity will depend on a few

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
things first of all it will interact

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.820 
things first of all it will interact
with<00:03:38.150> Hispaniola<00:03:38.990> so<00:03:39.170> it<00:03:39.260> probably<00:03:39.530> won't

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830 
with Hispaniola so it probably won't

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.730 
with Hispaniola so it probably won't
intensify<00:03:40.460> much<00:03:40.790> unless<00:03:41.570> it<00:03:41.780> moves<00:03:42.020> far

the top of it that's why the circulation

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.340 
the top of it that's why the circulation
has<00:04:28.729> strengthened<00:04:29.210> so<00:04:29.419> much<00:04:29.630> tonight<00:04:30.080> and

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
has strengthened so much tonight and

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.860 
has strengthened so much tonight and
into<00:04:30.590> this<00:04:30.830> morning<00:04:30.910> however<00:04:31.910> as<00:04:32.270> it<00:04:32.450> moves<00:04:32.630> up

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
into this morning however as it moves up

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.119 
into this morning however as it moves up
towards<00:04:33.140> these<00:04:33.290> coasts<00:04:33.680> it<00:04:33.860> should

00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:34.129 
towards these coasts it should

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:36.399 
towards these coasts it should
continue<00:04:34.669> to<00:04:34.759> have<00:04:34.969> that<00:04:35.270> and<00:04:35.539> that<00:04:36.199> will

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:36.409 
continue to have that and that will

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:38.439 
continue to have that and that will
likely<00:04:36.619> mean<00:04:37.009> further<00:04:37.699> intensification

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
likely mean further intensification

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:41.619 
likely mean further intensification
perhaps<00:04:39.259> even<00:04:39.499> into<00:04:40.249> a<00:04:40.279> major<00:04:40.639> hurricane<00:04:41.089> a

perhaps even into a major hurricane a

perhaps even into a major hurricane a

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
out of the question you can see the

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:51.100 
out of the question you can see the
consensus<00:04:49.489> of<00:04:49.639> the<00:04:49.699> models<00:04:50.479> is<00:04:50.629> still<00:04:50.839> to<00:04:50.989> the

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:51.110 
consensus of the models is still to the

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:53.049 
consensus of the models is still to the

00:04:53.049 --> 00:04:53.059 
right of the Hurricane Center but there

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:55.239 
right of the Hurricane Center but there
is<00:04:53.209> the<00:04:53.419> opportunity<00:04:53.689> like<00:04:54.289> the<00:04:54.409> gfdl<00:04:54.830> shows

00:04:55.239 --> 00:04:55.249 
is the opportunity like the gfdl shows

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:57.100 
is the opportunity like the gfdl shows
and<00:04:55.550> the<00:04:56.029> UK<00:04:56.179> meant<00:04:56.569> for<00:04:56.719> this<00:04:56.809> to<00:04:56.869> move

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
and the UK meant for this to move

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.649 
and the UK meant for this to move
further<00:04:57.379> west<00:04:57.610> although<00:04:58.610> they<00:04:58.759> may<00:04:58.939> be<00:04:58.999> too

00:04:59.649 --> 00:04:59.659 
further west although they may be too

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:02.529 
further west although they may be too
far<00:04:59.929> west<00:05:00.349> in<00:05:00.619> the<00:05:00.800> short<00:05:01.159> term<00:05:01.459> they<00:05:02.089> might<00:05:02.360> be

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
far west in the short term they might be

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:04.239 
far west in the short term they might be
right<00:05:02.809> on<00:05:02.989> in<00:05:03.199> the<00:05:03.289> longer<00:05:03.709> term<00:05:03.739> and<00:05:04.219> that

00:05:04.239 --> 00:05:04.249 
right on in the longer term and that

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:06.850 
right on in the longer term and that
would<00:05:04.819> be<00:05:04.849> very<00:05:05.300> very<00:05:05.479> bad<00:05:05.929> news<00:05:06.229> because<00:05:06.679> that

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
would be very very bad news because that

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.159 
would be very very bad news because that
would<00:05:07.009> mean<00:05:07.189> no<00:05:07.729> it<00:05:07.939> doesn't<00:05:08.269> spend<00:05:08.539> time<00:05:08.809> over

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
would mean no it doesn't spend time over

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:10.929 
would mean no it doesn't spend time over
the<00:05:09.319> land<00:05:09.559> masses<00:05:09.800> that<00:05:10.159> can<00:05:10.339> weaken<00:05:10.639> it<00:05:10.789> but

00:05:10.929 --> 00:05:10.939 
the land masses that can weaken it but

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:14.549 
the land masses that can weaken it but
yes<00:05:11.179> it<00:05:11.360> hits<00:05:11.569> South<00:05:11.809> Florida<00:05:12.499> at<00:05:12.979> the<00:05:13.539> utmost

00:05:14.549 --> 00:05:14.559 
yes it hits South Florida at the utmost

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:17.529 
yes it hits South Florida at the utmost
intensity<00:05:15.559> and<00:05:15.800> it<00:05:15.979> then<00:05:16.699> again<00:05:16.969> it<00:05:17.119> can<00:05:17.240> still

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
intensity and it then again it can still

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:19.540 
intensity and it then again it can still
be<00:05:17.569> very<00:05:17.809> intense<00:05:18.559> and<00:05:18.709> strengthening<00:05:19.309> by<00:05:19.490> the
