00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.990
 hello family today I bring you others 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.860
 polymer clay projects and today 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.020
 let's make a carrot basically 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.510
 for that we need only a 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:38.170
 little piece of polymeric orange as 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:42.010
 come on screen then we give the form 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:44.890
 of a carrot and we basically do 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.920
 an ojito with a needle in the part of 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.530
 up the carrot and then we take 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.860
 a little piece of green clay 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.440
 polymer and we're going to introduce it into the 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.820
 roll of the top of the carrot 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.040
 and then that we have already the form we 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.760
 let's take the needle again to 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.030
 give it the shape of a carrot as you see 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.030
 onscreen 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:20.460
 basically we are going to make two earrings 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:23.369
 or earrings as they are called and we are going to 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.430
 once we have one of them done 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.159
 let's do the second to make it 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.229
 almost the same size on screen 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.229
 I'm just showing you how to do 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.940
 an earring and then we take the swab 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.700
 with an eye and we put it in the part of 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.729
 above the carrot once we have 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.220
 the carrot already made we have two of 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.090
 them to make the earrings then 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.600
 we can put it in the ceramic plate that 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.150
 we will use to bake our 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.240
 polymer clay 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:03.540
 and basically what I do 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.790
 It is usually to gather several projects 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.500
 of polymer clay to have it 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.200
 all on a plate as you see here in 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.410
 screen here I have projects that already 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.380
 I finished and basically what I do is 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:19.050
 gather them all here on a surface 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.030
 that can be put in the oven can be 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.210
 metal but it it has to be something 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.520
 can put in the oven here come in 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:30.480
 screen what are the instructions 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.300
 to be able to sew to oppose in the oven the 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.400
 polymer clay and you can see 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:40.370
 clearly what are the requirements 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.170
 per inch 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.040
 basically once we have everything 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.530
 cooked 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.660
 as they come here and to the 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.060
 the carrot is cooked is fine 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.120
 hard then we have one to a ring 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.880
 for costume jewelery and we have a hook 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.910
 for jewelery and we put it to our 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.940
 carrot and basically we close the 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.040
 ring and we have our earring 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.360
 I hope you liked this one 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.360
 project and until next time
