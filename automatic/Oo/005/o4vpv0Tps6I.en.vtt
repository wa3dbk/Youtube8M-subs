00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:31.980

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:35.700
 before losing 15 what happened 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.489

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.480
 garden flaxseed love result from the 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.420
 my hair 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.280

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.129
 undo the curls 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.219
 I used to go without frizz 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.710
 also was with curls all a 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.750
 I did not set a 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.610
 soybeans without causing it to 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:01.289
 destroy justice that's what i came 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:05.280

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.310
 to use jorge vinhaÃ§a to stay without frizz 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.220
 there people what bothers me so much is 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.240
 no frizz and stick with the curls 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.700
 defined 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:20.520
 ah ah ah ah I use it but it's very difficult 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.360
 of the hair dryer where I go 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:28.290
 Electric dryers discharge loads 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.360
 negative power of the &amp; and causes 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.600
 dehydration on wire 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.230
 So I'll spend an hour in court. 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.290
 hair moisturizing my hair 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.420
 rebuilding the strands of my hair and 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.990
 then went straight to your computer or 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:48.740
 in the diffuser the party happens 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.690
 so I avoid many there besides that the 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.300
 My son is very thin. 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.870
 he is very firm any carlos in that 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.820

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.460
 always how to let go and let's go 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.560

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:10.000

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:23.510

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:27.740
