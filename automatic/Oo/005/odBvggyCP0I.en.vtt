00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:06.250
 hello good afternoon today let's see how 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:10.510
 they make a paper doll first 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:13.509
 you need a second blank sheet a 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.530
 permanent marker 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:19.730
 third 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:24.290
 a black plastic paint and 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:27.110
 fourth some markers and one red for 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.300
 the lips one blue for the eyes and for 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.090
 last one yellow for the face 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:38.430
 you can put it in another color the most 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:42.690
 you like more blue red yellow the one 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.780
 more you like it first we start 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.280
 With paper 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.280
 first you fold it like that 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.600
 when it is already bent in order to bend 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.600
 A) Yes 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:08.980
 then you do like this and you have to do like this 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:11.300
 like a ship but it's not super 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.240
 then nobles like that 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.689
 and when you have finally 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:22.659
 you have it so you have to take these 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:22.659
 tips and put them here 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.180
 then they turn it around and do the same 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.649
 and later 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.649
 with these tips you bend them like this 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.960
 and then the other side the same 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.580
 and you turn it around 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.580
 and you are doing the same 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:56.289
 when you do not have it like that you have to stay 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.970
 as well as a hat then you do so 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.190
 crush 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.450
 and looking at the line has to be all 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:03.610
 straight 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.640
 and how are you looking at the girl then 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.210
 you have to go doubling so big to 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.210
 wrong 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.630
 Then you have to see three 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.160
 dots 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.160
 this is going 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.680
 up 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:36.549
 and I'm here then when I already 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:39.159
 take this way when you go a radiation what 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.659
 you open then they come out there inside believe that 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:44.290
 stay like a hat but more 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:47.019
 small then you crush it again and 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.099
 when you're already staying like this you have 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.099
 that double 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.390
 until you're staying like a 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.390
 comecocos 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.420
 so 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:06.010
 after doing that with the marker 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:09.200
 permanent you make two eyes 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.620
 not here and another there 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:17.360
 can you make eyelashes 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:21.620
 I'll do it if you do not want to, do not do it 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:25.460
 then he covered it and took the blue marker 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.490
 and I paint inside 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:32.540
 when when it is no longer painted by 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:35.799
 inside you take the red 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.799
 and they paint his lips 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.900
 until you stay like this you turn around 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.900
 and they do the same 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.080
 But so 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:08.240
 and then when you wear 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.630
 then with the yellow he is painting 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.630
 to your 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.390
 painting and painting 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:00.060
 until it looks like that, they turn it around 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.060
 and they already do the same 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.950
 it has to be like that 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:49.090
 then it opens in the mouth and takes the 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:52.240
 marker again red 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:55.870
 and it 's a language you can do it 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:58.870
 paper or painting what I prefer painting 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.229
 you can not do it on paper like you 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.229
 like 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.850
 painting a limit 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:17.259
 after he has painted his tongue, coges 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.259
 plastidecor black and what is painting 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.360
 the bottom 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.370
 that has to be more or less 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.370
 easy 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:15.500
 so when I've already pointed it 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:22.000
 you put so it has to look like this 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:22.000
 You can make it tiny like this 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:34.949
 and a little bit bigger or two equal 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.949
 you can not make the hair you want 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:37.930
 see you soon
