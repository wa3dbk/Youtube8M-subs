00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.790
 the defender couple practice arm-wrestling 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.800
 20 years ago 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.560
 I started under the influence of my family 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.609
 it's a very peculiar case 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:27.210
 my mother my uncles fought the ottawa 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:31.320
 her brothers and my aunt my father fought 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.090
 Also there were practically precursors 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.829
 20 years ago it was very strange, you are 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.980
 a woman practicing a sport like this 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.600
 I had a great influence until it was 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.260
 placed as challenge I first won the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.840
 my mother after war my uncle an aunt 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:49.530
 that's where I started my own story and 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.750
 It was difficult because you 're used to it. 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.030
 to see certain people and when they start 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.920
 to call by the same surname as she has already 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.280
 there is great expectation 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.859
 I just started to give some good 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.780
 position from the moment I 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.430
 she called Julian eyes no more than 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.150
 device was a last name is more 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.600
 known 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.460
 I won four times the Brazilian and was 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.100
 world champion in 2004 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.040
 I currently ranked sixth in the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.479
 world by playing up to 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.400
 90 kg 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.270
 the championship is divided by categories 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:28.710
 between male and female 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:33.259
 female veterans master one master 2 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:37.079
 you also have the disabled juniors 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.659
 - the fight in the female is not that they have 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.270
 these divisions among the countries there 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.270
 practitioner today are more than 40 countries 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.210
 affiliated with the World Federation of 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.100
 which annually celebrates the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.899
 world championship in each 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.640
 world 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:59.610
 today's favorite countries the first ones there 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.640
 in the overall standings are russia 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.450
 east europe general ukraine 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.899
 turkey is also doing very well here in 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.610
 South America, Brazil is first 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.920
 we can say that now we start until 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.840
 overcoming North America is also the 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.989
 Brazil has a lot of strength mainly in 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:22.450
 female category and not deficient 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.700
 is big screen world champion has several 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.900
 currents there to explain the origin has 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.819
 people who say he was practiced 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.950
 by the Vikings more by the Egyptians more 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:37.989
 officially it began to be disputed 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:40.180
 in 1989 the first world championship 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:44.109
 arm wrestling held in canada 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.609
 Then he came to Brazil in Brasilia and 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.049
 here in brazil we already had four 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:51.700
 world championships 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:56.290
 the last one was right here in 2012 in 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:59.769
 City saint vincent 400,000 ended 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.109
 in order to place second place in the 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.299
 general classification the first Russian to 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:08.109
 people have championship for right-handers and 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:11.049
 logical lefties you win in your 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:13.810
 arm is not stronger 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.699
 you will not depend on the result in 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.829
 another arm to be the champion 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:21.040
 So we separate the championship just to 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.480
 ten years and only here won us first 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.900
 thing for who will get the job 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:29.169
 iron is not gaining muscle is a 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.419
 Massive muscle mass will not 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:34.290
 work the tendons first 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:37.959
 to avoid any kind of injury 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:41.230
 any kind of break anything 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:42.910
 related to the tendons that work 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.129
 much more than the muscles themselves 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:47.829
 so people have nerds that the 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:51.010
 practitioner of arm wrestling brÃ¡s is 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.760
 he's a big muscular person is not 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.530
 like this 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.590
 he will usually have a physical 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.970
 similar to one of the practitioners of 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:03.519
 gymnastics and strength comes much from the 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.750
 that would be a climb to the end in this has 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:10.510
 that have strength in the wrist in the 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.970
 shoulder hand then first begins with 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.560
 a lot of thinking working tendon and 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.049
 from there you will work a 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.030
 very specific musculature that is the 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:24.360
 forearm of the shoulder 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:28.530
 hand to footprint is very important part 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:30.270
 of the body that are most used to fight 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.200
 on the arm contrary to what many people 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.820
 think is not lawful is not exactly a 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.980
 shoulder to chest 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:42.380
 there is a lot of muscle recruitment 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:45.480
 Strong Shoulder Cloth Forearm 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.360
 reaching the abdomen that has to 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.730
 work the oblique to finish 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.980
 when Brazil is no longer enough and the 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:57.180
 Your own leg that just goes to support you. 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.470
 on the table to help the body push the 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:59.940
 your arm 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.240
 in fact it is without any trace of 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.060
 iron could not even be iron body 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:09.930
 that you use a whole set is a 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:13.610
 leverage sport of concentration 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:16.890
 of a muscle group and not only 15 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.770
 the championship it is done through a 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:22.169
 double elimination system , ie in the 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:26.610
 first round all athletes 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:28.620
 compete between themselves and from 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.750
 champion goes through a key to 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:33.450
 winners will pick who won and who 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.419
 lost goes to the recap losing 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.979
 a fight he is in the repechage and still 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.110
 has a chance to win 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:42.570
 will only be eliminated from the second 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.330
 defeat lost 2 is out 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.160
 in short the champion will be the one who 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.830
 do not lose two fights 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.740
 So for example I won a fight or 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:54.960
 2003 I reached the final I did not lose any 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:58.080
 I'll probably fight somebody 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.850
 who lost a fight halfway and 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:02.039
 so he has to win two of me 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.740
 in the final and I just have to win one 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:07.770
 because he already has a defeat 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.080
 usually follows this basic system 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:12.300
 two defeats is eliminated in the 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:15.169
 championship comes a point mainly 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.320
 When you already compete professionally 

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:21.479
 which does not make so much difference anymore 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.640
 exactly your previous preparation for the 

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:25.229
 and how are you in that 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.979
 day 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:31.440
 if you're nimble if you're calm 

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:33.700
 Can you have the presence of spirit? 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.280
 to change your technique 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:37.330
 another strategy within the 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.240
 same fight 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:42.460
 That's why the great trick is to control 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:45.460
 adrenaline to a point that is not 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:50.290
 healthy so you do not let it 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:53.380
 had your focus and follows you in the middle of 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:56.260
 a competition the force is not the main 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:07:00.460
 sure you can have strength but you have 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:02.830
 that knowing how to apply power is not 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:08.950
 nothing without control of the arm of iron to 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:12.760
 me it means what is priceless 

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:16.660
 the iron arm is what I do I have 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:18.580
 discipline and give up things that 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:22.180
 for other people it would be much more 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:24.340
 important logical the try does not give 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.710
 priority to this but certainly the 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:30.030
 You end up sometimes renouncing 

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:34.900
 work to a family relationship 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:38.380
 social in the name of a goal that only have 

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:41.350
 Sometimes value to you is the overcoming is 

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:44.920
 back sometimes from an injury and got 

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:47.770
 prove to yourself that you can 

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:51.930
 to realize a dream beyond style 

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:55.620
 of life is also a thing that is 

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:55.620
 really priceless
