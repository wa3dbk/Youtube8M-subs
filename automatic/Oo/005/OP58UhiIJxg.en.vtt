00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110

actually<00:01:45.560> being<00:01:45.740> rendered<00:01:46.159> at<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.369> time

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
actually being rendered at the time

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.000

objects<00:01:47.330> being<00:01:47.570> rendered<00:01:47.780> it<00:01:48.500> could<00:01:48.799> slow

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
objects being rendered it could slow

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.740 
objects being rendered it could slow
down<00:01:49.070> your<00:01:49.190> system<00:01:49.490> so<00:01:49.970> I<00:01:50.000> decided<00:01:50.510> to<00:01:50.570> go<00:01:50.720> down
