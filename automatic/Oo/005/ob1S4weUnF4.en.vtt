some people like to just blend it just a

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:43.830 
some people like to just blend it just a
little<00:02:42.549> bit<00:02:42.790> i<00:02:42.909> would<00:02:43.180> never<00:02:43.359> bring<00:02:43.569> it<00:02:43.689> down

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
little bit i would never bring it down

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.670 
little bit i would never bring it down
here<00:02:44.169> if<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:44.319> have<00:02:44.409> to<00:02:44.530> bring<00:02:44.620> your

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
here if you have to bring your

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.559 
here if you have to bring your
foundation<00:02:45.219> all<00:02:45.340> the<00:02:45.400> way<00:02:45.459> down<00:02:45.609> here<00:02:45.849> I<00:02:46.000> think

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
foundation all the way down here I think

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.030 
foundation all the way down here I think
you<00:02:46.629> need<00:02:46.750> to<00:02:46.780> try<00:02:46.959> to<00:02:47.079> find<00:02:47.530> a<00:02:47.590> new<00:02:47.680> foundation

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
you need to try to find a new foundation

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.429 
you need to try to find a new foundation
but<00:02:48.819> sometimes<00:02:49.329> to<00:02:49.659> bring<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:49.989> down<00:02:50.019> your<00:02:50.290> neck

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439 
but sometimes to bring it down your neck

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.189 
but sometimes to bring it down your neck
a<00:02:50.469> little<00:02:50.739> bit<00:02:50.919> is<00:02:51.099> okay<00:02:51.219> but<00:02:52.180> as<00:02:52.659> you<00:02:52.810> can<00:02:52.930> see

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:53.199 
a little bit is okay but as you can see

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:55.619 
a little bit is okay but as you can see
looks<00:02:53.829> really<00:02:54.189> good<00:02:54.370> whereas<00:02:54.909> really<00:02:55.180> well<00:02:55.359> it

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
looks really good whereas really well it

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.449 
looks really good whereas really well it
gives<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.900> really<00:02:55.930> pretty<00:02:56.319> effect<00:02:56.709> on<00:02:56.859> camera

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
gives a really pretty effect on camera

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.819 
gives a really pretty effect on camera
and<00:02:57.669> it's<00:02:58.480> just<00:02:58.750> a<00:02:58.840> really<00:02:58.870> great<00:02:59.230> foundation

00:02:59.819 --> 00:02:59.829

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.819 
ahead and do the other side of my face
actually<00:03:04.540> switch<00:03:04.870> brushes<00:03:05.379> I'm<00:03:05.560> going<00:03:05.709> to<00:03:05.769> be

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
actually switch brushes I'm going to be

now using my flat top bronzer brush from

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.659 
now using my flat top bronzer brush from
sonia<00:03:08.530> kashuk<00:03:08.709> my<00:03:09.040> little<00:03:09.310> knives<00:03:09.459> but

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069 
shutting like crazy and I think it's

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:14.879 
shutting like crazy and I think it's
because<00:03:12.159> I<00:03:12.430> may<00:03:12.909> not<00:03:13.120> have<00:03:13.709> conditioned<00:03:14.709> it

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:14.889
