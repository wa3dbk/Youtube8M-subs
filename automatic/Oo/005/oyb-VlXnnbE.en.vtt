00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:06.700
 very good to all youtube people me 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.280
 I am road form and today I come to you 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.040
 with a trick to facilitate this blocking 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.680
 of suits or hats on his rival in the 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.810
 game heads or if you want to meet him 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.810
 I invite you to keep watching my video 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.870
 i 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:37.309
 this trick only works on your rival in 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.980
 the game heads soccer is totally 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:43.010
 usable for ios devices and 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.500
 This is about unlocking 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.290
 any helmet that you want in 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.930
 the number 10 match of his opponent against 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.239
 the robot to show you how it works 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.000
 we go to the game and from there we will go 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.400
 a survival 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.590
 and from here we will start from the first 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.570
 party and we will arrive until the tenth 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:07.250
 as we all know the tenth survival if 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.560
 we unlock a hat that is going to be 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.410
 always simple or low- end to 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.270
 defeat the robot but this time it will not 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.480
 If so it will block that 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.420
 we want 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.330
 and we can choose any doll that 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:27.400
 you want in my case is this and I'm going 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.400
 with the matches and I'll be right back 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.200
 ah 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.200
 Y 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.290
 do not 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.170
 ah 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.170
 God 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.329
 we go 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.329
 all right 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.879
 Y 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.799
 do not 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.930
 good 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.910
 ah 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.210
 what 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.560
 total 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.560
 all right 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.079
 Y 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:59.780
 even though 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.299
 yes no 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.560
 and how is it 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.880
 no no no 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.510
 as I told you we're just going to get to this 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.060
 fight with until we find the 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.610
 robot when we are in this combat 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:47.310
 when we start promptly 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:51.070
 let's go to the pause button and we're going 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.680
 to leave this one 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.790
 How are you 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.130
 we do not go out 

00:04:54.790 --> 00:05:00.040
 and from here we 're going to go to any 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:02.890
 competition or the one you want in 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:07.500
 my case I make that arch since all 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.500
 the characters have helmets or suits 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:14.060
 we can choose anyone 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:18.229
 We will give you 10 to continue and we will 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:21.410
 start the match here they will see if the 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:23.610
 opposing character likes the helmet 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.830
 What do you have 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.590
 and if so where and we will not go 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:32.050
 to the pause button and we'll surrender 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.180
 thing out of competition 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.150
 that we are 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.669
 we go to menu and we go back to survival 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:42.400
 when we are here it is also like 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:45.070
 any character and we're going to give it in 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:49.129
 continue in its place that we had done 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:51.559
 previously that is let's give it yes 

00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:53.929
 when we are here we will notice that the 

00:05:51.559 --> 00:05:55.669
 robot is going to have the hat of 

00:05:53.929 --> 00:06:00.030
 opponent that we were fighting 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:02.100
 previously as you will observe 

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.890
 first you have to defeat it to be able to 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.400
 unlock the hat as any 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.400
 his rival 

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.730
 as you will observe just unlock the 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.390
 hat 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:26.460
 normally now with this simple trick 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:29.460
 we will be able to block any 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.390
 hat that we want and what 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:36.420
 We can use when you like 

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:40.080
 as you will observe we are not going to leave anymore 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:42.270
 this does not go out we go to any tournament 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.720
 that you want let's go arcade 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:49.040
 and we choose the suit to look for is that 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.040
 we just unlock 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:53.690
 Y 

00:06:56.670 --> 00:07:03.900
 as you will see here you can find 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:06.810
 buy and equip we started it on 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:10.440
 party and you will see that my character already 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:14.130
 has this hat 

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:18.860
