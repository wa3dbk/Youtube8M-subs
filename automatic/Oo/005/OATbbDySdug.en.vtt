00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.069
 Overhead wires and lifting equipment can be a dangerous combination. 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.300
 You don't even have to touch the wires. 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.070
 When the wires are close enough, the electricity will jump like a lightning bolt. 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.000
 This is called flashover, and it is a thing that happens to a young worker. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.710
 The worker is behind a rental venue. 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.300
 Cleaning and maintenance inspection of two scissor lifts. 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.300
 Maintenance inspections include raising the lift to the highest point. 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.800
 The worker has completed the overhaul of one of the lifts. 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.900
 He moved another lift from the washing area to the back of the yard. 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.000
 There are 138 kV and 25 kV high voltage wires on it. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 One kilovolt is equal to 1,000 volts, so 25 kilovolts is equal to 25,000 volts. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.500
 The label on the lifting platform warns that it is far from the wire. 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.300
 A worker from the merchant next door has just arrived. 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.400
 She saw young workers standing in the middle of the elevated platform. 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.900
 The worker began to lift his right arm to the wire. 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.700
 It seems to be a way of defense. 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.700
 Electricity flashed from the 25,000 volt line to the workers. 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.400
 Then pass to the ground through the scissor lift. 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:28.600
 This radio wave shock was so severe that it left a scorch on the ground where the lifting platform touched the concrete. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.600
 The worker was seriously injured and failed to survive. 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.200
 We can learn three main lessons from this incident: 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.900
 Keep at least 3 or 10 feet away from the wires. 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:48.400
 This applies to power lines from 750 volts to 75 kilovolts. 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.710
 Higher voltages need to be kept farther away. 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.700
 Implement control measures such as visual aids or barriers to protect workers from overhead wiring. 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.200
 Don't just rely on the ability of the worker to judge the distance from the route. 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.600
 After the accident, a warning sign was installed at the rental site. 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.719
 Young and new workers should be trained to enable them to work safely. 

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:16.560
 Although the help of senior workers is essential, 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.189
 But training can't just rely on these. 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:24.400
 This can result in inconsistent training and long-term errors. 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:32.200
 It should include well-structured training, which means setting up and requiring workers to follow a safety-focused training program. 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.400
 Do training records. 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.519
 Overhead wires mean danger. 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.800
 Look up, stay away from danger and stay safe.
