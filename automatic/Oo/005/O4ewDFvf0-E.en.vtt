00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.610
 Y 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.040
 yes 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.469
 and goes to the rubén corner because I have 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.450
 fear of commitment time with a friend 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.240
 and the neck was hurt the other day 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.360
 yawning yawning and guy did not stay 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.650
 how could he touch collar that was very 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.390
 fun because I love people who 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.890
 bring a collar so that shock puts the 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.269
 collarín there was you put them collarín 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.949
 because it's very fun to annoy them 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:28.810
 always put back the letter on 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.619
 collar and they make him well in the shoulder and 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.619
 have to flip like 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.480
 I could members 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.350
 I love I love that about me 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.660
 steal will be hurt but I do not understand 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.360
 I realized that it is never exercise 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.710
 never and it hurts all the time the 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.790
 people who do not exercise are hurt 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.640
 all the time for example the other day 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:55.060
 a friend sent me a message he puts me 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.280
 of I think I have athlete's foot I ok 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.730
 there are two things that we have to consider 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.320
 the first because I have a friend who 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.220
 think you can tell me you have standing 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.990
 of athlete, I mean, I am a 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.900
 friend who does not judge and everything previously 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.400
 then bother obviously but the good 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.140
 of the communication right now is that 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.490
 there whatsapp in your friends can you 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.070
 say whatever and they'll never see your 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.680
 face and that bothers you a lot because you put 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.390
 blog dilithium contact and no problem 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.510
 the second thing that you have to consider 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:30.080
 it's because he says he has athlete's foot 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.460
 if in his life eight exercise that is that 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.140
 that disease is wrong 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.670
 dt to change the name or if you are 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.490
 a person who does a lot 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.530
 exercise and in the pool you get 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.880
 on the trampoline or on the fish I do not know where 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.640
 contagious athletes when they are 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.140
 barefoot or whatever and you are very 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.880
 athlete I say that if I have athlete's foot 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.790
 but if you're one of those rockets that do not 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.310
 or run for your life because when you 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.810
 tremble and half you wait a little bit for 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.280
 see if the tremor is very strong 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.259
 how bad it is to run 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.930
 or what do you think there is already an exercise 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.259
 because you steamed and already auctioned 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:09.599
 then that counts, you can not say 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.830
 that you have athlete's foot of that 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.560
 disease should change the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.120
 name of standing up must buy you 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.709
 a treatment and do not say you're 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.709
 athlete I feel
