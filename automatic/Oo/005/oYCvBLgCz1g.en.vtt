00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
get a dividend but it and that's

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.389 
get a dividend but it and that's
understandable<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.500> don't<00:00:47.039> think<00:00:47.250> they

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
understandable I don't think they

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.580 
understandable I don't think they
understand<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> math<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.629> though<00:00:48.840> then<00:00:49.350> in

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
understand the math of it though then in

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.680 
understand the math of it though then in
the<00:00:49.620> fact<00:00:49.920> we<00:00:50.430> would<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:50.760> been<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.059> lot<00:00:51.149> poor

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
the fact we would have been a lot poor

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.540 
the fact we would have been a lot poor
if<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.079> pay<00:00:52.260> dividends<00:00:52.710> over<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.039> year<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
if we pay dividends over the year the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.639 
if we pay dividends over the year the
shareholders<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.030> Berkshire<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.379> I

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
shareholders of Berkshire and and I

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:56.990 
shareholders of Berkshire and and I
think<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:56.010> will<00:00:56.129> continue<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.730> be<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> case

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
think that will continue to be the case

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.970 
think that will continue to be the case
I<00:00:57.360> can't<00:00:57.539> prove<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.620> will<00:00:58.710> continue

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
I can't prove that but it will continue

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.860 
I can't prove that but it will continue
to<00:00:59.129> be<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.340> case<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.789> wondering<00:01:00.629> if<00:01:00.719> it

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
to be the case and wondering if it

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.139 
to be the case and wondering if it
changes<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.710> will<00:01:01.859> pay<00:01:02.010> dividends<00:01:02.430> another

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
changes we will pay dividends another

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.119 
changes we will pay dividends another
big<00:01:03.390> question<00:01:03.539> was<00:01:03.840> why<00:01:04.710> aren't<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.949> buying

back and rockets talk at again this is a

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.310 
back and rockets talk at again this is a
question<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.240> comes<00:01:09.420> up<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.659> fair<00:01:09.900> amount<00:01:09.990> you

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
must you must feel this kind of

must you must feel this kind of
interesting<00:01:12.840> keep<00:01:13.020> going<00:01:13.290> down<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.530> same

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
interesting keep going down the same

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.740 
interesting keep going down the same
path<00:01:13.950> about<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.549> well<00:01:15.060> we<00:01:15.240> announced<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
path about that well we announced the

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.170 
path about that well we announced the
price<00:01:15.960> at<00:01:16.140> which<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.470> would<00:01:16.729> buy<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.790> stock

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
price at which we would buy the stock

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.260 
price at which we would buy the stock
and<00:01:18.509> we<00:01:18.990> thought<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.320> was<00:01:19.409> only<00:01:19.560> fair<00:01:20.009> if<00:01:20.270> we're

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
and we thought it was only fair if we're

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.120 
and we thought it was only fair if we're
going<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.540> be<00:01:21.750> buying<00:01:22.049> out<00:01:22.259> our<00:01:22.439> partners<00:01:22.920> to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
tell them the conditions under which we

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.890 
tell them the conditions under which we
would<00:01:25.380> buy<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.619> they<00:01:25.860> way<00:01:26.119> we<00:01:27.119> want<00:01:27.750> them<00:01:27.810> to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
would buy it they way we want them to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.929 
would buy it they way we want them to
understand<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.710> couple<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.340> things<00:01:29.549> one<00:01:29.670> is

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
understand a couple of things one is

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.160 
understand a couple of things one is
that<00:01:29.970> we<00:01:30.299> think<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.720> they're<00:01:30.869> making<00:01:31.110> a

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
that we think that they're making a

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.350 
that we think that they're making a
mistake<00:01:31.320> if<00:01:31.710> they<00:01:31.860> sell<00:01:32.070> out<00:01:32.100> there<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.670> and

mind I tell you what I day right one of
the<00:01:47.729> big<00:01:47.880> questions<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.329> underlies<00:01:48.869> both

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
the big questions that underlies both

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.420 
the big questions that underlies both
those<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.590> amount<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:49.920> cash<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.399> have

those is the amount of cash you have

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.429 
those is the amount of cash you have
them<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:50.850> is<00:01:51.390> it<00:01:51.600> possible<00:01:51.630> you'll<00:01:52.170> end<00:01:52.350> up

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
them is is it possible you'll end up

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.749 
them is is it possible you'll end up
with<00:01:52.500> too<00:01:52.799> much<00:01:52.920> cash<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.460> you'll<00:01:53.549> end<00:01:53.700> up

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
with too much cash and you'll end up

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.340 
with too much cash and you'll end up
just<00:01:53.820> saying<00:01:54.180> we<00:01:54.450> have<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.600> do<00:01:54.810> something<00:01:55.110> with

just saying we have to do something with

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.569 
just saying we have to do something with
this<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.860> do<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.040> worry<00:01:56.189> about<00:01:56.250> that

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
this and you do you worry about that

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.999 
this and you do you worry about that
well<00:01:56.729> we<00:01:56.939> had<00:01:57.090> cash<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.719> well<00:01:58.320> into<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.649> 14

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
well we had cash in the well into the 14

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.929 
well we had cash in the well into the 14
0<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.369> billions<00:01:59.790> right<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.869> we<00:02:01.579> we<00:02:02.579> managed

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
0 the billions right and we we managed

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.310 
0 the billions right and we we managed
to<00:02:03.030> find<00:02:03.240> things<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.570> do<00:02:03.750> with<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:03.899> we<00:02:04.140> bought

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
to find things to do with it we bought

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.539 
to find things to do with it we bought
the<00:02:04.439> Burlington<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:04.979> cost<00:02:05.189> us<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.399> lot<00:02:05.490> of

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
the Burlington that cost us a lot of

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.910 
the Burlington that cost us a lot of
money<00:02:05.640> we<00:02:05.880> bought<00:02:06.030> things<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.509> fall<00:02:06.960> 2008<00:02:07.710> we

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
money we bought things in fall 2008 we

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.790 
money we bought things in fall 2008 we
bought<00:02:08.160> 11<00:02:08.550> billion<00:02:09.450> worth<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.899> IBM<00:02:10.259> last<00:02:10.530> year

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
bought 11 billion worth of IBM last year

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.670 
bought 11 billion worth of IBM last year
so<00:02:11.180> generally<00:02:12.180> speaking<00:02:12.480> we<00:02:12.720> find<00:02:12.959> it<00:02:13.110> but<00:02:13.230> it

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
so generally speaking we find it but it

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.649 
so generally speaking we find it but it
not<00:02:13.799> on<00:02:13.950> an<00:02:14.069> even<00:02:14.370> basis<00:02:14.730> week<00:02:14.939> by<00:02:15.150> week<00:02:15.359> or

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
not on an even basis week by week or

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.289 
not on an even basis week by week or
month<00:02:15.780> by<00:02:16.019> month<00:02:16.049> I<00:02:16.469> mean<00:02:16.620> it's<00:02:17.189> it<00:02:17.519> surges<00:02:18.120> and

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
month by month I mean it's it surges and

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.229 
month by month I mean it's it surges and
then<00:02:18.719> it<00:02:19.079> flows<00:02:19.349> and<00:02:19.739> so<00:02:19.950> then<00:02:20.129> you<00:02:20.549> feel<00:02:20.760> you

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
then it flows and so then you feel you

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.640 
then it flows and so then you feel you
must<00:02:21.510> feel<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:21.810> your<00:02:21.959> stock<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.379> a<00:02:22.409> little

must feel that your stock is a little

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.559 
must feel that your stock is a little
bit<00:02:22.769> out<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:22.920> out<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.519> favor<00:02:23.760> right<00:02:24.030> now<00:02:24.060> senses
