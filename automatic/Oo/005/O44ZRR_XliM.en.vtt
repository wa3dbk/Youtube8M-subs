00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.010
 but not 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.140
 so that the pitchers 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.830
 good 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.429
 to all 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.109
 no way 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.290
 to end the enemies of the 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.290
 highway 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.339
 of game 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.370
 welcome everyone once again to me 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.809
 channel frame I am here I am again 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.000
 with all of you to bring you and 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.129
 present this new video today Tuesday 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.949
 day 27 as you are already seeing we are 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.979
 new with ice combat in this mission of 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.780
 let's say it like that of the game in 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.960
 which, as you are already seeing, we are forming 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.430
 part of an Apache squad 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.890
 ah-64 or what is the same the 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.409
 most powerful anti-tank helicopter in 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.270
 world of which I will speak in a next 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.200
 occasion since there is much to be said for 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.000
 that piece of helicopter and in which 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:31.580
 we are assembled right now firing 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.220
 this mini gum that is the sh 60 or h 60 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.899
 blackhawk is worth many you have heard 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.840
 of him for the black hawk movie 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:42.600
 knocked down 'of course a very powerful 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.720
 helicopter a multifunction helicopter 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.080
 veteran already for many years the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.180
 backs and many battles already lived 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.070
 so if it had not happened to talk to you about 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.100
 him and the first thing that I'll say good 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.650
 that this mission that we are taking to 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:02.340
 out right now 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.650
 the version is the m 60 page that is a 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.030
 version that was created specifically for 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:11.700
 the american army to develop and 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.940
 carry out missions in hostile terrain 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.490
 like the one you are seeing 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.830
 squad gets inside the 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.950
 enemy territory then either to search 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.540
 to your troops or to rescue pilots or 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.780
 things of this kind are worth it but it is a 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.330
 pretty special version in the design 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.250
 as well as in the armor and the armament 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.080
 What is it worth now I will tell you more 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.330
 in detail is the version also more 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.050
 modern that this version is currently 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.670
 as i tell you m60 pib hop which only 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.770
 owns the american army as not 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.160
 could be otherwise in Spain 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:51.300
 we also have it in its sh60 version 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.860
 well hop and it is used as anti submarine 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.500
 vale is a version that uses the 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.330
 armed Spanish if I remember correctly are 8 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.060
 the units that you currently have in 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.230
 service is worth it then I'm going to start 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.610
 tell you about this helicopter even though 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.560
 I have told you several things saying 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.860
 which is a utility helicopter 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.280
 load 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.470
 being so it is my engine 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.990
 which moves it in two general electric 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.480
 700 the usual crew are two 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.130
 pilots plus two gunners and the load 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.200
 useful that you can carry are from a lathe to 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.120
 about fourteen soldiers or six stretchers 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.740
 depending on what it is for 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.800
 configured since there is also version 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.670
 medac the average version that is the doctor 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.250
 sanitary vale for evacuations 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.650
 the service chest that operational that 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.660
 has this helicopter are five thousand 790 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.720
 meters of height at which you can fly 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:43.020
 the speed is 295 kilometers to 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.430
 as maximum speed and in any case the 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.590
 armament that we carry the armament that 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.489
 you carry as you are already seeing is this 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:52.830
 mini gum m 134 of 7.62 mm with 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.480
 a terrible firepower is worth 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.630
 keep in mind that it takes one to each 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.180
 side so imagine what you can 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:04.080
 drop this this is not worth also I tell you 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:07.980
 that there are versions in which they mount 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.170
 missiles or rockets with hydra containers 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:14.370
 of 70 millimeters as well as missiles 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.019
 antitank to gm 114 hellfire is worth that already 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.090
 have to take it installed as a few 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:20.880
 small rooms that led to each side 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.950
 it is not the case of this version but usa 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.090
 also has that version that is a 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.580
 more attack version 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.410
 so well you imagine then two 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.990
 children have a stack of versions of 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.110
 this helicopter since the units 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:39.020
 built are between 2400 and 2,600 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.669
 distributed among many armies in the 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.560
 ricoh but also that the woman operated 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.230
 of all as well as Argentina austria 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.650
 Brazil 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:49.360
 what else bahrein israel arabia saudi no 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.860
 I know a lot of countries have this 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.080
 helicopter in service as was done 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.780
 previously also Spain worth 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.160
 also spain the missions that can 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.870
 develop this helicopter by looking 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.500
 from tactical transport of troops 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.470
 electronic warfare medical evacuation and 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.630
 How does Spain have it in its version? 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.030
 maritime valero submarine anti version 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:13.000
 the cost of the unit because for example 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.860
 the cost of each page since 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.560
 we are in which we are going up now 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.660
 same of 10.2 million dollars but 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.500
 the gouache version 60 the most basic 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:26.610
 let's say the black hawk is 5.9 to us 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.229
 6 million dollars each each bug of 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.000
 What more good things, then, than the 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.490
 concept of this utility helicopter 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.840
 of combat is that it has the duality of 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.960
 the systems to be able to support the 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.849
 enemy fire and let's say yes there 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.360
 one of the helicopters the other can 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:43.620
 continue to maintain control there is no one 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.870
 of the pilots the other can follow 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:50.830
 maintaining control of the aircraft 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:53.620
 then good is also designed from what 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:56.530
 which is the helicopter model it 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.240
 designed so that if there was a landing 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.870
 of imminent emergency the components 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.680
 will be reformed progressively 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:05.290
 thus protecting the passenger compartment from 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.600
 helicopter and that in this way then it 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.970
 achieves a more robust and capable design 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.620
 endure situations, let's say 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.590
 extreme 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:18.250
 what are you seeing extreme situation the 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:20.530
 that each motor is living 94 thousand 536 

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:22.919
 kilos and as I said before is 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:26.290
 taken therefore spirit turbine 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:28.930
 then you get an idea of 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.580
 potential of this gunman and well then 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.470
 we are almost reaching 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:34.750
 end here you are watching the development 

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:37.180
 already of the mission and we have six combat 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:39.460
 assault horizon 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.199
 and well, I hope you liked it 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.259
 I hope you are enjoying all the 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:46.840
 information that I'm going about about 

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:48.699
 these aircraft and these vehicles and 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.259
 well then we will continue with the series of is 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:51.850
 I wonder combat in 

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:52.770
 comments what is looking like if you 

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:56.289
 is liking 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:58.509
 and what do you think about it, so nothing 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:01.840
 guys for me as always kisses 

00:06:58.509 --> 00:07:03.250
 Hugs and the host like and favorites if 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:05.530
 you want the content of the video to 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:09.240
 deserves and we hear each other in the next 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.240
 video see you later
