00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.980
 hello everyone my name is carlos cardoso 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.219
 class today is to conjugate the computer 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.990
 hotusa on your windows 8 motif 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:16.360
 It's very simple, we have to 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.369
 move the mouse to the bottom corner 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.170
 right for example or for any 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.560
 area on the right that the boy goes to 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:27.460
 partner and from there will partner 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:30.400
 the settings is, and then the 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.800
 power button turn off your turn 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.430
 course to choose or suspend one is to stay and 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.700
 and Ghana yartey another way would be for 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.160
 example use the high key efe 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.700
 four years too much access 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.360
 fast the option to heal to use a 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.230
 little sky we have become a more accessible 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.410
 fast 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.270
 we could create a button could stay 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.980
 in the workplace or even in the 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.930
 windows 8 applications 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.329
 the place format as I have here by 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:06.850
 example how do we create this 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:08.200
 right side button new shortcut and that we 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.270
 Let's do it, it's nothing more, nothing less. 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.610
 create a shortcut to turn off the 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.229
 computer where there is a command 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:21.760
 for this feat that the UN chief 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.380
 space bar and do the following let's go 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.240
 ask what the name is for this shortcut 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.590
 and I will give the name of forcing us could 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.590
 be that rare 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:32.470
 any other with you fell we have 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.650
 to conclude that not only does it have the 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.689
 access the motorcycle to switch off the 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.189
 stay here more innovate we can make a 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:46.509
 the right to own the property and the 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:50.049
 section a shortcut change and koné the altar 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:54.939
 and Koné ok then choose a field 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.990
 do more aa use and can disconnect from 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.950
 a ok 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.079
 we apply here again and already 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.310
 here we have our tag to hang up 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:07.180
 We want to put this afternoon on the other 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.539
 side make the pitch to the right post and in 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.360
 ms is fixed initially as standard will not 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:16.590
 stop here at the end looks like the players 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.540
 because there were the left side 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.069
 for example just to make it easier 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.620
 what is it for when you are entering 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.410
 I work quickly to come here and I want 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.910
 win not turn off product we have here 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.310
 three alternatives to using the computer 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.550
