00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.339 

this<00:00:23.789> position<00:00:24.060> today<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.960> going<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.230> be<00:00:25.289> a

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
this position today is going to be a

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.490 
this position today is going to be a
full-blown<00:00:25.830> road<00:00:26.340> race<00:00:26.640> position<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:28.020> he's

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
full-blown road race position so he's

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.140 
full-blown road race position so he's
got<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:28.890> tall<00:00:29.189> skeleton<00:00:29.880> but<00:00:30.029> he's

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
got this tall skeleton but he's

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.439 
got this tall skeleton but he's
naturally<00:00:30.869> arrow<00:00:31.050> which<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.590> good<00:00:35.090> well<00:00:36.090> if<00:00:36.360> I

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
naturally arrow which is good well if I

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:43.430 
naturally arrow which is good well if I
look<00:00:36.600> up<00:00:36.750> here<00:00:36.930> too<00:00:37.020> how<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.170> measure<00:00:42.440> perfect

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
look up here too how you measure perfect

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.290 
look up here too how you measure perfect
the<00:00:43.890> advantage<00:00:44.400> of<00:00:44.610> getting<00:00:44.760> something<00:00:45.120> a

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the advantage of getting something a

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.240 
the advantage of getting something a
little<00:00:45.480> bit<00:00:45.690> narrower<00:00:46.079> as<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.589> help<00:00:46.800> tuck<00:00:47.040> your

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
little bit narrower as we help tuck your

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.670 
little bit narrower as we help tuck your
arms<00:00:47.610> in<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.659> that<00:00:48.690> you're<00:00:48.930> doing<00:00:49.140> less<00:00:49.379> work

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
arms in so that you're doing less work

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.619 
arms in so that you're doing less work
because<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.339> wind<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.699> hitting<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.300> as<00:00:51.390> much

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
because the wind is hitting you as much

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.170 
because the wind is hitting you as much
I<00:00:52.230> don't<00:00:52.710> want<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.980> do<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.309> get<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.640> so<00:00:53.879> tucked

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
I don't want to do is get you so tucked

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.259 
I don't want to do is get you so tucked
in<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.470> then<00:00:55.680> start<00:00:56.489> having<00:00:57.119> a<00:00:57.150> hard

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
in that you then start having a hard

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:58.820 
in that you then start having a hard
time<00:00:57.360> breathing<00:00:57.780> because<00:00:58.350> you're<00:00:58.500> sort<00:00:58.769> of

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
time breathing because you're sort of

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:00.439 
time breathing because you're sort of
squeezing<00:00:59.339> on<00:00:59.430> your<00:00:59.640> rib<00:00:59.760> cage<00:00:59.790> I<00:01:00.119> don't<00:01:00.269> think

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
squeezing on your rib cage I don't think

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.789 
squeezing on your rib cage I don't think
we're<00:01:00.629> there<00:01:00.659> yet<00:01:02.720> we<00:01:03.720> know<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.589> wind

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
we're there yet we know that in the wind

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.880 
we're there yet we know that in the wind
tunnel<00:01:05.210> this<00:01:06.210> is<00:01:07.310> more<00:01:08.310> arrow<00:01:09.560> than<00:01:10.560> that

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
tunnel this is more arrow than that

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.640 
tunnel this is more arrow than that
because<00:01:11.880> there's<00:01:12.180> more<00:01:12.360> arms<00:01:12.869> seeing<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
because there's more arms seeing the

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:20.450 
because there's more arms seeing the
wind<00:01:18.380> your<00:01:19.380> bank<00:01:19.560> about<00:01:19.770> bar<00:01:19.950> wit<00:01:20.130> they're

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
wind your bank about bar wit they're

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.060 
wind your bank about bar wit they're
good<00:01:20.630> at<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> 44<00:01:22.229> is<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.439> bike<00:01:22.619> game<00:01:22.860> list

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
good at the 44 is this bike game list

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.580 
good at the 44 is this bike game list
with<00:01:23.250> you<00:01:23.369> if<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.909> like<00:01:23.939> driving<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.420> bus<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.560> we

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
with you if you like driving a bus so we

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.520 
with you if you like driving a bus so we
can<00:01:25.799> put<00:01:25.890> some<00:01:26.100> markers<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.850> him<00:01:26.999> that<00:01:27.149> are

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
can put some markers on him that are

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.919 
can put some markers on him that are
infrared<00:01:28.530> sensitive<00:01:29.219> I<00:01:29.749> think<00:01:30.749> the<00:01:30.810> most

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:30.929 
infrared sensitive I think the most

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:32.330 
infrared sensitive I think the most
significant<00:01:31.530> for<00:01:31.679> him<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.950> going<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.130> be<00:01:32.219> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
significant for him is going to be the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.060 
significant for him is going to be the
way<00:01:32.999> we<00:01:33.030> address<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.689> z-plane<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.499> x<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.890> y<00:01:35.009> is

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
way we address the z-plane so x and y is

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.580 
way we address the z-plane so x and y is
the<00:01:35.340> side<00:01:35.579> view<00:01:35.609> the<00:01:36.570> Z<00:01:36.780> plane<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.350> front

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
the side view the Z plane is the front

fairly nice vertical neat racing got a

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.530 
fairly nice vertical neat racing got a
little<00:02:04.409> bit<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.619> looping<00:02:05.010> on<00:02:05.160> the<00:02:05.310> left<00:02:05.580> in<00:02:05.880> a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
little bit of looping on the left in a

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.419 
little bit of looping on the left in a
perfect<00:02:06.750> world<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.590> line<00:02:07.890> would<00:02:08.190> line<00:02:08.399> up

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429

perfect world that line would line up
right<00:02:08.580> over<00:02:08.850> your<00:02:09.330> foot<00:02:09.630> so<00:02:10.140> there's<00:02:10.380> your
