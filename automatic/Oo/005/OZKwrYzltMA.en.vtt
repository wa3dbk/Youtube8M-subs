they did in China I think and these
pieces<00:00:27.119> who<00:00:27.330> that's<00:00:27.510> better<00:00:27.720> but<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.500> boys

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
pieces who that's better but the boys

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.410 
pieces who that's better but the boys
they<00:00:28.830> get<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.099> job<00:00:29.279> done<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.880> was<00:00:30.000> the

they get the job done and that was the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.880 
they get the job done and that was the
hardest<00:00:30.689> thing<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.050> always<00:00:31.320> harder<00:00:31.619> playing

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890
