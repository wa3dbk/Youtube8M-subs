00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
two images and this is the coding if I

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.540 
two images and this is the coding if I
go<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.870> wide<00:00:37.140> view<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:38.129> hit<00:00:38.280> one<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.489> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
go to a wide view and I hit one of the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.420 
go to a wide view and I hit one of the
images<00:00:38.700> that's<00:00:39.329> what's<00:00:39.540> supposed<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.840> happen

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
images that's what's supposed to happen

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.610 
images that's what's supposed to happen
and<00:00:41.430> you'll<00:00:41.730> get<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:41.940> larger<00:00:42.300> image<00:00:42.620> but

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
and you'll get the larger image but

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.340 
and you'll get the larger image but
let's<00:00:43.770> do<00:00:43.920> this<00:00:44.219> let's<00:00:45.149> insert<00:00:45.510> our<00:00:45.750> own<00:00:45.930> image

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
let's do this let's insert our own image

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.130 
let's do this let's insert our own image
what<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.829> did<00:00:47.129> was<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.670> already<00:00:47.940> copy<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.600> line

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
what I did was I already copy the line

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.410 
what I did was I already copy the line
of<00:00:49.320> coding<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.800> needed<00:00:50.250> I'm<00:00:50.760> going<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.969> paste<00:00:51.149> it

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
of coding I needed I'm going to paste it

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.610 
of coding I needed I'm going to paste it
in<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:52.469> selects<00:00:53.460> let<00:00:54.149> me<00:00:54.239> do<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.629> I'll<00:00:55.020> just

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
in it selects let me do this I'll just

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.200 
in it selects let me do this I'll just
show<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.829> what<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.430> do<00:00:56.610> I'm<00:00:56.879> going<00:00:57.120> to

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
put it on a next line / drop it down a

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.860 
put it on a next line / drop it down a
bit<00:01:01.620> um<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.730> can<00:01:02.940> see<00:01:03.149> already<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.600> can<00:01:03.629> do

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
bit um so you can see already you can do

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.969 
bit um so you can see already you can do
what<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.049> want<00:01:04.140> with<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.500> coding<00:01:04.860> and

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
what you want with the coding and

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.490 
what you want with the coding and
positioning<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:06.420> that's<00:01:06.659> my<00:01:06.869> imaged<00:01:07.260> I<00:01:07.439> took

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
positioning and that's my imaged I took

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.870 
positioning and that's my imaged I took
and<00:01:08.030> let's<00:01:09.030> bring<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:09.900> up<00:01:10.110> here<00:01:10.549> and<00:01:11.549> close

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
and let's bring this up here and close

and let's bring this up here and close
that<00:01:12.049> white<00:01:13.049> view<00:01:13.409> just<00:01:13.950> closed<00:01:14.280> save<00:01:15.229> and

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
that white view just closed save and

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.170 
that white view just closed save and
show<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.590> actually<00:01:17.040> what<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.220> looks<00:01:17.400> like<00:01:17.610> so

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
show you actually what it looks like so

show you actually what it looks like so
there<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.450> go<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.110> working<00:01:19.369> thumbnail<00:01:20.369> to

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
there you go it's a working thumbnail to

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.280 
there you go it's a working thumbnail to
large<00:01:20.850> image<00:01:21.180> gallery<00:01:23.600> but<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.990> order<00:01:25.170> to

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
large image gallery but to in order to

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.770 
large image gallery but to in order to
get<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.799> stage<00:01:26.460> I'm<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.420> minimize

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
get to this stage I'm going to minimize

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.030 
get to this stage I'm going to minimize
this<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.430> show<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.490> what<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.180> actual

this and show you what the actual

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.670 
this and show you what the actual
extension<00:01:32.040> does<00:01:32.220> for<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:33.170> once<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.259> insert

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
extension does for you once you insert

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.340 
extension does for you once you insert
the<00:01:34.740> extension<00:01:35.490> into<00:01:35.939> your<00:01:36.600> document<00:01:36.780> and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
the extension into your document and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.810 
the extension into your document and
you're<00:01:37.979> going<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.130> probably<00:01:38.280> be<00:01:38.460> doing<00:01:38.610> this

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
you're going to probably be doing this

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.390 
you're going to probably be doing this
on<00:01:38.970> your<00:01:39.000> own<00:01:39.119> website<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:39.689> you're<00:01:39.780> using<00:01:39.990> this

on your own website if you're using this

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.770 
on your own website if you're using this
you<00:01:41.400> can<00:01:41.549> get<00:01:41.670> three<00:01:41.880> folders<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.570> get

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
you can get three folders you can get

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.260 
you can get three folders you can get
the<00:01:42.869> CSS<00:01:43.320> folder<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:44.220> images<00:01:44.640> folder<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
the CSS folder the images folder and the

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.969 
the CSS folder the images folder and the
scripts<00:01:45.630> folder<00:01:45.899> well<00:01:46.380> with<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.590> images

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
scripts folder well with the images

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.600 
scripts folder well with the images
folder<00:01:47.040> i<00:01:48.079> renamed<00:01:49.079> my<00:01:49.290> image<00:01:49.649> based<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.490> what

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
folder i renamed my image based on what

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.660 
folder i renamed my image based on what
they<00:01:50.729> did<00:01:50.970> already<00:01:51.320> for<00:01:52.320> example<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.130> name

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
they did already for example the name

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.480 
they did already for example the name
one<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:53.970> images<00:01:54.119> thickbox<00:01:54.869> demo

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
one of the images thickbox demo

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.749 
one of the images thickbox demo
underscore<00:01:56.490> img1<00:01:57.920> so<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:58.979> gave<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.399> same<00:01:59.579> name

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
underscore img1 so I gave the same name

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
if I split I come to the coding here

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.030 
if I split I come to the coding here
you're<00:02:13.260> going<00:02:13.379> to<00:02:13.470> see<00:02:13.560> that

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
it's where the line of coding is here so

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.270 
it's where the line of coding is here so
basically<00:02:16.140> what<00:02:16.260> i<00:02:16.290> did<00:02:16.530> was<00:02:16.680> i<00:02:16.860> just<00:02:17.069> copied
