00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.130
 and hear beaudry so that's 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.500
 impressive we are here in one of 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.250
 construction sites from dcns to lorient 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.250
 and the frigate we see there is going ben 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.230
 soon find his liquid element 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.290
 yes you are here in the form of 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.960
 construction of the center dcns de lorient 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:55.620
 where fremm ships are assembled 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.589
 when you have behind me the frigate 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.140
 multi-missions normandie that will be put to 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:03.510
 stream on Thursday, October 18th, 2012 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.820
 so that's when she goes 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.750
 actually discover for the first 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.850
 times her natural environment the water she was 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.250
 built here by element it's also 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.890
 very spectacular actually you 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.770
 have here in this form are assembled 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.960
 two big blocks that are rearming so 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.750
 pre equipped they are soldered to each 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.399
 others to ultimately constitute the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.550
 frigate as you can see her 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.140
 behind you how is the setting 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:33.080
 to water because it's still a 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.799
 hunk at 110 meters long 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.500
 actually it's a step 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.200
 extremely rhythmic and in the day 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.780
 since we are dependent on the schedules of 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.189
 the tide since the frigate is not going 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.280
 go straight to the sea but 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.310
 rather throw themselves into the scorff that 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.530
 so adjoins this shape so the first 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.630
 step is going to be filling the form with 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.720
 water by actually adapting to 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.960
 go to the tide times and when the 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.509
 frigate will finally float and well one 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.530
 can finally get it out here it's a 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.180
 always moving moment 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.619
 it's a movement a moment 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.170
 actually relate to movement for 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.880
 all the collaborators of the site dcns of 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.500
 lorient who have who contribute 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.049
 today in the frigates program 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.470
 fremm first frigate was started 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:22.739
 in 2007 and the last frigate will be 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.670
 delivered in 2022 including twelve frigates a 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.550
 series of twelve frigates in total 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.940
 that very beautiful building and whose 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.709
 missions will be as they say multiple 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.110
 actually it's a regatta 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:40.220
 multimissions so with missions 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.770
 anti earth anti underwater 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.450
 that meets the needs of the Marines 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:47.290
 of today and it's a frigate 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.810
 stealthy actually one of his 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.200
 remarkable qualities and its stealth 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.750
 in all areas stealth 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:01.100
 thermal stealth stealth radar 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.120
 so his very very great discretion 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.120
 acoustic also 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:25.160
 this is the last vision on the ground before 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.160
 to go to the sea
