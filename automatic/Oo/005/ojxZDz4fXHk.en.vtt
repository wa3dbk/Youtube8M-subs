insane amount of time and you can see
right<00:02:25.470> there<00:02:25.709> i<00:02:25.739> just<00:02:25.950> switched<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.340> gameplay

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
right there i just switched the gameplay

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.399 
right there i just switched the gameplay
a<00:02:26.700> little<00:02:26.940> bit<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.360> is<00:02:27.510> still<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:27.989> same<00:02:28.019> life

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
a little bit it is still the same life

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:29.930 
a little bit it is still the same life
but<00:02:28.590> i<00:02:28.620> wanted<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:28.950> cut<00:02:29.159> out<00:02:29.250> the<00:02:29.280> slow<00:02:29.610> parts

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
but i wanted to cut out the slow parts

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.030 
but i wanted to cut out the slow parts
because<00:02:30.209> this<00:02:30.360> was<00:02:30.629> this<00:02:31.110> was<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.319> really<00:02:31.620> slow

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
because this was this was a really slow

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.130 
because this was this was a really slow
nuclear<00:02:32.580> this<00:02:32.730> was<00:02:32.910> like<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.030> 7-minute<00:02:33.569> nuclear

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
nuclear this was like a 7-minute nuclear

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.470 
nuclear this was like a 7-minute nuclear
so<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:34.920> know<00:02:35.040> it's<00:02:35.220> still<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.670> pretty<00:02:36.269> good

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
so you know it's still a pretty good

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.449 
so you know it's still a pretty good
gameplay<00:02:36.900> but<00:02:37.019> it<00:02:37.140> was<00:02:37.230> really<00:02:37.500> slow<00:02:37.769> it<00:02:38.250> may

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
gameplay but it was really slow it may

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.250 
gameplay but it was really slow it may
not<00:02:38.610> even<00:02:38.670> be<00:02:38.940> ground<00:02:39.330> war<00:02:39.510> Kill<00:02:39.750> Confirmed<00:02:39.780> I

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
not even be ground war Kill Confirmed I

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.130 
not even be ground war Kill Confirmed I
actually<00:02:41.069> I<00:02:41.489> think<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.329> is<00:02:42.360> but<00:02:42.660> still<00:02:42.959> that's

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
actually I think it is but still that's

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.020 
actually I think it is but still that's
really<00:02:43.379> slow<00:02:43.650> i<00:02:43.680> had<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.980> play<00:02:44.220> not<00:02:44.790> really

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
really slow i had to play not really

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.309 
really slow i had to play not really
aggressive<00:02:45.450> mainly<00:02:45.720> because<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:46.049> fact<00:02:46.230> that

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
aggressive mainly because the fact that

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.839 
aggressive mainly because the fact that
i'm<00:02:46.470> playing<00:02:46.560> on<00:02:46.739> the<00:02:46.860> map<00:02:47.010> drone<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.640> drone

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
i'm playing on the map drone and drone
