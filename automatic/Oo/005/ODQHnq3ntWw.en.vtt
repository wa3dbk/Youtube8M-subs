background<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.949> know<00:00:28.980> what<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.490> song

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
background so I you know what this song

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.669 
background so I you know what this song
is<00:00:29.820> he<00:00:30.300> did<00:00:30.480> drop<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.720> song<00:00:31.019> not<00:00:31.260> too<00:00:31.380> long<00:00:31.619> ago

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
is he did drop a song not too long ago

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.190 
is he did drop a song not too long ago
on<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> soundcloud<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:33.329> was<00:00:33.450> incredibly<00:00:33.870> dope

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
on a soundcloud that was incredibly dope

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.220 
on a soundcloud that was incredibly dope
and<00:00:34.670> but<00:00:35.670> i<00:00:35.700> guess<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.329> unrelated<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.899> it

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
and but i guess this is unrelated to it

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.660 
and but i guess this is unrelated to it
because<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.770> is<00:00:37.890> produced<00:00:38.219> actually<00:00:38.579> by

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
because this is produced actually by

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.900 
because this is produced actually by
great<00:00:39.030> another<00:00:39.480> person<00:00:39.930> on<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.230> OMG<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:41.280> i<00:00:41.670> don't
