is<00:00:42.300> if<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.079> paddler<00:00:43.620> you're<00:00:43.829> helping<00:00:44.370> push

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
is if the paddler you're helping push

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.630 
is if the paddler you're helping push
really<00:00:45.530> emphasizes<00:00:46.530> pushing<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.399> boats

really helps to have a person that your

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.869 
really helps to have a person that your

I<00:01:02.910> find<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.930> very<00:01:03.989> helpful

your burning close to mine as I'm

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.200 
your burning close to mine as I'm
paddling<00:01:19.510> them<00:01:19.840> but<00:01:20.440> if<00:01:21.159> they<00:01:21.369> are<00:01:21.430> incapable

is a short line I keep on the front deck

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.060 
is a short line I keep on the front deck
of<00:01:36.369> my<00:01:36.490> boat<00:01:37.050> for<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.170> situations<00:01:38.860> where<00:01:39.040> I

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
of my boat for the situations where I

don't want to get out my full toe room I

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.770 
don't want to get out my full toe room I
call<00:01:42.310> it<00:01:42.430> a<00:01:42.520> contact<00:01:42.970> towline<00:01:43.450> because<00:01:43.660> I

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
call it a contact towline because I

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.260 
call it a contact towline because I
primarily<00:01:44.110> use<00:01:44.470> it<00:01:44.890> when<00:01:45.100> I'm<00:01:45.280> in<00:01:45.490> a<00:01:45.789> contact

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
primarily use it when I'm in a contact

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.300 
primarily use it when I'm in a contact
tow<00:01:46.600> and<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:46.899> person's<00:01:47.350> incapable<00:01:47.740> of<00:01:48.100> holding

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
well I can use it as a foot sling I can

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.490 
well I can use it as a foot sling I can
use<00:02:03.700> it<00:02:03.910> to<00:02:04.060> hold<00:02:04.270> a<00:02:04.450> group<00:02:04.720> a<00:02:04.869> bunch<00:02:05.410> of

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
big long tow system going to do

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:26.280 
big long tow system going to do
something<00:02:17.290> like<00:02:17.440> that

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.020 

yeah<00:02:27.290> I<00:02:27.320> can<00:02:27.530> also<00:02:27.680> use<00:02:27.830> my<00:02:27.950> contact<00:02:28.610> towline

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
yeah I can also use my contact towline

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.720 
yeah I can also use my contact towline
to<00:02:29.180> support<00:02:29.630> an<00:02:29.750> incapacitated<00:02:30.220> paddler<00:02:31.220> in<00:02:31.490> a
