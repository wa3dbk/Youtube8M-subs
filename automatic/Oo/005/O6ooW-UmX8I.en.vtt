00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
palliative care is a very new medical

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.610 
palliative care is a very new medical
specialty<00:00:08.820> I'd<00:00:09.630> say<00:00:09.870> palliative<00:00:10.290> care<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.530> a

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
specialty I'd say palliative care is a

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.190 
specialty I'd say palliative care is a
philosophy<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:11.610> it's<00:00:12.059> a<00:00:12.179> way<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.389> looking<00:00:13.019> at

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
philosophy and it's a way of looking at

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.880 
philosophy and it's a way of looking at
medicine<00:00:13.799> in<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.400> different<00:00:14.910> set<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:15.929> eyes<00:00:16.080> than

medicine in a different set of eyes than

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.960 
medicine in a different set of eyes than
most<00:00:17.160> of<00:00:17.340> us<00:00:17.430> have<00:00:17.609> been<00:00:17.640> screened<00:00:19.520> every<00:00:20.520> day

particular<00:00:27.599> ways<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:29.010> first<00:00:29.250> thing<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.849> I

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
particular ways the first thing is I

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.030

is<00:01:04.830> really<00:01:04.949> different<00:01:05.280> on<00:01:05.610> one<00:01:06.330> patient<00:01:06.780> I'll

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
is really different on one patient I'll

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.020 
is really different on one patient I'll
go<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.560> strictly<00:01:08.130> be<00:01:08.250> seen<00:01:08.430> them<00:01:08.610> for<00:01:08.729> pain

go in and strictly be seen them for pain

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.300 
go in and strictly be seen them for pain
very<00:01:09.780> early<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.260> their<00:01:10.380> illness<00:01:10.740> other

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
very early in their illness other

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.960 
very early in their illness other
patients<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.750> show<00:01:13.650> up<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:13.979> help<00:01:14.130> them<00:01:14.430> with<00:01:14.939> a

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
patients we show up and help them with a

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.120 
patients we show up and help them with a
lot<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.150> end-of-life<00:01:15.600> questions<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.650> helping

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
lot of end-of-life questions and helping

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.630 
lot of end-of-life questions and helping
them<00:01:17.250> have<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.790> dignified<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.689> peaceful<00:01:19.320> death

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
them have a dignified and peaceful death

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.580 
them have a dignified and peaceful death
the<00:01:20.640> difference<00:01:21.000> between<00:01:21.420> how<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.049> care<00:01:22.439> and

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
the difference between how to care and

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.730 
the difference between how to care and
hospice<00:01:22.939> is<00:01:24.080> something<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.170> I'm<00:01:25.290> asked<00:01:25.590> very

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
hospice is something that I'm asked very

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.670 
hospice is something that I'm asked very
often<00:01:26.420> hospice<00:01:27.420> most<00:01:27.720> people<00:01:27.990> feel<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.380> they

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
often hospice most people feel like they

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.530 
often hospice most people feel like they
understand<00:01:29.189> better<00:01:29.520> than<00:01:29.850> palliative<00:01:30.299> care

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
understand better than palliative care

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.920 
understand better than palliative care
so<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.650> hospice<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.659> basically<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.900> same

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
so a hospice is basically the same

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.319 
so a hospice is basically the same
philosophy<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.009> palliative<00:01:35.549> care<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.000> that

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
philosophy of palliative care and that

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.960 
philosophy of palliative care and that
it's<00:01:36.659> about<00:01:37.259> quality<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.920> life<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.430> comfort

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
it's about quality of life and comfort

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.260 
it's about quality of life and comfort
but<00:01:39.659> Hospice<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> program<00:01:41.159> that's<00:01:41.729> limited

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
but Hospice is a program that's limited

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.020 
but Hospice is a program that's limited
to<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.509> last<00:01:42.689> six<00:01:42.960> months<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.380> your<00:01:43.470> life<00:01:43.530> and

palliative<00:01:45.030> care<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.270> not<00:01:45.450> a<00:01:45.509> program<00:01:46.079> it's<00:01:46.680> a

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
palliative care is not a program it's a

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.160 
palliative care is not a program it's a

and most of us are somewhere in between

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.320 
and most of us are somewhere in between
but<00:04:47.890> the<00:04:48.010> most<00:04:48.160> important<00:04:48.669> thing<00:04:48.700> is<00:04:48.940> to<00:04:48.970> find

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
but the most important thing is to find

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.420 
but the most important thing is to find
out<00:04:49.510> from<00:04:49.810> patients<00:04:50.350> and<00:04:50.530> their<00:04:50.950> families

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
out from patients and their families

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.490 
out from patients and their families
what's<00:04:51.669> what<00:04:52.180> kind<00:04:52.390> of<00:04:52.450> person<00:04:52.840> they<00:04:53.080> are<00:04:53.110> and

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:53.500 
what's what kind of person they are and

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.790 
what's what kind of person they are and
what<00:04:53.800> they<00:04:54.160> are<00:04:54.790> willing<00:04:55.000> to<00:04:55.150> go<00:04:55.390> through<00:04:55.800> too

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
what they are willing to go through too

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.130 
what they are willing to go through too
often<00:04:57.010> we<00:04:57.760> see<00:04:57.940> patients<00:04:58.150> who<00:04:58.510> aren't<00:04:58.840> able<00:04:58.930> to

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
often we see patients who aren't able to

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.500 
often we see patients who aren't able to
speak<00:04:59.440> for<00:04:59.650> themselves<00:05:00.070> and<00:05:00.490> we're<00:05:01.180> relying

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
speak for themselves and we're relying

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.390 
speak for themselves and we're relying
on<00:05:01.660> family<00:05:02.110> to<00:05:02.200> help<00:05:02.290> us<00:05:02.440> make<00:05:02.590> decisions<00:05:02.620> and

on family to help us make decisions and

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.300 
on family to help us make decisions and
the<00:05:03.520> families<00:05:04.000> often<00:05:04.750> don't<00:05:05.680> have<00:05:05.770> a<00:05:05.860> sense<00:05:06.160> of

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
the families often don't have a sense of

the families often don't have a sense of
what<00:05:06.430> their<00:05:06.610> loved<00:05:06.790> one<00:05:06.940> would<00:05:07.090> want<00:05:07.330> and<00:05:07.660> it's

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
what their loved one would want and it's

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.420 
what their loved one would want and it's
a<00:05:08.200> lot<00:05:08.350> of<00:05:08.500> pressure<00:05:08.800> to<00:05:08.950> make<00:05:09.190> heavy

a lot of pressure to make heavy
decisions<00:05:10.000> when<00:05:10.630> you<00:05:10.750> don't<00:05:10.990> know<00:05:11.200> I<00:05:11.530> think

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
decisions when you don't know I think

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.040 
decisions when you don't know I think
also<00:05:12.280> too<00:05:12.490> often<00:05:12.970> our<00:05:13.090> medical<00:05:13.450> system<00:05:13.600> puts
