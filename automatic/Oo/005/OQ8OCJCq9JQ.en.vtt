00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
all right so I finished rebuilding the

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.960 
all right so I finished rebuilding the
t56<00:00:05.940> transmission<00:00:06.089> out<00:00:06.690> of<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.899> GTO<00:00:07.610> and<00:00:08.610> I

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
t56 transmission out of the GTO and I

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.839 
t56 transmission out of the GTO and I
got<00:00:09.150> an<00:00:09.300> aftermarket<00:00:10.309> eBay<00:00:11.309> are<00:00:11.460> actually<00:00:11.759> an

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
got an aftermarket eBay are actually an

got an aftermarket eBay are actually an
Amazon<00:00:12.269> special<00:00:12.750> shifter<00:00:13.139> for<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.530> I<00:00:14.460> don't

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
Amazon special shifter for it I don't

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.510 
Amazon special shifter for it I don't
know<00:00:15.480> it's<00:00:15.929> insanity<00:00:16.139> great<00:00:16.890> so<00:00:17.070> far<00:00:17.310> they're

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
know it's insanity great so far they're

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.980 
know it's insanity great so far they're
gonna<00:00:17.609> die<00:00:17.850> down<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.150> threads<00:00:18.420> really<00:00:18.600> get<00:00:18.840> my

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
gonna die down the threads really get my

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.820 
gonna die down the threads really get my
her<00:00:19.109> shift<00:00:19.410> knob<00:00:19.619> on<00:00:19.859> there<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.240> got<00:00:21.240> my<00:00:21.390> nice

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
her shift knob on there I got my nice

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.870 
her shift knob on there I got my nice
white<00:00:24.080> shift<00:00:25.080> knob<00:00:25.260> with<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.880> six-speed

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
white shift knob with the six-speed

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.320 
white shift knob with the six-speed
pattern<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:28.160> and<00:00:29.160> that's<00:00:29.550> just<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.880> stub<00:00:30.300> shaft

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
pattern it and that's just a stub shaft

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.380 
pattern it and that's just a stub shaft
from<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.260> GTO<00:00:31.740> I<00:00:32.130> won't<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:32.790> using<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.180> but

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
from the GTO I won't be using that but

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.540 
from the GTO I won't be using that but
it's<00:00:33.510> just<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.860> weight<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:35.040> down<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.219> little<00:00:35.399> bit

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
it's just to weight it down a little bit

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.950 
it's just to weight it down a little bit
helps<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.940> shift<00:00:36.149> a<00:00:36.270> little<00:00:36.600> easier<00:00:36.899> when

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
helps it shift a little easier when

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.389 
helps it shift a little easier when
you're<00:00:37.110> hand<00:00:37.260> turning<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.860> also<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.280> can

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
you're hand turning it and also you can

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.100 
you're hand turning it and also you can
see<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:38.670> spinning<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.090> at<00:00:39.180> least<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.540> I'll

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
see it's spinning in at least so I'll

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.840 
see it's spinning in at least so I'll
attempt<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.620> shift<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:41.070> through<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.340> gears<00:00:41.610> I

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
attempt to shift it through the gears I

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.459 
attempt to shift it through the gears I
can't<00:00:42.629> get<00:00:42.719> him<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.840> reverse<00:00:43.200> because<00:00:43.379> I

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
can't get him to reverse because I

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.880 
can't get him to reverse because I
bolted<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> reverse<00:00:44.160> locks<00:00:44.489> all<00:00:44.789> annoyed<00:00:45.180> on

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
bolted the reverse locks all annoyed on

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.690 
bolted the reverse locks all annoyed on
before<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.129> had<00:00:47.280> no<00:00:47.399> problems<00:00:47.670> getting

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
before that I had no problems getting

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.549 
before that I had no problems getting
into<00:00:47.969> reverse<00:00:49.160> um<00:00:51.020> yeah<00:00:52.020> it's<00:00:52.230> gonna<00:00:52.410> be

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
into reverse um yeah it's gonna be

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.580 
into reverse um yeah it's gonna be
really<00:00:52.710> hard<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.129> see<00:00:53.250> anything<00:00:54.590> especially

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
really hard to see anything especially

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.819 
really hard to see anything especially
while<00:00:55.980> trying<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.750> shift<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.079> turn<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.590> input

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
while trying to shift and turn the input

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.170 
while trying to shift and turn the input
shaft<00:00:59.280> at<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.489> same<00:00:59.670> time<00:01:00.530> but<00:01:01.530> well<00:01:02.489> anyway

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
shaft at the same time but well anyway

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:16.840 
shaft at the same time but well anyway
it's<00:01:04.170> uh<00:01:07.100> that's<00:01:08.100> first

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:35.660 

and<00:01:17.850> second<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:27.590> think<00:01:28.590> that's<00:01:28.859> third<00:01:34.670> should

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
and second I think that's third should

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.459 
and second I think that's third should
be<00:01:35.819> fourth<00:01:38.780> you<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:39.899> see<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.170> different

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
be fourth you can see the different

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:42.410 
be fourth you can see the different
speeds<00:01:40.799> as<00:01:41.130> I'm<00:01:41.520> basically<00:01:42.000> turning<00:01:42.179> at<00:01:42.359> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
speeds as I'm basically turning at the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.789 
speeds as I'm basically turning at the
same<00:01:42.600> speed<00:01:42.869> each<00:01:43.020> time<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.469> it's<00:01:43.590> now

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
same speed each time and it's now

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.889 
same speed each time and it's now
spinning<00:01:44.569> faster<00:01:45.569> and<00:01:45.959> then<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:46.920> should<00:01:47.100> be

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
spinning faster and then this should be

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.449 
spinning faster and then this should be
fifth<00:01:48.899> oh<00:01:51.170> yeah<00:01:52.170> oh<00:01:52.349> it's<00:01:52.709> hard<00:01:53.039> to<00:01:53.099> turn<00:01:53.250> those

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459 
fifth oh yeah oh it's hard to turn those

00:01:53.459 --> 00:02:01.880 
fifth oh yeah oh it's hard to turn those
high<00:01:53.640> gears<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:55.759> sixth<00:02:00.679> sorry

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
high gears and sixth sorry

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:09.259 
high gears and sixth sorry
that's<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.759> 200<00:02:03.179> 100<00:02:05.629> a<00:02:06.629> sixth<00:02:08.060> and<00:02:09.060> then<00:02:09.179> of

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
that's a 200 100 a sixth and then of

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:14.119 
that's a 200 100 a sixth and then of
course<00:02:12.290> neutral<00:02:13.290> now<00:02:13.500> it's<00:02:13.650> funny<00:02:13.829> cuz<00:02:14.010> it

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
course neutral now it's funny cuz it

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.830 
course neutral now it's funny cuz it
there's<00:02:14.760> no<00:02:14.849> resistance<00:02:15.150> on<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.660> or<00:02:15.780> you

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
there's no resistance on it or you

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.559 
there's no resistance on it or you
spinning<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.799> end<00:02:16.950> but<00:02:17.310> if<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.489> Jam<00:02:18.180> a<00:02:18.209> hammer

it's<00:04:17.580> not<00:04:17.760> super<00:04:18.390> accurate<00:04:18.799> because<00:04:19.799> I<00:04:20.370> mean

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
it's not super accurate because I mean

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.630 
it's not super accurate because I mean
it<00:04:21.090> is<00:04:21.270> you<00:04:21.480> just<00:04:21.600> got<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:21.810> be<00:04:21.870> careful<00:04:22.220> so<00:04:23.220> it

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
it is you just got to be careful so it

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.430 
it is you just got to be careful so it
kind<00:04:23.940> of<00:04:23.970> you<00:04:24.590> that<00:04:25.590> idea<00:04:26.990> but<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.200> thing<00:04:28.410> is

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
kind of you that idea but the thing is

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.460 
kind of you that idea but the thing is
you<00:04:28.680> got<00:04:28.800> a<00:04:28.830> deflection<00:04:29.310> measured<00:04:29.850> off<00:04:30.030> of<00:04:30.270> the

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
you got a deflection measured off of the

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.810 
you got a deflection measured off of the
the<00:04:31.470> ready<00:04:31.650> rod<00:04:31.950> so<00:04:32.130> you<00:04:32.190> kinda<00:04:32.340> have<00:04:32.430> to<00:04:32.490> push

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
the ready rod so you kinda have to push

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.540 
the ready rod so you kinda have to push
it<00:04:33.000> in<00:04:33.150> and<00:04:33.390> then<00:04:33.930> stop<00:04:34.590> wiggling<00:04:34.890> it<00:04:35.250> take<00:04:35.520> a

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
it in and then stop wiggling it take a

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.790 
it in and then stop wiggling it take a
reading<00:04:35.940> pull<00:04:36.419> it<00:04:36.570> out<00:04:36.720> I<00:04:36.990> take<00:04:37.560> another

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
reading pull it out I take another

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.930 
reading pull it out I take another
reading<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:38.280> then<00:04:38.370> of<00:04:38.490> course<00:04:38.700> the

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
reading and then of course the

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.880 
reading and then of course the
difference<00:04:39.390> between<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.720> two<00:04:39.840> is<00:04:40.020> your<00:04:40.200> end

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
difference between the two is your end

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:43.010 
difference between the two is your end

circulat I was freaking out this of

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.290 
circulat I was freaking out this of
course<00:05:21.070> I<00:05:21.190> bought<00:05:21.370> this<00:05:21.490> transmission<00:05:22.060> and

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
course I bought this transmission and

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.720 
course I bought this transmission and
well<00:05:22.900> there<00:05:23.020> it<00:05:23.110> is<00:05:23.260> this<00:05:24.040> circle<00:05:24.430> up<00:05:24.490> here

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:24.730 
well there it is this circle up here

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.720 
well there it is this circle up here
this<00:05:25.150> is<00:05:25.300> an<00:05:25.390> extra<00:05:25.690> one<00:05:25.840> now<00:05:26.620> that's<00:05:27.490> totally

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
this is an extra one now that's totally

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.210 
this is an extra one now that's totally
normal<00:05:28.360> because<00:05:28.810> that<00:05:29.200> they<00:05:29.350> circlips<00:05:30.070> they

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
normal because that they circlips they

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:34.050 
normal because that they circlips they
give<00:05:30.430> you<00:05:31.920> part<00:05:32.920> also<00:05:33.280> for<00:05:33.490> the<00:05:33.580> F<00:05:33.730> body

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
give you part also for the F body

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.690 
give you part also for the F body
transmissions<00:05:34.870> and<00:05:35.110> the<00:05:35.890> main<00:05:36.100> shaft<00:05:36.430> at<00:05:36.670> the

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:36.700 
transmissions and the main shaft at the

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:40.110 
transmissions and the main shaft at the
front<00:05:36.820> on<00:05:37.360> the<00:05:37.540> GTO<00:05:37.900> is<00:05:38.400> turned<00:05:39.400> down<00:05:39.700> a<00:05:39.730> little

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
front on the GTO is turned down a little

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.960 
front on the GTO is turned down a little
bit<00:05:40.300> it's<00:05:40.480> got<00:05:40.600> a<00:05:40.630> slightly<00:05:40.960> smaller<00:05:41.970> diameter

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
bit it's got a slightly smaller diameter

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.690 
bit it's got a slightly smaller diameter
on<00:05:43.510> it<00:05:43.660> and<00:05:43.810> that's<00:05:43.990> got<00:05:44.710> a<00:05:44.740> smaller<00:05:45.190> circuit

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
on it and that's got a smaller circuit

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:48.540 
on it and that's got a smaller circuit
for<00:05:46.000> it<00:05:46.140> this<00:05:47.140> larger<00:05:47.650> one<00:05:47.770> is<00:05:47.920> for<00:05:48.100> the<00:05:48.160> F<00:05:48.280> body

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
for it this larger one is for the F body

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.460 
for it this larger one is for the F body
not<00:05:48.850> for<00:05:49.030> the<00:05:49.090> GTO<00:05:49.420> so<00:05:49.810> thank<00:05:50.080> goodness<00:05:50.380> I

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
not for the GTO so thank goodness I

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.230 
not for the GTO so thank goodness I
didn't<00:05:50.710> forget<00:05:50.950> a<00:05:51.010> circle<00:05:51.730> up<00:05:51.820> in<00:05:52.000> there<00:05:52.120> that

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
didn't forget a circle up in there that

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.290 
didn't forget a circle up in there that
would<00:05:52.330> have<00:05:52.450> really<00:05:53.020> peeving<00:05:53.290> me<00:05:53.470> off<00:05:53.500> I'm

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
would have really peeving me off I'm

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.280 
would have really peeving me off I'm
that<00:05:55.300> would<00:05:55.450> have<00:05:55.570> sucked<00:05:55.780> have<00:05:55.990> to<00:05:56.080> tear<00:05:56.260> it

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
that would have sucked have to tear it

00:05:56.290 --> 00:06:03.480 
that would have sucked have to tear it
all<00:05:56.470> down<00:05:56.500> and<00:05:56.890> redo<00:05:57.670> it<00:05:57.820> so<00:05:58.740> that's<00:05:59.740> good<00:06:02.430> yes

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
all down and redo it so that's good yes

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.570 
all down and redo it so that's good yes
you<00:06:04.060> got<00:06:04.240> to<00:06:04.360> make<00:06:04.540> sure<00:06:04.780> that<00:06:04.990> you<00:06:05.580> install

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:06.580 
you got to make sure that you install

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:13.200 
you got to make sure that you install
the<00:06:08.520> third<00:06:09.520> gear<00:06:09.910> and<00:06:11.610> synchro<00:06:12.610> before<00:06:13.030> you

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
the third gear and synchro before you

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:15.540 
the third gear and synchro before you
press<00:06:13.450> the<00:06:13.630> main<00:06:13.780> shaft<00:06:14.050> bearing<00:06:14.590> on<00:06:14.770> because

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
press the main shaft bearing on because

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.310 
press the main shaft bearing on because
otherwise<00:06:15.820> you<00:06:16.090> can't<00:06:16.420> get<00:06:16.660> them<00:06:16.870> over<00:06:17.080> top<00:06:17.260> of

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:17.320 
otherwise you can't get them over top of

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.380 
otherwise you can't get them over top of
it<00:06:17.590> I<00:06:17.650> mean<00:06:18.040> that<00:06:18.190> is<00:06:18.610> kind<00:06:18.760> of<00:06:18.880> weird<00:06:19.090> but

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:19.390 
it I mean that is kind of weird but

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.330 
it I mean that is kind of weird but
that's<00:06:19.570> the<00:06:19.870> way<00:06:20.020> it<00:06:20.140> is<00:06:20.320> and<00:06:20.680> I<00:06:21.070> end<00:06:21.220> up

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
that's the way it is and I end up

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.400 
that's the way it is and I end up
pressing<00:06:21.610> it<00:06:21.910> on<00:06:22.060> and<00:06:22.510> destroying<00:06:23.260> the

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
pressing it on and destroying the

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:24.780 
pressing it on and destroying the
bearing<00:06:23.710> removing<00:06:24.160> it<00:06:24.280> and<00:06:24.400> had<00:06:24.490> to<00:06:24.580> run<00:06:24.760> out

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:24.790 
bearing removing it and had to run out

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.520 
bearing removing it and had to run out
and<00:06:25.030> thankfully<00:06:25.420> Lord<00:06:25.630> Coe<00:06:25.780> had<00:06:25.960> exactly<00:06:26.380> the

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:26.530 
and thankfully Lord Coe had exactly the

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.090 
and thankfully Lord Coe had exactly the
same<00:06:26.770> brand<00:06:27.130> ICAP<00:06:27.760> coil<00:06:28.210> same<00:06:29.050> part<00:06:29.320> number<00:06:29.380> so

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.100 
same brand ICAP coil same part number so

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.410 
same brand ICAP coil same part number so
I<00:06:30.130> didn't<00:06:30.370> have<00:06:30.460> to<00:06:30.550> change<00:06:30.730> the<00:06:31.000> inner<00:06:31.150> race

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420 
I didn't have to change the inner race

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.110 
I didn't have to change the inner race
and<00:06:31.720> the<00:06:31.780> main<00:06:31.960> shaft<00:06:32.200> again<00:06:32.560> are<00:06:32.800> the<00:06:33.120> input

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
and the main shaft again are the input

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.880 
and the main shaft again are the input
shaft<00:06:34.300> again<00:06:34.660> so<00:06:34.990> I<00:06:35.200> just<00:06:35.410> pressed<00:06:35.680> a<00:06:35.770> new

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:35.890 
shaft again so I just pressed a new

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.420 
shaft again so I just pressed a new
bearing<00:06:36.190> on<00:06:36.370> and<00:06:37.740> that<00:06:38.740> was<00:06:38.890> that<00:06:39.070> was<00:06:39.250> in<00:06:39.340> an

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
bearing on and that was that was in an

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.570 
bearing on and that was that was in an
SKF<00:06:39.880> box<00:06:40.180> but<00:06:40.390> it<00:06:40.450> was<00:06:40.540> actually<00:06:40.690> coil<00:06:41.140> so

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
SKF box but it was actually coil so

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.020 
SKF box but it was actually coil so
matches<00:06:42.580> the<00:06:42.700> inner<00:06:42.850> and<00:06:43.060> outer<00:06:43.300> race<00:06:44.040> and<00:06:45.040> it

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.030 
matches the inner and outer race and it

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.140 
matches the inner and outer race and it
is<00:06:46.180> normal<00:06:46.600> to<00:06:47.110> have<00:06:47.500> a<00:06:47.560> little<00:06:47.620> bit<00:06:47.890> of<00:06:48.010> up<00:06:48.820> and

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:49.150 
is normal to have a little bit of up and

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.750 
is normal to have a little bit of up and
down<00:06:49.330> and<00:06:49.600> side<00:06:50.110> to<00:06:50.140> side<00:06:50.290> play<00:06:50.770> on<00:06:51.040> your<00:06:51.310> input

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:51.760 
down and side to side play on your input

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.160 
down and side to side play on your input
shaft<00:06:52.030> that's<00:06:52.210> what<00:06:52.330> your<00:06:52.480> pilot<00:06:52.810> bearing<00:06:52.930> is

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:53.170 
shaft that's what your pilot bearing is

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.380 
shaft that's what your pilot bearing is
forward<00:06:53.500> it<00:06:53.590> helps<00:06:53.800> align<00:06:54.040> it<00:06:54.270> okay<00:06:55.270> because

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:55.390 
forward it helps align it okay because

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:58.920 
forward it helps align it okay because
I've<00:06:55.540> had<00:06:55.810> people<00:06:55.960> ask<00:06:56.290> me<00:06:56.410> that<00:06:56.440> before<00:06:57.930> like

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
I've had people ask me that before like

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.780 
I've had people ask me that before like
you<00:06:59.110> know<00:06:59.260> what<00:06:59.470> a<00:06:59.500> ton<00:06:59.950> but<00:07:00.280> I<00:07:00.460> mean

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:00.790 
you know what a ton but I mean

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.720 
you know what a ton but I mean
you<00:07:01.210> can<00:07:01.360> easily<00:07:01.570> move<00:07:01.900> this<00:07:02.140> probably<00:07:02.770> at<00:07:03.550> the

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:03.730 
you can easily move this probably at the

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:08.570 
you can easily move this probably at the
tip<00:07:04.000> you<00:07:04.330> know<00:07:05.080> quarter<00:07:06.070> or<00:07:06.430> so<00:07:06.660> either<00:07:07.660> way

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:08.580 
tip you know quarter or so either way

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.320 
tip you know quarter or so either way
perfectly<00:07:09.580> normal<00:07:09.880> you<00:07:09.940> just<00:07:10.060> don't<00:07:10.180> want

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:10.330 
perfectly normal you just don't want

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:12.690 
perfectly normal you just don't want
in-and-out<00:07:10.690> play<00:07:11.050> which<00:07:11.710> I<00:07:11.830> had<00:07:12.040> only<00:07:12.670> a

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:12.700 
in-and-out play which I had only a

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.000 
in-and-out play which I had only a
thousand<00:07:13.150> a<00:07:13.180> half<00:07:13.360> off<00:07:13.630> so<00:07:13.930> you<00:07:14.680> can<00:07:14.800> hardly

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.010 
thousand a half off so you can hardly

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.190 
thousand a half off so you can hardly
even<00:07:15.130> feel<00:07:15.220> that<00:07:15.580> actually<00:07:15.760> but<00:07:16.180> ya<00:07:16.900> know
