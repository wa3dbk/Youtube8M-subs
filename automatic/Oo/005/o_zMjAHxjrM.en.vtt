00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.870
 world of tanks 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:11.930
 hello tankers where you know 64 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.129
 it is now 2 am I just like a shock 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.289
 ball of praise I sit here 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:18.589
 oh my goodness I didnâ€™t do so long ago 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:23.689
 Vidos did not spread as you I am a ghoul 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:24.499
 so I jumped up straight snatched the most such 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.419
 the last 

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:28.579
 one of the last more or less fit 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:32.329
 replays and I think you need karacheva 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:34.520
 show on here especially because we have a mouse 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:36.170
 randomly rarely see 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.840
 on this pretty boy 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.330
 how is he still a good year but now 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.150
 it's about you they are 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:47.270
 Ryuko, I probably am on personal combat missions 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.190
 who started our tagging 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.940
 here's a couple of days ago 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.100
 sequins started here they actually 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.410
 saying that this is something of combat missions 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.780
 suddenly someone did not know did not go into 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.080
 the game and generally watch out for not 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.689
 only by 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:10.039
 vidosov youtube and generally not knowing what 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:11.600
 it may turn out they are things to play here I 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:13.969
 I think that you 1 answer 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.090
 interesting useless this information 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:19.600
 Okay, so in general, dreams were tasks 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:24.770
 such funny crosses by the way 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:27.439
 suddenly I praise wargaming for what they 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.920
 did personal combat missions like 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:33.829
 called what they are here of course not 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.700
 paid for it 100 thousand Belarusian 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.210
 rubles 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.259
 otherwise I would not say that, but let us not 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:43.090
 sad 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:46.990
 and so when performing personally combat missions 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:52.780
 can get a wonderful reward 4 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:55.420
 so it is pieces 4 here from in principle on 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.670

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.560
 here 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.840
 but in order for this all to include us 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:12.829
 need to perform all sorts of different quests 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.829
 kissing saying every tank stands out 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:21.239
 much shorter quest for 15 quests about 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:27.569

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:39.150
 in this regard, only wargaming is done 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.760
 it was a goal to cheat at all do not 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:46.139
 such quests to hell and endure who does not 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:49.379
 maybe that's okay maybe someone can bastard 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:54.090
 artilleryman you are cool guys you are great 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:56.939

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.150
 she's combat missions or missions fine 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:02.129
 it's fun it's fun like a thunderstorm 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.760
 performance of such everyone by as 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:10.199
 lead to we will receive you will 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:13.919
 getting already received silver silver 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:15.960
 silver is all sorts of other buns here 

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:18.510
 depends and here you are 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.090
 level of severity of these quests girls 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.880
 knowledge is now started only on 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:26.910
 actually pass put up pieces but here 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:31.800
 why are you there on business to and a little time and so 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.660
 sluggish it's all current in fact 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.080
 cool very dilutes the gameplay 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.780
 there is like you already ask a task order 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.490
 what you need to count fell down 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.950
 let's say in battle buy there now yes 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:46.860
 You also do the quest well, let's say 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.980
 about 1 someone quite simple but don't know 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.840
 they can't just do them 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.180
 absolutely anyone who stank 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.400
 mouse keyboard monitors and don't know 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.230
 in short if you can play 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.030
 world of tanks means you can 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.740
 pay it just what 1000 inflict 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:08.640
 damage and try to survive the battle on 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:13.820
 the complexity of 110 rubles and that's where the farther 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:17.870
 so much cooler here and accordingly 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:20.450
 award there turns out 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.000
 I personally liked the personal patrons 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.940
 Of course, all this video paid for 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.580
 wargaming because nonstop 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:32.330
 praise somehow notice the animation on the very 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:34.910
 Well done, they were wrong 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.610
 interesting Sudbury there already read 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.640
 quietly you pass this here to me 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:42.260
 peasant woman brought cool features here 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.370
 Here are great personal combat missions. 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:48.590
 so you know 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:51.620
 a kind of single-player multiplayer on 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:54.020
 my stupidity said no that's it 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.840
 feeling feeling single player multiplayer 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:06:02.870
 something like this can now be observed 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:06.440
 just love loves you then at home i'm a hundred 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:06.860
 against the mouse who is everyone i love 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.930
 pancakes 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.370
 so I just showed this vidos 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:14.720
 of course cool place 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:17.030
 but here's a dude from the shadow looking at that damn 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.930
 how could you behave like this 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:24.140
 time all killed yes by the way I play on 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:27.710
 Goldie and therefore urgent need to unsubscribe 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:30.530
 from the channel because gold arrow and so 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:35.060
 what else can you say shorter to the corner and 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:37.910
 this angle is stealth though any azaz all 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.490
 this spirit is shorter than all the personal 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:45.260
 combat missions from the bite to play tanks 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:47.030
 fell thread personal combat missions that's all 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.020
 you will have a wonderful fate 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.840
 fecal 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:55.099
 all these mouse legs there and here are the results 

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:58.009
 The battlefield here is not a master I got my first 

00:06:55.099 --> 00:06:59.659
 degree gives beautiful food when 

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:02.150
 defeat got the first degree of me 

00:06:59.659 --> 00:07:05.270
 More experience than the guy from the team 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:07.789
 which won here is how defeat me 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:12.409
 experience more than his here but i don't care 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:14.690
 but you and of course I went without it 

00:07:12.409 --> 00:07:17.199
 that shot gold and again it's not 

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:20.120
 look for 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:24.349
 notice the bows exactly the bands delight and 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:27.650
 like 17 hits from 17 shots that's what 

00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:32.960
 German power means children's accuracy 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:34.159
 words at the last strands quest most 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.680
 it's hard to 

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:39.830
 Huron blocked armor and damage 

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.550
 inflicted and damage that you 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:46.370
 passed 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:48.500
 total this is all to 8000 hindered if 

00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:51.080
 if I were doing this quest now 

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:54.430
 fulfilled because I already exceed even 

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:57.650
 10 here then the floor can go on thousands 

00:07:54.430 --> 00:08:00.050
 similarity but more numbers and FIG know 

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:02.539
 we'll see and I hope you were interested
