00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:11.270
 not self-employed in Berlin this year with Mirko Henel Waas and 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.650
 I was 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.099
 very successful hours to talk about 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.069
 and because I want that 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:19.650
 that I stand out from the burnout syndrome I am pleased to say thought you have to 

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:22.649
 necessarily a bon vivant completely in white 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.140
 and so, gradually, team emerged through each opponent 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.999
 until 10 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.050
 people go to the terrain so in «Dutschke» 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.559
 meanwhile has become 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.750
 this idea around 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.670
 I developed that 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.860
 in duo prices 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.450
 Organize tours 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.540
 In the meantime, it is also that I never passed by Wilf motorcycles for 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.540
 the people and I have the clothes for the people and 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.810
 are in Graz 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.210
 in the field in the middle of the Pampa Smith 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.210
 Dublin dapd 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.170
 just times 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.740
 in a legal way, dirty to be allowed to win 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.320
 that you just say it 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.860
 and that just brought the market there 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.690
 family 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.350
 forget everything and focus only on yourself 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.970
 if no problems at home night 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.520
 they will come from all professions this way 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.510
 there is just typical craftsmen here 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.980
 Young entrepreneurs around 30 35 and of course the father of the family 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.310
 has two children 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.020
 he used to ride a motorcycle at some point and suddenly comes back up 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.909
 the b he urgently needs a hectic so there is no particular one 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.479
 Occupational section of this enduro driver operates particularly happy querbeet 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.479
 and even women's work 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.199
 which scares me 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:22.969
 in the free nature 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:25.229
 the whole thing with sports 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:26.819
 who make an effort 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.239
 and the people 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:29.659
 to teach something 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:34.650
 and it makes me a lot of fun when people in the area somehow like that 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.159
 Let go of Torschrei and say 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:40.420
 It was broke now that I come up this mountain 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.349
 I have never regretted to give up percent of gastronomy after 15 years 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.269
 and now I'm a major in Kohat 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:57.509
 and what could be better than conquering a new country with a motorbike?
