model<00:01:09.240> number<00:01:09.270> over<00:01:09.750> here<00:01:10.189> like<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.280> said<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.580> is

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
model number over here like I said it is

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.760 
model number over here like I said it is
a<00:01:11.780> 1987<00:01:13.610> model<00:01:14.610> number<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.119> e<00:01:15.570> for<00:01:16.170> eight<00:01:17.060> ESL

CCC so that's it I had the carbs rebuilt

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.080 
CCC so that's it I had the carbs rebuilt
on<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.259> two<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> half<00:01:25.590> years<00:01:25.830> ago<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.460> I

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
on this two and a half years ago and I

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.030 
on this two and a half years ago and I
have<00:01:27.210> not<00:01:27.420> had<00:01:27.630> had<00:01:28.140> water<00:01:28.409> pump<00:01:28.650> done<00:01:28.829> at<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
have not had had water pump done at the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.550 
have not had had water pump done at the
same<00:01:29.220> time<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:30.210> haven't<00:01:30.810> had<00:01:30.930> any<00:01:31.079> trouble<00:01:31.470> out

same time I haven't had any trouble out

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.859 
same time I haven't had any trouble out
of<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.829> since<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:33.060> just<00:01:33.150> wanted<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.540> go<00:01:33.840> a

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
of it since we just wanted to go a

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.080 
of it since we just wanted to go a
little<00:01:33.960> faster<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.770> let's<00:01:35.579> turn<00:01:35.700> on<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.880> water

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
little faster so let's turn on the water

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.030 
little faster so let's turn on the water
here<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.630> let's<00:01:37.470> see<00:01:37.619> house<00:01:37.770> fires<00:01:39.770> alright

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
here and let's see house fires alright

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.170 
here and let's see house fires alright
so<00:01:41.970> controls<00:01:42.780> are<00:01:42.960> up<00:01:42.990> here<00:01:44.000> what<00:01:45.000> we're<00:01:45.149> going

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
so controls are up here what we're going

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.450 
so controls are up here what we're going
to<00:01:45.329> do<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.899> typically<00:01:46.619> just<00:01:46.890> one<00:01:47.040> little<00:01:47.280> push

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
to do is typically just one little push

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.690 
to do is typically just one little push
of<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.170> choke<00:01:49.170> does<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.220> job<00:01:50.399> for<00:01:50.460> this

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
of the choke does the job for this

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.730 
of the choke does the job for this
little<00:01:51.000> motor

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
little motor

00:01:52.740 --> 00:02:09.229 
little motor
all<00:01:52.829> right<00:02:05.780> let's<00:02:06.780> go<00:02:06.990> put<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.380> into<00:02:07.649> gear<00:02:08.239> see

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
all right let's go put it into gear see

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:23.990 
all right let's go put it into gear see
what<00:02:09.390> happens<00:02:09.780> ears<00:02:10.530> right<00:02:10.860> here<00:02:21.860> good<00:02:22.970> put<00:02:23.970> it

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
what happens ears right here good put it

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.270 
what happens ears right here good put it
back<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.330> neutral

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
back to neutral

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.280 
back to neutral
all<00:02:26.280> right<00:02:26.430> neutrals<00:02:26.850> right<00:02:27.060> there<00:02:27.390> good<00:02:28.110> to

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
all right neutrals right there good to

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:37.990 
all right neutrals right there good to
go<00:02:28.470> drop<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:29.430> reverse

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.130 

put<00:02:38.750> it<00:02:38.840> back<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.080> neutral<00:02:39.380> real<00:02:39.620> quick<00:02:41.140> give

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
put it back to neutral real quick give

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.440 
put it back to neutral real quick give
it<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.260> little<00:02:42.380> rpm<00:02:43.010> just<00:02:43.790> sit<00:02:43.970> here<00:02:44.180> run<00:02:44.420> a

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
it a little rpm just sit here run a

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.830 
it a little rpm just sit here run a
little<00:02:44.660> faster

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
alright so that is my turn this water

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.470 
alright so that is my turn this water
off<00:03:03.530> real<00:03:03.770> quick<00:03:04.010> there<00:03:04.970> we<00:03:05.120> go
