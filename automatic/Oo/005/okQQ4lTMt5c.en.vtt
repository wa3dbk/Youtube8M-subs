00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:37.120
 to bishops messages difficult to decipher 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.180
 an alphabet of graffiti itself is 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.670
 present throughout the urban environment and already 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.559
 part of the visual routine of the inhabitants 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.040
 of the big cities 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.470
 walls and other public places and 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.699
 private spaces become spaces for 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:56.170
 records different forms of expression 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.660
 understood by some how the 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.379
 expression of feelings and by others 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.930
 such as aggression and violation of property 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:05.740
 this style of painting does not please the 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.810
 all 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.300
 I think that the graffiti I do not have 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.710
 however, that often impasse the art of 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.380
 that the people who defend this 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:19.180
 but I do not think I have any interest 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:21.190
 in society because it has no nexus 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.799
 the guy talking guy heck the wall I think 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:28.210
 which is valid if it erodes the 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:32.890
 fact that people are invading the 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:36.850
 Third party privacy 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.940
 I do not think anyone has the right to go there. 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:43.690
 and destroy the property of others 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:46.360
 I think this is absurd in relation to 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.250
 how the staff manages to be 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.260
 mainly in the region of curitiba 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.630
 people here in the central region 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.120
 tall buildings is difficult to understand as 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.910
 is that they can do this without 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.760
 the public can not see from January to 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:04.600
 May this year the municipal guard 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.760
 recorded 950 new graffiti and 157 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.519
 graffiti in the whole city of curitiba 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.769
 although many people do not like 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.459
 affirm that the graffiti is also a style 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.769
 to act 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.150
 I can create commodity exists 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:18.310
 that matter of the degradation of space 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.099
 public or private, but it is an issue 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.930
 laws nor speaking as an artist I 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.370
 I think it's something that gives you importance. 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.239
 for society 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.750
 dg is 17 years old and is not intended 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.040
 stop for him the prejudice is natural 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.260
 in this environment 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.780
 I'm already in my life and almost everything 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.579
 taking my child out of the family or after 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.290
 That's all for me, I do it because 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:44.780
 I like it so much that I 'm 29 years old. 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.790
 I leave I will stop is never the way of being 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.519
 anonymity and everyone knows who I am 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.189
 For me graffiti there, the bug for this. 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.750
 closed it for you to protest nothing 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:55.549
 Prejudice is good if not if not 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.290
 I would have been prejudiced. 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.239
 doing what I do I do a little 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.560
 To break it, to show it to 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.720
 society composed of something that is 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.790
 It is also legal to act as a 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.370
 characterized by the use of the language of 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.170
 signs to mark territory and also 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.200
 to express yourself 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.720
 graphite has the same objectives but 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.689
 with a slightly different aesthetic with 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.209
 more designs and colors that please more 

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:22.760
 Graphite population I think the most 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.849
 I think it's nice when it has walls like this. 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.349
 that the conquering staff was there and 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.750
 Take the tape for me and call for it. 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.790
 well- elaborated mars something like that 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.480
 that it's worth even checking fitch 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.639
 chance it's an art, right? 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.090
 however it is very confused with the graffiti 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:43.519
 It's by fitch a very beautiful job. 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.370
 in Brazil the act of polishing is taken as 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.799
 the opposite of graphing 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.199
 through the law sanctioned in the year 2011 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:54.109
 by president dilma rousseff 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:55.190
 legalizing graphite to the detriment of 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.609
 graffiti 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:01.819
 the graphite is cool is allowed and it is beautiful 

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:05.510
 is something that comes to English the city and 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.319
 equipment where water is made of Brazil 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.569
 graffiti 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.090
 graphite does not speak that is pretty colorful 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.919
 like several friends who are graffiti 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.900
 and all except that the graphite is nothing more than the 

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:17.120
 what a graffiti evolved this alone 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.599
 the difference between graffiti and graffiti is 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.250
 that graphite is authorized is required 

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:25.760
 by the owner or person responsible for 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:29.180
 property and usually has an information 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.280
 contained in the graphite is not a drawing 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.289
 there is an aesthetic difference 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.090
 without for example following the type of the 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.889
 technique here uses this type more 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.320
 thing and such and graffiti not but the 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.090
 Argentinean is no longer an emerging 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.000
 graffiti because so the graphite it came 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.800
 of graffiti he was born captation evolved 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.539
 with time other types of techniques and 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.130
 today they have something more artist 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.940
 that will make them computation also already 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.940
 was paid to the table
