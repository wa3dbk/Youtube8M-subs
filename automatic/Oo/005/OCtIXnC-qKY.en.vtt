guy problem what's the guy's problem
I've<00:01:14.750> got<00:01:14.810> some<00:01:15.970> yellow<00:01:16.970> cross<00:01:17.540> cut<00:01:17.869> rabbit

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
I've got some yellow cross cut rabbit

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.789 
I've got some yellow cross cut rabbit
strips<00:01:22.540> so<00:01:23.540> I<00:01:23.600> put<00:01:23.840> a<00:01:23.869> little<00:01:24.020> collar<00:01:24.320> on<00:01:24.590> here

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
strips so I put a little collar on here

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.679 
strips so I put a little collar on here
don't<00:01:25.159> need<00:01:25.310> a<00:01:25.340> huge<00:01:25.700> amount<00:01:25.729> usually<00:01:26.180> a<00:01:26.420> you

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
don't need a huge amount usually a you

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:41.109 
don't need a huge amount usually a you
know<00:01:26.810> maybe<00:01:27.259> two<00:01:27.650> wraps<00:01:27.890> at<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:28.250> most

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.480 

so<00:01:42.119> now<00:01:42.330> buoyancy<00:01:42.960> for<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.680> fly<00:01:43.950> has<00:01:44.189> been

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
so now buoyancy for this fly has been

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.840 
so now buoyancy for this fly has been
important<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.479> Iser<00:01:46.380> mono<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.610> it's<00:01:47.729> not

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
important and the Iser mono so it's not

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.440 
important and the Iser mono so it's not
gonna<00:01:48.030> really<00:01:48.240> sink<00:01:49.220> this<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.210> body

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
gonna really sink this this the the body

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.480 
gonna really sink this this the the body
material<00:01:51.840> here<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.500> going<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.830> be<00:01:53.039> just<00:01:53.310> a

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
material here is going to be just a

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.370 
material here is going to be just a
little<00:01:53.729> bit<00:01:54.000> heavier<00:01:54.450> than<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> traditional

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
little bit heavier than the traditional

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.859 
little bit heavier than the traditional
polypropylene<00:01:55.920> but<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:56.970> also<00:01:57.149> has<00:01:57.539> some<00:01:57.780> of

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
polypropylene but it also has some of

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.289 
polypropylene but it also has some of
the<00:01:57.960> same<00:01:58.140> qualities<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.580> and<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.180> know

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
the same qualities to it and you know

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.120 
the same qualities to it and you know
they're<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> bunch<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.500> stuff<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.710> can<00:02:01.950> do

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
they're a bunch of stuff you can do

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.880 
they're a bunch of stuff you can do
longer<00:02:02.580> leaders<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.509> floating<00:02:04.020> materials<00:02:04.560> you

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
longer leaders of floating materials you

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.679 
longer leaders of floating materials you
know<00:02:05.009> mono<00:02:05.250> instead<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.820> fluorocarbon<00:02:06.270> stuff

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
know mono instead of fluorocarbon stuff

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.900 
know mono instead of fluorocarbon stuff
like<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.050> that<00:02:08.009> are<00:02:08.100> gonna<00:02:08.190> help<00:02:08.459> keep<00:02:08.700> the

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
like that that are gonna help keep the

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.540 
like that that are gonna help keep the
thing<00:02:09.090> up<00:02:09.410> this<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.590> not<00:02:10.769> going<00:02:11.130> to<00:02:11.250> be<00:02:11.370> your

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
thing up this is not going to be your

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.940 
thing up this is not going to be your
ledum<00:02:11.850> by<00:02:12.000> 50-foot<00:02:12.510> fly<00:02:12.780> for<00:02:13.170> sure<00:02:13.350> it's<00:02:13.799> gonna

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
ledum by 50-foot fly for sure it's gonna

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.449 
ledum by 50-foot fly for sure it's gonna
be<00:02:14.010> more<00:02:14.340> like<00:02:14.549> a<00:02:14.580> 15<00:02:15.330> 20<00:02:15.569> foot<00:02:15.930> feed<00:02:16.140> on<00:02:16.380> it<00:02:16.560> so

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
be more like a 15 20 foot feed on it so

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:18.559 
be more like a 15 20 foot feed on it so
you<00:02:17.519> know<00:02:17.610> maybe<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.970> little<00:02:18.120> bit<00:02:18.209> murkier

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
you know maybe a little bit murkier

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.820 
you know maybe a little bit murkier
water<00:02:18.870> things<00:02:19.560> like<00:02:19.739> that<00:02:19.950> but<00:02:21.500> motion<00:02:22.500> so

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
water things like that but motion so

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.870 
water things like that but motion so
when<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.069> pull<00:02:23.280> this<00:02:23.430> thing<00:02:23.610> through<00:02:23.790> the

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
when you pull this thing through the

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.190 
when you pull this thing through the
water<00:02:24.060> on<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.330> great<00:02:24.480> things<00:02:24.690> about<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:25.019> toad

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
water on the great things about the toad

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.720 
water on the great things about the toad
is<00:02:25.380> that<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.620> really<00:02:25.890> kicked<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.310> whole<00:02:26.489> bunch

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
is that it really kicked a whole bunch

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.509 
is that it really kicked a whole bunch
and<00:02:27.000> we're<00:02:27.780> gonna<00:02:27.870> get<00:02:28.049> almost<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:29.130> know<00:02:29.220> more

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
and we're gonna get almost you know more

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:34.400 
and we're gonna get almost you know more
basically<00:02:30.060> more<00:02:30.360> motion<00:02:30.900> out<00:02:31.140> of<00:02:31.290> this<00:02:33.410> so

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
basically more motion out of this so

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.350 
basically more motion out of this so
with<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.709> tarantula<00:02:35.310> legs<00:02:35.489> you<00:02:35.730> just<00:02:35.970> peeled

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
with the tarantula legs you just peeled

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.539 
with the tarantula legs you just peeled
