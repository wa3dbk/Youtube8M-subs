00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:08.360
 let's see the technique of manual brushing 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.430
 First make sure the brush 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.770
 It is in good condition and clean 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:16.449
 also replace it every three months or 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.449
 even earlier if necessary 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.910
 the brushing must be thorough without 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.070
 pressure and should be extended about two 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.140
 approximately minutes using a 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.419
 Toothpaste with fluoride in small amount 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.789
 to avoid excess foam during 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:34.390
 brushing we suggest the following 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:37.000
 technique divide the teeth into two groups 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.040
 to avoid forgetting the superiors and 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.699
 inferiors and always follow the same 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.699
 sequence 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.530
 first brush the outer faces 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.900
 of the upper teeth for it 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.210
 place the brush perpendicular to the 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.430
 tooth slightly tilted toward the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.380
 gum and make several times a 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.300
 gentle movement of rotation on the 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.480
 surface to advance to the next 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.700
 tooth I separated the brush forward and in the 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.830
 Initial position repeat movement 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.170
 always brush from the gum 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.510
 tooth and not vice versa to prevent 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.730
 the gum is damaged 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.920
 when I finish brushing my faces 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.600
 exteriors follow with the interiors 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.600
 using the same technique 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.630
 after the inside faces stand the 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.530
 crushed faces by a 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.530
 swinging motion 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.969
 and once brushing the teeth 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.969
 superiors continue with the inferiors 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.170
 just like before you place the brush 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.060
 slightly perpendicular to the tooth 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.850
 inclined towards the gum and perform 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.810
 several times a smooth turning movement 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.810
 Over the surface 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.680
 after the outer faces continue 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.880
 with the inside faces following 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.880
 always the same order 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.510
 and finally the faces crush tes 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.829
 brush your tongue also because in 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.290
 she retains a lot of remains 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.510
 To do this, stick out your tongue and place the 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.549
 brush as far back as you can but 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.859
 not too much to prevent nausea 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:57.439
 then perform a sweep towards 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:57.439
 go ahead and repeat this step several times
