00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.670 
Stan you know it becomes very unbearable
when<00:04:32.210> it<00:04:32.360> comes<00:04:32.600> down<00:04:32.840> to<00:04:34.960> an<00:04:35.960> issue<00:04:36.140> of<00:04:36.350> just

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
when it comes down to an issue of just

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.680 
when it comes down to an issue of just
using<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:37.040> toilet<00:04:37.250> which<00:04:37.820> is<00:04:37.940> really<00:04:38.150> sad<00:04:38.419> but

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
using the toilet which is really sad but

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.880 
using the toilet which is really sad but
I<00:04:38.780> guess<00:04:38.930> this<00:04:39.110> is<00:04:39.200> what<00:04:39.350> we<00:04:39.440> have<00:04:39.560> to<00:04:39.650> come<00:04:39.800> to

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
I guess this is what we have to come to

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.560 
I guess this is what we have to come to
we<00:04:39.980> have<00:04:40.070> to<00:04:40.100> pick<00:04:40.340> up<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.520> other<00:04:40.550> dog<00:04:40.910> and<00:04:41.300> I

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
we have to pick up the other dog and I

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.659 
we have to pick up the other dog and I
feel<00:04:41.750> it's<00:04:41.900> the<00:04:42.020> reason<00:04:42.350> why<00:04:42.440> 74<00:04:43.010> economic<00:04:43.550> tan

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
feel it's the reason why 74 economic tan

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.580 
feel it's the reason why 74 economic tan
that<00:04:44.210> the<00:04:44.300> reason<00:04:44.570> why<00:04:44.660> trenching<00:04:45.050> us<00:04:45.169> the

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.440 
that the reason why trenching us the
simple<00:04:45.890> fact<00:04:45.919> is<00:04:46.100> we<00:04:46.490> can<00:04:46.610> go<00:04:46.730> and<00:04:47.090> people<00:04:47.240> were
