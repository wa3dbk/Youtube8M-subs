00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello girls it's Masha often 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.440
 ask why the apple arise 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.929
 some problems he breaks off 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.820
 exfoliate bubbles or something like that 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.830
 I suggest something in this video 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.360
 talk about this for some reason 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.080
 happens and how is it right after all 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.930
 apply gel varnish start over and 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.550
 the first thing we can run into is not 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.830
 properly prepared nail 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.010
 plate what can we expect on this 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.500
 stage 1 the edge of the nail should be absolutely 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.079
 smooth pharynx is necessary in order to 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.290
 when sealing the tip of the nail cover 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.399
 not going to lumps that will 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.800
 the effects of wearing very fast 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.879
 chipping and driving school cover 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.620
 the nail plate itself 2 momentik before 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.360
 the beginning of the procedure needs a little 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.940
 clean the keratin layer of the nail 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.820
 plate this is done by buff with high 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.969
 in order to improve 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.399
 the grip of the nail plate and the base but I 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.379
 I want to emphasize the word a little bit 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.449
 it means a little bit literally a couple of times 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.250
 ride a buff on the nail they 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.590
 grinds it from all sides in that 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.900
 narrow little film otherwise yes indeed 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.229
 varnish topping nails will only get worse 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.380
 here gel varnish itself will have nothing to do with it 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.960
 proceed directly to the application 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.960
 the first stage of the roof it is far from excess moisture 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.909
 from the nail plate sebum and also 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.670
 fine dust that can cause 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.799
 the appearance of bumps to cover so here 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.140
 exactly bad fat nail 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.950
 plate is the root of all ills connected 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.710
 chipped and flaking 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.840
 coverage should not be neglected in the evening 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.409
 do not replace it with alcohol or 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.750
 acetone 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.520
 because in alcohol or acetone you and 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.039
 contain some auxiliary 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.460
 substances here but oil for example which 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.920
 at this stage, we do not need any further 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.899
 nala se primers it is needed in order to 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.270
 somehow strengthen the grip of the nail 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.890
 gel varnish plates for working with 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.229
 acid-free gel polishes 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.360
 primer just eat more acid but 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.250
 rather for building up because oh 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.470
 force really contained 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.750
 acid that eats up the surface 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.750
 nails making it more legs and nails again 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.250
 need treatment the same as after 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.920
 building up so it's better all the same 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.269
 you can choose acid-free primer 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.849
 apply as the entire nail 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.310
 so and only on donut some girls 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.470
 manicure houses themselves and even 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.349
 some unscrupulous masters something not 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.450
 betray the use of primer but with 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.160
 the first for the same pieces and log 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.480
 they are the ones who complain about the bad 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.480
 manufacturer reached a basic framework 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.920
 covering is a very important part of the process 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.980
 it provides a solid connection 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.350
 between the surface of the nail these varnish when 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.780
 this protecting the news from pigmented 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.120
 the base needs to be applied in a thin layer and 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.730
 avoid the side rollers and 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.620
 cuticle important to remember that the base 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.540
 spreads when dried and can flow 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.790
 even if you neatly dyed 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.150
 keep this in mind and retreat a little 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.150
 more 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:06.769
 by dries a little faster than color and 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:11.030
 top ordinary morning before ivan leads 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:13.760
 dry for one minute and at 250 after drying 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.829
 bases you can take the dispersion layer this 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.709
 will help evenly apply a colored layer 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.269
 and prevent it from spreading at all 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.920
 dry one nail correctly 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.140
 made some dried 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.060
 and so time after time but it is rather 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.620
 salon option because at home 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.780
 conditions it will take too much 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.569
 time, especially if you use not 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:35.180
 Lermontov ordinary which dries by two 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.159
 minutes and in that case golden 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.409
 midway between the salon options in 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:42.200
 home use will be separate 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.760
 drying 4 fingers and separate drying large 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.590
 fingers because we need that by 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.470
 thumb cover spread out 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.870
 In general, let's be 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.400
 I use color number now 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.909
 118 code 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:58.010
 if you like it and follow the link 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:04:01.069
 remember that three thin layers are better than 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.959
 two fat ones because if you made up 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.239
 too thick layer of dust at risk 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.540
 get a wavy coating or 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:11.329
 bloated paint 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.060
 subtleties I will connect an hour complaint that 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.500
 gel lacquer bubbles when applied 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.500
 thanks to the habit of shaking the bottle 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.320
 before applying thanks to the usual varnish 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.080
 I give the blocks you need to mix because 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.240
 pigment settles well and when hacked 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.030
 ends we get a very thick gel 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.520
 varnish and no this is not the missing demos it 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.810
 just settled change 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.660
 mix properly and efficiently 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.270
 gel polish can be just slow 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:39.130
 also a bottle in different directions this 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.560
 the method can be applied immediately before 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.290
 drawing or you can still 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:46.090
 shake we then need to open the bottle 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:49.180
 and don't get a brush 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.940
 leave to stand for five hours I 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.070
 put three layers of color when the density 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.530
 color coverage will be enough for 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.560
 the color you choose 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.640
 the symptom is very simple 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.800
 the only caveat is that you need it 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.920
 dry well otherwise risk 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.200
 posing for a suit can be so brush 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.210
 will take on change therefore 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.060
 so as not to spoil the whole getting home 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.220
 it is better to apply it with a separate brush or 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:18.430
 just wash the flight brush before 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.560
 so as for against you necessarily 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.260
 dry each applied layer 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.490
 gel polish when we're not done 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.530
 we need to remove the dispersion word 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:32.080
 that many are mistaken using alcohol 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.150
 is a plan containing liquids they 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.070
 remarkably relieve an adhesive layer but 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.870
 nobody prog super limit knows in 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.450
 what reaction does your chosen one enter 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.470
 liquid and varnish gel coating therefore 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.600
 is it worth the risk 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.100
 perfect manicure with time and effort 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.080
 spent 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.170
 already use specially designated 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.720
 for this twitter fluid at the end 

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:55.020
 very appropriate to introduce special oils 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.070
 on the skin around the nail 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.070
 [music] 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.450
 especially if before applying 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.340
 gel polish and removed the old coating 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.840
 by the way this procedure prague life is yours 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.630

 sequence 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:31.630
 fresher console work base 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:33.760
 color top peak lenser use

 will certainly turn out by clicking on any
