00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
called shadow strikes I think and you

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.840 
called shadow strikes I think and you
have<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:30.380> dispel<00:02:31.380> it<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:31.830> you<00:02:31.920> can't<00:02:32.310> rank<00:02:32.580> shot

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
have to dispel it so you can't rank shot

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.350 
have to dispel it so you can't rank shot
it<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:34.100> he<00:02:35.100> does<00:02:35.310> a<00:02:35.340> lot<00:02:35.550> less<00:02:35.760> damage<00:02:36.150> then

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
it and he does a lot less damage then

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.570 
it and he does a lot less damage then
and<00:02:36.960> he<00:02:37.140> also<00:02:37.170> cast<00:02:37.680> chain<00:02:38.040> lightning<00:02:38.280> and

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
and he also cast chain lightning and

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.640 
and he also cast chain lightning and
you'll<00:02:38.670> see<00:02:38.880> right<00:02:39.030> there<00:02:39.330> he<00:02:39.810> casts<00:02:40.380> chain

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
you'll see right there he casts chain

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.050 
you'll see right there he casts chain
lightning<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.070> I<00:02:41.130> interrupted<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.820> with

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
lightning and I interrupted it with

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.600 
lightning and I interrupted it with
silencing<00:02:42.720> shot<00:02:42.930> so<00:02:43.470> if<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:44.130> don't<00:02:44.310> do<00:02:44.430> those

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
silencing shot so if you don't do those

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.090 
silencing shot so if you don't do those
two<00:02:44.880> things<00:02:44.910> you<00:02:45.330> will<00:02:45.570> die<00:02:45.920> Chain<00:02:46.920> Lightning

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
two things you will die Chain Lightning

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.460 
two things you will die Chain Lightning
will<00:02:47.370> take<00:02:47.580> you<00:02:47.730> down<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.390> probably<00:02:49.110> the

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
will take you down and probably the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.940 
will take you down and probably the
shadow<00:02:49.710> strikes<00:02:50.160> so<00:02:51.230> while<00:02:52.230> you're<00:02:52.470> kiting

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
shadow strikes so while you're kiting

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.410 
shadow strikes so while you're kiting
you<00:02:53.040> have<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.310> be<00:02:53.430> doing<00:02:53.700> those<00:02:53.970> two<00:02:54.180> things

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
you have to be doing those two things

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.480 
you have to be doing those two things
but<00:02:54.960> really<00:02:55.230> that's<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.590> whole<00:02:55.740> fight<00:02:56.040> is

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
but really that's the whole fight is

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.220 
but really that's the whole fight is
just<00:02:56.550> let<00:02:57.360> your<00:02:57.480> pet<00:02:57.660> tank<00:02:57.930> them<00:02:58.080> at<00:02:58.140> the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
just let your pet tank them at the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.160 
just let your pet tank them at the
beginning<00:02:58.590> rasm<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.820> then<00:03:00.630> kite<00:03:00.900> for<00:03:01.110> the

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
beginning rasm and then kite for the

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.120 
beginning rasm and then kite for the
rest<00:03:01.320> of<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.500> time<00:03:01.710> but<00:03:02.520> do<00:03:02.760> remember<00:03:02.970> to

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
rest of the time but do remember to

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.490 
rest of the time but do remember to
interrupt<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.430> purge<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:06.690> damage<00:03:07.260> buff<00:03:07.470> that

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
interrupt and purge the damage buff that

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:17.570 
interrupt and purge the damage buff that
he<00:03:07.710> has<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:16.590> next<00:03:16.770> two<00:03:16.860> fights<00:03:17.130> look<00:03:17.370> a<00:03:17.460> little

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
he has the next two fights look a little

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.830 
he has the next two fights look a little
bit<00:03:17.760> different<00:03:18.120> but<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.300> strategy<00:03:18.810> is

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
bit different but the strategy is

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.050 
bit different but the strategy is
exactly<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.470> same<00:03:20.180> this<00:03:21.180> guy<00:03:22.670> this<00:03:23.670> guy<00:03:23.790> has

DPS him that's the only one that he'll
take<00:03:50.490> damage<00:03:50.730> like<00:03:51.030> right<00:03:51.240> now<00:03:51.390> he's<00:03:51.600> doing<00:03:51.870> it

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
take damage like right now he's doing it

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.550 
take damage like right now he's doing it
so<00:03:53.400> you<00:03:54.390> want<00:03:54.570> to<00:03:54.630> stay<00:03:54.780> behind<00:03:54.960> him<00:03:55.290> as<00:03:55.410> often

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
so you want to stay behind him as often

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.130 
so you want to stay behind him as often
as<00:03:55.830> possible<00:03:56.150> but<00:03:57.150> really<00:03:57.480> just<00:03:57.510> save<00:03:57.960> your

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
as possible but really just save your

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.560 
as possible but really just save your
cutting<00:03:58.530> abilities<00:03:59.090> disengaged<00:04:00.090> traps

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
cutting abilities disengaged traps

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.810 
cutting abilities disengaged traps
things<00:04:00.930> like<00:04:01.110> that<00:04:01.320> for<00:04:02.220> when<00:04:02.370> he's<00:04:02.520> running

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
things like that for when he's running

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.580 
things like that for when he's running
around<00:04:02.940> here<00:04:03.450> in<00:04:03.570> between<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.080> shield<00:04:04.320> walls

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
around here in between the shield walls

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.310 
around here in between the shield walls
so<00:04:05.190> you<00:04:05.250> see<00:04:05.430> I<00:04:05.460> do<00:04:05.580> a<00:04:05.700> dump<00:04:06.030> jump<00:04:06.570> disengaged

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
so you see I do a dump jump disengaged

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.380 
so you see I do a dump jump disengaged
there<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.920> get<00:04:08.040> away<00:04:08.250> from<00:04:08.310> him<00:04:08.580> and<00:04:08.790> by<00:04:09.330> the

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
there to get away from him and by the

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.360 
there to get away from him and by the
time<00:04:09.480> he<00:04:09.630> catches<00:04:09.900> up<00:04:10.170> to<00:04:10.320> me<00:04:10.350> again<00:04:10.650> it's<00:04:11.010> time

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
time he catches up to me again it's time

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.910 
time he catches up to me again it's time
to<00:04:11.670> do<00:04:11.880> another<00:04:11.910> shield<00:04:12.390> wall<00:04:12.630> so<00:04:13.350> run<00:04:13.710> around

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
to do another shield wall so run around

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.470 
to do another shield wall so run around
to<00:04:14.010> the<00:04:14.100> back<00:04:14.280> do<00:04:14.490> a<00:04:14.520> little<00:04:14.730> bit<00:04:14.880> more<00:04:15.000> dps

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
to the back do a little bit more dps

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.110 
to the back do a little bit more dps
that's<00:04:16.140> all<00:04:16.320> this<00:04:16.440> fight<00:04:16.710> is<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.760> you'll<00:04:18.000> go

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
that's all this fight is and you'll go

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.490 
that's all this fight is and you'll go
down<00:04:18.270> pretty<00:04:18.570> quick<00:04:18.810> because<00:04:18.989> you<00:04:19.260> have<00:04:19.410> the

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
down pretty quick because you have the

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.190 
down pretty quick because you have the
damage

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
damage

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.540 
damage
from<00:04:20.410> killing<00:04:20.740> the<00:04:20.830> goblins<00:04:22.980> now<00:04:23.980> I<00:04:24.010> don't<00:04:24.310> put

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
from killing the goblins now I don't put

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.220 
from killing the goblins now I don't put
any<00:04:24.730> traps<00:04:25.030> down<00:04:25.270> here<00:04:25.570> and<00:04:25.690> that's<00:04:25.810> that's

any traps down here and that's that's

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.710 
any traps down here and that's that's
pretty<00:04:26.380> much<00:04:26.710> my<00:04:26.920> fault<00:04:27.210> but<00:04:28.210> I<00:04:28.270> did<00:04:28.510> make<00:04:28.660> it

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
pretty much my fault but I did make it

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:48.450 
pretty much my fault but I did make it
through<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:29.080> fight<00:04:46.230> so<00:04:47.230> again<00:04:47.460> you're

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
through the fight so again you're

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.650 
through the fight so again you're
cutting<00:04:48.790> abilities<00:04:49.210> that<00:04:49.330> you<00:04:49.390> have

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
cutting abilities that you have

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.840 
cutting abilities that you have
available<00:04:49.810> to<00:04:50.200> you<00:04:50.320> mostly<00:04:50.830> traps<00:04:51.280> you<00:04:51.640> have

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:51.850 
available to you mostly traps you have

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.790 
available to you mostly traps you have
disengaged<00:04:52.330> if<00:04:52.870> someone<00:04:53.200> gets<00:04:53.320> near<00:04:53.650> you<00:04:53.770> you

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
disengaged if someone gets near you you

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.040 
disengaged if someone gets near you you
might<00:04:54.190> want<00:04:54.400> to<00:04:54.520> deterrence<00:04:54.930> you<00:04:55.930> have

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
might want to deterrence you have

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.900 
might want to deterrence you have
concussive<00:04:56.500> shot<00:04:56.950> which<00:04:57.280> I<00:04:57.430> actually<00:04:57.520> didn't

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
concussive shot which I actually didn't

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.870 
concussive shot which I actually didn't
make<00:04:58.060> use<00:04:58.240> of<00:04:58.480> so<00:04:58.750> again<00:04:59.080> I<00:04:59.260> wasn't<00:04:59.890> doing<00:05:00.670> the

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
make use of so again I wasn't doing the

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.180 
make use of so again I wasn't doing the
greatest<00:05:01.270> job<00:05:01.420> with<00:05:01.660> kiting<00:05:02.020> if<00:05:02.560> you<00:05:02.770> have<00:05:03.010> if

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
greatest job with kiting if you have if

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.940 
greatest job with kiting if you have if
you're<00:05:03.310> a<00:05:03.370> pvp<00:05:04.210> ER<00:05:04.240> and<00:05:04.480> you<00:05:05.200> do<00:05:05.350> a<00:05:05.380> lot<00:05:05.680> of<00:05:05.710> this

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:05.950 
you're a pvp ER and you do a lot of this

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.680 
you're a pvp ER and you do a lot of this
and<00:05:06.550> you<00:05:06.640> do<00:05:06.760> a<00:05:06.790> lot<00:05:07.000> of<00:05:07.030> kiting<00:05:07.390> like<00:05:07.540> this

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
and you do a lot of kiting like this

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.880 
and you do a lot of kiting like this
you'll<00:05:07.870> probably<00:05:08.050> be<00:05:08.230> a<00:05:08.260> lot<00:05:08.410> better<00:05:08.590> at<00:05:08.800> this

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
you'll probably be a lot better at this

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.480 
you'll probably be a lot better at this
than<00:05:08.950> I<00:05:09.220> am<00:05:09.250> actually<00:05:09.610> I<00:05:10.390> don't<00:05:11.320> have<00:05:11.620> a<00:05:11.980> I

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
than I am actually I don't have a I

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.810 
than I am actually I don't have a I
pretty<00:05:13.090> much<00:05:13.180> solely<00:05:13.600> PvE<00:05:14.140> and<00:05:14.670> you<00:05:15.670> don't

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
pretty much solely PvE and you don't

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.370 
pretty much solely PvE and you don't
have<00:05:15.910> a<00:05:15.970> whole<00:05:16.120> lot<00:05:16.150> of<00:05:16.330> opportunity<00:05:16.990> to<00:05:17.200> do

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
have a whole lot of opportunity to do

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.760 
have a whole lot of opportunity to do
intense<00:05:18.010> kiting<00:05:18.490> so<00:05:19.090> what<00:05:20.050> I<00:05:20.080> was<00:05:20.290> able<00:05:20.410> to<00:05:20.560> do

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
intense kiting so what I was able to do

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.920 
intense kiting so what I was able to do
got<00:05:21.010> me<00:05:21.130> through<00:05:21.340> these<00:05:21.460> fights<00:05:21.880> but<00:05:22.660> there's

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
got me through these fights but there's

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:25.050 
got me through these fights but there's
certainly<00:05:23.350> more<00:05:23.440> efficient<00:05:24.100> ways<00:05:24.310> to<00:05:24.340> kite

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
certainly more efficient ways to kite

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.820 
certainly more efficient ways to kite
and<00:05:25.300> other<00:05:25.390> bility<00:05:25.780> other<00:05:26.140> abilities<00:05:26.710> that

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
and other bility other abilities that

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.130 
and other bility other abilities that
you<00:05:26.890> can<00:05:27.100> utilize<00:05:30.570> now<00:05:31.570> I<00:05:31.600> did<00:05:31.840> think<00:05:32.080> about

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
you can utilize now I did think about

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.050 
you can utilize now I did think about
concussive<00:05:32.680> shot<00:05:32.980> for<00:05:33.280> this<00:05:33.400> fight<00:05:33.640> I<00:05:33.670> think<00:05:34.000> I

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
concussive shot for this fight I think I

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:36.750 
concussive shot for this fight I think I
cast<00:05:34.330> it<00:05:34.540> once<00:05:34.810> on<00:05:35.020> this<00:05:35.650> last<00:05:35.890> boss<00:05:36.250> but<00:05:36.550> again

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
cast it once on this last boss but again

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.340 
cast it once on this last boss but again
didn't<00:05:37.060> make<00:05:37.150> as<00:05:37.300> much<00:05:37.450> use<00:05:37.690> of<00:05:37.840> it<00:05:37.960> as<00:05:38.050> I<00:05:38.170> might

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
didn't make as much use of it as I might

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:45.420 
didn't make as much use of it as I might
have<00:05:38.440> been<00:05:38.560> able<00:05:38.680> to

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430

a lot in my earlier videos but it's

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.510

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.370
