00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
the truth I'm not too sure if that's a

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.729 
the truth I'm not too sure if that's a
decent<00:00:56.969> size<00:00:57.270> for<00:00:57.660> him<00:00:57.750> or<00:00:57.930> not<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.289> know<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
decent size for him or not I know the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.799 
decent size for him or not I know the
character<00:00:58.920> but<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.309> really<00:00:59.550> don't<00:00:59.670> know<00:00:59.910> his

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
character but I really don't know his

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.900 
character but I really don't know his
size<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.199> don't<00:01:01.620> remember<00:01:01.770> him<00:01:02.430> being<00:01:02.460> that

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
size I don't remember him being that

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.149 
size I don't remember him being that
much<00:01:03.120> bigger<00:01:03.300> than<00:01:03.739> the<00:01:04.739> rest<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
much bigger than the rest of the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.580 
much bigger than the rest of the

the figures I wouldn't say my favorite
but<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:25.049> definitely<00:03:25.769> put<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.220> lot<00:03:26.370> of<00:03:26.489> work

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
but you definitely put a lot of work

but you definitely put a lot of work
into<00:03:26.819> him<00:03:27.060> like<00:03:27.599> I<00:03:27.630> said<00:03:27.930> I'm<00:03:28.019> not<00:03:28.049> sure<00:03:28.200> if<00:03:28.530> his

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
into him like I said I'm not sure if his

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.039 
into him like I said I'm not sure if his
size<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.370> really<00:03:29.519> accurate<00:03:29.790> but<00:03:30.269> for<00:03:30.900> what<00:03:31.019> I

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
size is really accurate but for what I

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.080 
size is really accurate but for what I
remember<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.859> should<00:03:31.919> be<00:03:32.370> about<00:03:32.579> accurate

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
remember it should be about accurate

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.589 
remember it should be about accurate
