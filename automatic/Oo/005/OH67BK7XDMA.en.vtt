00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
call that you know the tempo because if

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.539 
call that you know the tempo because if
we<00:01:00.750> sped<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.140> up<00:01:01.229> baby<00:01:01.760> or<00:01:02.760> slowed<00:01:03.089> it<00:01:03.239> down

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.179 

I<00:01:12.549> now<00:01:13.549> we<00:01:14.030> want<00:01:14.210> to<00:01:14.299> find<00:01:14.479> the<00:01:14.659> one<00:01:14.929> this<00:01:15.649> can

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
I now we want to find the one this can

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:17.859 
I now we want to find the one this can
be<00:01:16.219> a<00:01:16.310> little<00:01:16.490> hard<00:01:16.729> for<00:01:17.060> some<00:01:17.420> people<00:01:17.570> because

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
be a little hard for some people because

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.649 
be a little hard for some people because
you're<00:01:18.469> distracted<00:01:18.979> by<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.159> vocals<00:01:19.909> there's

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
you're distracted by the vocals there's

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.300 
you're distracted by the vocals there's
different<00:01:21.079> stuff<00:01:21.350> going<00:01:21.649> on<00:01:21.770> so<00:01:22.100> it's<00:01:22.250> like

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
different stuff going on so it's like

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.569 
different stuff going on so it's like
where<00:01:22.820> is<00:01:23.270> one<00:01:23.600> where<00:01:23.960> is<00:01:24.079> this<00:01:24.289> you<00:01:25.130> know<00:01:25.250> how

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:25.579 
where is one where is this you know how

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.459 
where is one where is this you know how
do<00:01:25.640> I<00:01:25.729> make<00:01:25.850> sense<00:01:26.210> of<00:01:26.360> all<00:01:26.479> this<00:01:26.659> and<00:01:26.929> so

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:27.469 
do I make sense of all this and so

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:29.800 
do I make sense of all this and so
usually<00:01:27.890> there's<00:01:28.069> a<00:01:28.159> phrasing<00:01:28.850> pattern<00:01:29.630> or<00:01:29.780> a

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
usually there's a phrasing pattern or a

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.199 
usually there's a phrasing pattern or a
rhythmic<00:01:30.350> pattern<00:01:30.710> that's<00:01:30.920> going<00:01:31.909> and<00:01:32.119> it

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:32.209 
rhythmic pattern that's going and it

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:34.510 
rhythmic pattern that's going and it
always<00:01:32.390> kind<00:01:32.780> of<00:01:32.929> starts<00:01:33.319> over<00:01:33.619> somewhere<00:01:34.009> so

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
always kind of starts over somewhere so

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.919 
always kind of starts over somewhere so
let's<00:01:34.640> just<00:01:34.819> hit<00:01:34.969> play<00:01:35.119> well<00:01:35.420> listen<00:01:35.780> a<00:01:35.840> little

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:35.929 
let's just hit play well listen a little

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:38.830 
let's just hit play well listen a little
bit<00:01:36.140> will<00:01:36.679> feel<00:01:36.860> our<00:01:37.069> beat<00:01:37.280> and<00:01:37.539> we'll<00:01:38.539> find

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
bit will feel our beat and we'll find

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:53.070 
bit will feel our beat and we'll find
the<00:01:38.990> one

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.600 

they're<00:01:54.080> just<00:01:54.110> started<00:01:54.830> right

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
they're just started right

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:06.320 
they're just started right
for<00:01:58.950> 1841

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.280 

34<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.970> that's<00:02:08.970> that's<00:02:09.420> how<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.720> find<00:02:09.960> the<00:02:10.080> one

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
34 so that's that's how you find the one

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.530 
34 so that's that's how you find the one
and<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:11.160> was<00:02:11.280> counting<00:02:11.460> four<00:02:12.000> beats<00:02:12.300> because

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
and I was counting four beats because

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.500 
and I was counting four beats because
most<00:02:13.260> music<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:13.800> in<00:02:13.950> for<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:14.910> if<00:02:15.030> you<00:02:15.180> can<00:02:15.480> I

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
most music is in for so if you can I

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.060 
most music is in for so if you can I
just<00:02:15.810> count<00:02:16.020> your<00:02:16.110> Forge<00:02:16.470> you'll<00:02:16.710> just<00:02:16.890> feel

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
just count your Forge you'll just feel

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.110 
just count your Forge you'll just feel
that<00:02:17.130> one<00:02:17.580> repeating<00:02:18.180> all<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.510> time

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.610 

alright<00:02:22.120> so<00:02:22.300> we<00:02:22.390> established<00:02:22.900> our<00:02:23.050> pulse<00:02:23.350> or

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
alright so we established our pulse or

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:29.540 
alright so we established our pulse or
beat<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:25.140> then<00:02:26.140> we've<00:02:26.319> found<00:02:26.740> our<00:02:27.069> one<00:02:28.470> 1234

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
beat and then we've found our one 1234

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.030 
beat and then we've found our one 1234
1234<00:02:30.720> and<00:02:31.720> that<00:02:31.900> beat<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.380> that<00:02:32.470> pulse<00:02:32.709> is<00:02:32.980> a

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
1234 and that beat and that pulse is a

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.730 
1234 and that beat and that pulse is a
quarter<00:02:33.520> note<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.900> if<00:02:34.959> we<00:02:35.080> go<00:02:35.200> on<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.380> guitar

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
quarter note so if we go on the guitar

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.160 
quarter note so if we go on the guitar
we<00:02:36.459> can<00:02:36.610> strum<00:02:36.970> let's<00:02:37.209> say<00:02:37.330> an<00:02:37.450> E<00:02:37.660> chord<00:02:37.690> and

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
we can strum let's say an E chord and

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.470 
we can strum let's say an E chord and
will<00:02:38.290> strum<00:02:38.530> down<00:02:38.740> strokes<00:02:39.459> for<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.060> quarter

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
will strum down strokes for a quarter

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.300 
will strum down strokes for a quarter
note<00:02:40.510> so<00:02:40.870> that<00:02:40.930> we<00:02:41.110> stay<00:02:41.170> connected<00:02:41.740> to<00:02:42.160> that

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
note so that we stay connected to that

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:49.680 
note so that we stay connected to that
pulse<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.830> if<00:02:48.700> you<00:02:48.790> don't<00:02:48.940> knowi<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.450> mean<00:02:49.600> you

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
pulse and if you don't knowi I mean you

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.030 
pulse and if you don't knowi I mean you
can<00:02:49.780> just<00:02:49.840> pluck<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.290> open<00:02:50.530> low<00:02:50.830> E<00:02:50.860> string

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
can just pluck the open low E string

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.670 
can just pluck the open low E string
just<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:52.090> practice<00:02:52.239> your<00:02:52.540> rhythms<00:02:52.840> alright

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
just to practice your rhythms alright

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.070 
just to practice your rhythms alright
next<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.250> can<00:02:54.400> double<00:02:54.820> it<00:02:54.940> up<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.360> get<00:02:55.810> eighth

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
next you can double it up and get eighth

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.949 
next you can double it up and get eighth
notes<00:02:56.380> one<00:02:57.190> and<00:02:57.430> two<00:02:57.760> and<00:02:57.940> three<00:02:58.030> and<00:02:58.390> four<00:02:58.600> and

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
notes one and two and three and four and

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.790 
notes one and two and three and four and
one<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.470> two<00:02:59.980> and<00:03:00.010> three<00:03:00.370> and<00:03:00.580> four<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:02.230> we

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
one and two and three and four and so we

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.060 
one and two and three and four and so we
saw<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.100> quarter<00:03:03.489> note<00:03:03.519> 1<00:03:04.060> 2<00:03:04.570> 3<00:03:04.870> 4<00:03:05.320> and<00:03:05.830> we<00:03:05.890> just

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
saw a quarter note 1 2 3 4 and we just

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:07.610 
saw a quarter note 1 2 3 4 and we just
stuck<00:03:06.340> something<00:03:06.610> right<00:03:06.850> in<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.060> middle<00:03:07.239> and

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
stuck something right in the middle and

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.580 
stuck something right in the middle and
one<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:08.890> two<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:09.160> three<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:09.760> four<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.590> so

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
one and two and three and four and so

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.020 
one and two and three and four and so
what<00:03:11.920> we<00:03:12.010> can<00:03:12.130> do<00:03:12.310> is<00:03:12.459> to<00:03:12.640> keep<00:03:12.820> that

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
what we can do is to keep that

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.320 
what we can do is to keep that
connection<00:03:13.390> we<00:03:14.110> can<00:03:14.260> strum<00:03:14.620> down<00:03:14.650> for<00:03:15.269> for<00:03:16.269> our

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
connection we can strum down for for our

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.449 
connection we can strum down for for our
poles<00:03:16.600> for<00:03:16.930> a<00:03:16.959> beat<00:03:17.200> and<00:03:17.769> just<00:03:18.070> add<00:03:18.220> the<00:03:18.340> eighth

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
poles for a beat and just add the eighth

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:26.370 
poles for a beat and just add the eighth
notes<00:03:18.760> as<00:03:19.030> an<00:03:19.150> up<00:03:22.200> one<00:03:23.200> and<00:03:23.530> three<00:03:24.370> men<00:03:24.580> for<00:03:25.380> the

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
notes as an up one and three men for the

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.680 
notes as an up one and three men for the
next<00:03:26.799> rhythm<00:03:27.250> that<00:03:27.400> you<00:03:27.579> have<00:03:27.790> is<00:03:28.090> sixteenth

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
next rhythm that you have is sixteenth

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.270 
next rhythm that you have is sixteenth
notes<00:03:28.930> so<00:03:29.260> you<00:03:29.290> just<00:03:29.410> double<00:03:29.769> it<00:03:29.829> up<00:03:29.950> again

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
notes so you just double it up again

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.940 
notes so you just double it up again
it's<00:03:31.120> kind<00:03:31.420> of<00:03:31.540> like<00:03:31.600> this<00:03:31.930> one<00:03:32.410> iana<00:03:32.650> to

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
it's kind of like this one iana to

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.060 
it's kind of like this one iana to
Vienna<00:03:33.250> 3e<00:03:33.579> Anna<00:03:33.850> for<00:03:34.150> Jana<00:03:34.390> so<00:03:35.260> we<00:03:35.380> added<00:03:35.590> a

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
Vienna 3e Anna for Jana so we added a

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.720 
Vienna 3e Anna for Jana so we added a
note<00:03:37.000> after<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.810> one<00:03:38.019> and<00:03:38.290> the<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.829> so<00:03:39.640> we

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
note after the one and the and so we

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.560 
note after the one and the and so we
have<00:03:39.820> one<00:03:40.090> E<00:03:40.269> and<00:03:40.360> up<00:03:41.320> on<00:03:41.590> the<00:03:41.730> guitar<00:03:42.730> we<00:03:43.390> have

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
have one E and up on the guitar we have

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.360 
have one E and up on the guitar we have
to<00:03:43.780> make<00:03:44.019> all<00:03:44.320> our<00:03:44.350> eighth<00:03:44.680> notes<00:03:44.980> down

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
to make all our eighth notes down

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.789 
to make all our eighth notes down
strokes<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.150> our<00:03:46.690> sixteenth<00:03:47.200> notes<00:03:47.440> become

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
strokes and our sixteenth notes become

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.130 
strokes and our sixteenth notes become
upstrokes<00:03:48.430> so<00:03:49.239> we<00:03:49.450> still<00:03:49.600> have<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.810> quarter

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
upstrokes so we still have a quarter

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.740 
upstrokes so we still have a quarter
note<00:03:51.390> and<00:03:52.390> our<00:03:53.079> eighth<00:03:53.290> note<00:03:53.640> too

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
note and our eighth note too

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.960 
note and our eighth note too
this<00:03:56.750> time<00:03:57.020> is<00:03:57.290> all<00:03:57.620> down<00:03:57.830> strokes<00:04:00.160> and<00:04:01.160> then

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
this time is all down strokes and then

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.750 
this time is all down strokes and then
your<00:04:02.120> sixteenth<00:04:02.600> notes<00:04:02.980> you<00:04:03.980> end<00:04:04.340> up<00:04:04.460> having

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
your sixteenth notes you end up having

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.970 
your sixteenth notes you end up having
it<00:04:05.000> up<00:04:07.420> one<00:04:08.420> E<00:04:08.450> and<00:04:08.570> a<00:04:08.810> two<00:04:08.840> E<00:04:09.050> and<00:04:09.200> A<00:04:09.440> three<00:04:09.470> and

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
it up one E and a two E and A three and

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:16.180 
it up one E and a two E and A three and
a<00:04:10.160> four<00:04:10.190> yet<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.870> now<00:04:15.080> let's<00:04:15.680> go<00:04:15.770> back<00:04:15.860> to<00:04:16.040> our

go the other direction you can have

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:23.170 
go the other direction you can have
longer<00:04:20.930> notes<00:04:21.170> like<00:04:22.040> a<00:04:22.100> half<00:04:22.310> note<00:04:22.610> is<00:04:22.790> two

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
quarter notes for two two beats long

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.870 
quarter notes for two two beats long
like<00:04:26.090> this

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.020 

and<00:04:31.570> you<00:04:32.320> can<00:04:32.470> even<00:04:32.710> go<00:04:32.920> longer<00:04:33.400> a<00:04:33.550> whole<00:04:33.820> note

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
and you can even go longer a whole note

these<00:04:42.310> different<00:04:42.850> note<00:04:43.090> links<00:04:43.450> will<00:04:44.080> create

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
these different note links will create

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.900 
these different note links will create
your<00:04:44.620> rhythms

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:46.910 
your rhythms

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.219 
your rhythms

all right now let's go back to this song

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:51.500 
all right now let's go back to this song
and<00:04:49.560> find<00:04:50.250> out<00:04:50.430> what<00:04:50.639> rhythm<00:04:50.970> the<00:04:51.120> guitar<00:04:51.389> is

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
and find out what rhythm the guitar is

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.780 
and find out what rhythm the guitar is
playing<00:04:51.889> first<00:04:52.889> we'll<00:04:53.070> start<00:04:53.160> by<00:04:53.550> finding

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
playing first we'll start by finding

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:00.379 
playing first we'll start by finding
that<00:04:54.060> pulse<00:04:57.380> there's<00:04:58.380> our<00:04:58.500> poles<00:04:58.880> one<00:04:59.880> two

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
that pulse there's our poles one two

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:09.690 
that pulse there's our poles one two
three<00:05:00.710> orders<00:05:01.710> are<00:05:01.889> 12

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.920 

and<00:05:10.700> this<00:05:11.210> is<00:05:11.330> where<00:05:11.510> it<00:05:11.570> gets<00:05:11.630> a<00:05:11.810> little

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:11.930 
and this is where it gets a little

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.410 
and this is where it gets a little
tricky<00:05:12.230> because<00:05:12.560> you<00:05:12.890> have<00:05:13.010> to<00:05:13.190> focus<00:05:13.910> in<00:05:14.300> on

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
tricky because you have to focus in on

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.840 
tricky because you have to focus in on
the<00:05:14.600> guitar<00:05:14.930> kind<00:05:15.500> of<00:05:15.590> block<00:05:15.800> out<00:05:16.010> the<00:05:16.040> melody

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:16.850 
the guitar kind of block out the melody

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.720 
the guitar kind of block out the melody
or<00:05:17.420> block<00:05:17.660> out<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:17.900> drums<00:05:18.380> and<00:05:18.770> focus<00:05:19.490> in<00:05:19.640> on

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
or block out the drums and focus in on

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.070 
or block out the drums and focus in on
the<00:05:19.850> guitar<00:05:20.150> so<00:05:20.360> let's<00:05:20.510> just<00:05:20.660> listen<00:05:20.810> to<00:05:20.990> the

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
the guitar so let's just listen to the

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.280 
the guitar so let's just listen to the
guitar<00:05:21.380> little<00:05:21.530> bit<00:05:21.650> that<00:05:21.830> same<00:05:22.160> section

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:23.290 
guitar little bit that same section

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:27.040 
guitar little bit that same section
let's<00:05:24.290> back<00:05:24.680> it<00:05:24.710> up<00:05:24.980> and<00:05:25.970> let's<00:05:26.570> listen<00:05:26.960> to

let's back it up and let's listen to
just<00:05:27.260> a<00:05:27.350> guitar<00:05:27.680> rhythm

00:05:36.939 --> 00:05:36.949 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:40.219

but i vetted undone so some of that goes
right<00:05:47.009> with<00:05:47.220> it<00:05:47.250> the<00:05:47.850> fruit<00:05:48.120> let's<00:05:48.300> break<00:05:48.509> it

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
right with it the fruit let's break it

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.689 
right with it the fruit let's break it
in<00:05:48.720> half<00:05:48.780> the<00:05:49.199> first<00:05:49.410> half<00:05:49.530> down<00:05:50.160> down<00:05:50.430> down

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
in half the first half down down down

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:55.310 
in half the first half down down down
did<00:05:51.000> a<00:05:51.380> dumb<00:05:52.380> dumb<00:05:52.680> dumb<00:05:52.710> dumb<00:05:53.570> dumb<00:05:54.570> dumb<00:05:54.840> so

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:55.320 
did a dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb so

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:00.620 
did a dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb so
that's<00:05:55.470> eight<00:05:55.770> notes<00:05:58.370> and<00:05:59.370> then<00:06:00.090> with<00:06:00.449> some

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
that's eight notes and then with some

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.420 
that's eight notes and then with some
sixteenth<00:06:01.080> notes<00:06:01.229> don't<00:06:01.560> own<00:06:01.860> dumb<00:06:02.130> but<00:06:02.400> I

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
sixteenth notes don't own dumb but I

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:09.469 
sixteenth notes don't own dumb but I
don't<00:06:02.970> go<00:06:05.720> so<00:06:06.720> the<00:06:07.650> count<00:06:07.949> ends<00:06:08.280> up<00:06:08.370> being<00:06:08.580> one

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:09.479 
don't go so the count ends up being one

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:13.270 
don't go so the count ends up being one
and<00:06:09.840> two<00:06:10.169> and<00:06:10.789> then<00:06:11.789> we<00:06:11.940> have<00:06:12.150> a<00:06:12.419> little<00:06:12.690> bit<00:06:12.870> of

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
and two and then we have a little bit of

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.350 
and two and then we have a little bit of
sixteenth<00:06:14.280> notes<00:06:14.550> one<00:06:14.910> and<00:06:15.210> two<00:06:15.509> anda<00:06:17.360> and

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
sixteenth notes one and two anda and

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.219 
sixteenth notes one and two anda and
then<00:06:19.259> the<00:06:19.410> second<00:06:20.400> half<00:06:20.580> is<00:06:20.849> three<00:06:21.780> E<00:06:21.810> and<00:06:21.930> a

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229 
then the second half is three E and a

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:27.020 
then the second half is three E and a
four<00:06:24.050> four<00:06:25.050> one<00:06:25.590> and<00:06:25.800> two<00:06:25.889> and<00:06:26.460> A<00:06:26.699> three<00:06:26.729> E<00:06:26.940> and

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
four four one and two and A three E and

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.689 
four four one and two and A three E and
a<00:06:27.330> four<00:06:29.060> and<00:06:30.060> so<00:06:31.050> we<00:06:31.199> just<00:06:31.490> take<00:06:32.490> those

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:32.699 
a four and so we just take those

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:34.760 
a four and so we just take those
different<00:06:33.389> note<00:06:33.570> lengths<00:06:33.960> and<00:06:34.410> we<00:06:34.560> can<00:06:34.680> use

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:34.770 
different note lengths and we can use

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.129 
different note lengths and we can use
account<00:06:35.190> to<00:06:35.370> kind<00:06:35.490> of<00:06:35.610> help<00:06:35.729> establish<00:06:36.360> where

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:37.139 
account to kind of help establish where

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:39.080 
account to kind of help establish where
they're<00:06:37.320> happening<00:06:37.680> and<00:06:37.949> then<00:06:38.759> we've<00:06:38.880> got<00:06:38.910> a

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
they're happening and then we've got a

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:52.500 
they're happening and then we've got a
rhythm

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.510 

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.520 

alright<00:06:53.510> so<00:06:53.690> you<00:06:53.750> see<00:06:53.930> how<00:06:54.050> we<00:06:54.110> found<00:06:54.350> the

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:54.530 
alright so you see how we found the

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:56.290 
alright so you see how we found the
rhythm<00:06:54.830> five<00:06:55.010> by<00:06:55.370> first<00:06:55.670> you<00:06:55.850> know<00:06:55.940> finding

00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:56.300 
rhythm five by first you know finding

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.110 
rhythm five by first you know finding
that<00:06:56.450> pulse<00:06:56.920> finding<00:06:57.920> the<00:06:58.010> one<00:06:58.190> and<00:06:58.520> just

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 
that pulse finding the one and just

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.600 
that pulse finding the one and just
identifying<00:06:59.720> the<00:06:59.870> rhythms<00:07:00.230> a<00:07:00.470> rock<00:07:01.100> prodigy

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610 
identifying the rhythms a rock prodigy

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.580 
identifying the rhythms a rock prodigy
has<00:07:01.760> a<00:07:01.790> bunch<00:07:02.180> of<00:07:02.330> lessons<00:07:02.780> and<00:07:02.930> exercises

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:03.590 
has a bunch of lessons and exercises

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:05.050 
has a bunch of lessons and exercises
that<00:07:03.740> will<00:07:03.890> kind<00:07:04.160> of<00:07:04.190> get<00:07:04.340> you<00:07:04.520> used<00:07:04.880> two

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:05.060 
that will kind of get you used two

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.540 
that will kind of get you used two
different<00:07:05.210> rhythm<00:07:05.720> patterns<00:07:06.250> and<00:07:07.250> then<00:07:07.400> you

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
different rhythm patterns and then you

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:09.310 
different rhythm patterns and then you
know<00:07:07.670> just<00:07:07.910> go<00:07:08.300> about<00:07:08.360> go<00:07:08.750> out<00:07:08.870> and<00:07:09.050> listen<00:07:09.260> to

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:09.320 
know just go about go out and listen to

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.200 
know just go about go out and listen to
your<00:07:09.380> favorite<00:07:09.740> music<00:07:09.770> and<00:07:10.370> listen<00:07:10.760> for<00:07:10.940> these

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:15.080 
and the rhythm patterns then come back

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.100 
and the rhythm patterns then come back
and<00:07:15.260> have<00:07:15.530> fun<00:07:15.680> on<00:07:15.860> your<00:07:15.890> guitar
