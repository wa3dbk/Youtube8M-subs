00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:09.940
 Hello I am from my team and today 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.509
 i want to show you how to do it 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.849
 Potatoes on wÃ¶lfl in front of me are four 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.700
 rows of potatoes because the two rheine 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.800
 I already have the first turn earth 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.520
 heaped up so that you can easily 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.809
 Dams recognizes the two rows are 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.910
 untouched and on these two rows 

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:31.119
 the dense how to explain the am 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:35.440
 why do you like potatoes? 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:38.079
 Of course , we want one 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.109
 rich harvest produce and by the 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.109
 earthing up potatoes we give the 

00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:46.570
 Plant the opportunity laterally 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:50.140
 to put on underground to those 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.300
 the potato her tubers forms that 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.890
 So call and get them frequently 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.050
 in the end more potatoes 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.589
 but it is also important that this 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.210
 potatoes are not washed free to 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.729
 for example, precipitation 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.440
 they should always be covered with earth 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:07.600
 be because if a potato is green 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.300
 then it gets poisonous all 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.690
 ingredients are the green of the plant 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.580
 toxic and not suitable for consumption 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.520
 maybe that will be the first 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.190
 Fruits attached to the inflorescences 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.340
 Here too, the should concern 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.500
 they by no means decorate appropriate 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.710
 garden tools are for this activity 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:35.490
 the save or if you like the hand 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:38.760
 Plowing the shovel is very easy 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.930
 walk along the rhine 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.280
 next to him something earth and throw the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.640
 between the potato plants and on 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.440
 the potato plants 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.570
 it is not bad at all if the 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.830
 Whole plant should have their potatoes 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.140
 still be small 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.240
 covered with earth is because the green 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:02.400
 the green part of the plants and again 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.400
 grow upwards 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:17.120
 quietly take the earth from the right and 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:30.890
 left that you enough he ready 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:32.570
 have right to form after 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.740
 West is of course when the ground 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.740
 is softened 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.050
 you should do this activity calmly 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.870
 repeat several times during the season 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:12.450
 so may the devils really nice high 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:15.780
 Piling up is not just a concern 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.930
 the potatoes can also be your plant 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.350
 They just push them on today 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.510
 on the earth side 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:32.310
 this creates a lance in the professional 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:33.830
 beautiful long white we can do 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.160
 also recommend the cabbage plants 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.500
 to accumulate 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.600
 such as the broccoli here 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.540
 also the cabbage and other head 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.670
 cabbage red or white do not cool 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.310
 you should pile up the kohlrabi's 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.290
 do not like it when the tubers are on earth 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.630
 are covered 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.330
 Why should they pile cabbage on the one hand? 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.880
 The head cabbage forms above all 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.940
 The lateral supports support him 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.580
 give a better stand and you 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.550
 wanted the infestation by the cabbage 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.950
 then do not fly past the root neck 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:10.860
 it is just as easy to set free 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.940
 just like a little before wine 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.940
 push earth 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:18.870
 going fast 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:25.259
 finished
