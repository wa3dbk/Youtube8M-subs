00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:09.960
 Well then you'll get into trouble with a 1 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:13.410
 It's the best but it's too late to say that it's a pale yellow formula 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.320
 It is made of only Now Do This loaf 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.640
 It is what I uninstall official in 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.640
 Town official 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:29.980
 From pale yellow role 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:35.340
 Where say the number of answer you integer took the character 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:38.180
 As it becomes part of number after other than this time 300 yen 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.180
 The factor is 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.350
 And will you Well then + N' 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.500
 I told finished Ura Seto 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.010
 Defense-3 b 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.870
 Since the cut in the two did split this 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.870
 It is an official along 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:12.600
 Dead octopus 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:16.259
 It is the size of the coefficient of each school that is hugely freezing about the polynomial 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.380
 Well this is good from the notch When you say Kowa 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:25.909
 Only is written another one of those monitor while the 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:29.479
 So eh a great simple When you said: 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.119
 I'll just cut it to go go yeah yeah 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.450
 How 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:37.550
 - on the third day it is a sister Once raised outside 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.870
 Just put corn in the middle 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.960
 I'm sorry 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.960
 Well then if you ask for the coefficients 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:56.590
 Let 's answer each chair in the case of Kobaye each school. 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:02:01.409
 Here and rear separately how to answer coefficient of it today's An'nen 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:05.749
 For example, let's say goodbye to the beginning-3 world 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.749
 In this case because it is parting in the Lame description 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.829
 Hey's company yeah yeah 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.090
 Psychic 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.739
 5 then 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.739
 Riding good 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.260
 continue 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.210
 y Let's write as Nasu 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:34.740
 Then it is the third one 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:38.540
 The third is -2/3 x 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.540
 This is also this 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:51.160
 As a mass up to one 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:51.160
 It is pale yellow, but even if a fraction enters, I know the tanka from this full 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:59.310
 Then I would like to answer only the coefficient 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:03.960
 I will 2/3 x 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:08.200
 Numbers attached to letters-2/3 shop this is as it is 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.680
 Please give written while its also a fraction 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.500
 Is that okay 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:17.350
 Then I will go to 4 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.319
 4 Tsumou is this Hyo' this 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.469
 so 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:28.450
 There is no coal mine there just for cleaning 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:28.450
 Turn ancient rite, even this is only one character alone pale yellow numbers 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.390
 But to the factor 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.790
 Digits attached to 3 letters in case of numbers only 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:46.200
 Inner circle after gyanization 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:51.739
 The coefficient is still better before this 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.739
 Since there is no coefficient in the case of Su sou, it is worth noting 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.410
 Luigi 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.310
 Good 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:06.300
 Towards the corner 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.300
 There is no factor 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.989
 There is no ace 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:20.370
 There is no case in relation to sake 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:24.389
 Yes So is the next 5 th 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:27.250
 As it is clearly Dokandukandokan well 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:31.590
 Because there is no mass This 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.590
 It will be a polynomial 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:43.900
 If you have a good time to go to the case of the face you want to coat 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:47.710
 But or high give wipe until now you were amazing cans I described Re edition earlier 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:51.820
 After all day f with f more than 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:54.650
 Then-3 f 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:59.960
 3 parts x and 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:03.080
 Concern is I'm good, even not put even Well number 4 Well of this Wes Inter + with 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.750
 It is also not a mistake to put in another poised land 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:11.100
 It will be called 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.100
 It is coefficient of each school each 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:19.130
 And say whether or not there is Anko public that now participate in one Nja I 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:24.760
 I do not think each 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:30.480
 It seems good in respect to x2 or more on -2 x 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.480
 Coefficient of more than Holdings is and go write in this kind of wind 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:39.960
 The numbers attached to x2 or more are not 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:42.150
 Contains Chochoi is Yappa 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:48.340
 Police case 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:55.320
 Was the number -3 minutes Pegan or strange feeling of Okeru attached to the mortar 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:55.320
 In this case that in the egg of 3 minutes to put out y is 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.169
 -3 minutes 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:06.820
 life 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:09.060
 1x1 along the eyes are omitted and it is the kettle way of life 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.380
 What 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:14.700
 The factor is 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:17.050
 There is no part here I want to support you back 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:21.990
 Mang selling 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.990
 The factor attached is 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:36.190
 -One third 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:37.000
 I If you answer only this because there is only now we police stand because there is no coefficient is related to the place of Yang 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.480
 is 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.480
 What say
