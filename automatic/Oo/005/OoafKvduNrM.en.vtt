00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.299
 i know you don't like yes i'm telling 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.379
 politics but still i have some nuances 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:09.120
 requests especially when it comes to 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.679
 Crimea, I will not go now 5 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.590
 political assessments are correct 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.800
 correctly joining the Crimea to the question 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.600
 stations and why aren't they deepening in 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.359
 principle is unlikely to be on and on here 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.529
 there will be a failure back because there is one 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.500
 interesting is not particularly the case is that again 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.940
 in the process the so -called again 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.340
 hegemony of the so-called West 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.680
 pushing Russia into the arms of China 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.300
 particular very dangerous 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.640
 for the west itself why because 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.289
 because the union of the two countries of him 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.810
 for how what will it be who is there so how 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:55.650
 let's say 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.970
 stupid relationship but nonetheless 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.820
 the greatest labor resources on earth 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.840
 plus the largest natural reserves 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.390
 fossil and land is actually a third a 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.820
 planets imagine such a union before 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.490
 Europe and the Western world would probably 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.270
 on the contrary, they wanted natural resources 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:20.980
 more so pushing into the arms of China 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:24.370
 In principle, it is not profitable for western countries 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:26.680
 because the May 9th victory parade is something 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.540
 showed the same western countries 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.210
 so there may be a lot of hype 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.979
 democracy stories such data on 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.300
 Concluded on but in principle the mental compartment 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.160
 western country of this fearing and 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.100
 fear really naturally 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.610
 such an association with is quite dangerous well 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.020
 and the second is also an important factor 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.090
 Russians of the northern roots 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.110
 it cannot be limited there in some kind 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.630
 space and try 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.240
 let's say pestering russia 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.990
 really heavily tied to the world 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:07.979
 economy is first of all first 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:12.819
 Western European countries they suffer losses and 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.200
 ordinary so let's say a European will pass 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.910
 it will be difficult to explain to them that for the sake of 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.640
 some kind of democracy for some 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:24.400
 Ukraine, they are ready to sacrifice 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.300
 personal well-being of his farm in 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.590
 some firms need this 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.890
 precisely which lowers the western world 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.140
 because there is a lot going on in the world 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.550
 what is there some event happening there 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.100
 event and of course living in 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:46.750
 Ukraine Ukraine Russia is perceived there 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:49.300
 what is happening in the east of Crimea I will say something 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.880
 which is close for most countries on 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.890
 really don't give a damn about what 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.840
 happens they are interested again personal 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.280
 welfare personal pocket again with 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.470
 Western philosophy doesnâ€™t care 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.290
 built more on this than on 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.080
 some kind of symbolic democracy here 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:08.320
 what are the main two reasons that are early 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.420
 or later hi basically so 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.370
 call stealing from the station although the machines 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.630
 formally will be saved as it were for 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:20.830
 visibility but the threat of russia china 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:24.280
 consolidation and economic damages for 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.210
 most west all the same most likely that 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.430
 will lead to leveling sled 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:33.180
 although you do not like thank you policy but 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.180
 just draw
