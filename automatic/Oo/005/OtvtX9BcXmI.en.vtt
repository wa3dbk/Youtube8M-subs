00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:26.779
 in two days we will review a little bit 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.910
 all there is way to do for 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.650
 progress to turn faster in 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.780
 security it's really for us very 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:35.720
 important we will also do levels 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.860
 different depending on the speed of 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.860
 each trainee 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.610
 so my role during this internship is to 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.280
 to supervise a group of eight to nine 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.280
 people from whom was determined in 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.560
 according to the level of the participants 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.510
 the group is made up of people from 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.880
 equivalent level with experience a 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.890
 pretty much similar and so during these 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.320
 two days of internship we will work at 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.870
 through workshops al conferences so 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.010
 we discuss topics in theory for 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.990
 put into practice that right away 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.200
 behind on a 20-minute session in 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.200
 track 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.970
 I 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.960
 he 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.220
 so I did this internship because 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.140
 I wanted to have a first 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.260
 track experience in others 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:52.729
 conditions with good advice 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.979
 to be able to really enjoy 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.560
 safe then I think it takes 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.229
 dissociate well between the road 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.630
 and the circuit in any case the circuit is going 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.649
 to go beyond its limits I think 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.549
 that it is better not to go beyond 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.310
 limits on the road 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:09.259
 and especially to have a look 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.849
 criticism about his name on his driving 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.130
 there is always something left for 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:16.450
 the wheel but make the circuit the pure 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.450
 it's really very nice 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.880
 I had already advised pilots 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.170
 I knew a little bit about it 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.300
 worked of course and 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.340
 I knew that I really had to give 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.160
 not ready live advice 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.330
 stopping you know there in the bend 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.730
 you did not do that well no it's really 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.930
 afterwards it's too difficult and it's 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.370
 much more efficient in this way 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.920
 here we try to pass a paper in 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.920
 China is accelerating 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.819
 pity 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.190
 you do not care enough about the lever 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.350
 all finesse 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.830
 because brutality 1 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.740
 yet 6 2 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.550
 little step to sweat 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.940
 also because 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.940
 on the big 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.630
 well then 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.630
 nelson and bordeaux 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.290
 I wanted to continue 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.349
 improvement of my driving because 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.090
 that basically doing the road 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.989
 here I needed to go a little bit more 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.760
 at the end of myself and after 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.549
 machine capabilities all that one 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.190
 will learn on the track obviously going 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:50.950
 enormously help us to apprehend 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.159
 the road this way ie 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.650
 on the track I'm learning to anticipate 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:59.110
 things so I have a speed of 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.879
 gesture that allows me to be better 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.269
 prepared for what will happen by the 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.120
 after 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:08.440
 and my gesture is much more precise 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.440
 our look 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:30.960
 in fact 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.920
 and in fact the circuit we learn the 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:43.060
 rigor it's these two but there are 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:45.700
 a music score executed a the 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.990
 second is that it is the rigor it is 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:48.760
 quite complex 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.950
 it was great without pressure they will have 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.660
 had a great time it really 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:54.770
 progresses relative to levels 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.699
 that I had and 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:01.270
 it was really informative and nice 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:01.270
 two days 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.160
 Yes 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:29.259
 it's your first pagnol congratulations 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.259
 haired 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:58.590
 no effect and next one synchronizes 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.590
 tonight 2-3
