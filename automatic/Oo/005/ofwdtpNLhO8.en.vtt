but the running phrase that French

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.249 
but the running phrase that French

man who had a lot to do with people
getting<00:00:41.340> interested<00:00:41.940> in<00:00:42.030> taking<00:00:42.239> care<00:00:42.570> of

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:42.630 
getting interested in taking care of

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.950 
getting interested in taking care of
their<00:00:42.809> own<00:00:42.930> bodies<00:00:43.350> well<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:43.890> think<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.550> was<00:00:44.790> at

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
their own bodies well I think I was at

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.979 
their own bodies well I think I was at
the<00:00:45.960> right<00:00:46.050> place<00:00:46.110> at<00:00:46.470> the<00:00:46.500> right<00:00:46.559> time<00:00:46.710> and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
and again there's a there's a luck

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.250 
and again there's a there's a luck
element<00:00:51.270> involved<00:00:51.449> in<00:00:51.720> everything<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.140> you

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
element involved in everything that you

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.900 
element involved in everything that you
do<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.739> was<00:00:52.890> lucky<00:00:53.040> that<00:00:53.220> the<00:00:53.460> training<00:00:53.820> I

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
do and I was lucky that the training I

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.330 
do and I was lucky that the training I
had<00:00:54.030> done<00:00:54.150> was<00:00:54.420> right<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.989> i<00:00:55.890> think<00:00:55.920> i<00:00:56.190> was

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
had done was right and i think i was

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.240 
had done was right and i think i was
also<00:00:56.520> again<00:00:57.440> fortunate<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.559> i<00:00:58.590> came<00:00:58.710> along

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
also again fortunate that i came along

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.970 
also again fortunate that i came along
at<00:00:59.610> a<00:00:59.640> time<00:00:59.970> in<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.600> scientific<00:01:01.230> development

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
at a time in the scientific development

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.549 
at a time in the scientific development
of<00:01:02.040> the<00:01:02.129> sport<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:03.210> my<00:01:03.870> type<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.170> training

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
of the sport that my type of training

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.440 
of the sport that my type of training
was<00:01:04.800> all<00:01:04.949> I<00:01:04.979> needed<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.430> do<00:01:05.670> there's<00:01:06.270> all<00:01:06.420> that

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
was all I needed to do there's all that

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.999 
was all I needed to do there's all that
luck<00:01:06.750> involved<00:01:07.020> because<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.470> Americans<00:01:07.860> have

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
luck involved because the Americans have

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.790 
luck involved because the Americans have
been<00:01:08.190> very<00:01:08.660> behind<00:01:09.660> in<00:01:10.050> the<00:01:10.170> sophistication

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
been very behind in the sophistication

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.999 
been very behind in the sophistication
of<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.340> scientific<00:01:12.020> research<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.259> sport<00:01:13.619> we

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:14.009 
of the scientific research on sport we

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:15.650 
of the scientific research on sport we
do<00:01:14.130> lots<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.430> scientific<00:01:14.910> research<00:01:15.030> but<00:01:15.540> then

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
do lots of scientific research but then

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.240 
do lots of scientific research but then
the<00:01:15.750> other<00:01:15.780> countries<00:01:16.290> use<00:01:16.500> our<00:01:16.710> data<00:01:16.950> and

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the other countries use our data and

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.249 
the other countries use our data and
then<00:01:17.729> they<00:01:17.940> transfer<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.869> athletes

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
then they transfer it to the athletes

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.469 
then they transfer it to the athletes
now<00:01:19.830> we're<00:01:20.070> finally<00:01:20.280> doing<00:01:20.550> it<00:01:20.790> here<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.360> I

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
now we're finally doing it here and I

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.060 
now we're finally doing it here and I
may<00:01:21.690> have<00:01:21.780> been<00:01:21.990> one<00:01:22.380> of<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.560> first<00:01:22.590> that

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
may have been one of the first that

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.420 
may have been one of the first that
people<00:01:23.550> started<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.030> look<00:01:24.149> at<00:01:24.360> because<00:01:24.539> my

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
people started to look at because my

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.889 
people started to look at because my
advantage<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.610> running<00:01:26.940> is<00:01:27.060> not<00:01:27.090> strength<00:01:27.630> it

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
advantage in running is not strength it

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.639 
advantage in running is not strength it
is<00:01:28.050> it<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.590> form<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.280> biomechanics<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.649> as

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:31.649 
is it is form and biomechanics and as

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.950 
is it is form and biomechanics and as
you<00:01:32.190> reach<00:01:32.399> a<00:01:32.550> certain<00:01:32.729> level<00:01:32.910> of<00:01:33.330> training<00:01:33.600> I

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
you reach a certain level of training I

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.779 
you reach a certain level of training I
think<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.710> get<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.220> point<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.640> diminishing

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
think you get to a point of diminishing

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.580 
think you get to a point of diminishing
return<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.660> terms<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.319> physical

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
return in terms of just the physical

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.800 
return in terms of just the physical
effort<00:01:38.190> that<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.459> put<00:01:38.490> out<00:01:38.819> and<00:01:39.090> then<00:01:39.690> you

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
effort that you put out and then you

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.410 
effort that you put out and then you
have<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.289> get<00:01:40.440> to<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.679> point<00:01:40.860> where<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:42.240> can

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
have to get to the point where you can

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.090 
have to get to the point where you can
improve<00:01:42.750> your<00:01:42.810> form<00:01:43.289> and<00:01:43.649> it's<00:01:43.830> a<00:01:43.890> very

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
improve your form and it's a very

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.830 
improve your form and it's a very
difficult<00:01:44.399> thing<00:01:44.910> to<00:01:44.970> do<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.300> can't

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
difficult thing to do you can't

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.499 
difficult thing to do you can't
visualize<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.130> your<00:01:47.700> own<00:01:47.729> mind<00:01:48.149> and

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
visualize it in your own mind and

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.630 
visualize it in your own mind and
reproduce<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.440> you<00:01:49.560> have<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:49.979> able<00:01:50.099> to<00:01:50.399> see

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
reproduce it you have to be able to see

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.910 
reproduce it you have to be able to see
it<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.450> think<00:01:51.750> you're<00:01:52.170> starting<00:01:52.410> to<00:01:52.679> see

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
it and I think you're starting to see

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.130 
it and I think you're starting to see
this<00:01:53.130> in<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.849> lot<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.030> runners<00:01:54.300> now<00:01:54.599> true<00:01:54.990> in

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
this in a lot of runners now true in

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.279 
this in a lot of runners now true in
1976<00:01:56.270> there<00:01:57.270> weren't<00:01:57.660> people<00:01:57.690> like<00:01:58.110> getting

00:01:58.279 --> 00:01:58.289 
1976 there weren't people like getting

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.180 
1976 there weren't people like getting
an<00:01:58.470> aerial<00:01:58.830> on<00:01:59.550> the<00:02:00.209> scene<00:02:00.770> they<00:02:01.770> were<00:02:01.830> behind

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
an aerial on the scene they were behind

an aerial on the scene they were behind
the<00:02:02.399> scenes<00:02:02.640> now<00:02:02.940> I<00:02:02.970> think<00:02:03.450> they<00:02:03.569> really<00:02:03.840> are

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
the scenes now I think they really are

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:05.900 
the scenes now I think they really are
in<00:02:04.080> the<00:02:04.140> forefront<00:02:04.380> Frank<00:02:05.190> always<00:02:05.459> in

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
in the forefront Frank always in

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.730 
in the forefront Frank always in
scientific<00:02:06.599> pursuits<00:02:07.050> there<00:02:07.259> seems<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.619> be

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
scientific pursuits there seems to be

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.490 
scientific pursuits there seems to be
some<00:02:08.009> model<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.810> Sebastian<00:02:09.810> Cole<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.200> he<00:02:10.319> going

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
some model a Sebastian Cole is he going

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.900 
some model a Sebastian Cole is he going
to<00:02:10.590> become<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.860> model<00:02:11.160> now<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.610> people<00:02:11.730> are

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
to become a model now and people are

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.210 
to become a model now and people are
going<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.150> try<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.390> imitate<00:02:12.959> this<00:02:13.319> guy<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.830> think

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
going to try to imitate this guy I think

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.589 
going to try to imitate this guy I think
what<00:02:14.370> they'll<00:02:14.520> do<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.880> they'll<00:02:15.030> study<00:02:15.330> his

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
what they'll do is they'll study his

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.479 
what they'll do is they'll study his
form<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.290> see<00:02:16.470> just<00:02:16.770> what<00:02:16.830> makes<00:02:17.099> him<00:02:17.310> so

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
form to see just what makes him so

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.370 
form to see just what makes him so
efficient<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.870> know<00:02:18.959> they<00:02:19.080> they<00:02:19.319> do

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
efficient and you know they they do

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.080 
efficient and you know they they do
amazing<00:02:19.800> things<00:02:19.830> now<00:02:20.190> like<00:02:20.220> they<00:02:20.640> can<00:02:20.819> put<00:02:21.000> him

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
amazing things now like they can put him

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.520 
amazing things now like they can put him
on<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.239> treadmill<00:02:21.510> in<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.020> measure<00:02:22.319> the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
on a treadmill in and measure the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.320 
on a treadmill in and measure the
friction<00:02:22.890> coefficient<00:02:23.040> of<00:02:23.610> his<00:02:23.849> foot<00:02:24.090> when<00:02:24.239> he

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
friction coefficient of his foot when he

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.900 
friction coefficient of his foot when he
lands<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:25.290> they<00:02:25.410> can<00:02:25.590> see<00:02:25.770> even<00:02:26.010> what<00:02:26.580> kind<00:02:26.819> of

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
lands and they can see even what kind of

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.540 
lands and they can see even what kind of
shoe<00:02:27.150> he<00:02:27.959> should<00:02:28.170> wear<00:02:28.380> some<00:02:29.010> shoes<00:02:29.220> will<00:02:29.430> give

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
shoe he should wear some shoes will give

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.400 
shoe he should wear some shoes will give
him<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.760> better<00:02:29.910> friction<00:02:30.360> coefficient<00:02:30.959> than

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
him a better friction coefficient than

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.920 
him a better friction coefficient than
others<00:02:31.709> so<00:02:32.220> they<00:02:32.580> can<00:02:32.970> not<00:02:33.120> only<00:02:33.239> see<00:02:33.660> what

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
others so they can not only see what

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.589 
others so they can not only see what
makes<00:02:34.230> him<00:02:34.530> good<00:02:35.160> what<00:02:35.640> allows<00:02:35.940> him<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.239> flow

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
makes him good what allows him to flow

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.830 
makes him good what allows him to flow
along<00:02:36.900> as<00:02:37.110> he<00:02:37.290> runs<00:02:37.500> they<00:02:38.130> can<00:02:38.370> see<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.239> study

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
along as he runs they can see and study

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.569 
along as he runs they can see and study
just<00:02:40.200> exactly<00:02:40.560> what<00:02:40.860> he<00:02:41.010> might<00:02:41.129> have<00:02:41.189> done<00:02:41.340> in

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
just exactly what he might have done in

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.190 
just exactly what he might have done in
the<00:02:41.670> way<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.879> weight<00:02:42.120> work<00:02:42.299> work<00:02:42.540> or<00:02:42.840> training

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
the way of weight work work or training

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.500 
the way of weight work work or training
to<00:02:43.799> improve<00:02:44.189> that<00:02:44.519> form<00:02:44.909> so<00:02:45.060> it's<00:02:45.180> going<00:02:45.299> to<00:02:45.360> be

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
to improve that form so it's going to be

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.010 
to improve that form so it's going to be
a<00:02:45.540> calm

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
a calm

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.160 
a calm
sort<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:46.710> taking<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.400> fine<00:02:47.640> points<00:02:47.990> the<00:02:48.990> good

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
sort of taking the fine points the good

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.130 
sort of taking the fine points the good
points<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.680> the<00:02:50.580> superior<00:02:50.940> athlete<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:51.720> then

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
points of the superior athlete and then

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.620 
points of the superior athlete and then
trying<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.620> generalize<00:02:53.490> enough<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:54.330> that<00:02:54.360> you

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
trying to generalize enough so that you

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.070 
trying to generalize enough so that you
can<00:02:54.810> develop<00:02:54.960> weight<00:02:55.890> programs<00:02:56.600> even<00:02:57.600> chew

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
can develop weight programs even chew

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.100 
can develop weight programs even chew
development<00:02:58.650> programs<00:02:59.130> to<00:03:00.120> get<00:03:00.300> the<00:03:00.480> athlete

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
development programs to get the athlete

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.140 
development programs to get the athlete
to<00:03:01.230> run<00:03:01.380> faster<00:03:01.770> great<00:03:02.400> thing<00:03:02.610> about<00:03:02.700> Gideon

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
to run faster great thing about Gideon

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.020 
to run faster great thing about Gideon
having<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.720> information<00:03:03.840> on<00:03:04.470> me<00:03:04.950> from<00:03:05.190> 1972

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
having the information on me from 1972

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.410 
having the information on me from 1972
is<00:03:06.530> now<00:03:07.530> i<00:03:07.560> think<00:03:07.830> i'm<00:03:08.220> totally<00:03:08.730> rehabilitated

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
is now i think i'm totally rehabilitated

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.180 
is now i think i'm totally rehabilitated
I<00:03:09.540> think<00:03:09.780> my<00:03:09.930> strength<00:03:10.560> is<00:03:10.710> back<00:03:10.950> where<00:03:11.160> it

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
I think my strength is back where it

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
I think my strength is back where it
should<00:03:11.280> be<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.670> would<00:03:11.820> be<00:03:11.940> very<00:03:12.090> interesting

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210 
should be it would be very interesting

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.050 
should be it would be very interesting
to<00:03:12.720> be<00:03:12.840> tested<00:03:13.230> again<00:03:13.500> to<00:03:14.040> compare<00:03:14.490> just<00:03:14.940> to

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
to be tested again to compare just to

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.140 
to be tested again to compare just to
see<00:03:15.300> how<00:03:15.930> close<00:03:16.320> I<00:03:16.620> can<00:03:16.770> be<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.940> same

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
see how close I can be to the same

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.880 
see how close I can be to the same
efficiency<00:03:18.570> that<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:18.960> had<00:03:19.230> before<00:03:19.410> I<00:03:19.650> was

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
efficiency that I had before I was

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.670 
efficiency that I had before I was
injured<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.340> that's<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.910> great<00:03:21.210> tool<00:03:21.510> to<00:03:22.290> have

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
injured and that's a great tool to have

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.260 
injured and that's a great tool to have
because<00:03:22.860> otherwise<00:03:23.400> you<00:03:23.640> never<00:03:23.760> know<00:03:24.030> when

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
because otherwise you never know when

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.430 
because otherwise you never know when
there's<00:03:24.420> always<00:03:24.630> the<00:03:24.750> uncertainty<00:03:25.320> and

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
there's always the uncertainty and

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.170 
there's always the uncertainty and
that's<00:03:25.590> when<00:03:25.830> the<00:03:25.860> psychological<00:03:26.850> element

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
that's when the psychological element

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.300 
that's when the psychological element
comes<00:03:27.330> in<00:03:27.600> it<00:03:28.050> now<00:03:28.290> gives<00:03:28.500> me<00:03:28.740> a<00:03:28.770> means<00:03:29.070> to

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
comes in it now gives me a means to

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.400 
comes in it now gives me a means to
psychologically<00:03:30.150> know<00:03:30.390> that<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:30.780> am<00:03:30.930> recovered

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
psychologically know that I am recovered

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.660 
psychologically know that I am recovered
and<00:03:31.560> back<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.040> point<00:03:32.220> where<00:03:32.460> I<00:03:32.520> left

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
and back to the point where I left

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.120 
form you know getting on the top line
you<00:03:56.910> have<00:03:57.120> a<00:03:57.180> 1972<00:03:58.170> line<00:03:58.380> he<00:03:58.740> looked<00:03:58.950> pretty

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
you have a 1972 line he looked pretty

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.240 
you have a 1972 line he looked pretty
smooth<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.640> me<00:03:59.790> in<00:04:00.600> 1982<00:04:01.500> when<00:04:01.800> he<00:04:01.890> recover

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
smooth to me in 1982 when he recover

from<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.640> injury<00:04:02.940> you<00:04:03.330> really<00:04:03.660> are<00:04:03.780> coaching

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
from the injury you really are coaching

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.620 
from the injury you really are coaching
the<00:04:04.320> same<00:04:04.590> style<00:04:04.950> now<00:04:05.730> when<00:04:06.000> he<00:04:06.120> was<00:04:06.300> injured

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
the same style now when he was injured

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.860 
the same style now when he was injured
the<00:04:07.620> central<00:04:08.459> quality<00:04:08.970> was<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.480> little<00:04:09.750> bit

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
the central quality was a little bit

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.330 
the central quality was a little bit
different<00:04:10.260> if<00:04:10.410> we<00:04:10.590> look<00:04:10.770> at<00:04:10.860> it<00:04:11.010> from<00:04:11.160> a

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
different if we look at it from a

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.940 
different if we look at it from a
multiple<00:04:11.910> choice<00:04:11.940> point<00:04:12.660> of<00:04:12.840> view<00:04:13.050> you

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
multiple choice point of view you

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.220 
multiple choice point of view you
see<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.340> trace<00:04:14.790> is<00:04:15.060> little<00:04:15.480> bit<00:04:15.599> different<00:04:15.989> on

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
see the trace is little bit different on

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.550 
see the trace is little bit different on
the<00:04:16.980> top<00:04:17.250> you<00:04:18.030> seem<00:04:18.359> little<00:04:18.720> bouncing<00:04:19.290> that's

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
the top you seem little bouncing that's

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.289 
the top you seem little bouncing that's
when<00:04:19.769> he<00:04:19.889> just<00:04:20.220> recovered<00:04:20.639> from<00:04:20.730> the<00:04:20.910> injury

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
when he just recovered from the injury

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.930 
when he just recovered from the injury
and<00:04:21.510> he<00:04:21.570> going<00:04:21.870> up<00:04:22.079> and<00:04:22.350> down<00:04:22.639> but<00:04:23.639> when<00:04:23.850> you

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
and he going up and down but when you

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.150 
and he going up and down but when you
look<00:04:24.150> on<00:04:24.330> 1982<00:04:25.080> is<00:04:25.230> almost<00:04:25.620> completely

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
look on 1982 is almost completely

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.090 
look on 1982 is almost completely
straight<00:04:26.930> yeah<00:04:27.930> completely<00:04:28.560> straight<00:04:28.889> that's

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
straight yeah completely straight that's

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.890 
straight yeah completely straight that's
a<00:04:29.250> great<00:04:29.460> runner<00:04:29.669> friend<00:04:30.000> sure<00:04:30.210> you're<00:04:30.690> saying

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
getting keep that head from bouncing up

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.860 
getting keep that head from bouncing up
and<00:04:32.610> down<00:04:32.729> and<00:04:32.850> you'll<00:04:33.150> be<00:04:33.240> a<00:04:33.270> faster<00:04:33.750> runner

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
and down and you'll be a faster runner

yes in fact Rick look on these aqua
bodies<00:04:36.540> as<00:04:36.750> important<00:04:37.620> as<00:04:37.740> the<00:04:37.950> lower<00:04:38.130> body

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
bodies as important as the lower body

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.230 
bodies as important as the lower body
and<00:04:38.669> you<00:04:38.910> don't<00:04:39.180> want<00:04:39.419> to<00:04:39.600> bounce<00:04:39.840> with<00:04:40.169> it<00:04:41.240> if

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
and you don't want to bounce with it if

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.750 
and you don't want to bounce with it if
we're<00:04:42.690> going<00:04:42.870> to<00:04:43.020> use<00:04:43.770> instruments<00:04:44.250> if<00:04:44.610> we're

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
we're going to use instruments if we're

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.219 
we're going to use instruments if we're
going<00:04:44.910> to<00:04:44.970> make<00:04:45.060> measurements<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:45.900> why<00:04:46.080> not

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:46.229 
going to make measurements and why not

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:48.620 
going to make measurements and why not
use<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:46.620> finest<00:04:47.040> instrument<00:04:47.610> right<00:04:47.760> and<00:04:48.389> the

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
use the finest instrument right and the

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.770 
use the finest instrument right and the
other<00:04:48.780> is<00:04:49.169> the<00:04:49.440> psychological<00:04:50.070> feedback

country<00:05:09.090> we<00:05:09.419> have<00:05:09.540> the<00:05:09.690> best<00:05:09.870> technology<00:05:10.410> in

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
country we have the best technology in

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.320 
country we have the best technology in
the<00:05:10.560> world<00:05:10.740> we<00:05:11.040> put<00:05:11.310> a<00:05:11.550> person<00:05:11.970> in<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.150> moon

the world we put a person in the moon

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.690 
the world we put a person in the moon
but<00:05:13.139> we<00:05:13.320> then<00:05:13.530> use<00:05:13.770> this<00:05:13.950> technology<00:05:14.370> to

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
but we then use this technology to

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.270 
but we then use this technology to
people<00:05:15.360> at<00:05:15.479> farm<00:05:15.810> if<00:05:15.990> we<00:05:16.110> would<00:05:16.290> use<00:05:16.500> that<00:05:16.530> he

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 
people at farm if we would use that he

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.040 
people at farm if we would use that he
would<00:05:17.430> be<00:05:17.580> on<00:05:17.669> his<00:05:17.700> own<00:05:18.030> moon<00:05:18.300> which<00:05:18.570> was<00:05:18.600> under

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
would be on his own moon which was under

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.620 
would be on his own moon which was under
winning<00:05:19.860> gold<00:05:20.130> medal<00:05:20.460> this<00:05:21.060> yeah<00:05:21.510> the

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
winning gold medal this yeah the

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:22.820 
winning gold medal this yeah the
interesting<00:05:22.200> things<00:05:22.380> you<00:05:22.470> go<00:05:22.590> to<00:05:22.650> East

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830
