00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.540
 I'm Daniel for credits and we started 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.180
 with a new video well this video 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.270
 I had already been asked by several people 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.780
 on the channel in the video where they 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.470
 I explain how to download songs 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:31.620
 bought from itunes well then the video 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:36.420
 will be how to play music files 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:39.750
 audio to your iphone ipod ipad and all your 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.000
 devices to joe is so we're going to 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.160
 start with this video the only thing that 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.260
 we will need is itunes 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.390
 the itunes program on the official 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.370
 support so that they have the most 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.440
 current good does not matter the version but 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.140
 they urge me to then the only thing that 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.540
 obviously and obviously the song or the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.570
 audio file to be able to pass it to 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:04.500
 our device well once 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.810
 having the iTunes open we have to 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.180
 connect our iphone strike by 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.060
 our ipad in this case already connect my 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.659
 iphone what I think of how many gigas 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.210
 is the serial number dropped is I have 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.400
 etcetera and also the backups well 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.650
 here in this option where we have all 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.200
 the information we see that we have a menu 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.509
 at the left-side 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.079
 well here we will go to the section where 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:34.320
 says music and x2 will appear all the 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.880
 music that our iphone has 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.420
 ipod our devices with ios 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.369
 both purchased and the voice notes the 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.590
 audio notes that we record in 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.729
 the iphone will also appear in the 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.340
 good music section to spend music 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.439
 from the iTunes library is good is very 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.240
 simple in fact the only thing we have 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.240
 what to do is give where it says add to 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:05.719
 and will show us the albos we have 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.060
 in the iTunes library in our 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:11.330
 bookstore the only thing that we will have to 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:15.080
 do to pass the music to our 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:18.769
 device would drag the album in 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.900
 the case of some or the song to the menu 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.090
 that appears on the right side and 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.260
 drop it on the top 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:31.280
 appear a status bar where 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.810
 they would be passing the songs archives 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:37.390
 audio to our iphone device 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.030
 on the iphone we will see the icon of 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.160
 synchronization on the top with 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.470
 two arrows following each other going to 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.510
 study and you will see it here 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.760
 We will give the ok when we already 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.370
 we have selected the songs that 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.700
 we want to move to our device with 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.280
 ios we already give in ok and good then here 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.260
 well they go by pretty fast so 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.680
 they will not notice it if they pass 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.920
 enough will appear a circle will appear 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.180
 dotted in this part showing the 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.890
 state of the song that we are going through 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.660
 okay now if we do not have any song 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.880
 added to the iTunes library what 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.210
 only thing we have to do would be 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.040
 drag the music to this section 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.660
 that would be something like that look here we have 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.010
 our audio file is a 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.480
 file 4a which are the archives 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.580
 used and nothing else we will drag it 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.970
 to the program and we itunes 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.860
 we will jump creating a link and so 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.790
 synchronize already what is the file 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.790
 audio to our device with year west 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.050
 this is very simple but good 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.790
 I wanted to do it because they asked me 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.070
 enough people in the video of 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.940
 download music from itunes well 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:53.390
 here I have them for themselves 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.190
 in case you have that big doubt in the end 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.050
