overall<00:03:09.120> giving<00:03:09.450> this<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.720> a<00:03:09.750> seven<00:03:10.050> point<00:03:10.140> two

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
overall giving this to a seven point two

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.030 
overall giving this to a seven point two
five<00:03:10.470> out<00:03:10.680> of<00:03:10.800> ten<00:03:11.989> and<00:03:12.989> then<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.320> last<00:03:13.620> disc

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
five out of ten and then the last disc

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.500 
five out of ten and then the last disc
which<00:03:14.430> probably<00:03:14.850> should<00:03:15.150> have<00:03:15.209> done<00:03:15.360> better

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
which probably should have done better

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.220 
which probably should have done better
than<00:03:15.720> saying<00:03:15.930> this<00:03:16.110> but<00:03:16.290> whatever<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:18.230> champ

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230

shippy<00:03:19.500> started<00:03:20.130> with<00:03:20.250> I<00:03:20.549> off<00:03:21.000> well<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.480> only

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
shippy started with I off well the only

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.140 
shippy started with I off well the only
good<00:03:21.780> match<00:03:21.930> is<00:03:22.110> really<00:03:22.320> on<00:03:22.410> this<00:03:22.560> disc<00:03:22.769> is

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
good match is really on this disc is

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.580 
good match is really on this disc is
probably<00:03:24.150> why<00:03:24.390> is<00:03:24.720> there's<00:03:24.989> only<00:03:25.170> one<00:03:25.440> that

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
probably why is there's only one that

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.949 
probably why is there's only one that
really<00:03:25.709> made<00:03:25.950> four<00:03:26.130> stars<00:03:26.540> which<00:03:27.540> was<00:03:27.780> Steve

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
had a perfect into the DVD it wasn't it

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.699 
had a perfect into the DVD it wasn't it
was<00:03:55.829> all<00:03:55.980> about<00:03:56.780> NWS<00:03:57.780> first<00:03:57.989> birthday<00:03:58.500> and

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
was all about NWS first birthday and

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.210 
was all about NWS first birthday and
sting<00:03:59.370> returns<00:03:59.610> and<00:04:00.209> it's<00:04:00.450> the<00:04:00.720> debut<00:04:01.320> of<00:04:01.350> the

crow<00:04:02.820> sting<00:04:03.299> which<00:04:04.049> that<00:04:04.650> was<00:04:04.799> great<00:04:05.190> for<00:04:05.400> the

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
crow sting which that was great for the

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.400 
crow sting which that was great for the
DVD<00:04:05.850> I<00:04:06.030> felt<00:04:06.450> that<00:04:06.510> really<00:04:06.840> captured<00:04:07.170> off<00:04:07.260> and

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
DVD I felt that really captured off and
