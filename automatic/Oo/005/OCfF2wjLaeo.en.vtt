app on a Mac it's called webcam settings

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.949 
app on a Mac it's called webcam settings
I<00:03:32.940> believe<00:03:33.209> it's<00:03:33.359> just<00:03:33.480> like<00:03:33.599> in<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.840> App

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
I believe it's just like in the App

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.220 
I believe it's just like in the App
Store<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.500> if<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.400> get<00:03:35.669> webcam<00:03:36.269> settings<00:03:36.630> you

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
Store and if you get webcam settings you

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.199 
Store and if you get webcam settings you
can<00:03:37.380> actually<00:03:37.590> sort<00:03:37.919> of<00:03:38.040> like<00:03:38.220> pimp<00:03:38.579> your

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
not just limited to exactly having it

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.610 
not just limited to exactly having it
you<00:04:36.850> know<00:04:36.970> hooked<00:04:37.510> on<00:04:37.690> onto<00:04:38.020> your<00:04:38.140> webcam

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
I use ScreenFlow to edit nothing else

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.110 
I use ScreenFlow to edit nothing else
was<00:04:44.200> really<00:04:44.440> needed<00:04:44.800> to<00:04:45.370> get<00:04:45.520> it<00:04:45.610> done<00:04:45.640> and

was really needed to get it done and
what<00:04:46.240> I<00:04:46.270> like<00:04:46.510> about<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:46.810> speed<00:04:47.050> is<00:04:47.230> that<00:04:47.380> you

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
what I like about the speed is that you

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.380 
what I like about the speed is that you
know<00:04:48.100> sometimes<00:04:48.340> you<00:04:48.580> got<00:04:48.670> to<00:04:48.700> script<00:04:49.000> out<00:04:49.150> and

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:49.390 
know sometimes you got to script out and

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:50.940 
know sometimes you got to script out and
do<00:04:49.450> videos<00:04:49.570> but<00:04:49.900> I<00:04:50.110> love<00:04:50.530> to<00:04:50.650> have<00:04:50.800> those

away<00:06:31.240> from<00:06:31.510> the<00:06:31.630> video<00:06:31.780> and<00:06:31.960> that's<00:06:32.110> the<00:06:32.230> key

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
away from the video and that's the key

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:33.300 
away from the video and that's the key
thing<00:06:32.410> to<00:06:32.560> think<00:06:32.650> about<00:06:32.800> when<00:06:32.950> you're<00:06:33.100> doing<00:06:33.160> a

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:33.310 
thing to think about when you're doing a

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:35.970 
thing to think about when you're doing a
video<00:06:33.460> is<00:06:34.170> you<00:06:35.170> know<00:06:35.260> if<00:06:35.320> you're<00:06:35.440> using<00:06:35.560> audio

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:35.980 
video is you know if you're using audio

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.470 
video is you know if you're using audio
or<00:06:36.160> video<00:06:36.280> whatever<00:06:36.640> it<00:06:36.730> might<00:06:36.790> be<00:06:36.850> is<00:06:37.150> like<00:06:37.330> oh

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:37.480 
or video whatever it might be is like oh

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.240 
or video whatever it might be is like oh
lack<00:06:37.810> of<00:06:37.990> microphone<00:06:38.500> that's<00:06:38.890> gonna<00:06:39.010> take

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:39.250 
lack of microphone that's gonna take

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.620 
lack of microphone that's gonna take
away<00:06:39.460> from<00:06:39.490> the<00:06:39.730> video<00:06:40.000> or<00:06:40.240> something<00:06:40.540> like

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:40.630 
away from the video or something like

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.630 
away from the video or something like
that<00:06:40.810> you<00:06:41.080> know<00:06:41.200> lack<00:06:41.410> of<00:06:41.680> certain<00:06:42.490> things

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:42.640 
that you know lack of certain things

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.330 
that you know lack of certain things
will<00:06:42.790> take<00:06:42.910> away<00:06:43.210> but<00:06:43.780> not<00:06:43.960> the<00:06:44.170> 1%<00:06:45.070> difference

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340 
will take away but not the 1% difference
