 the first stanza there was a 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.289
 tiny tune because if not no 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:26.999

 the letter the tuning the projection the 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:38.590
 character of this is this program and 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.409
 this is important that everyone 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:44.319
 know it's about looking at an icon of the 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:47.050
 music and understand what it is that makes 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:49.449
 it works internally and then put it 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:52.569
 on a stage copying his gestures 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:55.180
 copying his wardrobe copying his way 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:58.689
 to look in such a way that I see you and 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:01.300
 it creates to be seeing not only the presence 

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:02.889
 physical but what is artist left behind 

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.560
