drops if flash is trying to bring in a
few<00:01:04.949> vultures<00:01:05.369> lay<00:01:05.640> some<00:01:05.820> mines<00:01:06.060> trying<00:01:06.750> to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
few vultures lay some mines trying to

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.350 
few vultures lay some mines trying to
get<00:01:06.930> lucky<00:01:07.080> with<00:01:07.290> those<00:01:07.439> mines<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.610> at<00:01:09.240> this

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
get lucky with those mines and at this

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.880 
get lucky with those mines and at this
point<00:01:09.570> in<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.780> game<00:01:09.810> mines<00:01:10.290> are<00:01:10.530> actually<00:01:10.860> a

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
point in the game mines are actually a

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.280 
point in the game mines are actually a
big<00:01:11.130> factor<00:01:11.400> because<00:01:11.939> once<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.780> get<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.140> many

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
big factor because once you get so many

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.230 
big factor because once you get so many
bases<00:01:13.740> going<00:01:14.070> you<00:01:14.640> have<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.909> split<00:01:15.119> your

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
bases going you have to split your

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.510 
bases going you have to split your
attention<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:15.840> much<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.530> might<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.130> put

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
attention so much and you might just put

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.609 
attention so much and you might just put
your<00:01:17.670> forces<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.630> move<00:01:18.869> instead<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.439> tech

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
your forces on move instead of a tech

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.580 
your forces on move instead of a tech
move<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.000> moment<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:22.229> would<00:01:22.439> be

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
move just for a moment and that would be

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.190 
move just for a moment and that would be
enough<00:01:22.830> to<00:01:22.860> take<00:01:23.159> out<00:01:23.390> about<00:01:24.390> six<00:01:24.750> tanks<00:01:24.960> I

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
enough to take out about six tanks I

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.780 
enough to take out about six tanks I
think<00:01:25.470> from<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.580> flash<00:01:26.970> damage<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.600> mine

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
think from the flash damage of the mine

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.390 
think from the flash damage of the mine
flash<00:01:29.790> once<00:01:30.240> again<00:01:30.570> trying<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.619> take<00:01:31.799> bits<00:01:32.220> and

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
flash once again trying to take bits and

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.920 
flash once again trying to take bits and
pieces<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.939> map<00:01:33.150> but<00:01:33.299> he's<00:01:33.450> lost<00:01:33.689> the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
pieces of the map but he's lost the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.109 
pieces of the map but he's lost the
middle<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.259> think<00:01:34.530> he's<00:01:35.430> getting<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.850> some

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
middle I think he's getting in some

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.670 
middle I think he's getting in some
reinforcement<00:01:36.840> troops<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.200> take<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.500> middle

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
reinforcement troops to take the middle

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.480 
reinforcement troops to take the middle
but<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.220> think<00:01:38.729> Watson<00:01:38.880> has<00:01:39.390> more<00:01:39.840> troops<00:01:40.200> oh

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
but I think Watson has more troops oh

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.999 
but I think Watson has more troops oh
wow<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.000> going<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.210> be<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> huge<00:01:42.840> force<00:01:43.710> a

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
wow this is going to be a huge force a

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.310 
wow this is going to be a huge force a
huge<00:01:44.579> drop<00:01:44.970> from<00:01:45.360> puasa<00:01:45.630> i'm<00:01:45.869> not<00:01:46.020> sure<00:01:46.170> where

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.330 
he's going to try to drop these troops
but<00:01:48.540> wherever<00:01:48.840> he<00:01:49.049> drops<00:01:49.350> there's<00:01:50.130> going<00:01:50.280> to

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
but wherever he drops there's going to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.850 
but wherever he drops there's going to
be<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.460> lot<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.700> explosions<00:01:51.320> okay<00:01:52.320> for<00:01:52.500> us<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:52.770> is

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
be a lot of explosions okay for us it is

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.590 
be a lot of explosions okay for us it is
coming<00:01:53.159> over<00:01:53.250> here<00:01:53.490> he<00:01:53.909> definitely<00:01:54.119> has<00:01:54.420> more

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
coming over here he definitely has more

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.880 
coming over here he definitely has more
drop<00:01:54.810> ships<00:01:55.079> well<00:01:55.380> he<00:01:55.500> might<00:01:55.619> have<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.860> same

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
drop ships well he might have the same

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.109 
drop ships well he might have the same
amount<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.310> dropships<00:01:56.670> but<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:56.820> think<00:01:57.000> he<00:01:57.060> has

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
amount of dropships but I think he has

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.060 
amount of dropships but I think he has
more<00:01:57.299> troops<00:01:57.570> definitely<00:01:58.170> than<00:01:58.680> flash<00:01:58.920> at

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
more troops definitely than flash at

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.260 
more troops definitely than flash at
this<00:01:59.189> point<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:01.829> think<00:02:02.729> he's<00:02:02.880> going<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.149> try

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
this point and I think he's going to try

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.420 
this point and I think he's going to try
to<00:02:03.329> intercept<00:02:03.630> this<00:02:04.170> he<00:02:04.439> definitely<00:02:04.710> sees<00:02:05.070> the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
to intercept this he definitely sees the

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.490 
to intercept this he definitely sees the
drop<00:02:06.390> ships<00:02:06.630> coming<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:06.990> here<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.350> I<00:02:07.380> think

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
drop ships coming in here so I think

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.169 
drop ships coming in here so I think
he's<00:02:07.649> going<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.829> try<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.069> intercept<00:02:08.759> this

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
he's going to try and intercept this

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.720 
he's going to try and intercept this
drop<00:02:09.509> maybe<00:02:10.379> he's<00:02:10.920> still<00:02:11.220> floating<00:02:11.580> around

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
drop maybe he's still floating around

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.910 
drop maybe he's still floating around
here

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
here

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.130 
here
and<00:02:13.640> I<00:02:13.790> think<00:02:14.030> he<00:02:14.120> should<00:02:14.420> be<00:02:14.569> very<00:02:14.900> very

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
and I think he should be very very

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.530 
and I think he should be very very
careful<00:02:15.470> with<00:02:15.860> these<00:02:16.010> Goliath<00:02:16.459> here<00:02:17.120> he's

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
careful with these Goliath here he's

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.380 
careful with these Goliath here he's
dropping<00:02:18.050> troops<00:02:18.380> everywhere<00:02:18.620> but<00:02:19.190> oh<00:02:19.430> right

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
dropping troops everywhere but oh right

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.920 
dropping troops everywhere but oh right
on<00:02:20.510> top<00:02:20.750> of<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:21.380> siege<00:02:21.620> tanks<00:02:22.040> of<00:02:22.250> flash<00:02:22.550> is<00:02:22.930> I

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
on top of the siege tanks of flash is I

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.100 
on top of the siege tanks of flash is I
think<00:02:24.530> oh<00:02:25.010> man<00:02:25.730> but<00:02:26.120> flash<00:02:26.510> doing<00:02:26.840> a<00:02:26.930> good<00:02:27.050> job

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
think oh man but flash doing a good job

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.850 
think oh man but flash doing a good job
finding<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:27.770> off<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.280> think<00:02:28.880> up<00:02:29.660> home<00:02:30.560> was<00:02:30.709> set

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
finding that off I think up home was set

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.100 
finding that off I think up home was set
up<00:02:31.010> magic<00:02:31.310> again<00:02:31.640> looks<00:02:32.120> like<00:02:32.239> Hassan<00:02:32.630> was<00:02:33.050> a

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
up magic again looks like Hassan was a

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.510 
up magic again looks like Hassan was a
little<00:02:33.380> bit<00:02:33.500> too<00:02:33.620> cavalier<00:02:33.980> going<00:02:34.220> in<00:02:34.340> there

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
little bit too cavalier going in there

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.470 
little bit too cavalier going in there
with<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:36.050> many<00:02:36.319> Goliath<00:02:36.890> and<00:02:37.069> now<00:02:37.880> he's<00:02:38.060> forced

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
with so many Goliath and now he's forced

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.660 
with so many Goliath and now he's forced
to<00:02:38.540> float<00:02:38.750> his<00:02:38.900> command<00:02:39.170> center<00:02:39.410> away<00:02:39.709> so

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
to float his command center away so

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.370 
to float his command center away so
flash<00:02:41.269> i<00:02:41.480> think<00:02:41.690> is<00:02:41.780> taking<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.170> advantage

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
flash i think is taking the advantage

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.070 
flash i think is taking the advantage
again<00:02:42.860> just<00:02:43.640> knowing<00:02:44.239> exactly<00:02:44.360> what<00:02:44.840> to<00:02:44.870> do

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
again just knowing exactly what to do

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.759 
again just knowing exactly what to do
and<00:02:45.160> harassed<00:02:46.160> that<00:02:46.459> base<00:02:46.910> he's<00:02:47.810> positioned

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
and harassed that base he's positioned

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.259 
and harassed that base he's positioned
his<00:02:48.890> troops<00:02:49.130> right<00:02:49.340> at<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.550> choke<00:02:49.760> there<00:02:49.970> so

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
his troops right at the choke there so

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.539 
his troops right at the choke there so
there's<00:02:50.540> not<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.989> lot<00:02:51.440> of<00:02:51.470> owning<00:02:51.920> scanned<00:02:52.310> i

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
there's not a lot of owning scanned i

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.059 
there's not a lot of owning scanned i
scanned<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.569> drop<00:02:54.170> ships<00:02:54.440> coming<00:02:54.739> towards

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
scanned the drop ships coming towards

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.400 
scanned the drop ships coming towards
his<00:02:55.190> troop<00:02:55.430> so<00:02:55.580> he<00:02:55.640> knows<00:02:55.850> he<00:02:56.390> knows<00:02:56.420> that

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
his troop so he knows he knows that

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.809 
his troop so he knows he knows that
those<00:02:57.650> drop<00:02:58.430> ships<00:02:58.459> are<00:02:58.819> coming<00:03:00.459> you<00:03:01.459> scanned

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
those drop ships are coming you scanned

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.840 
those drop ships are coming you scanned
it<00:03:02.000> again<00:03:02.269> so<00:03:02.930> he<00:03:03.590> sees<00:03:03.830> the<00:03:04.040> troop<00:03:04.340> down<00:03:04.519> here

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
it again so he sees the troop down here

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.449 
it again so he sees the troop down here
so<00:03:05.510> oh<00:03:05.870> wow<00:03:06.319> Boston's<00:03:07.069> not<00:03:07.190> going<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.370> be<00:03:07.430> able

here<00:03:43.040> at<00:03:43.190> another<00:03:43.459> trick<00:03:43.790> point<00:03:44.090> where<00:03:44.780> he<00:03:44.870> can

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
here at another trick point where he can

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.630 
here at another trick point where he can
take<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.290> high<00:03:45.410> ground<00:03:45.440> and<00:03:45.859> just<00:03:46.010> shell<00:03:46.370> down

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
take the high ground and just shell down

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.120 
take the high ground and just shell down
if<00:03:46.940> Watson<00:03:47.600> tried<00:03:47.959> to<00:03:48.200> move<00:03:48.470> up<00:03:48.650> and<00:03:48.859> take<00:03:49.010> them

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
if Watson tried to move up and take them

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.970 
if Watson tried to move up and take them
out<00:03:49.280> oh<00:03:51.130> boy<00:03:52.130> yep<00:03:53.060> Watson<00:03:54.019> is<00:03:54.170> losing<00:03:54.739> his

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
out oh boy yep Watson is losing his

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.740 
out oh boy yep Watson is losing his
economic<00:03:55.489> advantage<00:03:55.880> here<00:03:56.090> well<00:03:56.510> he<00:03:56.569> didn't

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
economic advantage here well he didn't

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.120 
economic advantage here well he didn't
really<00:03:56.840> have<00:03:57.109> an<00:03:57.260> economic<00:03:57.380> advantage<00:03:58.040> to

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:58.130 
really have an economic advantage to

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:59.770 
really have an economic advantage to
begin<00:03:58.370> with<00:03:58.549> because<00:03:58.670> flash<00:03:58.970> took<00:03:59.239> more<00:03:59.420> bases

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
begin with because flash took more bases

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.050 
begin with because flash took more bases
and<00:04:00.079> here<00:04:00.350> comes<00:04:00.620> another<00:04:00.769> drop<00:04:01.280> here<00:04:01.549> from

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
and here comes another drop here from

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.849 
and here comes another drop here from
wasin<00:04:02.420> I<00:04:02.480> think<00:04:02.690> this<00:04:02.840> one<00:04:03.079> is<00:04:03.260> going<00:04:03.709> to<00:04:03.799> be

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
wasin I think this one is going to be

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.050 
wasin I think this one is going to be
successful<00:04:04.190> he's<00:04:04.489> going<00:04:04.609> to<00:04:04.670> be<00:04:04.730> able<00:04:04.819> to<00:04:04.940> take

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
successful he's going to be able to take

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.370 
successful he's going to be able to take
out<00:04:05.180> all<00:04:05.299> these<00:04:05.390> troops<00:04:05.690> and<00:04:07.209> flash<00:04:08.209> in<00:04:08.660> the

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
out all these troops and flash in the

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.319 
out all these troops and flash in the
meantime<00:04:09.609> trying<00:04:10.609> to<00:04:10.670> move<00:04:10.790> up<00:04:10.910> with<00:04:11.090> more

meantime trying to move up with more

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:12.699 
meantime trying to move up with more
troops<00:04:11.600> and<00:04:12.019> there's<00:04:12.260> a<00:04:12.350> command<00:04:12.620> center

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
troops and there's a command center

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.210 
troops and there's a command center
around<00:04:13.160> here<00:04:13.480> i<00:04:14.680> commences<00:04:15.680> go<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:15.980> try<00:04:16.160> to

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
around here i commences go to try to

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.550 
around here i commences go to try to
float<00:04:16.459> down<00:04:16.669> there<00:04:16.940> I<00:04:16.970> believe<00:04:17.120> down<00:04:17.959> there<00:04:18.229> to

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
float down there I believe down there to

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.270 
float down there I believe down there to
the<00:04:19.269> seven<00:04:20.269> o'clock<00:04:20.479> base<00:04:20.750> once<00:04:21.709> these<00:04:21.950> troops

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
the seven o'clock base once these troops

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.640 
the seven o'clock base once these troops
are<00:04:22.430> out<00:04:22.460> of<00:04:22.610> the<00:04:22.669> way<00:04:22.700> but<00:04:22.849> oh<00:04:23.330> man<00:04:24.140> flash<00:04:24.500> is

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
are out of the way but oh man flash is

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.930 
are out of the way but oh man flash is
going<00:04:24.800> to<00:04:24.860> bring<00:04:25.010> in<00:04:25.159> some<00:04:25.340> reinforcements

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
going to bring in some reinforcements

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:26.480 
going to bring in some reinforcements
army<00:04:26.180> I

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
army I

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.790 
army I
think<00:04:27.590> who<00:04:28.819> so<00:04:29.819> many<00:04:30.090> Goliath<00:04:30.630> this<00:04:31.440> Goliath

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
think who so many Goliath this Goliath

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.770 
think who so many Goliath this Goliath
could<00:04:32.099> prove<00:04:32.370> a<00:04:32.610> very<00:04:32.970> important<00:04:33.389> factor<00:04:33.509> in

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
could prove a very important factor in

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.650 
could prove a very important factor in
this<00:04:33.900> game<00:04:33.990> whoever<00:04:34.440> can<00:04:34.830> snipe<00:04:35.099> the<00:04:35.310> others

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
this game whoever can snipe the others

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.779 
this game whoever can snipe the others
about<00:04:36.660> say<00:04:36.990> shuttles<00:04:37.319> but<00:04:37.470> drop<00:04:37.710> ships<00:04:38.009> could

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
about say shuttles but drop ships could

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.499 
about say shuttles but drop ships could
definitely<00:04:39.120> take<00:04:39.389> this<00:04:40.910> wasson<00:04:41.910> again<00:04:42.240> trying

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
definitely take this wasson again trying

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:46.249 
definitely take this wasson again trying
to<00:04:42.569> take<00:04:42.720> his<00:04:42.840> fifth<00:04:43.050> base<00:04:43.289> and<00:04:45.259> being

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:46.259 
to take his fifth base and being

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.260 
to take his fifth base and being
actually<00:04:46.620> hit<00:04:46.949> by<00:04:47.099> a<00:04:47.130> mine<00:04:47.460> they're<00:04:47.759> forced<00:04:48.210> to

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
actually hit by a mine they're forced to

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.180 
actually hit by a mine they're forced to
waste<00:04:48.660> to<00:04:48.810> scan<00:04:49.110> just<00:04:49.349> for<00:04:49.590> that<00:04:49.620> one<00:04:49.740> mine

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
waste to scan just for that one mine

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.400 
waste to scan just for that one mine
there<00:04:50.729> weren't<00:04:50.880> any<00:04:51.090> other<00:04:51.750> mines<00:04:52.020> in<00:04:52.229> there

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
there weren't any other mines in there

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.890 
there weren't any other mines in there
so<00:04:52.699> it<00:04:53.699> looks<00:04:53.880> like<00:04:53.940> flash<00:04:54.210> is<00:04:54.449> going<00:04:54.569> to<00:04:54.720> try

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
so it looks like flash is going to try

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.900 
so it looks like flash is going to try
to<00:04:54.930> take<00:04:55.169> this<00:04:55.770> base<00:04:56.009> down<00:04:56.250> here<00:04:56.520> at<00:04:56.669> the<00:04:56.699> eight

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
to take this base down here at the eight

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.879 
to take this base down here at the eight
o'clock<00:04:57.270> he's<00:04:57.780> moving<00:04:58.289> in<00:04:58.380> with<00:04:58.440> another

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
o'clock he's moving in with another

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.909 
o'clock he's moving in with another
force<00:04:59.370> but<00:04:59.639> Goliath<00:05:00.120> in<00:05:00.330> here<00:05:00.569> did<00:05:01.020> those

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
force but Goliath in here did those

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.430 
force but Goliath in here did those
dropships<00:05:02.340> it's<00:05:02.909> not<00:05:03.509> enough<00:05:03.750> glass<00:05:04.050> though

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
dropships it's not enough glass though

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.189 
dropships it's not enough glass though
and<00:05:05.250> oh<00:05:05.460> man<00:05:05.849> these<00:05:06.120> these<00:05:06.389> tanks<00:05:06.840> are<00:05:06.960> going

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
and oh man these these tanks are going

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.140 
and oh man these these tanks are going
to<00:05:07.319> decimate<00:05:07.650> this<00:05:08.220> command<00:05:08.580> center<00:05:08.849> once

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
to decimate this command center once

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.420 
to decimate this command center once
again<00:05:09.479> wason<00:05:10.259> is<00:05:10.349> going<00:05:10.530> to<00:05:10.620> be<00:05:10.710> forced<00:05:10.949> to<00:05:11.099> get

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
again wason is going to be forced to get

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.770 
again wason is going to be forced to get
rid<00:05:11.580> of<00:05:11.610> this<00:05:11.729> command<00:05:11.940> sir<00:05:12.120> 2<00:05:12.210> b's<00:05:12.360> dropping

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
rid of this command sir 2 b's dropping

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.240 
rid of this command sir 2 b's dropping
all<00:05:12.930> over<00:05:13.229> the<00:05:13.319> siege<00:05:13.590> tanks<00:05:13.919> so<00:05:14.009> he<00:05:14.099> actually

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
all over the siege tanks so he actually

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.909 
all over the siege tanks so he actually
does<00:05:14.610> defend<00:05:15.060> this<00:05:15.270> so<00:05:16.050> Watson<00:05:16.409> has<00:05:16.590> defended

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
does defend this so Watson has defended

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.710 
does defend this so Watson has defended
this<00:05:17.099> base<00:05:17.340> he's<00:05:17.580> still<00:05:17.759> economically<00:05:18.270> behind

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
this base he's still economically behind

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.439 
this base he's still economically behind
but<00:05:18.930> at<00:05:18.990> least<00:05:19.080> he's<00:05:19.319> taken<00:05:19.650> this<00:05:19.770> base<00:05:20.009> back

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
but at least he's taken this base back

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:24.980 
but at least he's taken this base back
he's<00:05:21.449> had<00:05:21.780> taken<00:05:22.229> his<00:05:22.409> game<00:05:22.650> back<00:05:22.919> here<00:05:23.990> both

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
he's had taken his game back here both

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.480 
he's had taken his game back here both
are<00:05:25.199> very<00:05:25.500> very<00:05:25.650> tight<00:05:25.889> at<00:05:26.009> this<00:05:26.099> point<00:05:26.370> but

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
are very very tight at this point but

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.640 
are very very tight at this point but
flash<00:05:26.759> I<00:05:26.970> do<00:05:27.030> think<00:05:27.389> is<00:05:27.569> economically<00:05:28.380> ahead

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:28.650 
flash I do think is economically ahead

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.659 
flash I do think is economically ahead
definitely<00:05:29.069> economically<00:05:29.880> ahead<00:05:31.250> hoo<00:05:32.250> boy

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
definitely economically ahead hoo boy

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.300 
definitely economically ahead hoo boy
let's<00:05:33.360> look<00:05:33.479> at<00:05:33.630> down<00:05:33.930> here<00:05:34.229> at<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:34.409> stats

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
let's look at down here at the stats

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:36.770 
let's look at down here at the stats
here<00:05:35.639> so<00:05:35.849> I<00:05:35.880> can<00:05:35.940> figure<00:05:36.240> out<00:05:36.330> who<00:05:36.570> has<00:05:36.750> the

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
here so I can figure out who has the

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.879 
here so I can figure out who has the
most<00:05:37.080> troops<00:05:37.560> it<00:05:38.550> looks<00:05:38.699> like<00:05:38.759> flash<00:05:39.090> is<00:05:39.449> at

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
most troops it looks like flash is at

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.120 
most troops it looks like flash is at
150<00:05:40.889> I<00:05:41.190> think<00:05:41.430> 157<00:05:42.270> population<00:05:42.930> and<00:05:43.199> 136<00:05:43.889> for

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
150 I think 157 population and 136 for

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:46.580 
150 I think 157 population and 136 for
wasson<00:05:44.639> so<00:05:44.909> yeah<00:05:45.570> flash<00:05:45.840> is<00:05:46.020> definitely<00:05:46.380> ahead

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
wasson so yeah flash is definitely ahead

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.870 
wasson so yeah flash is definitely ahead
in<00:05:46.710> this<00:05:46.860> Oh<00:05:49.310> both<00:05:50.310> have<00:05:50.520> about<00:05:50.610> the<00:05:50.849> same

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
in this Oh both have about the same

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.020 
in this Oh both have about the same
excess<00:05:51.659> of<00:05:51.750> minerals<00:05:52.169> here<00:05:52.500> but<00:05:53.159> the<00:05:53.370> not<00:05:53.880> an

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
excess of minerals here but the not an

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.879 
excess of minerals here but the not an
excess<00:05:54.389> of<00:05:54.509> gas<00:05:54.719> for<00:05:54.960> either<00:05:55.110> player<00:05:55.380> here

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
excess of gas for either player here

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:58.399 
excess of gas for either player here
they<00:05:56.460> definitely<00:05:56.759> need<00:05:57.000> their<00:05:57.150> gas<00:05:57.409> not

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409 
they definitely need their gas not

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:59.749 
they definitely need their gas not
really<00:05:58.650> as<00:05:58.740> much<00:05:58.860> as<00:05:59.009> they<00:05:59.130> need<00:05:59.159> the<00:05:59.400> minerals

00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 
really as much as they need the minerals

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.520 
really as much as they need the minerals
because<00:06:00.360> they're<00:06:00.659> not<00:06:00.810> really<00:06:00.990> devoting

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
because they're not really devoting

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.830 
because they're not really devoting
themselves<00:06:01.650> to<00:06:02.009> a<00:06:02.520> whole<00:06:03.060> lot<00:06:03.270> of<00:06:03.300> vultures<00:06:03.690> at

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
themselves to a whole lot of vultures at

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.469 
themselves to a whole lot of vultures at
this<00:06:03.990> point<00:06:04.789> mineral<00:06:05.789> is<00:06:05.849> not<00:06:06.030> needed<00:06:06.240> too

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
this point mineral is not needed too

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:14.570 
this point mineral is not needed too
much<00:06:06.509> there<00:06:07.020> and<00:06:08.270> let's<00:06:09.270> see<00:06:11.659> okay<00:06:13.550> not<00:06:14.550> really

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:14.580 
much there and let's see okay not really

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.100 
much there and let's see okay not really
sure<00:06:15.000> what<00:06:15.120> to<00:06:15.210> say<00:06:15.240> from<00:06:15.569> this<00:06:15.659> point<00:06:15.900> on

sure what to say from this point on

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.830 
sure what to say from this point on
because<00:06:16.349> both<00:06:16.560> are<00:06:16.800> very<00:06:17.069> very<00:06:17.400> tied<00:06:17.729> now<00:06:18.539> that

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
because both are very very tied now that

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.320 
because both are very very tied now that
each<00:06:19.289> has<00:06:19.620> the<00:06:20.009> same<00:06:20.250> number<00:06:20.460> of<00:06:20.610> bases<00:06:21.060> up<00:06:21.180> and

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:21.330 
each has the same number of bases up and

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.180 
each has the same number of bases up and
running<00:06:21.569> and<00:06:21.690> both<00:06:22.500> are<00:06:22.530> about<00:06:22.889> the<00:06:23.009> same
