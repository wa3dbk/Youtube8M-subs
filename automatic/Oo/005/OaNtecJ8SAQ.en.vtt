00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.680
 Gopro has a great place to attach an external microphone! 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.140
 As we connect with microUSB, 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.940
 Audio → micro USB connector is required! 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.780
 Unexpectedly expensive! Anger 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.880
 There are cheap items, but I chose the safe ones 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.360
 audio-technica stereo microphone AT9901 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.840
 It enters such a way ♪ 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.400
 ※ However there is one problem! 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.320
 I can not connect with the case inserted! 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.040
 Then I will open a hole forcibly 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.180
 Because it's a lot of trouble, I will also be able to retrieve memory 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.600
 I sell cases for audio, but 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.320
 I do not recommend it because battery replacement is troublesome 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.520
 It was possible ♪ 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.760
 Memory can be taken out immediately ♪ 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.380
 I feel that the sound is muddy in the case ,, 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.000
 The sound that the metal for fall prevention has hit has entered ,, 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.740
 Wear! 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.400
 Just inserting it, I did not need any troublesome settings! :) 

00:02:26.474 --> 00:02:29.974
 Sound became clear ♪ 

00:02:29.974 --> 00:02:32.054
 It is natural ♪ 

00:02:32.054 --> 00:02:35.174
 Because the microphone is highly directional, 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.020
 The sound seems to be able to be recorded by the way of putting! 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.840
 If it is only this clear, sound quality seems to be able to be edited as much as possible later ♪ 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.800
 I will try again ♪
