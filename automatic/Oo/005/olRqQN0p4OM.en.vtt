00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
to use I think this was like maybe if

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.210 
to use I think this was like maybe if
I'm<00:01:28.140> not<00:01:28.170> mistaken<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.860> might<00:01:29.070> have<00:01:29.189> been

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
I'm not mistaken this might have been

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.440 
I'm not mistaken this might have been
695<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.770> color<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.610> purchased<00:01:33.270> this

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
695 so this color that I purchased this

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.600 
695 so this color that I purchased this
is<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.960> deep<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.380> comes<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.829> three<00:01:35.130> different

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
is the deep it comes in three different

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.090 
is the deep it comes in three different
shades<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.329> doesn't<00:01:36.840> change<00:01:37.079> your<00:01:37.439> makeup<00:01:37.650> it
