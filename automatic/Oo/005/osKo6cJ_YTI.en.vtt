super solid pen with blinding poison and
puncture<00:00:19.859> wound<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.340> was<00:00:20.880> trying<00:00:21.210> out<00:00:21.359> vicious

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900

ping<00:00:22.170> but<00:00:22.410> I'm<00:00:22.500> not<00:00:22.619> really<00:00:22.890> liking<00:00:23.250> it

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
ping but I'm not really liking it

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.859 
ping but I'm not really liking it
just<00:00:24.029> because<00:00:24.180> I'm<00:00:24.269> mourning<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.570> lot<00:00:24.720> of

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
just because I'm mourning a lot of

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.429 
just because I'm mourning a lot of
shield<00:00:25.800> teams<00:00:26.130> shell<00:00:26.880> teams<00:00:27.210> so<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.230> thought

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
shield teams shell teams so I thought

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:29.810 
shield teams shell teams so I thought
I'd<00:00:28.619> be<00:00:28.740> able<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.949> do<00:00:29.010> more<00:00:29.189> damage<00:00:29.609> at<00:00:29.730> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
I'd be able to do more damage at the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.790 
I'd be able to do more damage at the
vicious<00:00:30.090> van<00:00:30.330> gout<00:00:30.570> kind<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.260> like<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> arcane

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
vicious van gout kind of like the arcane

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.700 
vicious van gout kind of like the arcane
blast<00:00:31.949> for<00:00:32.430> Death<00:00:33.000> Adder

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
blast for Death Adder

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.080 
blast for Death Adder
but<00:00:34.710> not<00:00:35.040> really<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> big<00:00:35.489> fan<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.730> should

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
but not really a big fan I should

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.729 
but not really a big fan I should
probably<00:00:36.270> just<00:00:36.510> go<00:00:36.600> back<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.930> poison<00:00:37.350> Fink

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
probably just go back to poison Fink

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.250 
probably just go back to poison Fink
and<00:00:38.899> I<00:00:39.899> have<00:00:40.309> my<00:00:41.309> mad<00:00:41.730> hikami<00:00:42.180> in<00:00:42.420> here<00:00:42.660> just<00:00:43.140> in

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
and I have my mad hikami in here just in

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.290 
and I have my mad hikami in here just in
case<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.620> go<00:00:43.770> against<00:00:44.129> an<00:00:44.190> odd<00:00:44.340> dead<00:00:44.579> he<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.120> a

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
case I go against an odd dead he is a

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.869 
case I go against an odd dead he is a
really<00:00:45.780> really<00:00:46.559> good<00:00:46.890> counter<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.489> undead's

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
really really good counter to undead's

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.000 
really really good counter to undead's
with<00:00:48.329> shell<00:00:48.719> shield<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.260> he'll<00:00:49.440> Plus<00:00:49.800> being

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
with shell shield and he'll Plus being

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.850 
with shell shield and he'll Plus being
an<00:00:50.160> aquatic<00:00:50.489> type<00:00:50.840> taking<00:00:51.840> 50%<00:00:52.079> less<00:00:52.469> damage

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
an aquatic type taking 50% less damage

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.790 
an aquatic type taking 50% less damage
from<00:00:52.890> docks<00:00:53.699> plus<00:00:54.180> just<00:00:54.390> taking<00:00:54.750> 33%<00:00:55.739> more

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
from docks plus just taking 33% more

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.279 
from docks plus just taking 33% more
damage<00:00:56.340> from<00:00:56.460> undead<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.180> he<00:00:57.809> basically<00:00:57.960> just

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
damage from undead so he basically just

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.470 
damage from undead so he basically just
takes<00:00:58.620> no<00:00:58.829> damage<00:00:59.010> from<00:00:59.430> dots<00:00:59.730> which<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.329> what

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
takes no damage from dots which is what

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.410 
takes no damage from dots which is what
most<00:01:00.629> undead's<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:02.760> then<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.149> my

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
most undead's do and then I have my

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.370 
most undead's do and then I have my
Yatagarasu<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:04.680> here<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.850> fiendish<00:01:06.240> imp<00:01:06.510> SS

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
Yatagarasu in here the fiendish imp SS

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.920 
Yatagarasu in here the fiendish imp SS
of<00:01:07.619> course<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.250> fast<00:01:08.490> one<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:09.570> way<00:01:09.659> can<00:01:09.810> go

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
of course the fast one that way can go

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.719 
of course the fast one that way can go
in<00:01:10.110> Nethergate<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.950> interrupt<00:01:11.310> some<00:01:11.490> moves

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
in Nethergate to interrupt some moves

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.030 
in Nethergate to interrupt some moves
emulation<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.990> then<00:01:13.080> go<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.560> back<00:01:13.740> line

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
emulation and then go on the back line

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.499 
emulation and then go on the back line
so<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.340> he<00:01:14.400> can<00:01:14.520> do<00:01:14.670> damage<00:01:14.880> while<00:01:15.299> healing

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
so that he can do damage while healing

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.929 
so that he can do damage while healing
himself<00:01:15.750> every<00:01:16.170> turn<00:01:16.350> but<00:01:17.100> he's<00:01:17.280> mainly<00:01:17.759> in

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
himself every turn but he's mainly in

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.510 
himself every turn but he's mainly in

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
Death Adder hatch lane and then just to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.870 
Death Adder hatch lane and then just to
backups<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:38.009> could<00:01:38.159> take<00:01:38.310> care<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.549> what<00:01:38.759> he

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
backups I could take care of what he

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.600 
backups I could take care of what he
can't<00:01:39.560> all<00:01:40.560> right<00:01:40.710> so<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.070> first<00:01:41.130> team<00:01:41.490> are

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
can't all right so this first team are

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.080 
can't all right so this first team are
going<00:01:41.759> against<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:43.259> mana<00:01:43.799> storm<00:01:44.430> team<00:01:44.820> I

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
going against is a mana storm team I

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.460 
going against is a mana storm team I
think<00:01:45.299> that's<00:01:45.420> what<00:01:45.540> it's<00:01:45.659> called<00:01:45.720> basically

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
think that's what it's called basically

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.319 
think that's what it's called basically
the<00:01:46.649> next<00:01:46.799> as<00:01:46.950> well<00:01:47.130> thing<00:01:47.280> comes<00:01:47.490> in<00:01:47.700> throws

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the next as well thing comes in throws

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.030 
the next as well thing comes in throws
up<00:01:48.479> arcane<00:01:48.899> snoring<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.439> then<00:01:49.560> does<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
up arcane snoring and then does the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.780

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.960 
each one is really good on its own but
I've<00:03:35.020> never<00:03:35.320> actually<00:03:35.650> thought<00:03:36.520> about<00:03:36.580> trying

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
I've never actually thought about trying

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.940 
I've never actually thought about trying
out<00:03:37.210> three<00:03:37.570> before<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:38.440> it's<00:03:38.590> not<00:03:38.680> about<00:03:38.890> a

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
out three before and it's not about a

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.040 
out three before and it's not about a
plan<00:03:39.250> what<00:03:39.670> you<00:03:39.760> do<00:03:39.880> is<00:03:39.970> you<00:03:40.120> it's<00:03:40.690> basically

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
plan what you do is you it's basically

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.970 
plan what you do is you it's basically
like<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.290> bone<00:03:41.920> StormTeam<00:03:42.550> where<00:03:43.300> use<00:03:43.540> its

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
like a bone StormTeam where use its

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.020 
like a bone StormTeam where use its
thunderbolt<00:03:44.980> ability<00:03:45.370> to<00:03:45.490> just<00:03:45.670> do<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:45.820> oe

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
thunderbolt ability to just do a oe

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.510 
thunderbolt ability to just do a oe
damage<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:46.660> then<00:03:47.260> of<00:03:47.440> course<00:03:47.470> just<00:03:47.740> put<00:03:48.430> up

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
damage and then of course just put up

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.230 
damage and then of course just put up
decoy<00:03:48.880> to<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:51.070> know<00:03:51.160> take<00:03:51.400> less<00:03:51.610> damage<00:03:51.640> and

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
decoy to you know take less damage and

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.330 
decoy to you know take less damage and
you'll<00:03:52.330> have<00:03:52.480> three<00:03:52.720> decoys<00:03:53.110> each<00:03:53.920> one<00:03:54.100> blocks

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
you'll have three decoys each one blocks

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.580 
you'll have three decoys each one blocks
to<00:03:54.550> tax<00:03:54.820> it's<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.600> really<00:03:55.900> good<00:03:55.990> ability<00:03:56.380> since

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
to tax it's a really good ability since

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.110 
to tax it's a really good ability since
it<00:03:56.680> blocks<00:03:56.920> two<00:03:57.160> attacks<00:03:57.460> if<00:03:57.700> you<00:03:57.790> go<00:03:57.910> first

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
it blocks two attacks if you go first

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.060 
it blocks two attacks if you go first
you're<00:03:58.330> able<00:03:58.510> to<00:03:58.540> like<00:03:58.780> basically<00:03:59.620> get<00:03:59.800> a<00:03:59.860> free

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
you're able to like basically get a free

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.610 
you're able to like basically get a free
turn<00:04:00.280> out<00:04:00.430> of<00:04:00.460> it<00:04:00.670> my<00:04:01.300> team<00:04:02.050> though<00:04:02.320> has<00:04:02.590> a

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
turn out of it my team though has a

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.670 
turn out of it my team though has a
really<00:04:02.980> nice<00:04:03.070> counter<00:04:03.460> to<00:04:03.610> it<00:04:03.730> my<00:04:04.000> Yatagarasu

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
really nice counter to it my Yatagarasu

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.070 
really nice counter to it my Yatagarasu
he<00:04:05.680> has<00:04:06.070> a<00:04:06.100> type<00:04:06.520> advantage<00:04:06.970> on<00:04:07.210> the

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
he has a type advantage on the

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.560 
he has a type advantage on the
mechanical<00:04:08.470> dragon<00:04:08.800> lean<00:04:08.920> plus<00:04:09.570> immolation

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:10.570 
mechanical dragon lean plus immolation

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.300 
mechanical dragon lean plus immolation
takes<00:04:10.780> care<00:04:11.020> of<00:04:11.050> decoy<00:04:11.470> really<00:04:11.740> well<00:04:11.860> since<00:04:12.130> it

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
takes care of decoy really well since it

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.610 
takes care of decoy really well since it
counts<00:04:12.580> as<00:04:12.670> a<00:04:12.700> hit<00:04:12.940> and<00:04:13.420> it<00:04:13.510> just<00:04:13.660> happens<00:04:13.960> at

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
counts as a hit and it just happens at

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.830 
counts as a hit and it just happens at
the<00:04:14.770> end<00:04:14.920> of<00:04:15.040> each<00:04:15.160> turn<00:04:15.220> so<00:04:15.760> I'm<00:04:16.360> able<00:04:16.480> to<00:04:16.630> take

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
the end of each turn so I'm able to take

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.650 
the end of each turn so I'm able to take
down<00:04:17.020> the<00:04:17.170> decoy<00:04:17.530> in<00:04:17.590> one<00:04:17.860> turn<00:04:18.070> so<00:04:18.450> his<00:04:19.450> one

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:19.660 
down the decoy in one turn so his one

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.450 
down the decoy in one turn so his one
turn<00:04:19.870> of<00:04:20.170> free<00:04:20.440> abilities

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:21.460 
turn of free abilities

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:23.310 
turn of free abilities
it<00:04:21.940> isn't<00:04:22.360> really<00:04:22.630> that<00:04:22.660> big<00:04:22.930> of<00:04:22.990> a<00:04:23.140> deal

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
it isn't really that big of a deal

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.510 
it isn't really that big of a deal
against<00:04:24.190> my<00:04:24.510> fiendish<00:04:25.510> Shemp<00:04:25.750> plus<00:04:26.740> I<00:04:27.130> have

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
against my fiendish Shemp plus I have

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.770 
against my fiendish Shemp plus I have
the<00:04:27.610> type<00:04:27.760> of<00:04:27.790> bonus<00:04:28.120> so<00:04:28.210> I'm<00:04:28.270> just<00:04:28.360> gonna<00:04:28.480> stay

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
the type of bonus so I'm just gonna stay

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.980 
the type of bonus so I'm just gonna stay
into<00:04:29.500> Jana<00:04:29.710> garasu<00:04:30.010> until<00:04:30.850> he<00:04:31.000> dies<00:04:31.240> because

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
into Jana garasu until he dies because

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.320 
into Jana garasu until he dies because
that's<00:04:32.320> the<00:04:32.470> best<00:04:32.710> way<00:04:32.890> to<00:04:32.920> do<00:04:33.100> this<00:04:33.250> because<00:04:34.120> I

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
that's the best way to do this because I

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.300 
that's the best way to do this because I
have<00:04:34.510> the<00:04:34.750> type<00:04:34.930> advantage<00:04:35.350> I<00:04:35.560> should<00:04:36.130> be<00:04:36.250> able

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
have the type advantage I should be able

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.830 
have the type advantage I should be able
to<00:04:36.400> take<00:04:36.580> out<00:04:36.730> like<00:04:36.910> two<00:04:37.180> of<00:04:37.300> them<00:04:37.420> before<00:04:37.570> he

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
to take out like two of them before he

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.980 
to take out like two of them before he
dies<00:04:38.580> this<00:04:39.580> one<00:04:39.760> I<00:04:39.970> just<00:04:40.480> watch<00:04:40.630> out<00:04:40.810> because

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
dies this one I just watch out because

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.610 
dies this one I just watch out because

the switch out is it's free damage

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.220 
the switch out is it's free damage

last pretty much anyone I put up my
shield<00:05:37.370> not<00:05:37.850> really<00:05:38.210> that<00:05:38.330> effective<00:05:38.600> against

shield not really that effective against

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.720 
shield not really that effective against
this<00:05:39.260> guy<00:05:39.410> he's<00:05:39.620> gonna<00:05:39.710> get<00:05:39.920> an<00:05:40.040> extra<00:05:40.370> turn<00:05:40.580> on

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:40.730 
this guy he's gonna get an extra turn on

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:42.280 
this guy he's gonna get an extra turn on
me<00:05:40.820> since<00:05:41.120> my<00:05:41.240> crab<00:05:41.480> doesn't<00:05:41.780> have<00:05:41.900> the<00:05:41.990> multi

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
me since my crab doesn't have the multi

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:43.840 
me since my crab doesn't have the multi
turn<00:05:42.470> stuff<00:05:42.710> like<00:05:42.950> the<00:05:43.130> leadership<00:05:43.490> does

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
turn stuff like the leadership does

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:45.700 
turn stuff like the leadership does
probably<00:05:44.810> should<00:05:45.050> swish<00:05:45.230> him<00:05:45.380> a<00:05:45.440> little<00:05:45.620> bit

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
probably should swish him a little bit

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.080 
probably should swish him a little bit
earlier<00:05:45.980> but<00:05:46.070> whatever<00:05:46.880> and<00:05:47.740> then<00:05:48.740> I<00:05:48.830> just<00:05:49.090> I'm

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
earlier but whatever and then I just I'm

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.030 
earlier but whatever and then I just I'm
just<00:05:50.180> gonna<00:05:50.390> try<00:05:50.600> to<00:05:50.630> outlast<00:05:51.050> him<00:05:51.350> it's<00:05:51.860> not

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.040 
just gonna try to outlast him it's not

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.280 
just gonna try to outlast him it's not
gonna<00:05:52.190> work<00:05:52.460> because<00:05:52.690> breath<00:05:53.690> does<00:05:53.990> hit

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
gonna work because breath does hit

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.750 
gonna work because breath does hit
pretty<00:05:54.650> hard<00:05:54.770> and<00:05:55.190> the<00:05:55.250> shield<00:05:55.520> doesn't

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:55.760 
pretty hard and the shield doesn't

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.660 
pretty hard and the shield doesn't
really<00:05:55.910> introduce<00:05:56.300> it<00:05:56.450> by<00:05:56.540> that<00:05:56.750> much<00:05:57.640> so<00:05:58.640> I

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.670 
really introduce it by that much so I

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.790 
really introduce it by that much so I
was<00:05:58.850> gonna<00:05:58.940> see<00:05:59.030> if<00:05:59.210> I<00:05:59.330> can<00:05:59.480> get<00:05:59.630> enough<00:06:00.590> out<00:06:00.770> of

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
was gonna see if I can get enough out of

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.380 
was gonna see if I can get enough out of
him<00:06:01.010> you<00:06:01.100> trying<00:06:01.340> to<00:06:01.400> a<00:06:01.460> OE<00:06:01.670> down<00:06:01.940> my<00:06:02.180> Death

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
Adder cuz he knows he can't deal with

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.440 
Adder cuz he knows he can't deal with
the<00:06:03.860> death<00:06:04.010> I<00:06:04.130> don't<00:06:04.190> want<00:06:04.430> to<00:06:04.520> comes<00:06:04.700> out<00:06:04.850> the

the death I don't want to comes out the

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.890 
the death I don't want to comes out the
Death<00:06:05.600> Adder

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
Death Adder

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.020 
Death Adder
his<00:06:06.110> faster<00:06:06.650> than<00:06:06.800> him<00:06:06.980> plus<00:06:07.280> he's<00:06:07.430> below<00:06:07.790> 50%

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
his faster than him plus he's below 50%

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.460 
his faster than him plus he's below 50%
health<00:06:08.360> so<00:06:08.600> he's<00:06:08.720> doing<00:06:08.900> extra<00:06:09.080> damage<00:06:09.320> right

second time which is like the best way
to<00:06:22.430> deal<00:06:22.730> with<00:06:23.320> mechanicals<00:06:24.320> is<00:06:24.470> it<00:06:24.560> gives<00:06:24.740> a
