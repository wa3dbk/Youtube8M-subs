necessarily<00:01:36.040> say<00:01:36.610> that<00:01:36.790> any<00:01:37.000> one<00:01:37.270> individual

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
match is it the usual suspects for you

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.700 
match is it the usual suspects for you
that<00:01:43.060> you<00:01:43.150> think<00:01:43.420> will<00:01:43.570> be<00:01:43.750> will<00:01:44.110> be<00:01:44.140> in<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.500> in

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
that you think will be will be in the in

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.319 
that you think will be will be in the in
the<00:01:44.770> groove<00:01:45.070> at<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.340> end<00:01:45.490> or<00:01:45.700> or<00:01:46.060> could<00:01:46.240> this

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:46.329 
the groove at the end or or could this

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:47.550 
the groove at the end or or could this
be<00:01:46.509> a<00:01:46.540> tournament<00:01:46.960> where<00:01:46.990> there<00:01:47.229> might<00:01:47.380> be<00:01:47.439> a

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
be a tournament where there might be a

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.590 
be a tournament where there might be a
surprise<00:01:48.310> in<00:01:48.579> the<00:01:48.850> offing<00:01:49.180> in<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.360> closing

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
surprise in the offing in the closing

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.630 
surprise in the offing in the closing
stages<00:01:49.810> it's<00:01:50.710> very<00:01:50.860> difficult<00:01:51.100> to<00:01:51.369> tell

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
stages it's very difficult to tell

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.460 
stages it's very difficult to tell
because<00:01:51.670> it's<00:01:52.060> been<00:01:52.149> so<00:01:52.390> many<00:01:52.450> matches<00:01:53.049> and<00:01:53.320> so

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
because it's been so many matches and so

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.050 
because it's been so many matches and so
many<00:01:53.530> games<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.159> so<00:01:54.310> many<00:01:54.369> players<00:01:54.610> that

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
many games and so many players that

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.490 
many games and so many players that
sometimes<00:01:55.509> you<00:01:55.630> know<00:01:55.810> everyone<00:01:56.110> kind<00:01:56.380> of

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
sometimes you know everyone kind of

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.859 
sometimes you know everyone kind of
slipped<00:01:57.189> under<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.520> radar<00:01:57.610> in<00:01:58.329> some<00:01:58.570> sort<00:01:58.810> of

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
slipped under the radar in some sort of

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.350 
slipped under the radar in some sort of
way<00:01:58.930> but<00:01:59.740> you<00:02:00.310> know<00:02:00.369> I've<00:02:00.490> been<00:02:00.880> watching<00:02:01.180> some

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
way but you know I've been watching some

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.179 
way but you know I've been watching some
of<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.479> guys<00:02:01.689> and<00:02:02.079> you<00:02:02.200> know<00:02:02.320> a<00:02:02.649> lot<00:02:02.920> you<00:02:03.070> know

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
of the guys and you know a lot you know

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.130 
of the guys and you know a lot you know
listen<00:02:03.460> people<00:02:03.610> playing<00:02:03.969> well<00:02:04.360> there<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:05.079> I

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
listen people playing well there and I

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.999 
listen people playing well there and I
think<00:02:05.380> there's<00:02:05.560> people<00:02:05.920> do<00:02:06.100> a<00:02:06.960> capable<00:02:07.960> I<00:02:08.290> know

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
think there's people do a capable I know

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.109 
think there's people do a capable I know
they're<00:02:09.310> capable<00:02:09.489> of<00:02:09.790> winning<00:02:09.880> tournaments

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
they're capable of winning tournaments

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.090 
they're capable of winning tournaments
and<00:02:10.509> it's<00:02:10.660> just<00:02:10.840> it's<00:02:11.320> just<00:02:11.440> a<00:02:11.620> matter<00:02:11.799> of<00:02:11.890> time

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
and it's just it's just a matter of time

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.860 
and it's just it's just a matter of time
before<00:02:12.220> they<00:02:12.610> have<00:02:12.880> their<00:02:13.090> little<00:02:13.239> spell<00:02:13.690> you

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
before they have their little spell you

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.229 
before they have their little spell you
know<00:02:13.989> like<00:02:14.140> dings<00:02:14.410> had<00:02:14.650> his<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.160> Nils<00:02:15.760> head<00:02:16.060> is

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
know like dings had his and Nils head is

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.540 
know like dings had his and Nils head is
how<00:02:16.690> long<00:02:16.930> can<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.170> carry<00:02:17.440> on<00:02:17.680> law<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.340> averages

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
how long can it carry on law of averages

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.080 
how long can it carry on law of averages
probably<00:02:19.180> says<00:02:19.360> that<00:02:19.599> it<00:02:19.720> can't

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
probably says that it can't

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.780 
probably says that it can't
forever<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.720> it's<00:02:21.650> time<00:02:21.890> maybe<00:02:22.220> for<00:02:22.459> somebody

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
forever and it's time maybe for somebody

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.940 
forever and it's time maybe for somebody
else<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.000> to<00:02:23.720> have<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:23.900> little<00:02:24.080> run<00:02:24.319> you<00:02:24.500> know<00:02:24.620> so

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
else to to have a little run you know so

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.520 
else to to have a little run you know so
you<00:02:25.280> know<00:02:25.310> them<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:26.840> know<00:02:26.959> and<00:02:26.989> who<00:02:27.349> that

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
you know them you know and who that

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.229 
you know them you know and who that
would<00:02:27.680> be<00:02:27.800> I<00:02:27.830> don't<00:02:27.980> know<00:02:28.250> but<00:02:28.489> you<00:02:28.700> know<00:02:28.879> it

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
would be I don't know but you know it

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.180 
would be I don't know but you know it
has<00:02:29.450> to<00:02:29.480> be<00:02:29.720> someone<00:02:29.959> else<00:02:30.170> go<00:02:30.739> gets<00:02:31.040> their

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
has to be someone else go gets their

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.890 
has to be someone else go gets their
hands<00:02:31.340> on<00:02:31.459> trophy<00:02:31.849> or<00:02:31.910> harm<00:02:32.120> see<00:02:32.660> Dean

whenever<00:02:33.200> torn<00:02:33.500> forever<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.160> you<00:02:34.670> know<00:02:34.760> maybe

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
whenever torn forever and you know maybe

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.270 
whenever torn forever and you know maybe
but<00:02:35.510> it's<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:36.019> be<00:02:36.140> highly<00:02:36.410> unlikely<00:02:36.680> well

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
but it's it be highly unlikely well

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.190 
but it's it be highly unlikely well
possibly<00:02:37.700> somebody<00:02:38.030> like<00:02:38.330> Judd<00:02:38.720> Trump<00:02:38.959> who

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
possibly somebody like Judd Trump who

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.080 
possibly somebody like Judd Trump who
hasn't<00:02:39.530> necessarily<00:02:39.650> clicked<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:40.670> far<00:02:40.910> this

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
hasn't necessarily clicked so far this

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.789 
hasn't necessarily clicked so far this
season<00:02:41.150> but<00:02:41.660> does<00:02:41.870> look<00:02:42.080> as<00:02:42.200> though<00:02:42.230> he's

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
season but does look as though he's

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.530 
season but does look as though he's
starting<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.250> find<00:02:43.519> the<00:02:43.610> kind<00:02:43.819> of<00:02:43.879> form<00:02:44.120> that

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
starting to find the kind of form that

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.759 
starting to find the kind of form that
took<00:02:44.690> him<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.019> final<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.470> one<00:02:45.620> in<00:02:45.739> the
