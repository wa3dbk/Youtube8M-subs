00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.590 

to<00:00:06.500> test<00:00:06.770> the<00:00:06.950> new<00:00:07.100> highbanker<00:00:07.760> that<00:00:08.000> Todd

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:08.600 
to test the new highbanker that Todd

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.090 
to test the new highbanker that Todd
assembled<00:00:09.050> for<00:00:09.230> us<00:00:09.350> this<00:00:09.500> is<00:00:09.650> a<00:00:09.680> hole<00:00:09.920> we're

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:10.100 
assembled for us this is a hole we're

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.980 
assembled for us this is a hole we're
digging<00:00:10.460> in<00:00:10.639> all<00:00:10.880> we're<00:00:11.719> doing<00:00:11.930> is

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:11.990 
digging in all we're doing is

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.810 
digging in all we're doing is
classifying<00:00:12.590> our<00:00:12.740> material<00:00:13.280> through<00:00:13.490> a<00:00:13.549> four

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:13.820 
classifying our material through a four

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.670 
classifying our material through a four
screen<00:00:14.180> and<00:00:14.959> then<00:00:15.139> we're<00:00:15.230> gonna<00:00:15.320> go<00:00:15.500> up<00:00:15.650> to

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
screen and then we're gonna go up to

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.520 
screen and then we're gonna go up to
where<00:00:16.100> we<00:00:16.250> know<00:00:16.400> there's<00:00:16.610> some<00:00:16.820> water<00:00:17.030> I<00:00:17.869> have

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:18.530 
where we know there's some water I have

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.470 
where we know there's some water I have
gotten<00:00:18.890> gold<00:00:19.130> here<00:00:19.369> dredging<00:00:19.910> when<00:00:20.119> this<00:00:20.300> is

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
gotten gold here dredging when this is

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.140 
gotten gold here dredging when this is
flowing<00:00:20.960> so<00:00:21.800> hopefully<00:00:22.490> we'll<00:00:22.760> have<00:00:22.940> a<00:00:22.970> little

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.150 
flowing so hopefully we'll have a little

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.730 
flowing so hopefully we'll have a little
bit<00:00:23.270> of<00:00:23.360> color<00:00:23.600> to<00:00:23.840> show<00:00:24.050> you<00:00:24.730> but<00:00:26.470> here<00:00:27.470> it<00:00:27.590> is

gonna<00:00:38.960> be<00:00:39.199> working<00:00:40.039> this<00:00:40.129> new<00:00:40.339> highbanker<00:00:40.969> so

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
gonna be working this new highbanker so

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.290 
gonna be working this new highbanker so
back<00:00:42.350> at<00:00:42.559> here<00:00:42.859> we<00:00:42.980> are<00:00:43.010> found<00:00:43.879> our<00:00:44.059> water

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.450 
material you saw us getting this is the
little<00:00:50.569> highbanker<00:00:51.170> that<00:00:51.379> we've<00:00:52.159> kind<00:00:52.399> of

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
little highbanker that we've kind of

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.729 
little highbanker that we've kind of
designed<00:00:52.879> and<00:00:53.179> or<00:00:53.420> working<00:00:54.140> out<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.530> kinks

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
super concentrator people a kit to

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
super concentrator people a kit to
convert<00:01:16.100> it<00:01:16.250> into<00:01:16.430> a<00:01:16.550> little<00:01:16.790> mini<00:01:17.030> highbanker

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
convert it into a little mini highbanker

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.800 
convert it into a little mini highbanker
so<00:01:19.640> if<00:01:19.760> you<00:01:19.850> already<00:01:19.970> bought<00:01:20.120> the<00:01:20.420> piece<00:01:20.600> of

he's gonna stand the hopper box up and

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:06.900 
he's gonna stand the hopper box up and
you<00:01:54.380> can<00:01:54.530> set<00:01:54.740> your<00:01:54.770> angles<00:01:55.310> with<00:01:55.520> it

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910

got we just ran through a four screen
classified<00:02:12.740> it<00:02:12.860> down<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.130> a<00:02:13.160> four<00:02:13.460> this<00:02:14.270> is

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
classified it down to a four this is

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.510 
classified it down to a four this is
going<00:02:14.600> to<00:02:14.660> class<00:02:14.900> it<00:02:15.140> down<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.830> miracle

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
going to class it down to the miracle

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
okay guys we're filming so you can see

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.310 
okay guys we're filming so you can see
already<00:03:23.360> we<00:03:23.660> know<00:03:23.840> we're<00:03:23.989> going<00:03:24.110> to<00:03:24.170> add<00:03:24.290> a

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
already we know we're going to add a

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.240 
already we know we're going to add a
little<00:03:24.560> bit<00:03:24.769> more<00:03:24.799> pump<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.519> this<00:03:27.220> get<00:03:28.220> a

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
little bit more pump to this get a

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.430 
little bit more pump to this get a
little<00:03:28.340> bit<00:03:28.640> more<00:03:28.850> water<00:03:29.090> flow<00:03:29.480> I'm<00:03:30.049> almost

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
little bit more water flow I'm almost

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.190 
little bit more water flow I'm almost
wondering<00:03:30.709> if<00:03:30.980> we<00:03:31.100> took<00:03:31.250> that<00:03:31.430> valve<00:03:31.730> out

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
wondering if we took that valve out

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.449 
wondering if we took that valve out
because<00:03:33.200> that<00:03:33.380> valve<00:03:33.590> restricts<00:03:34.160> it<00:03:34.280> down<00:03:34.430> a

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
because that valve restricts it down a

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.910 
because that valve restricts it down a
little<00:03:34.700> bit<00:03:34.940> but<00:03:35.269> we'll<00:03:36.230> see<00:03:36.380> what<00:03:36.500> happens

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
little bit but we'll see what happens

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.620 
little bit but we'll see what happens
but<00:03:37.010> this<00:03:37.430> is<00:03:37.580> the<00:03:37.730> machine<00:03:38.030> running<00:03:38.299> we're

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
but this is the machine running we're

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.360 
but this is the machine running we're
just<00:03:38.810> running<00:03:38.989> the<00:03:39.200> stuff<00:03:39.410> that<00:03:39.620> we<00:03:39.739> dug<00:03:40.010> up<00:03:40.220> at

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
just running the stuff that we dug up at

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.390 
just running the stuff that we dug up at
that<00:03:40.519> hole<00:03:41.709> Grizzly's<00:03:42.709> working<00:03:43.130> great

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
that hole Grizzly's working great

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.819 
that hole Grizzly's working great
bringing<00:03:43.790> us<00:03:44.030> down<00:03:44.209> to<00:03:44.540> about<00:03:44.810> 1/8<00:03:45.170> size<00:03:45.500> on

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829

dredging<00:04:00.780> so<00:04:01.020> if<00:04:01.830> I<00:04:01.950> would<00:04:02.070> have<00:04:02.130> known<00:04:02.280> this

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
dredging so if I would have known this

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.800 
dredging so if I would have known this
water<00:04:02.670> was<00:04:02.940> up<00:04:03.120> here<00:04:03.300> I<00:04:03.330> probably<00:04:03.570> would<00:04:03.780> have

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
water was up here I probably would have

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.960 
water was up here I probably would have
brought<00:04:03.930> my<00:04:04.140> dredge<00:04:04.380> too<00:04:05.780> but<00:04:06.780> anyway<00:04:07.970> that's

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
brought my dredge too but anyway that's

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.400 
brought my dredge too but anyway that's
how<00:04:09.150> she<00:04:09.210> looks<00:04:09.510> when<00:04:09.690> she's<00:04:09.720> running<00:04:10.080> and

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
how she looks when she's running and

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:11.750 
how she looks when she's running and
I'll<00:04:10.530> come<00:04:10.770> back<00:04:10.800> to<00:04:10.950> you<00:04:11.190> when<00:04:11.400> we<00:04:11.550> do<00:04:11.730> a
