00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
changed a bit so I think some champions

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.410 
changed a bit so I think some champions
are<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.890> bit<00:00:26.039> better<00:00:26.160> than<00:00:26.400> others<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:26.789> my<00:00:27.150> last

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
are a bit better than others and my last

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.089 
are a bit better than others and my last
year<00:00:27.599> list<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.019> so<00:00:28.560> with<00:00:28.710> all<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:28.890> being

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
year list and so with all that being

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:44.229 
year list and so with all that being
said<00:00:29.340> let's<00:00:30.060> get<00:00:30.300> started

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.400 

alright<00:00:45.239> so<00:00:45.450> first<00:00:45.660> up<00:00:45.870> is<00:00:46.020> going<00:00:46.199> to<00:00:46.290> be

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
alright so first up is going to be

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.799 
alright so first up is going to be
phased<00:00:46.710> at<00:00:46.829> number<00:00:47.219> 10<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:48.000> fizz<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.540> a<00:00:48.570> lich

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
phased at number 10 so fizz is a lich

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.780 
phased at number 10 so fizz is a lich
bane<00:00:48.989> user<00:00:49.230> which<00:00:49.559> makes<00:00:49.829> him<00:00:49.949> a<00:00:50.129> great<00:00:50.399> room

like<00:03:02.200> a<00:03:02.230> 1.3<00:03:02.890> seconds<00:03:03.310> slow<00:03:03.520> and<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:04.030> obviously

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
like a 1.3 seconds slow and so obviously

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.030 
like a 1.3 seconds slow and so obviously
there's<00:03:04.720> going<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:04.900> be<00:03:04.930> less<00:03:05.110> CC<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.680> his<00:03:05.800> kit

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
there's going to be less CC and his kit

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.430 
there's going to be less CC and his kit
since<00:03:06.430> well<00:03:07.090> that's<00:03:07.660> almost<00:03:07.900> half<00:03:08.110> of<00:03:08.290> the

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
since well that's almost half of the

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.410 
since well that's almost half of the
slow<00:03:08.650> gone<00:03:08.890> so<00:03:09.400> his<00:03:09.490> gang<00:03:09.670> Stan<00:03:09.940> team<00:03:10.180> fighting

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
slow gone so his gang Stan team fighting

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.120 
slow gone so his gang Stan team fighting
are<00:03:10.690> a<00:03:10.720> bit<00:03:10.870> weaker<00:03:11.230> but<00:03:11.530> he<00:03:11.620> still<00:03:11.770> packs<00:03:12.010> a

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
are a bit weaker but he still packs a

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.580 
are a bit weaker but he still packs a
lot<00:03:12.160> of<00:03:12.400> CC<00:03:12.760> with<00:03:12.910> his<00:03:13.030> Ian<00:03:13.360> are<00:03:13.540> so<00:03:14.110> like<00:03:14.410> he's

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
lot of CC with his Ian are so like he's

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.440 
lot of CC with his Ian are so like he's
still<00:03:14.800> good<00:03:14.980> in<00:03:15.100> that<00:03:15.190> sense<00:03:15.490> I<00:03:15.730> mean<00:03:15.820> he<00:03:16.210> kind

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
still good in that sense I mean he kind

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.760 
still good in that sense I mean he kind
of<00:03:16.570> loses<00:03:16.810> a<00:03:16.840> sticking<00:03:17.260> power<00:03:17.380> because<00:03:17.680> the

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 
of loses a sticking power because the

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.710 
of loses a sticking power because the
slow<00:03:17.980> is<00:03:18.130> down<00:03:18.310> of<00:03:18.490> course<00:03:18.670> but<00:03:19.420> he<00:03:19.510> still

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
slow is down of course but he still

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.510 
slow is down of course but he still
packs<00:03:19.960> a<00:03:20.080> lot<00:03:20.110> of<00:03:20.320> base<00:03:20.500> damage<00:03:20.740> with<00:03:21.040> his<00:03:21.160> W

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
packs a lot of base damage with his W

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.130 
packs a lot of base damage with his W
you<00:03:22.060> know<00:03:22.180> what<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.390> percent<00:03:22.750> health<00:03:22.930> damage

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
you know what the percent health damage

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.410 
you know what the percent health damage
and<00:03:23.530> he's<00:03:23.860> still<00:03:24.070> really<00:03:24.340> tanky<00:03:24.850> I<00:03:25.030> think<00:03:25.360> the

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
and he's still really tanky I think the

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.540 
and he's still really tanky I think the
health<00:03:25.600> regen<00:03:25.930> nerf<00:03:26.170> did<00:03:26.470> hurt<00:03:26.740> a<00:03:26.860> bit<00:03:26.980> but<00:03:27.250> I

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
health regen nerf did hurt a bit but I

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.160 
health regen nerf did hurt a bit but I
think<00:03:27.760> as<00:03:27.850> passive<00:03:28.240> does<00:03:28.480> make<00:03:28.660> up<00:03:28.810> most<00:03:28.990> of

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
think as passive does make up most of

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.350 
think as passive does make up most of
his<00:03:29.230> health<00:03:29.530> again<00:03:29.890> either<00:03:30.460> way<00:03:30.640> I<00:03:30.670> still<00:03:31.120> see

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
his health again either way I still see

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.210 
his health again either way I still see
a<00:03:31.390> lot<00:03:31.570> of<00:03:31.630> people<00:03:31.900> applying<00:03:32.080> them<00:03:32.350> next<00:03:32.920> up<00:03:33.040> we

advantage through their only problem is

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.300 
advantage through their only problem is
I<00:04:49.450> do<00:04:49.510> fall<00:04:49.870> off<00:04:49.960> in<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.200> late<00:04:50.380> game<00:04:50.620> and<00:04:50.830> I'm

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
I do fall off in the late game and I'm

putting<00:04:51.580> myself<00:04:51.730> at<00:04:52.060> risk<00:04:52.120> by<00:04:52.600> being<00:04:52.630> squishy

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
putting myself at risk by being squishy

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.260 
putting myself at risk by being squishy
but<00:04:53.860> now<00:04:54.010> let's<00:04:54.040> talk<00:04:54.460> about<00:04:54.669> the<00:04:54.910> perks<00:04:55.150> of

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
but now let's talk about the perks of

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.659 
but now let's talk about the perks of
her<00:04:55.600> just<00:04:55.960> in<00:04:56.110> general<00:04:56.230> so<00:04:56.830> she's<00:04:57.100> stealth<00:04:57.460> and

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
her just in general so she's stealth and

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.190 
her just in general so she's stealth and
can't<00:04:57.850> avoid<00:04:58.060> the<00:04:58.300> site<00:04:58.540> wards<00:04:58.780> in<00:04:58.870> the<00:04:58.960> early

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
can't avoid the site wards in the early

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.050 
can't avoid the site wards in the early
game<00:04:59.380> so<00:04:59.800> that's<00:04:59.950> really<00:05:00.100> good<00:05:00.370> and<00:05:00.580> she<00:05:00.880> has<00:05:01.030> a

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
game so that's really good and she has a

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.279 
game so that's really good and she has a
lot<00:05:01.270> of<00:05:01.330> early<00:05:01.600> game<00:05:01.840> pressure

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
lot of early game pressure

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.049 
lot of early game pressure
and<00:05:02.469> once<00:05:02.860> she<00:05:02.979> gets<00:05:03.099> those<00:05:03.279> few<00:05:03.580> early<00:05:03.909> game

00:05:04.049 --> 00:05:04.059 
and once she gets those few early game

00:05:04.059 --> 00:05:05.579 
and once she gets those few early game
kills<00:05:04.389> you<00:05:04.689> can<00:05:04.809> start<00:05:05.020> snowballing<00:05:05.439> the

00:05:05.579 --> 00:05:05.589 
kills you can start snowballing the

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:07.109 
kills you can start snowballing the
early<00:05:05.800> game<00:05:06.009> and<00:05:06.189> eventually<00:05:06.550> you<00:05:06.789> know<00:05:06.819> went

00:05:07.109 --> 00:05:07.119 
early game and eventually you know went

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:08.249 
early game and eventually you know went
off<00:05:07.240> that<00:05:07.449> because<00:05:07.749> they're<00:05:07.869> made<00:05:08.020> give<00:05:08.139> me

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:08.259 
off that because they're made give me

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:11.070 
off that because they're made give me
liking<00:05:08.439> kind<00:05:08.770> of<00:05:08.830> suck<00:05:09.360> and<00:05:10.360> since<00:05:10.689> I<00:05:10.839> just

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
liking kind of suck and since I just

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.689 
liking kind of suck and since I just
said<00:05:11.259> that<00:05:11.289> well<00:05:11.830> that's<00:05:12.159> one<00:05:12.309> of<00:05:12.399> our<00:05:12.490> fault

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
said that well that's one of our fault

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.219 
said that well that's one of our fault
of<00:05:12.849> course<00:05:12.879> so<00:05:13.389> you<00:05:13.809> don't<00:05:13.960> want<00:05:14.080> to<00:05:14.139> really

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:14.229 
of course so you don't want to really

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:15.450 
of course so you don't want to really
get<00:05:14.439> in<00:05:14.559> the<00:05:14.619> mid<00:05:14.740> gaming<00:05:15.009> linking<00:05:15.249> there's

like<00:05:15.639> better<00:05:15.909> champions<00:05:16.449> that<00:05:16.899> will<00:05:17.139> let's

00:05:17.429 --> 00:05:17.439 
like better champions that will let's

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:18.839 
like better champions that will let's
kill<00:05:17.649> you<00:05:17.860> so<00:05:18.099> you<00:05:18.189> don't<00:05:18.339> want<00:05:18.520> that<00:05:18.669> to

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
kill you so you don't want that to

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:21.119 
kill you so you don't want that to
happen<00:05:18.879> either<00:05:19.360> way<00:05:19.930> abusing<00:05:20.619> her<00:05:20.710> early<00:05:20.949> game

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 
happen either way abusing her early game

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:22.980 
happen either way abusing her early game
is<00:05:21.309> probably<00:05:21.610> your<00:05:21.729> best<00:05:21.789> bet<00:05:22.029> and<00:05:22.389> that's<00:05:22.899> a

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
is probably your best bet and that's a

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.389 
is probably your best bet and that's a
really<00:05:23.199> common<00:05:23.379> thing<00:05:23.649> in<00:05:23.680> hiring<00:05:23.979> a<00:05:24.219> lowes

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:24.399 
really common thing in hiring a lowes

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:25.409 
really common thing in hiring a lowes
because<00:05:24.789> they<00:05:24.909> can<00:05:25.029> scrub<00:05:25.270> all<00:05:25.389> the

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
because they can scrub all the

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.540 
because they can scrub all the
advantages<00:05:26.050> easily<00:05:26.439> and<00:05:26.619> not<00:05:27.159> throw<00:05:27.369> their

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
advantages easily and not throw their

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.549 
advantages easily and not throw their
lead<00:05:27.729> as<00:05:27.969> much<00:05:28.210> but<00:05:28.599> of<00:05:28.839> course<00:05:28.899> they<00:05:29.169> still<00:05:29.409> do

00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:29.559 
lead as much but of course they still do

00:05:29.559 --> 00:05:32.730 
lead as much but of course they still do
next<00:05:30.550> up<00:05:30.729> at<00:05:31.029> number<00:05:31.509> two<00:05:31.779> is<00:05:32.050> going<00:05:32.499> to<00:05:32.589> beam

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
next up at number two is going to beam

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.579 
next up at number two is going to beam
Italy<00:05:33.219> so<00:05:33.939> nearly<00:05:34.389> I<00:05:34.659> said<00:05:35.020> in<00:05:35.110> another<00:05:35.289> video

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:35.589 
Italy so nearly I said in another video

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:37.320 
Italy so nearly I said in another video
that<00:05:35.889> I<00:05:35.919> kind<00:05:36.189> of<00:05:36.219> nerve<00:05:36.399> to<00:05:36.580> early<00:05:36.789> game<00:05:36.969> which

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
that I kind of nerve to early game which

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.420 
that I kind of nerve to early game which
is<00:05:37.360> no<00:05:38.169> that's<00:05:38.439> actually<00:05:38.740> not<00:05:38.860> true<00:05:39.039> because

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
is no that's actually not true because

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.909 
is no that's actually not true because
her<00:05:39.819> clears<00:05:40.149> feel<00:05:40.509> you<00:05:40.930> know<00:05:41.020> basically<00:05:41.709> the

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:41.919 
her clears feel you know basically the

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.159 
her clears feel you know basically the
same<00:05:42.099> and<00:05:42.309> it's<00:05:42.999> just<00:05:43.209> that<00:05:43.389> now<00:05:43.599> she<00:05:43.659> has<00:05:43.959> more

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
same and it's just that now she has more

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:46.350 
same and it's just that now she has more
managing<00:05:44.770> and<00:05:45.009> now<00:05:45.459> her<00:05:45.699> ganks<00:05:46.059> are<00:05:46.149> a<00:05:46.180> bit

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
managing and now her ganks are a bit

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.359 
managing and now her ganks are a bit
more<00:05:46.599> consistent<00:05:47.110> because<00:05:47.289> now<00:05:47.919> some<00:05:48.129> of<00:05:48.249> that

00:05:48.359 --> 00:05:48.369 
more consistent because now some of that

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:50.639 
more consistent because now some of that
