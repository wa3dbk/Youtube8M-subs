on<00:01:38.440> the<00:01:38.560> back<00:01:38.710> but<00:01:38.980> for<00:01:39.460> this<00:01:39.640> type<00:01:40.090> of<00:01:40.120> knife

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
on the back but for this type of knife

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.820 
on the back but for this type of knife
where<00:01:40.630> you're<00:01:40.750> pulling<00:01:41.050> I<00:01:41.410> don't<00:01:41.560> know<00:01:41.650> why

good just when you're holding it like a
regular<00:01:45.790> knife<00:01:46.120> but<00:01:48.690> it's<00:01:49.690> not<00:01:49.930> really<00:01:50.230> needed

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
regular knife but it's not really needed

comparable to vg-10 I'm correct so I got

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.770
