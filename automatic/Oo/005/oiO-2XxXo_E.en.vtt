up armor lock before because I've tried

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.889 
up armor lock before because I've tried

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899 
this a couple of times and sometimes I

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.380 
this a couple of times and sometimes I
fall<00:01:29.960> off<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.319> rocks<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:31.369> what<00:01:31.579> happens<00:01:32.270> with

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
fall off the rocks and what happens with

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.359 
fall off the rocks and what happens with
armor<00:01:32.630> lock<00:01:32.810> is<00:01:32.960> if<00:01:33.049> you<00:01:33.140> land<00:01:33.380> on<00:01:33.530> a<00:01:33.590> like<00:01:34.340> a

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
armor lock is if you land on a like a

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.219 
armor lock is if you land on a like a
diagonal<00:01:34.880> surface<00:01:35.299> that<00:01:35.479> you're<00:01:35.539> most<00:01:36.020> likely

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
diagonal surface that you're most likely

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.440 
diagonal surface that you're most likely
going<00:01:36.409> to<00:01:36.469> bounce<00:01:36.619> off<00:01:36.859> if<00:01:37.729> you<00:01:37.880> are<00:01:38.030> malach<00:01:38.299> on

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
going to bounce off if you are malach on

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.349 
going to bounce off if you are malach on
top<00:01:38.630> of<00:01:38.749> it<00:01:38.869> you<00:01:38.899> will<00:01:39.139> stop<00:01:39.409> which<00:01:39.799> is<00:01:39.950> cool<00:01:40.359> so

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:41.359 
top of it you will stop which is cool so

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:42.850 
top of it you will stop which is cool so
I<00:01:41.689> might<00:01:41.929> give<00:01:42.380> that<00:01:42.530> a<00:01:42.560> go

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860
