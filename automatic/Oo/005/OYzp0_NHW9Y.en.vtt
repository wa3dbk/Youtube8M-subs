these in upcoming design segments and

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.009 
these in upcoming design segments and
today<00:00:23.670> we're<00:00:23.789> going<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:23.970> focus<00:00:24.180> on<00:00:24.480> color<00:00:24.779> and

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
today we're going to focus on color and

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.040 
today we're going to focus on color and
color<00:00:25.650> schemes<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.970> can<00:00:27.000> divide<00:00:27.390> colors<00:00:27.779> into

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
color schemes you can divide colors into

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.650 
color schemes you can divide colors into
two<00:00:28.289> main<00:00:28.920> groups<00:00:28.949> warm<00:00:29.849> colors<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.510> cool

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
two main groups warm colors and cool

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.190 
two main groups warm colors and cool
colors<00:00:31.189> warm<00:00:32.189> colors<00:00:32.550> include<00:00:33.000> oranges<00:00:33.719> reds

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
colors warm colors include oranges reds

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.430 
colors warm colors include oranges reds
and<00:00:34.590> yellows<00:00:35.149> warm<00:00:36.149> colors<00:00:36.570> create<00:00:37.050> sort<00:00:37.410> of

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
and yellows warm colors create sort of

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.920 
and yellows warm colors create sort of
an<00:00:37.559> excitement<00:00:38.100> they<00:00:38.790> also<00:00:38.940> tend<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.450> move<00:00:39.719> out

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
an excitement they also tend to move out

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.040 
an excitement they also tend to move out
towards<00:00:40.440> you<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.280> these<00:00:41.489> yellow<00:00:42.329> flowers<00:00:42.870> are

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
towards you so these yellow flowers are

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.319 
towards you so these yellow flowers are
in<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.260> background<00:00:43.610> but<00:00:44.610> they<00:00:44.760> tend<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.059> jump

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
in the background but they tend to jump

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.760 
in the background but they tend to jump
forward<00:00:45.690> even<00:00:46.050> though<00:00:46.140> they're<00:00:46.320> behind<00:00:46.620> the

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
forward even though they're behind the

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.020 
forward even though they're behind the
blue<00:00:46.980> flowers<00:00:48.079> now<00:00:49.079> cool<00:00:49.559> colors<00:00:50.039> include

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
blue flowers now cool colors include

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.279 
blue flowers now cool colors include
blues<00:00:51.480> greens<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.649> purples<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.399> these<00:00:54.289> tend

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
blues greens and purples and these tend

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.010 
blues greens and purples and these tend
to<00:00:55.410> add<00:00:55.500> depth<00:00:55.949> they<00:00:56.820> look<00:00:57.059> farther<00:00:57.600> away<00:00:57.809> from

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
to add depth they look farther away from

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.920 
to add depth they look farther away from
you<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:58.770> they<00:00:59.670> make<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> really<00:01:00.329> good<00:01:00.510> backdrop

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
you and they make a really good backdrop

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.979 
you and they make a really good backdrop
to<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:02.070> garden<00:01:02.579> because<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.120> backward

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
to a garden because of that backward

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.350 
to a garden because of that backward
motion<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:05.010> when<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.250> use<00:01:05.460> these<00:01:05.729> warm<00:01:06.119> and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
motion and when we use these warm and

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.120 
motion and when we use these warm and
cool<00:01:06.510> colors<00:01:06.750> together<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.619> add<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> great

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
cool colors together we can add a great

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.370 
cool colors together we can add a great
deal<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.580> depth<00:01:08.880> even<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.689> very<00:01:10.080> narrow

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
deal of depth even to a very narrow

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.940 
deal of depth even to a very narrow
border

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.740 

now<00:01:15.950> just<00:01:16.280> as<00:01:16.490> different<00:01:17.180> color<00:01:17.450> combinations

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
now just as different color combinations

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.530 
now just as different color combinations
can<00:01:18.470> create<00:01:18.770> depth<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:19.430> can<00:01:19.670> light<00:01:19.940> and<00:01:20.210> dark

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
can create depth so can light and dark

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.960 
can create depth so can light and dark
colors<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.110> this<00:01:21.710> planting<00:01:22.340> is<00:01:22.520> a<00:01:22.550> very<00:01:22.790> good

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
colors and this planting is a very good

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.030 
colors and this planting is a very good
example<00:01:23.570> of<00:01:23.660> that<00:01:23.720> the<00:01:24.380> first<00:01:24.650> thing<00:01:24.890> we

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
example of that the first thing we

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.070 
example of that the first thing we
really<00:01:25.340> see<00:01:25.670> there's<00:01:25.940> this<00:01:26.300> variegated

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
really see there's this variegated

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.170 
really see there's this variegated
monkey<00:01:27.560> grass<00:01:27.800> it<00:01:28.040> just<00:01:28.220> jumps<00:01:28.670> out<00:01:28.820> at<00:01:29.060> you

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
monkey grass it just jumps out at you

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.880 
monkey grass it just jumps out at you
because<00:01:29.330> of<00:01:29.570> that<00:01:29.600> very<00:01:29.900> light<00:01:30.290> color<00:01:30.620> the

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
because of that very light color the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:32.290 
because of that very light color the
white<00:01:31.040> variegation<00:01:31.640> in<00:01:31.970> it

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
white variegation in it

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.440 
white variegation in it
the<00:01:32.960> acorus<00:01:33.620> catches<00:01:34.340> our<00:01:34.460> eye<00:01:34.490> next<00:01:35.120> with<00:01:35.300> the

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
the acorus catches our eye next with the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.200 
the acorus catches our eye next with the
yellow<00:01:35.900> color<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:36.410> then<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.280> holly<00:01:37.520> seems<00:01:38.030> to

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
yellow color and then the holly seems to

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.510 
yellow color and then the holly seems to
fall<00:01:38.480> back<00:01:38.750> into<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.380> background<00:01:39.950> because<00:01:40.490> it

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
fall back into the background because it

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.370 
fall back into the background because it
has<00:01:40.730> this<00:01:40.910> darker<00:01:41.360> foliage<00:01:41.810> but

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
has this darker foliage but

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.200 
has this darker foliage but
interestingly<00:01:42.710> the<00:01:43.280> acorus<00:01:43.730> in<00:01:43.880> the<00:01:43.970> Holly

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
interestingly the acorus in the Holly

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.600 
interestingly the acorus in the Holly
are<00:01:44.540> planted<00:01:45.290> pretty<00:01:45.530> much<00:01:45.740> in<00:01:45.950> a<00:01:46.040> line<00:01:46.250> it's

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
are planted pretty much in a line it's

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.440 
are planted pretty much in a line it's
just<00:01:46.760> the<00:01:47.090> color<00:01:47.330> that<00:01:47.570> creates<00:01:47.930> that<00:01:48.050> depth

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
just the color that creates that depth

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.090 
just the color that creates that depth
colors<00:01:50.450> combined<00:01:50.990> in<00:01:51.229> very<00:01:51.440> different<00:01:51.890> ways

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
colors combined in very different ways

and understanding how they combine and
how<00:01:54.710> they<00:01:54.890> look<00:01:55.130> together<00:01:55.340> can<00:01:55.820> help<00:01:56.000> us<00:01:56.240> use

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
how they look together can help us use

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.600 
how they look together can help us use
those<00:01:56.720> more<00:01:56.960> effectively<00:01:57.650> in<00:01:57.770> a<00:01:57.860> planting<00:01:58.400> a

those more effectively in a planting a
color<00:01:59.330> wheel<00:01:59.600> can<00:01:59.930> help<00:02:00.170> you<00:02:00.320> understand<00:02:00.979> that

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
color wheel can help you understand that

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.540 
color wheel can help you understand that
combination<00:02:02.590> there<00:02:03.590> are<00:02:03.680> several<00:02:03.920> common

are used in planting and the first of
these<00:02:09.290> is<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.770> complementary<00:02:10.429> color<00:02:10.729> scheme

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
these is the complementary color scheme

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.870 
these is the complementary color scheme
complementary<00:02:12.320> colors<00:02:12.680> appear<00:02:13.070> opposite<00:02:13.730> one

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
complementary colors appear opposite one

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
looked at it uses many different colors

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.080 
looked at it uses many different colors
as<00:03:45.390> well<00:03:46.200> as<00:03:46.380> different<00:03:46.800> shades<00:03:47.130> and<00:03:47.400> tints<00:03:47.910> of

now there's a lot of bold color and a

and<00:03:56.430> it's<00:03:57.000> not<00:03:57.270> for<00:03:57.600> everywhere<00:03:58.050> you<00:03:58.290> have<00:03:58.319> to

and it's not for everywhere you have to

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.590 
and it's not for everywhere you have to

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.530 
be careful because a polychromatic
garden<00:04:01.020> can<00:04:01.200> get<00:04:01.319> a<00:04:01.350> little<00:04:01.680> bit<00:04:01.830> too<00:04:02.310> much<00:04:02.580> too

and free-flowing and so this

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.410 
and free-flowing and so this
polychromatic<00:04:14.070> color<00:04:14.400> scheme<00:04:14.760> really<00:04:15.030> works

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
in this situation you can use these

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.750 
in this situation you can use these
different<00:04:18.750> basic<00:04:19.739> color<00:04:19.980> schemes<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.579> help
