00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 gentlemen decided for you to write 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.270
 completely spontaneously and video something 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.010
 bespectacled squandered camping and the operator told 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.800
 we all take the camera and shoots well 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.719
 I will try to tell you something about the essence 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.910
 the conversation that was happening now she 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:20.100
 was about a bucket of my dreams how often 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.710
 happens know such a scythe with when u 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.980
 you were a dream machine and with a lapse 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.380
 years you have not mastered this machine 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.320
 and the dream died because those machines 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.540
 everything is rotted and there is no 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.500
 the market, that is, she hung in your childhood 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.450
 on posters 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.579
 or maybe already some mature 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.860
 aged people looked out for her 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.550
 and even quite possibly you even had 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.410
 chance to buy it but years have passed and cars 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.450
 already changed and not only because 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.910
 they just have all rotted just with 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.370
 over time yourself regardless of you 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.640
 but also because you have changed because 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.379
 did you perceive it when you were a little bit 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.530
 younger from scratch 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.930
 you saw this design as such he was 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.390
 for you new all these buttons all this 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.960
 it seemed modern but then with 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.000
 time comes this experience comes then 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.490
 the number of cars that is through you 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.710
 passed and you went through them and everything for 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.229
 you are not the same and now comes such 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.280
 funny case like or with me it was 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.500
 how is it possible with many of you when you 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.280
 and finally you sit down that machine and 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.650
 which you dreamed of a teenager 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.680
 but the buzz does not come and why 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:35.260
 what you see this style is no longer new you 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.430
 trying to tie him to the fact that already 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.040
 you were before him 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.500
 because these buttons were already like this 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.979
 there and this deflector already applied total 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.950
 here 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.020
 and here is this solution is clearly out of 93 and 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.960
 here today you begin to understand that 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.850
 the dream she died was a buzz and while you're in 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.630
 she did not sit down and in the end it turned out that 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.210
 sweatshirt 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.130
 and in this moment you can 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.229
 a little to understand me and why and so 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.990
 trolls in the mesh because with time 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:05.950
 when you move on anything and 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.410
 for 5000 rubles and for 5 million or 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.509
 whatever brand and jar you like 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.300
 Fly on the fact that the street is not, and in general on 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.720
 anything you already start everything for 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.600
 deliver for you closes these here 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.850
 doors here in such a youthful paradise when 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.340
 every car is just a car given 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.980
 the buzz about the war is not for you every new 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.650
 the car is just a set of already some 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.390
 other cars that were before she 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.209
 loses its originality loses 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.120
 isolation and buzz from her 1 no how 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.250
 here 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.000
 what's the whole thing 1 is it real 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.040
 problem 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.380
 that is why it often happens that when I 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.420
 here are people in adulthood until when 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.430
 a young man buys a car he is from her 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.230
 trudging begins to cutting 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.180
 stuff like that by the way often 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.270
 obtained by the owners of the lada granta yes 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.280
 it's no secret that very often tuning 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.010
 Lada exposed exactly as the first 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.570
 car and and buys but not for a while 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.240
 there is someone starts to cripple 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:07.150
 compressor here are these new drives and why 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.650
 we so rarely see on machines that 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.570
 all older people buy 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.900
 Yes, because they simply do not push 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.209
 in fact when you buy there 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.070
 car your second third to you 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.080
 anonymous you like her from you 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.290
 immediately want to improve something 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.850
 when at 10 you just want something 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.860
 improve because from certain 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:30.880
 things you obviously do not drag 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:33.370
 and when this machine 20 30 you have so on 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.290
 dick some flaws which shoals you 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.690
 just sit down and you have clear 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.980
 requirements that the car should be this 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:44.940
 third but should sound so be it 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.620
 and be something but do not be like this, some 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.720
 already begins to bother but 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.230
 subtleties like there with what effort 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.819
 levers turn that and so on 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.830
 most shay I assure you really 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.019
 even when a person buys a car for 5 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.819
 million in his head one simple 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.340
 requirement she should just fine 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.160
 comfortable to ride and not fool all 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.390
 therefore, no tuning is already easier 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.610
 are needed 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.800
 sometimes this rare perversion happens 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.510
 when exactly is perversion and I 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.390
 I emphasize this when young 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.660
 a person buys a car for 5 million and 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.910
 start something else tune yes it 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.890
 interesting but this is really such here 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.360
 rare case when fat is frantic to understand 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.189
 this ummu 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.759
 in the real sense, no nothing 

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:28.759
 I want to say 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.440
 from all this it follows that 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.419
 it all comes out pretty 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.370
 atypical for me conclusion because 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.280
 I usually always trolls of people who 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.560
 tuning budget table 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.750
 Well what I want to tell you if you 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.380
 started all the same tuning budget ki 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.790
 then try to memorize yours well 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.610
 sensations from this 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.400
 and really catch from this buzz not 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.560
 listen to no one listen to me because 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.930
 that what you do is bullshit me 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.690
 I want to say right away but this garbage is for you 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:07.310
 and you will enjoy it and it 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.169
 pleasure will be much better than 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.610
 you will spend money on some 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:12.860
 there drugs booze 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:16.340
 Well, for women, something better to spend 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:20.200
 I so want to say it is but it 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.740
 pleasure for everyone therefore 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:24.980
 pulling will 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.120
 pressed grandmother living incinerate 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.510
 your life garage 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.460
 then you will regret it but two hours 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:35.390
 after leaving the garage you will be kayfovo 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.570
 so the touches are good luck and I'll see everything 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:37.570
 until
