00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.470 

okay<00:00:19.970> so<00:00:20.030> here<00:00:20.360> we<00:00:20.480> are<00:00:20.630> we<00:00:21.110> have<00:00:22.270> the<00:00:23.270> main

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
okay so here we are we have the main

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.980 
okay so here we are we have the main
page<00:00:24.290> of<00:00:24.590> the<00:00:24.830> amplifier<00:00:25.010> page<00:00:25.880> one<00:00:26.210> I<00:00:26.420> like<00:00:26.960> to

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
page of the amplifier page one I like to

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.290 
page of the amplifier page one I like to
keep<00:00:27.140> it<00:00:27.580> pretty<00:00:28.580> basic<00:00:28.820> I<00:00:29.240> keep<00:00:29.869> the<00:00:30.020> boost<00:00:30.260> on

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
keep it pretty basic I keep the boost on

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.549 
keep it pretty basic I keep the boost on
going<00:00:32.300> to<00:00:32.450> the<00:00:32.960> dr<00:00:33.230> spit<00:00:33.860> around<00:00:34.100> 650<00:00:35.559> because

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559 
going to the dr spit around 650 because

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.880 
going to the dr spit around 650 because
i<00:00:36.680> use<00:00:36.860> a<00:00:36.890> an<00:00:37.580> overdrive<00:00:38.480> in<00:00:38.780> front<00:00:39.230> to<00:00:39.559> give<00:00:39.739> it

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
i use a an overdrive in front to give it

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.970 
i use a an overdrive in front to give it
some<00:00:40.100> more<00:00:40.129> push<00:00:40.550> base<00:00:41.360> it's<00:00:42.110> already<00:00:42.410> a<00:00:42.590> very

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
some more push base it's already a very

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.320 
some more push base it's already a very
low<00:00:43.309> end<00:00:43.580> kind<00:00:44.330> of<00:00:44.420> amplifier<00:00:44.989> so<00:00:45.470> I'd<00:00:46.280> like<00:00:47.180> to

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
low end kind of amplifier so I'd like to

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:52.140 
low end kind of amplifier so I'd like to
keep<00:00:47.480> it<00:00:47.629> right<00:00:47.809> below<00:00:48.170> 5<00:00:49.030> mids<00:00:50.590> you<00:00:51.590> know<00:00:51.710> for

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
keep it right below 5 mids you know for

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.520 
keep it right below 5 mids you know for
7480<00:00:53.150> whatever<00:00:53.570> you<00:00:53.720> want<00:00:54.050> to<00:00:54.110> do<00:00:54.230> this<00:00:54.350> is

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
what I really like and I think sounds

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.960 
what I really like and I think sounds
good<00:00:56.810> treble<00:00:57.770> keep<00:00:58.220> it<00:00:58.340> around<00:00:59.200> 6-7<00:01:00.200> with<00:01:00.970> the

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
good treble keep it around 6-7 with the

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.130 
good treble keep it around 6-7 with the
treble<00:01:02.360> boost<00:01:02.570> on<00:01:03.009> and<00:01:04.840> those<00:01:05.840> are<00:01:05.869> my

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
treble boost on and those are my

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.430 
treble boost on and those are my
settings<00:01:07.330> for<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.420> main<00:01:08.630> for<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:08.990> amplifier

I don't get involved in like page 2 or
all<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:12.619> speakers<00:01:13.040> and<00:01:13.190> stuff<00:01:13.280> like<00:01:13.399> you<00:01:13.790> can

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
all the speakers and stuff like you can

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.810 
all the speakers and stuff like you can
do<00:01:14.180> a<00:01:14.210> bunch<00:01:14.509> of<00:01:14.630> stuff<00:01:14.990> if<00:01:15.200> you<00:01:15.350> want<00:01:15.619> but<00:01:15.860> it's

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
do a bunch of stuff if you want but it's

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.030 
do a bunch of stuff if you want but it's
very<00:01:17.090> I<00:01:17.420> like<00:01:17.630> to<00:01:17.750> keep<00:01:17.899> it<00:01:18.020> very<00:01:18.200> basic<00:01:18.770> when

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
very I like to keep it very basic when

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.169 
very I like to keep it very basic when
it<00:01:19.160> comes<00:01:19.340> down<00:01:19.550> to<00:01:20.080> amplifiers<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:22.340> here<00:01:23.060> we

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:23.179 
it comes down to amplifiers and here we

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:28.800 
it comes down to amplifiers and here we
go<00:01:23.209> if<00:01:23.450> you<00:01:23.539> scroll<00:01:24.500> in<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:26.380> cabinet<00:01:27.380> right<00:01:27.770> here

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
go if you scroll in a cabinet right here

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.180 
go if you scroll in a cabinet right here
I'm<00:01:29.810> running<00:01:30.140> it<00:01:30.350> through<00:01:30.410> a<00:01:31.060> 212<00:01:32.060> orange<00:01:33.190> but

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
I'm running it through a 212 orange but

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.350 
I'm running it through a 212 orange but
using<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.149> the<00:01:35.720> cab<00:01:35.990> model<00:01:36.530> built<00:01:37.490> in<00:01:37.700> it

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
using the the cab model built in it

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.240 
using the the cab model built in it
sounds<00:01:38.869> better<00:01:39.050> for<00:01:39.380> some<00:01:39.560> reason<00:01:39.950> when<00:01:40.130> it's

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
sounds better for some reason when it's

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.820 
sounds better for some reason when it's
off<00:01:40.520> it<00:01:40.850> sounds<00:01:41.479> very<00:01:41.720> thin<00:01:42.259> and<00:01:42.530> very<00:01:43.810> like

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
off it sounds very thin and very like

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.559 
off it sounds very thin and very like
over<00:01:45.830> distorted<00:01:46.459> but<00:01:46.759> when<00:01:46.910> you<00:01:47.000> turn<00:01:47.360> it<00:01:47.390> on

00:01:47.559 --> 00:01:47.569 
over distorted but when you turn it on

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:49.660 
over distorted but when you turn it on
for<00:01:47.810> some<00:01:47.990> reason<00:01:48.229> it<00:01:48.289> just<00:01:48.349> it<00:01:48.920> makes<00:01:49.280> it<00:01:49.520> like

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
for some reason it just it makes it like

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.240 
for some reason it just it makes it like
much<00:01:50.090> fuller<00:01:50.450> and<00:01:50.780> you<00:01:51.440> get<00:01:51.619> like<00:01:51.800> that<00:01:51.950> full

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
much fuller and you get like that full

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.230 
much fuller and you get like that full
sound<00:01:52.580> and<00:01:52.899> I'm<00:01:53.899> just<00:01:54.170> using<00:01:54.380> the<00:01:55.130> 412<00:01:55.700> orange

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
how I get my sound that you know varies

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.089 
how I get my sound that you know varies
in<00:02:07.869> recordings<00:02:08.869> i'll<00:02:09.110> do<00:02:09.289> i'll<00:02:09.440> use<00:02:09.649> different

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
in recordings i'll do i'll use different

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.190 
in recordings i'll do i'll use different
mics<00:02:10.369> or<00:02:10.700> just<00:02:11.390> won't<00:02:11.540> even<00:02:11.660> use<00:02:11.780> them<00:02:12.080> like

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
mics or just won't even use them like

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
just

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.400 
just
you<00:02:19.300> know<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:19.450> blend<00:02:19.810> them<00:02:19.960> in<00:02:20.080> yourself<00:02:20.880> but

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
you know you blend them in yourself but

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.770 
you know you blend them in yourself but
through<00:02:23.410> that<00:02:23.620> I<00:02:23.920> have<00:02:24.760> it<00:02:24.970> going<00:02:25.420> through

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
through that I have it going through

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.840 
through that I have it going through
reverb<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:26.920> delay<00:02:27.700> and<00:02:28.680> reverb<00:02:29.680> I<00:02:30.130> use<00:02:30.370> small

more<00:02:47.350> thickness<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:48.120> don't<00:02:49.120> usually<00:02:49.510> like<00:02:49.840> to

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:49.960 
more thickness I don't usually like to

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.100 
more thickness I don't usually like to
use<00:02:50.080> a<00:02:50.110> lot<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.470> delay<00:02:51.250> when<00:02:51.870> I'm<00:02:52.870> playing

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
use a lot of delay when I'm playing

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.110 
use a lot of delay when I'm playing
because<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.710> just<00:02:53.830> I'll<00:02:54.130> find<00:02:54.610> that<00:02:54.820> like<00:02:54.970> if

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
because it just I'll find that like if

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.290 
because it just I'll find that like if
you're<00:02:55.270> playing<00:02:55.450> neoclassical<00:02:56.410> really<00:02:56.680> fast

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
you're playing neoclassical really fast

the notes well just it double or triple

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.180 
the notes well just it double or triple
and<00:03:01.600> it<00:03:01.660> will<00:03:01.780> sound<00:03:01.990> like<00:03:02.230> a<00:03:02.260> total<00:03:02.500> mess<00:03:02.860> and

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
and it will sound like a total mess and

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.100 
and it will sound like a total mess and
it's<00:03:03.310> not<00:03:03.520> clean<00:03:03.940> and<00:03:04.180> it's<00:03:04.300> not<00:03:04.510> cool<00:03:04.840> at<00:03:05.080> all

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
it's not clean and it's not cool at all

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
you know using your max effects to you

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.170 
you know using your max effects to you
can<00:03:49.870> get<00:03:50.080> it<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.290> sound<00:03:50.500> so<00:03:50.769> it's<00:03:50.920> not<00:03:51.180> to

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
can get it to sound so it's not to

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.750 
can get it to sound so it's not to
treble<00:03:52.600> heaven<00:03:52.989> it<00:03:53.140> just<00:03:53.320> sounds<00:03:53.760> pretty

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
treble heaven it just sounds pretty
