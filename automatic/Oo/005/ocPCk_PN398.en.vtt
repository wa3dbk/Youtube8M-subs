00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
I know so my first one is to wake up at

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.229

the same time each day and basically

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.090 
the same time each day and basically
this<00:00:54.390> will<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:54.989> your<00:00:55.170> body<00:00:55.410> develop<00:00:56.039> a
