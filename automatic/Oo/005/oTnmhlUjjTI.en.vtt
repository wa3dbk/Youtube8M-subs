00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
whenever you wanna fall you know and

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.690 
whenever you wanna fall you know and
look<00:03:32.430> not<00:03:33.180> more<00:03:33.390> higher<00:03:33.690> than<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.760> six<00:03:35.760> is<00:03:36.060> I

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
look not more higher than the six is I

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.820 
look not more higher than the six is I
haven't<00:03:38.700> found<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.209> way<00:03:39.240> to<00:03:39.420> stop<00:03:39.840> usual<00:03:40.530> normal

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
haven't found a way to stop usual normal

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.190 
haven't found a way to stop usual normal
to<00:03:41.070> the<00:03:41.370> 16<00:03:41.790> really<00:03:42.180> decent<00:03:42.450> why<00:03:42.840> would<00:03:43.080> you

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
to the 16 really decent why would you

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.949 
to the 16 really decent why would you
probably<00:03:43.680> one<00:03:44.010> it's<00:03:44.610> around<00:03:45.180> ten<00:03:45.540> percent

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
probably one it's around ten percent

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.310 
probably one it's around ten percent
chance<00:03:46.230> of<00:03:46.560> being<00:03:47.100> right<00:03:47.459> egg<00:03:47.760> forever<00:03:48.330> or<00:03:49.050> say

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
chance of being right egg forever or say

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.920 
chance of being right egg forever or say
so<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.970> smell<00:03:51.300> again<00:03:51.600> just<00:03:51.930> as<00:03:52.110> last<00:03:52.380> time

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
so the smell again just as last time

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:02.479 
so the smell again just as last time
norma<00:03:54.930> three<00:03:58.940> orbitals<00:04:00.380> there<00:04:01.380> yeah<00:04:02.100> that's

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
norma three orbitals there yeah that's

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.940 
norma three orbitals there yeah that's
pretty<00:04:02.790> much<00:04:02.880> a<00:04:03.000> long<00:04:03.270> show<00:04:03.630> you<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:04.110> you<00:04:04.800> can

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
pretty much a long show you and you can

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.100 
pretty much a long show you and you can
do<00:04:05.130> a<00:04:05.400> no<00:04:05.760> effect<00:04:06.150> you<00:04:06.360> want<00:04:06.540> a<00:04:06.690> lot<00:04:06.930> of<00:04:06.959> money
