00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.260 
which is why I continue to use it it
says<00:01:46.869> it<00:01:47.050> has<00:01:47.170> shine<00:01:47.440> control<00:01:47.890> so<00:01:48.130> I<00:01:48.369> mean<00:01:49.150> I<00:01:49.210> do

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
says it has shine control so I mean I do

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.900 
says it has shine control so I mean I do
get<00:01:49.570> oily<00:01:50.020> throughout<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.770> day<00:01:50.950> but<00:01:51.369> not<00:01:51.640> as

only difference between this and the
regular<00:02:06.910> one<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.930> just<00:02:08.289> really<00:02:08.590> love<00:02:08.770> this

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
regular one I just really love this

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.310 
regular one I just really love this
formula<00:02:09.520> I<00:02:09.640> think<00:02:09.880> it<00:02:10.000> works<00:02:10.209> great<00:02:10.570> I've<00:02:11.110> been

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
formula I think it works great I've been

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.650 
formula I think it works great I've been
using<00:02:11.530> this<00:02:11.739> mascara<00:02:12.250> since<00:02:12.640> I<00:02:12.820> was<00:02:13.150> in<00:02:13.180> high

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
using this mascara since I was in high

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.280 
using this mascara since I was in high
school<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:15.310> just<00:02:16.150> think<00:02:16.540> it's<00:02:16.660> really<00:02:16.840> good<00:02:17.110> for

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
school I just think it's really good for

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.290 
school I just think it's really good for
the<00:02:17.380> price<00:02:17.590> it's<00:02:17.860> like<00:02:18.040> five<00:02:18.280> six<00:02:18.670> dollars<00:02:19.120> I

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
the price it's like five six dollars I

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
the price it's like five six dollars I
honestly<00:02:20.230> like<00:02:21.150> drugstore<00:02:22.150> mascaras<00:02:22.720> better

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
honestly like drugstore mascaras better

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.350 
honestly like drugstore mascaras better
than<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.980> more<00:02:24.220> expensive<00:02:24.580> brands<00:02:25.180> of

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
than the more expensive brands of

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.090 
than the more expensive brands of
mascaras<00:02:25.959> I<00:02:26.049> just<00:02:26.290> think<00:02:26.500> they<00:02:26.650> work<00:02:26.890> better

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
mascaras I just think they work better

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.680 
mascaras I just think they work better
they<00:02:27.850> are<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.180> better<00:02:28.450> price<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:30.690> especially

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
they are a better price and especially

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.960 
they are a better price and especially
since<00:02:32.110> your<00:02:32.260> mascara<00:02:32.739> tends<00:02:33.010> to<00:02:33.280> dry<00:02:33.760> up

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
since your mascara tends to dry up

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.210 
since your mascara tends to dry up
faster<00:02:34.660> than<00:02:34.690> other<00:02:35.049> your<00:02:35.650> other<00:02:35.830> makeup

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
faster than other your other makeup

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.920 
faster than other your other makeup
products<00:02:36.640> I<00:02:36.730> just<00:02:37.180> think<00:02:37.360> it's<00:02:37.480> worth<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.900> to

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
products I just think it's worth it to

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.640 
products I just think it's worth it to
buy<00:02:38.230> drugstore<00:02:39.190> mascara<00:02:39.610> rather<00:02:39.970> than<00:02:40.650> more

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
buy drugstore mascara rather than more

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.229 
buy drugstore mascara rather than more
expensive<00:02:42.070> brands<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:42.519> just<00:02:42.790> think<00:02:42.910> they<00:02:43.060> work

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
expensive brands I just think they work

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.390 
expensive brands I just think they work
better<00:02:43.420> so<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.320> then<00:02:44.500> another<00:02:44.739> mascara<00:02:45.250> that

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
better so and then another mascara that

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.610 
better so and then another mascara that
I<00:02:45.549> really<00:02:45.880> like<00:02:46.060> is<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.330> NYC<00:02:48.299> lengthening

dark which is what I like and it did

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.340 
dark which is what I like and it did
take<00:04:18.940> me<00:04:18.970> a<00:04:19.150> little<00:04:19.359> while<00:04:19.450> it<00:04:19.810> does<00:04:19.959> have<00:04:20.169> like

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
take me a little while it does have like

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.120 
take me a little while it does have like
a<00:04:20.380> long<00:04:20.970> handle<00:04:21.970> to<00:04:22.450> it<00:04:22.600> it<00:04:23.530> has<00:04:23.680> like<00:04:23.830> a<00:04:23.860> brush

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
a long handle to it it has like a brush

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.210 
a long handle to it it has like a brush
tip<00:04:24.490> it<00:04:25.090> did<00:04:25.720> take<00:04:25.930> me<00:04:25.960> a<00:04:26.140> little<00:04:26.350> while<00:04:26.470> to<00:04:27.040> get

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
tip it did take me a little while to get

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.150 
tip it did take me a little while to get
used<00:04:27.460> to<00:04:27.639> that<00:04:27.790> long<00:04:28.060> handle<00:04:28.600> because<00:04:29.380> you<00:04:29.950> do

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
used to that long handle because you do

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.750 
used to that long handle because you do
have<00:04:30.190> a<00:04:30.370> little<00:04:30.580> less<00:04:31.229> less<00:04:32.229> control<00:04:32.830> with<00:04:33.550> it

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
have a little less less control with it

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.150 
have a little less less control with it
but<00:04:34.120> you<00:04:34.930> get<00:04:35.080> used<00:04:35.290> to<00:04:35.410> it<00:04:35.470> once<00:04:35.770> you<00:04:35.919> start

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
but you get used to it once you start

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.890 
but you get used to it once you start
using<00:04:36.280> it<00:04:36.520> more<00:04:36.580> and<00:04:36.820> more<00:04:36.970> so<00:04:37.600> that's<00:04:37.780> a

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
using it more and more so that's a

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.420 
using it more and more so that's a
really<00:04:38.140> and<00:04:38.320> the<00:04:38.380> next<00:04:38.560> one<00:04:38.740> I<00:04:38.770> have<00:04:39.010> is<00:04:39.220> wet

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
really and the next one I have is wet

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.320 
really and the next one I have is wet
and<00:04:39.460> wild<00:04:39.669> mega<00:04:40.090> liner<00:04:40.530> um<00:04:41.580> this<00:04:42.580> is<00:04:42.880> I<00:04:42.910> mean

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
and wild mega liner um this is I mean

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.060 
and wild mega liner um this is I mean
this<00:04:43.540> is<00:04:43.750> like<00:04:43.780> two<00:04:44.169> dollars<00:04:44.560> you<00:04:44.800> can<00:04:44.979> even

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
this is like two dollars you can even

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.850 
this is like two dollars you can even
probably<00:04:45.640> find<00:04:45.850> it<00:04:45.970> for<00:04:46.210> a<00:04:46.240> dollar<00:04:46.710> but<00:04:47.710> it's

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
probably find it for a dollar but it's

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.590 
probably find it for a dollar but it's
really<00:04:48.160> good<00:04:48.430> especially<00:04:48.580> I<00:04:49.090> mean<00:04:49.360> come<00:04:49.570> on

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
really good especially I mean come on

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.080 
really good especially I mean come on
especially<00:04:50.350> for<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.620> price<00:04:50.740> it's<00:04:51.520> really<00:04:52.000> an

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 
especially for the price it's really an

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:53.969 
especially for the price it's really an
intense<00:04:52.479> black<00:04:52.840> which<00:04:53.110> is<00:04:53.289> what<00:04:53.500> I<00:04:53.530> like<00:04:53.740> most

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979 
intense black which is what I like most

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:57.060 
intense black which is what I like most
about<00:04:54.220> it<00:04:54.580> it's<00:04:54.840> not<00:04:55.840> waterproof<00:04:56.229> but<00:04:56.470> it<00:04:56.860> does

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
about it it's not waterproof but it does

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.540 
about it it's not waterproof but it does
last<00:04:57.370> long<00:04:57.640> and<00:04:57.880> it<00:04:58.750> has<00:04:58.900> this<00:04:59.050> little<00:04:59.550> little

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:00.550 
last long and it has this little little

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.450 
last long and it has this little little
brush<00:05:00.880> tip<00:05:01.180> so<00:05:01.630> it's<00:05:01.780> super<00:05:02.110> thin<00:05:02.380> I<00:05:02.620> like<00:05:03.220> that

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
brush tip so it's super thin I like that

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.730 
brush tip so it's super thin I like that
but<00:05:04.120> the<00:05:04.360> only<00:05:04.510> thing<00:05:04.600> with<00:05:04.870> this<00:05:04.990> is<00:05:05.050> if<00:05:05.440> you

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
but the only thing with this is if you

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.100 
but the only thing with this is if you
do<00:05:05.979> keep<00:05:06.250> building<00:05:06.550> on<00:05:06.850> the<00:05:07.000> color<00:05:07.210> keep<00:05:07.870> going

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
do keep building on the color keep going

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.140 
do keep building on the color keep going
over<00:05:08.260> and<00:05:08.410> over<00:05:08.590> with<00:05:09.039> it<00:05:09.220> it<00:05:09.460> will<00:05:09.760> start<00:05:10.060> to

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
over and over with it it will start to

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.850 
over and over with it it will start to
look<00:05:10.330> a<00:05:10.479> little<00:05:10.570> cakey<00:05:11.110> so<00:05:11.380> that's<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.680> only

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
look a little cakey so that's the only

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.640 
look a little cakey so that's the only
thing<00:05:11.979> I<00:05:12.100> don't<00:05:12.160> like<00:05:12.430> but<00:05:13.090> it<00:05:13.240> does<00:05:13.570> work<00:05:13.930> good

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
thing I don't like but it does work good

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.740 
thing I don't like but it does work good
and<00:05:14.919> for<00:05:15.100> the<00:05:15.130> price<00:05:15.310> you<00:05:15.669> can't<00:05:15.970> beat<00:05:16.180> it<00:05:16.210> it

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:16.750 
and for the price you can't beat it it

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.090 
and for the price you can't beat it it
works<00:05:17.050> really<00:05:17.140> good<00:05:17.380> and<00:05:17.530> the<00:05:17.590> next<00:05:17.830> thing<00:05:17.979> i
