00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Not 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:23.280
 we had 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.340
 wise people right because so white from Meinhard Miegel, for example, in the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.949
 Last 30 years, a fixed 50 times 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.120
 the amount of money experienced and only a quadrupling of the first real 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.580
 Freight transport is the real Michler and products behind it 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.810
 Since Iran does not understand its numbers I have no other advice 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.040
 the EKD 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.210
 "It goes without saying that there is no need for a gap now 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.740
 this discussion are not included 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.350
 agree that is self-declared I am now no regulation 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.350
 given these discussions 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.630
 Sarah are old 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.770
 Year what you called the leverage, so to speak 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.090
 and what we saw through different ones 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.000
 injured Danzig also in Germany but also in other parts of the world 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.470
 but suddenly found that rather culprits 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.980
 rather it levels in this system 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.980
 that was actually built more than two house of cards that you probably 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.310
 in the dimension and valued 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.829
 second, that the ones you know are distributed in Kobar, the transparency in 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.270
 the risks were very small 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.400
 and that many have taken in by the way the BDK Peter Nestler 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.280
 tighten more 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.180
 and then you have certainly seen too little 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.880
 that actually lives the regulated banking system 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.310
 a round of regulated percent 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.579
 In conclusion, the test creates a wavering system that exists away from one 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.580
 Magnitude that will exceed a talent expectation 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.879
 on 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:48.449
 long 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:18.949
 on the 9th 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.659
 produces real products to a certain extent 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:26.209
 but has critics around expectations hostages 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.209
 Francioni set on speculation and in the end it has none at all 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.429
 Grounding had more 

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:34.429
 and that has to be merged 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.129
 and that needs to be merged and that will lead to that in part 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.380
 also have to accept that some economic growth 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.859
 not so done 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.459
 because they have lived to learn more about our circumstances 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.649
 it has been adopted as a kind of future pact and has done so 

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:17.649
 Partners already spend the money 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.790

 Annual salary works out at 24 big fund my first bonus was 40 000 pounds 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:36.509
 my father worked hard as a deputy, his salary was around 50

 Roads drove 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.030
 August falls to the ground I earned nearly as much in my first year 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.350
 like my dad sorry my last salary was 120 hit south and the bonus was at 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.729
 500000 Fund 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.560
 together at that time 800,000 euros Persson and Esther mobile measures only steeply upwards 

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:55.559
 because this Karlsfeld country holster 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.930
 and now it's about bringing this together again 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.100
 That is what you get with the speculations that are going on 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.720
 you have to secure and in the moment where you need to hedge you can 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.660
 not going to take such big steps anymore just the whole thing 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.370

 ddp cause that the air way was chosen that they one 

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:25.419
 fragmented banking supervision 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:29.440
 who will take care of this directly after the federal elections he dares 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:32.889
 fragmented banking supervision again a more concentrated 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:34.370
 a punchier one 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:38.790
