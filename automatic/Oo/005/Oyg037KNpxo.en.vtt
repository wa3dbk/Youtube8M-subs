00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
something you know what's the point of

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.470 
something you know what's the point of
hitting<00:05:10.620> it<00:05:10.800> if<00:05:10.890> you<00:05:10.980> just<00:05:11.160> die<00:05:11.370> I<00:05:11.700> think<00:05:12.240> that

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:12.480 
hitting it if you just die I think that

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.020 
hitting it if you just die I think that
all<00:05:12.720> of<00:05:13.350> the<00:05:13.530> dolls<00:05:13.740> and<00:05:13.890> players<00:05:14.160> did<00:05:14.700> not

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
all of the dolls and players did not

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:21.650 
all of the dolls and players did not
voice<00:05:15.480> their<00:05:15.810> opinion<00:05:16.430> yeah<00:05:20.210> he<00:05:21.210> needs<00:05:21.450> that

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
voice their opinion yeah he needs that

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.870 
voice their opinion yeah he needs that
like<00:05:21.930> otherwise<00:05:22.920> that's<00:05:23.250> a<00:05:23.310> move<00:05:23.520> that<00:05:23.730> just

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
like otherwise that's a move that just

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.610 
like otherwise that's a move that just
kills<00:05:24.180> him<00:05:24.330> so<00:05:24.480> it's<00:05:24.660> like<00:05:24.810> a<00:05:24.840> disadvantage<00:05:25.500> at

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
kills him so it's like a disadvantage at

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.630 
kills him so it's like a disadvantage at
some<00:05:25.770> point<00:05:26.990> well<00:05:27.990> just<00:05:28.380> my<00:05:28.500> sense<00:05:28.830> gets<00:05:29.370> sent
