00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:20.110
 colored leaves or wrapping paper 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:22.980
 pencil ruler scissors 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.720
 I feel double face or glue in bar 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.610
 a button 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:34.210
 material to decorate 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.210
 and of course our paper bag 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.320
 let's use a gift bag 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.570
 It can be cardboard or paper if not 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.469
 you find in no stationery or store 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.930
 as a gift 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.150
 you can make your own bag as 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.580
 is 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:55.070
 in one of the last tutorials you 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.590
 taught how to make these kinds of sachets 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.900
 If you want to learn how to do it, you can give 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.500
 click on the screen to see the 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.710
 tutorial 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.710
 I'm going to use this white bag myself 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.350
 I made it with a sheet of machine what 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.440
 first thing we're going to do is leave in a 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.690
 side our bag and let's take a 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.820
 sheet of color machine or paper of 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.670
 gift also remember that you can 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.729
 use all scraps of paper that 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.940
 have you been left of other crafts to 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.520
 I like this green color so I'm going 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.150
 to use it and we're going to take our 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:36.940
 ruler and our pencil 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:42.430
 and let's draw two strips one of 15 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:44.980
 centimeters by 2 centimeters like that and 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.460
 let's mark another 15 strip 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:51.460
 centimeters long by 1 centimeter of 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.070
 wide and we're going to cut them up to 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.950
 now we must have two strips one 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.830
 of 15 centimeters by 2 centimeters and 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.550
 another 15 centimeters by one centimeter 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:06.040
 these measures will surely vary 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:09.490
 according to the size of your bag this 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.720
 bag that I am using measures 9.5 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.310
 centimeters by 15 points 5 centimeters 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.620
 there are some bags that are much more 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.570
 large or smaller depending on how the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.550
 you need 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:25.360
 but if you're going to make your own bag 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.750
 with a machine sheet the size plus or 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.780
 less is going to be equal to mine 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:33.240
 ok then these strips can you make them 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.790
 longer, shorter, longer 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.660
 thin as you like them so 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:42.540
 soon we will take the widest strip 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.760
 ie which it is 2 centimeters this 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.140
 we're going to leave it for a moment and what 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.900
 let's paste as follows 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.200
 we're going to need glue you can 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.230
 use double-sided glue tape 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.930
 in silicone liquid silicone bar 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.420
 hot or what you like most we are going to 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.239
 take the strip like this and we're going to 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.560
 make this figure as if we were 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:09.220
 forming a circle 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.160
 but we're going to paste it only from the 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.150
 shores 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:18.420
 thus leaving an opening like this one a 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.500
 little bit like that 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:26.670
 to form the collar of the shirt like this 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.580
 now let's put the strip of this 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.940
 way and we fold until now 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.430
 we will have this figure this is going to be the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.800
 shirt collar we are going to put 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.530
 glue in this part for the part of 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:44.160
 back and we 're going to stick it on the edge of 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:47.459
 the bag like that and our bag up 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.160
 right now it will look like this if you notice this already 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.319
 the shirt with the collar appears 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:55.080
 now let's take the thinnest strip 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:58.260
 the one that we made 15 centimeters for a 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.930
 centimeter wide is we're going to 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:05.040
 paste as follows we will 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.860
 paste it below the neck like this 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.480
 down and what you dismiss you can fold it 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:13.350
 in the bottom part or you can 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.260
 cut and our bag will look like this now 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:19.889
 missing the last details you can 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.590
 use a button and stick it here in 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.180
 the part of the neck where the 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.370
 two corners of the strip 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:31.259
 and in this part you can also put 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:34.590
 smaller buttons and that's how it's like 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:38.520
 the completed and decorated bag appears 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:41.100
 I used a button here to put it on 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.900
 in the collar of the shirt in this part 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.400
 on the strip where the shirt is closed 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.770
 I used some balls of these paper and 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.500
 I made them with the drill here in this 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.350
 part of above I put a small pocket 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.860
 of the same paper that you use here in the 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:02.400
 neck and the truth looks super beautiful 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.840
 This ideal bag for a cup in your day or 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.300
 not only father's day but in his 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.970
 birthday or you can also give away sela 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:12.479
 tuna or here in the back I put 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.729
 a card here you can write the 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:18.060
 dedication to the congratulations or 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:21.000
 even here behind the bag or less the 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:25.810
 and the rest runs through your imagination and 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.090
 Finally, only the gift remains 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:30.580

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.370
 of chocolates I do not know what you can think 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.740
 and this is a simple but super way 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:39.130
 original to decorate a bag of 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:42.610
