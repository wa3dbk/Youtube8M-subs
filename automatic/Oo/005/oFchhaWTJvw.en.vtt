00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
I mean all they really have to do is

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.339 
I mean all they really have to do is
turn<00:04:17.849> the<00:04:18.030> graphic<00:04:18.389> settings<00:04:18.570> down<00:04:18.840> and<00:04:19.169> in

turn the graphic settings down and in

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.259 
turn the graphic settings down and in
the<00:04:19.440> PC<00:04:19.799> world<00:04:19.949> they<00:04:20.190> manage<00:04:20.519> this<00:04:20.729> just<00:04:21.060> fine

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
the PC world they manage this just fine

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.240 
the PC world they manage this just fine
right<00:04:21.630> in<00:04:21.779> the<00:04:21.870> PC<00:04:22.169> world<00:04:22.320> you<00:04:22.800> can<00:04:22.979> set<00:04:23.130> it<00:04:23.159> to

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
right in the PC world you can set it to

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.550 
right in the PC world you can set it to
medium<00:04:23.490> high<00:04:23.880> ultra<00:04:24.389> high<00:04:24.570> or<00:04:24.930> whatever<00:04:25.349> and

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
medium high ultra high or whatever and

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.990 
medium high ultra high or whatever and
they<00:04:25.680> handle<00:04:26.010> all<00:04:26.159> different<00:04:26.580> levels

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
they handle all different levels

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.750 
they handle all different levels
graphics<00:04:27.390> graphics<00:04:27.870> processing<00:04:28.800> power<00:04:29.070> so

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
graphics graphics processing power so

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.940 
graphics graphics processing power so
why<00:04:30.210> they<00:04:30.390> couldn't<00:04:30.630> do<00:04:30.810> that<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.170> have<00:04:31.290> a<00:04:31.350> 360

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
why they couldn't do that and have a 360

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.400 
why they couldn't do that and have a 360
and<00:04:32.190> a<00:04:32.250> 720<00:04:32.910> version<00:04:33.330> you<00:04:34.020> know<00:04:34.110> would<00:04:34.290> be
