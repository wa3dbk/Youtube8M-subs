00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069 
games these have been shown to improve

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.700 
games these have been shown to improve
our<00:04:38.490> overall<00:04:38.669> mental<00:04:39.150> flexibility<00:04:40.080> and<00:04:40.319> also

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
our overall mental flexibility and also

our overall mental flexibility and also
executive<00:04:41.639> functions<00:04:42.800> so<00:04:43.800> what<00:04:43.949> does<00:04:44.039> that

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
executive functions so what does that

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:44.450 
executive functions so what does that
mean

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
mean

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.520 
mean
well<00:04:44.759> it's<00:04:44.910> basically<00:04:45.120> our<00:04:45.449> ability<00:04:46.110> to<00:04:46.289> think

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
well it's basically our ability to think

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.040 
well it's basically our ability to think
on<00:04:46.740> our<00:04:46.800> feet<00:04:47.009> to<00:04:47.880> quickly<00:04:48.090> problem-solve<00:04:48.870> and

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
on our feet to quickly problem-solve and

puzzler cut the rope and the research

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.540 
puzzler cut the rope and the research
demonstrated<00:04:58.319> that<00:04:58.500> it<00:04:58.650> took<00:04:58.860> as<00:04:59.039> little<00:04:59.430> as

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
demonstrated that it took as little as

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.760 
demonstrated that it took as little as
an<00:04:59.669> hour<00:04:59.880> a<00:05:00.060> day<00:05:00.180> of<00:05:00.599> gaming<00:05:00.990> to<00:05:01.470> get<00:05:01.650> the

an hour a day of gaming to get the

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.070 
an hour a day of gaming to get the

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
improvements so how exactly did the

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.559 
improvements so how exactly did the

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
weeks of gaming were over all test

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.399 
weeks of gaming were over all test
subjects<00:05:17.940> then<00:05:18.150> took<00:05:18.389> part<00:05:18.720> in<00:05:18.930> a<00:05:19.020> number<00:05:19.319> of

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:21.439 
subjects then took part in a number of
tests<00:05:19.979> the<00:05:20.340> results<00:05:20.729> showed<00:05:20.909> that<00:05:21.180> players

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
tests the results showed that players

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:22.909 
tests the results showed that players
have<00:05:21.659> cut<00:05:21.840> the<00:05:21.960> rope<00:05:22.139> could<00:05:22.349> switch<00:05:22.680> between

have cut the rope could switch between

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:26.779 
have cut the rope could switch between
tasks<00:05:23.630> 33%<00:05:24.630> faster<00:05:24.840> were<00:05:25.590> 30%<00:05:26.280> faster<00:05:26.490> in

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
tasks 33% faster were 30% faster in

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.570 
tasks 33% faster were 30% faster in
adapting<00:05:27.270> to<00:05:27.360> new<00:05:27.389> situations<00:05:27.690> and<00:05:28.580> 60%

adapting to new situations and 60%

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.969 
adapting to new situations and 60%
better<00:05:30.060> in<00:05:30.389> blocking<00:05:31.080> out<00:05:31.199> distractions<00:05:31.229> and

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979 
better in blocking out distractions and

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.040 
better in blocking out distractions and
focusing<00:05:32.490> on<00:05:32.580> the<00:05:32.669> tasks<00:05:33.060> at<00:05:33.180> hand<00:05:33.210> than

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
focusing on the tasks at hand than

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.620 
focusing on the tasks at hand than
before<00:05:34.500> training<00:05:34.860> so<00:05:35.550> how<00:05:35.880> could<00:05:36.090> games<00:05:36.360> like

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
before training so how could games like

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:38.240 
before training so how could games like
Cut<00:05:36.810> the<00:05:36.840> Rope<00:05:36.930> actually<00:05:37.289> help<00:05:37.830> with<00:05:38.039> this

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
Cut the Rope actually help with this

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.219 
Cut the Rope actually help with this
well<00:05:38.820> it's<00:05:39.030> possibly<00:05:39.539> to<00:05:39.719> do<00:05:39.810> with<00:05:39.930> the<00:05:39.990> fact

00:05:40.219 --> 00:05:40.229 
well it's possibly to do with the fact

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:42.320 
well it's possibly to do with the fact
that<00:05:40.349> games<00:05:40.740> like<00:05:41.009> Cut<00:05:41.219> the<00:05:41.250> Rope<00:05:41.340> constantly

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
that games like Cut the Rope constantly
