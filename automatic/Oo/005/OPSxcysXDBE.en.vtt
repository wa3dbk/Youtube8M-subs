00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.710 
topper toys
when<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:15.340> believe<00:02:15.640> like<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.120> late<00:02:16.239> sixties<00:02:16.689> in

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
when I believe like the late sixties in

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.319 
when I believe like the late sixties in
the<00:02:16.870> early<00:02:17.260> seventies<00:02:17.769> it<00:02:18.489> is<00:02:18.610> broken<00:02:19.000> but<00:02:19.269> I

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:19.329 
the early seventies it is broken but I

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:21.030 
the early seventies it is broken but I
only<00:02:19.480> pick<00:02:19.750> that<00:02:19.900> up<00:02:19.930> for<00:02:20.200> like<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:20.349> corridor<00:02:20.799> I

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
only pick that up for like a corridor I

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:29.869 
only pick that up for like a corridor I
think<00:02:23.189> this<00:02:24.189> is<00:02:24.250> pretty<00:02:24.519> neat<00:02:26.099> Sesame<00:02:27.099> Street

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.680 

so<00:02:30.879> it's<00:02:31.000> like<00:02:31.120> a<00:02:31.860> Bert<00:02:32.860> Sesame<00:02:33.670> Street<00:02:33.700> some

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
so it's like a Bert Sesame Street some

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.410 
so it's like a Bert Sesame Street some
