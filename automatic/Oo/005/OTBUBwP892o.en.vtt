is<00:00:08.090> there<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.179> Pixar's<00:00:09.570> 22<00:00:13.490> dead<00:00:14.490> pixels<00:00:16.010> I'm

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
is there the Pixar's 22 dead pixels I'm

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.109 
is there the Pixar's 22 dead pixels I'm
joking<00:00:17.609> it's<00:00:17.730> true<00:00:18.320> ptosis<00:00:19.850> you're<00:00:20.850> such<00:00:21.090> a

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
joking it's true ptosis you're such a

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.480 
joking it's true ptosis you're such a
kidder<00:00:21.449> man<00:00:21.750> i'm<00:00:21.990> such<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> kidder<00:00:22.560> quit

kidder man i'm such a kidder quit
pulling<00:00:23.699> my<00:00:23.880> chain<00:00:24.240> ptosis<00:00:24.810> in<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.529> upper

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
pulling my chain ptosis in the upper

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.179 
pulling my chain ptosis in the upper
right<00:00:26.010> in<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.369> red<00:00:26.550> our<00:00:26.789> Terran<00:00:27.980> Keith<00:00:28.980> you

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
right in the red our Terran Keith you

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.440 
right in the red our Terran Keith you
will<00:00:29.369> third<00:00:29.609> flash<00:00:30.289> by<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.349> way<00:00:31.500> um<00:00:32.120> okay<00:00:33.120> I

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
will third flash by the way um okay I

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.729 
will third flash by the way um okay I
think<00:00:33.630> we<00:00:33.690> can<00:00:33.809> agree<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.050> flash<00:00:34.469> is

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
think we can agree that flash is

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.350 
think we can agree that flash is
actually<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.190> great<00:00:35.610> ID<00:00:36.020> it<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> very<00:00:37.950> good<00:00:38.070> ID

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
actually a great ID it is a very good ID

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.540 
actually a great ID it is a very good ID
RIT<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.480> also<00:00:39.989> great<00:00:40.260> tastes<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.129> our<00:00:41.190> ptosis

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
RIT is also great tastes and our ptosis

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.090 
RIT is also great tastes and our ptosis
can't<00:00:42.180> ask<00:00:42.390> ones<00:00:42.690> well<00:00:43.290> that's<00:00:43.500> really<00:00:43.829> good

weight into it but a lot of people can

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.369 
weight into it but a lot of people can
draw<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.000> star<00:00:51.300> craps<00:00:51.570> yeah<00:00:51.930> that's<00:00:52.140> right

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.400 
draw the star craps yeah that's right
that's<00:00:53.129> true<00:00:53.420> did<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.600> guy<00:00:54.780> draw<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.199> I

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
that's true did that guy draw that I

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.139 
that's true did that guy draw that I
don't<00:00:55.620> know<00:00:55.739> maybe<00:00:56.460> flash<00:00:56.789> make<00:00:57.030> that

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
don't know maybe flash make that

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.330

explosion<00:00:57.510> by<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.750> hot<00:00:57.870> six<00:00:58.109> can<00:00:58.399> whoa<00:01:01.340> we're

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
explosion by the hot six can whoa we're

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.860 
explosion by the hot six can whoa we're
all<00:01:02.430> right<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.640> think<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.910> what<00:01:03.059> other<00:01:03.180> IDs<00:01:03.539> are

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
all right I think of what other IDs are

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.929 
all right I think of what other IDs are
great<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.320> are<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:04.739> gsl<00:01:05.309> specifically

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
great that are in this gsl specifically

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
that's not how we're not here I you want

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.910 
that's not how we're not here I you want
to<00:01:39.450> hear<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.380> thing<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.619> sometimes

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
to hear this the thing is sometimes

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.969 
to hear this the thing is sometimes
players<00:01:41.310> play<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.640> other<00:01:41.939> IDs<00:01:42.240> become<00:01:42.570> better

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
players play so other IDs become better

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.139 
players play so other IDs become better
this<00:01:43.979> is<00:01:44.130> actually<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> true<00:01:44.700> thing<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.000> is

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
Stourport making hell I was gonna say

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.670 
Stourport making hell I was gonna say
he's<00:03:35.940> gonna<00:03:36.480> be<00:03:36.750> mapped<00:03:36.990> out<00:03:37.170> now<00:03:37.380> at<00:03:37.590> this

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
he's gonna be mapped out now at this

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.680 
he's gonna be mapped out now at this
point<00:03:37.920> in<00:03:38.010> time<00:03:38.160> for<00:03:39.000> this<00:03:39.060> page<00:03:39.330> of<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.540> game

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
point in time for this page of the game

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.540 
point in time for this page of the game
at<00:03:39.840> least<00:03:39.990> yeah<00:03:40.740> once<00:03:40.920> you<00:03:40.980> see<00:03:41.160> all<00:03:41.370> the

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
at least yeah once you see all the

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.980 
at least yeah once you see all the
builds<00:03:42.060> that<00:03:42.150> they're<00:03:42.300> actually<00:03:42.570> opening<00:03:42.840> up

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:42.990 
builds that they're actually opening up

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.920 
builds that they're actually opening up
with<00:03:43.230> you<00:03:44.100> know<00:03:44.190> it's<00:03:45.180> pretty<00:03:45.420> obvious<00:03:45.750> what's

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
with you know it's pretty obvious what's

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.199 
with you know it's pretty obvious what's
going<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.110> be<00:03:46.170> coming<00:03:46.320> up<00:03:46.500> next<00:03:46.910> flash<00:03:47.910> has

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
going to be coming up next flash has

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.570 
going to be coming up next flash has
been<00:03:48.450> doing<00:03:48.660> a<00:03:48.780> lot<00:03:49.050> of<00:03:49.110> this<00:03:49.440> like<00:03:49.830> some

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
been doing a lot of this like some

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.550 
been doing a lot of this like some
marines<00:03:50.940> some<00:03:51.630> hellions<00:03:52.020> and<00:03:52.170> a<00:03:52.200> medevac

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
marines some hellions and a medevac

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.760 
marines some hellions and a medevac
we've<00:03:53.310> seen<00:03:53.910> input<00:03:54.840> he<00:03:54.990> puts<00:03:55.200> on<00:03:55.260> like<00:03:55.440> very

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
we've seen input he puts on like very

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.410 
we've seen input he puts on like very
good<00:03:55.950> pressure<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.430> thing<00:03:56.550> is<00:03:56.670> even<00:03:57.090> if<00:03:57.300> the

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
good pressure the thing is even if the

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.350 
good pressure the thing is even if the
pressure<00:03:57.720> doesn't<00:03:58.170> go<00:03:58.740> that<00:03:59.010> well<00:03:59.220> he<00:03:59.940> follows

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
pressure doesn't go that well he follows

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.300 
pressure doesn't go that well he follows
it<00:04:00.390> up<00:04:00.570> with<00:04:00.720> such<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:00.930> solid<00:04:01.350> macro<00:04:01.920> game<00:04:02.100> that

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
it up with such a solid macro game that

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.030 
it up with such a solid macro game that
it<00:04:02.430> really<00:04:02.760> are<00:04:02.910> to<00:04:03.000> stop<00:04:03.240> him<00:04:03.450> now<00:04:03.890> I'll<00:04:04.890> be

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
it really are to stop him now I'll be

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.560 
it really are to stop him now I'll be
interested<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.400> see<00:04:05.580> if<00:04:05.610> his<00:04:06.000> third<00:04:06.240> base<00:04:06.420> if

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
interested to see if his third base if

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.110 
interested to see if his third base if
he<00:04:06.690> takes<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:07.080> base<00:04:07.530> below<00:04:08.100> his<00:04:08.400> main<00:04:08.700> because

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
he takes the base below his main because

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.090 
he takes the base below his main because
I<00:04:09.360> bet<00:04:09.900> he<00:04:09.989> would<00:04:10.200> actually<00:04:10.440> knowing<00:04:10.860> how

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
I bet he would actually knowing how

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.920 
I bet he would actually knowing how
flash<00:04:11.340> plays<00:04:11.670> yeah<00:04:12.120> let's<00:04:12.570> actually<00:04:12.720> talk

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
flash plays yeah let's actually talk

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.870 
flash plays yeah let's actually talk
about<00:04:13.050> Flash<00:04:13.440> play<00:04:13.800> dumb<00:04:14.040> when<00:04:14.430> we<00:04:14.550> were<00:04:14.640> cast

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
about Flash play dumb when we were cast

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.970 
about Flash play dumb when we were cast
him<00:04:15.120> in<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.239> round<00:04:15.420> of<00:04:15.510> 32<00:04:15.630> I<00:04:16.049> mean<00:04:16.470> he<00:04:16.859> was

him in the round of 32 I mean he was

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:18.620 
him in the round of 32 I mean he was
making<00:04:17.250> these<00:04:17.340> armies<00:04:17.700> that<00:04:17.880> just<00:04:18.060> punched

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
making these armies that just punched

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.500 
making these armies that just punched
through<00:04:19.340> the<00:04:20.340> enemy<00:04:20.609> defense<00:04:21.000> yeah<00:04:21.150> he<00:04:21.390> was

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
through the enemy defense yeah he was

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.719 
through the enemy defense yeah he was
and<00:04:21.720> is<00:04:22.229> also<00:04:22.440> he<00:04:22.680> had<00:04:22.800> another<00:04:23.010> style<00:04:23.370> as<00:04:23.520> well

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:23.729 
and is also he had another style as well

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.360 
and is also he had another style as well
where<00:04:24.060> he<00:04:24.390> would<00:04:24.510> sit<00:04:25.350> on<00:04:25.380> the<00:04:25.590> edge<00:04:25.740> of<00:04:26.040> creep

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
where he would sit on the edge of creep

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:27.050 
where he would sit on the edge of creep
mere

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
mere

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.330 
mere
the<00:04:27.150> fourth<00:04:27.450> and<00:04:28.410> you<00:04:28.500> basically<00:04:28.770> always<00:04:29.160> have

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
the fourth and you basically always have

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.590 
the fourth and you basically always have
to<00:04:29.400> be<00:04:29.460> pokin<00:04:29.760> up<00:04:29.850> you<00:04:29.970> would<00:04:30.090> keep<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.389> creep

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
to be pokin up you would keep the creep

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.090 
to be pokin up you would keep the creep
back<00:04:30.810> you<00:04:31.080> make<00:04:31.260> a<00:04:31.290> bunch<00:04:31.530> of<00:04:31.590> hell<00:04:31.740> bats<00:04:31.919> he'd

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
back you make a bunch of hell bats he'd

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.550 
back you make a bunch of hell bats he'd
have<00:04:32.220> his<00:04:32.400> army<00:04:32.850> pre<00:04:33.090> spread<00:04:33.419> it's<00:04:33.810> like<00:04:33.960> very

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
have his army pre spread it's like very

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.400 
have his army pre spread it's like very
hard<00:04:35.490> to<00:04:35.639> engage<00:04:35.790> that<00:04:36.360> it's<00:04:36.750> harder<00:04:37.050> to<00:04:37.080> do<00:04:37.260> on

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
hard to engage that it's harder to do on

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.290 
hard to engage that it's harder to do on
this<00:04:37.620> map<00:04:37.889> and<00:04:38.190> when<00:04:38.730> we<00:04:38.850> saw<00:04:39.000> him<00:04:39.060> do<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:39.180> on

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
this map and when we saw him do it on

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.909 
this map and when we saw him do it on
Nimbus<00:04:39.690> specifically<00:04:40.470> that<00:04:40.560> was<00:04:40.680> the<00:04:40.770> map

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:40.919 
Nimbus specifically that was the map

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:41.960 
Nimbus specifically that was the map
where<00:04:41.040> you<00:04:41.130> get<00:04:41.250> it<00:04:41.280> really<00:04:41.610> we're<00:04:41.790> going<00:04:41.910> to

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
where you get it really we're going to

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.270 
where you get it really we're going to
have<00:04:42.090> a<00:04:42.419> two-pronged<00:04:43.110> attack<00:04:43.290> up<00:04:43.650> here<00:04:43.830> aliens

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
have a two-pronged attack up here aliens

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.580 
have a two-pronged attack up here aliens
coming<00:04:44.490> up<00:04:44.639> to<00:04:44.730> the<00:04:44.820> front<00:04:45.260> this<00:04:46.260> is<00:04:46.380> not<00:04:46.500> going

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
coming up to the front this is not going

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:47.930 
coming up to the front this is not going
to<00:04:46.650> be<00:04:46.740> easy<00:04:46.860> for<00:04:47.100> true<00:04:47.250> to<00:04:47.340> hold<00:04:47.490> by<00:04:47.730> the<00:04:47.760> way

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
to be easy for true to hold by the way

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.550 
to be easy for true to hold by the way
you<00:04:48.300> see<00:04:48.419> the<00:04:48.450> second<00:04:48.840> the<00:04:48.900> third<00:04:48.930> or<00:04:49.260> a<00:04:49.290> bit

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
you see the second the third or a bit

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.260 
you see the second the third or a bit
separated<00:04:50.040> there's<00:04:50.880> lots<00:04:51.090> of<00:04:51.210> different

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
separated there's lots of different

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.150 
separated there's lots of different
angles<00:04:51.660> that<00:04:51.750> can<00:04:51.900> come<00:04:52.350> into<00:04:52.530> here<00:04:52.919> you<00:04:53.070> know

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
angles that can come into here you know

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.470 
angles that can come into here you know
you<00:04:53.310> might<00:04:53.460> just<00:04:53.669> put<00:04:54.030> them<00:04:54.150> all<00:04:54.300> together

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
you might just put them all together

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.760 
you might just put them all together
because<00:04:54.840> these<00:04:54.930> are<00:04:55.080> about<00:04:55.230> to<00:04:55.350> be<00:04:55.410> hell<00:04:55.560> bats

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
because these are about to be hell bats

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.670 
because these are about to be hell bats
oh<00:04:56.090> my<00:04:57.090> eyes<00:04:57.360> actually<00:04:57.600> enclosed<00:04:58.110> banshees<00:04:58.560> as

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
that was actually the series is more

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.000 
that was actually the series is more
complicated<00:05:55.200> than<00:05:55.530> it<00:05:55.620> might<00:05:55.740> have<00:05:55.800> looked

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
complicated than it might have looked

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.909 
complicated than it might have looked
that<00:05:57.000> was<00:05:57.150> not<00:05:57.300> simply<00:05:57.660> him<00:05:57.990> a<00:05:58.020> setting<00:05:58.740> stuff

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
that was not simply him a setting stuff

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:00.920 
that was not simply him a setting stuff
down<00:05:59.130> there<00:05:59.220> was<00:05:59.430> a<00:05:59.490> lot<00:05:59.610> of<00:05:59.639> things<00:05:59.940> he<00:06:00.780> did

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
down there was a lot of things he did

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.270 
down there was a lot of things he did
that<00:06:01.050> were<00:06:01.110> subtle<00:06:01.440> there<00:06:01.590> he<00:06:01.740> loaded<00:06:02.070> up<00:06:02.250> the

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 
that were subtle there he loaded up the

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.670 
that were subtle there he loaded up the
medevac<00:06:02.820> went<00:06:03.630> to<00:06:03.690> the<00:06:03.810> front<00:06:03.990> and<00:06:04.260> then<00:06:04.410> said

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 
medevac went to the front and then said

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.830 
medevac went to the front and then said
okay<00:06:04.919> I'm<00:06:04.979> actually<00:06:05.130> almost<00:06:05.340> solved<00:06:05.940> here<00:06:06.210> it

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
okay I'm actually almost solved here it

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.210 
okay I'm actually almost solved here it
did<00:06:07.110> look<00:06:07.229> at<00:06:07.380> is<00:06:07.500> she<00:06:07.650> like<00:06:07.800> it<00:06:07.919> could<00:06:08.100> be<00:06:08.130> a

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 
did look at is she like it could be a

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.610 
did look at is she like it could be a
drop<00:06:08.580> in<00:06:08.850> the<00:06:08.910> main<00:06:09.090> and<00:06:09.780> attack<00:06:10.139> the<00:06:10.320> front

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
drop in the main and attack the front

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:11.840 
drop in the main and attack the front
that<00:06:10.860> might<00:06:11.010> do<00:06:11.130> one<00:06:11.220> the<00:06:11.340> reason<00:06:11.610> why<00:06:11.729> we

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
that might do one the reason why we

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.370 
that might do one the reason why we
didn't<00:06:12.030> see<00:06:12.120> a<00:06:12.150> spine<00:06:12.479> polar<00:06:12.750> made<00:06:12.960> clickers
