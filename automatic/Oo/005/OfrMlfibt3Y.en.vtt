00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.590
 Hello. 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.840
 I am Serizawa, an afterbeat music school guitar instructor. 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.320
 Today, I received a request from somebody to try out the base slap video too. 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.870
 I would like to do a slap even with the base. 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.680
 Basically, it is no different from what you do on guitar, 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.970
 First of all, there are two lessons videos that are slap on the guitar, 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.430
 I think that you should look at this video after having them refer to it. 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.539
 So, let's do it soon. 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.109
 I'm going from thumping. 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:01.019
 Although it is totally the same as a guitar even though it is called a thumping, 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:08.060
 For example, if you thumb the 4th string, the thumb stops on the 3rd string, 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.020
 During that time, I had scraped four strings. 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.990
 Please play with that nuance. 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.340
 If you do not use the movement of this wrist well, I think that extra power enters and there is no beautiful sound. 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.430
 So it is often said that the movement to look at the fan, this is a rotation of the wrist. 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.890
 Use this twist or snap 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.770
 Not this 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.709
 It is this. 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:42.500
 Then you will get a good sound easily, so practice this first. 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.450
 And the next one is pull. 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.500
 Unlike the guitar, because the strings are thick, to some extent firmly ... 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.479
 I have to pull it 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.610
 There is no noise. 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:01.160
 If this is loose 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.810
 It feels like playing with a finger, so pull firmly 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.800
 Make a sound like "Bacon, Buckon, Buckon". 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.470
 So it seems like it is good to practice this on an octave at first. 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.340
 Combine Sam and Pull, 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.840
 Sam, Pull, Sam, Pull, Sam, Pull, Sam, Pull, 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.100
 Sam, Pull, Sam, Pull. 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.920
 I feel that. 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.190
 "One, two!" 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.890
 It feels like you should practice the thumping and pulling. 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.870
 So, if you do this alone, it is not very interesting. 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.980
 I would like to introduce one more skill. 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.780
 That's a thumb-up. 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.890
 I did thumping down with my thumb, but 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.570
 This time, I thumb up like picking up a pick. 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.410
 down. 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.110
 Down, up, down, up, 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.959
 Down, up .... 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.860
 You just pick your thumb up like picking up and picking up. 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.959
 It is a thumbing. 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.310
 If you do this 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.310
 You can play it with the nuance like playing a pick. 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.020
 Do you feel like that? 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:52.790
 However, since it becomes a phrase that is slightly delicious and human-like, I want this to be a master by all means. 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:02.240
 In this combination, the last part of the first slap phrase is 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.180
 I use this style of rendition. 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.880
 Thumb down, hammering. 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.390
 So, up, pull. 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.819
 Down, hammering, up, pull. 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:24.810
 Increase this octave a bit. 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.810
 Do this quickly. 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:38.010
 Then, a lot of sound enters "Baba baba baba baba baba", so 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.080
 It has a lot of impact, so it's hard to keep doing it, but 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.800
 Just like a good person if you insert it a little 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:53.800
 Because it works well, I want to master it by all means. 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.409
 After that, thumbing and thumbing up. 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:00.579
 Mute of the left hand, it is after pull. 

00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:06.689
 If you can master these four actions well, you can play most slap phrases. 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:09.319
 And I also know some pretty cool phrases. 

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:16.319
 For example, three operations without thumping up 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:38.909
 You can also make a slap phrase like that. 

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:52.209
 Because I am not so wide in the slap phrase 

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:58.789
 I can not introduce a lot, but because it is quite fun playing method by all means · · · 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:04.210
 I get bored in about 10 minutes, but please try practicing because it is a fun playing method. 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.879
 As a recommendation, it is a base magazine. 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:12.520
 Sometimes I bought a base magazine, accompanied by a CD and introduced various slap phrases. 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:20.249
 I think that if you practice that kind of thing you may not have the ability. 

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:32.249
 I feel that there was such a phrase. 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.389
 I feel that a phrase like this was in the base magazine. 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:51.240
 There are many practical phrases like this, so if you can afford the money, 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:58.400
 I think that you can buy it for around 2,000 yen and 3,000 yen, so please try to buy a book that looks like all the slap playing methods. 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.889
 Well, let's end today's base video like this.
