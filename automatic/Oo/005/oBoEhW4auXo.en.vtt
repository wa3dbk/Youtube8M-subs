00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:05.480
 3 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.279
 to them 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.990
 hello and welcome to this new video 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.870
 tutorial where he will teach you how 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.110
 download a mouse library for the 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.030
 fl studio so let's start the link 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:19.490
 will be in the description of the video of the 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:22.160
 mega page 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.710
 after having entered the link 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.840
 it's going to look like this you just have to give it 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.210
 in downloading to your computer or if you 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.640
 appear the previous view you have to 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.430
 give a tab here and after 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:39.770
 analyze will make your computer 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:41.480
 weighs 168 points 3 megabytes that contains 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.450
 contains a variety of things deaf to 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.920
 the samples will be delayed downloading 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:50.579
 depending on the time of your internet 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.289
 the great zeal because I already have it 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.430
 after giving him up he's going to 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.170
 appear a winrar file 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.720
 thus 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:04.040
 they give you right click extract here 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.040
 we hope it is extracted 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.780
 meanwhile I tell them to go through 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:19.950
 my channel I have good videos explaining 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.000
 different programs and settings and 7 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.560
 after this you will see a 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.750
 reggaeton library folder 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.200
 and opens it and all this will appear 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:33.369
 content 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.950
 of everything a little under the effects things 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:39.620
 of everything to say but how do I keep this in 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.410
 the f study in this way the basis 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:47.470
 they give right click and they give copy to the 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:51.760
 folder after they go to your documents 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:54.760
 or enter team start after they leave 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.570
 to disk what jail after files of the 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.220
 program then pass image image 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.140
 line 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.840
 then now in the folder efe the 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.440
 study 10 or in the version that you 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.899
 have open a data folder and now a 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.110
 folder patches 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:18.330
 patches and libraries will appear i 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.330
 I'm going to give it a right click and hit it 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.700
 and ready 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.480
 after this they go to the efe the study 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.750
 where you can find your bookshop now 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.170
 Now I 'm going to show you 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.740
 here this reggaeton and exact library 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.740
 contains it 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.480
 as well 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.810
 comes from a whole lot they come up in 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.810
 bausch 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.780
 much more ask how they are used 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.200
 these of bous as one is dragging it 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.200
 well in this way 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.860
 but it's very long so we lower the 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:30.080
 speed to 90 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:31.370
 in this way to 95 or another method that is 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.230
 also easy so they can 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.250
 use these types of folder in 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:41.770
 bowls doing near chanel and looking 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.770
 the expansion if leds or silence 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.769
 if it did not change that is and drag it 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.340
 and ready 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.340
 will appear 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.910
 thus 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:04.140
 in ark panther 1 and they can go 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:06.540
 painting being another method I'm already 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.270
 lengthening the video thank you comment 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.760
 subscribe German thirst and it's up is 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.760
 because the jerusalem the library contains 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:17.820
 of all many things of all is only 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.690
 question of you who look at it and who 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:24.389
 the review until the next and until the 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:28.219
 next video and that's it 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.219
