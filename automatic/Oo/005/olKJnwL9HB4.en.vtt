week of a curly twist that I was able to
achieve<00:07:27.080> with<00:07:27.440> using<00:07:27.770> just<00:07:27.979> a<00:07:28.099> very<00:07:28.430> small

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:28.610 
achieve with using just a very small

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:31.029 
achieve with using just a very small
amount<00:07:29.210> of<00:07:29.389> the<00:07:29.690> curling<00:07:30.050> souffle<00:07:30.409> on<00:07:30.589> top<00:07:30.830> of
