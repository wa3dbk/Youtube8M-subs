00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.449 
definitely faster and you know for meat
I<00:04:00.209> for<00:04:00.840> me<00:04:01.020> I<00:04:01.050> can<00:04:01.319> feel<00:04:01.560> it's<00:04:01.800> faster<00:04:02.250> but<00:04:02.430> I

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
I for me I can feel it's faster but I

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.309 
I for me I can feel it's faster but I
mean<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:02.940> know<00:04:03.270> as<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.450> user<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:03.870> have<00:04:03.990> to

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
mean you know as a user you have to

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.949 
mean you know as a user you have to
really<00:04:04.440> try<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:04.770> out<00:04:04.980> and<00:04:05.370> I<00:04:06.060> think<00:04:06.600> you<00:04:06.750> will

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
really try it out and I think you will

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.470 
really try it out and I think you will
find<00:04:07.020> it<00:04:07.440> it's<00:04:07.590> much<00:04:07.740> faster<00:04:08.040> so<00:04:08.970> check<00:04:09.300> it<00:04:09.330> out

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480

faster<00:04:11.640> that's<00:04:11.880> what<00:04:12.330> the<00:04:12.480> main<00:04:12.690> reason<00:04:13.290> for

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
faster that's what the main reason for

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.009 
faster that's what the main reason for
android<00:04:13.770> for<00:04:13.920> 2<00:04:14.220> dot<00:04:14.370> 2<00:04:14.550> is<00:04:14.730> more<00:04:15.720> stability
