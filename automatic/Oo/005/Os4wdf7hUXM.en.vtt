everything but feel free to pause it
here<00:00:24.630> if<00:00:24.720> you<00:00:24.840> want<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.170> read<00:00:25.320> through<00:00:25.529> every

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
here if you want to read through every

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.259 
here if you want to read through every
bullet<00:00:26.189> point<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.640> first<00:00:26.820> thing<00:00:27.029> we<00:00:27.090> want<00:00:27.210> to

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
bullet point the first thing we want to

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.500 
bullet point the first thing we want to
point<00:00:27.480> out<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.900> this<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.380> 87<00:00:29.130> Plus<00:00:29.429> ready<00:00:29.820> so

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
point out is this is 87 Plus ready so

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.569 
point out is this is 87 Plus ready so
that<00:00:30.539> means<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.470> this<00:00:31.859> is<00:00:32.099> an<00:00:32.219> extreme

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
that means that this is an extreme

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.700 
that means that this is an extreme
efficiency<00:00:32.820> PSU<00:00:33.570> which<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.899> why<00:00:34.020> it's<00:00:34.230> 80<00:00:34.469> plus

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
efficiency PSU which is why it's 80 plus

efficiency PSU which is why it's 80 plus
gold<00:00:34.739> certified<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:35.700> it's<00:00:35.880> running<00:00:36.260> 87

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
gold certified so it's running 87

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.490 
gold certified so it's running 87
percent<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.680> 93<00:00:38.340> percent<00:00:38.370> efficiency<00:00:39.120> at<00:00:39.780> 22<00:00:40.469> a

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
percent to 93 percent efficiency at 22 a

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.650 
percent to 93 percent efficiency at 22 a
hundred<00:00:40.920> percent<00:00:41.070> load<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> very

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
hundred percent load so this is a very

the<00:01:46.829> heat<00:01:46.860> out<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.310> your<00:01:47.610> system<00:01:48.060> even<00:01:48.329> after

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
the heat out of your system even after

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.420 
the heat out of your system even after
it's<00:01:49.140> been<00:01:49.259> shut<00:01:49.530> off<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.860> you'll<00:01:49.979> still<00:01:50.250> hear

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
it's been shut off so you'll still hear

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.219 
it's been shut off so you'll still hear
the<00:01:50.579> fan<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:50.909> your<00:01:51.000> power<00:01:51.180> supply<00:01:51.360> running<00:01:51.720> but

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
the fan on your power supply running but

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.050 
the fan on your power supply running but
it's<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:52.500> clearing<00:01:52.829> out<00:01:52.979> any<00:01:53.280> extra<00:01:53.700> heat

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
it's just clearing out any extra heat

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.260 
it's just clearing out any extra heat
which<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.810> very<00:01:54.990> helpful<00:01:55.200> also<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.710> get<00:01:55.950> your

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
which is very helpful also you get your

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
which is very helpful also you get your
safeguards<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.509> have<00:01:57.659> your<00:01:57.840> multiple

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
safeguards so you have your multiple

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.230 
safeguards so you have your multiple
protection<00:01:58.890> circuitry's<00:01:59.490> here<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.969> can<00:02:00.119> take

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
protection circuitry's here you can take

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.490 
protection circuitry's here you can take
a<00:02:00.270> look<00:02:00.450> at<00:02:00.600> those<00:02:00.810> if<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.079> want<00:02:01.110> to<00:02:01.290> pause<00:02:01.469> it

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
a look at those if you want to pause it

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.100 
a look at those if you want to pause it
and<00:02:01.740> read<00:02:01.920> through<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.250> rest<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.110> also

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
and read through the rest of it and also

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.810 
and read through the rest of it and also
you<00:02:04.170> get<00:02:04.680> your<00:02:04.920> cord<00:02:05.219> guard<00:02:05.490> which<00:02:05.790> is

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
you get your cord guard which is

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.429 
you get your cord guard which is
interesting<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.689> will<00:02:06.840> show<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.409> on

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
interesting and I will show it to you on

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.050 
interesting and I will show it to you on
the<00:02:07.829> power<00:02:08.009> supply<00:02:08.280> unit<00:02:08.310> when<00:02:08.640> we<00:02:08.670> get<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:08.970> out

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
the power supply unit when we get it out

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.089 
the power supply unit when we get it out
alright<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:09.959> we're<00:02:10.110> gonna<00:02:10.170> do<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.440> quick<00:02:10.830> shot

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
alright so we're gonna do a quick shot

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.770 
alright so we're gonna do a quick shot
here<00:02:11.430> for<00:02:11.610> you<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.849> pause<00:02:12.060> if<00:02:12.300> you'd<00:02:12.420> like<00:02:12.569> and

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
here for you to pause if you'd like and

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.700 
here for you to pause if you'd like and
you<00:02:12.840> can<00:02:12.959> take<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.170> look

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
you can take it look

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:14.960 
you can take it look
the<00:02:13.830> features<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.250> some<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.790> other

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
the features of some of the other

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.810 
the features of some of the other
available<00:02:15.420> models<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.950> then<00:02:17.100> if<00:02:17.250> we<00:02:17.400> can<00:02:17.550> just

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
available models and then if we can just

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.410 
available models and then if we can just
slap<00:02:18.120> the<00:02:18.600> box<00:02:18.780> piece<00:02:19.170> away<00:02:19.820> there<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:20.970> go<00:02:21.120> you

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
slap the box piece away there you go you

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.470 
slap the box piece away there you go you
can<00:02:21.540> take<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.750> look<00:02:21.990> at<00:02:22.140> some<00:02:22.710> of<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.920> other

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
can take a look at some of the other

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.120 
can take a look at some of the other
input<00:02:24.480> voltages<00:02:24.990> and<00:02:25.200> whatnots<00:02:25.530> from<00:02:25.950> the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
input voltages and whatnots from the

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.550 
input voltages and whatnots from the
other<00:02:26.400> models<00:02:26.820> if<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.060> think<00:02:27.300> 730<00:02:28.110> watt<00:02:28.320> is<00:02:28.530> a

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
other models if you think 730 watt is a

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.770 
other models if you think 730 watt is a
little<00:02:28.950> bit<00:02:29.070> too<00:02:29.280> beefy<00:02:29.700> for<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.300> system<00:02:30.630> that

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
little bit too beefy for the system that

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.600 
little bit too beefy for the system that
you're<00:02:30.900> running<00:02:31.020> all<00:02:31.680> right<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:32.040> let's<00:02:32.250> get

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
you're running all right so let's get

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.010 
you're running all right so let's get
this<00:02:32.880> sucker<00:02:33.090> out<00:02:33.240> of<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.990> box<00:02:35.510> first<00:02:36.510> up<00:02:36.780> I

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
this sucker out of the box first up I

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.990 
this sucker out of the box first up I
have<00:02:37.110> already<00:02:37.710> taken<00:02:37.950> all<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.340> plastic<00:02:38.790> wrap

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
have already taken all the plastic wrap

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.630 
have already taken all the plastic wrap
off<00:02:39.270> of<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.930> cords<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.560> such<00:02:40.830> but<00:02:41.310> these<00:02:41.460> are

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
off of the cords and such but these are

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.610 
off of the cords and such but these are
the<00:02:41.760> modular<00:02:42.210> cords<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:42.690> get<00:02:42.900> so<00:02:43.140> we<00:02:43.260> have<00:02:43.470> an

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
the modular cords you get so we have an

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.700 
the modular cords you get so we have an
extra<00:02:43.950> GPU<00:02:44.760> cable<00:02:45.210> and<00:02:45.840> I<00:02:45.990> say<00:02:46.140> extra<00:02:46.470> because

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
extra GPU cable and I say extra because

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.290 
extra GPU cable and I say extra because
there<00:02:46.830> is<00:02:47.010> one<00:02:47.310> pre-installed<00:02:47.970> like<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.180> said

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
there is one pre-installed like I said

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.970 
there is one pre-installed like I said
this<00:02:48.390> is<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.540> hybrid<00:02:48.720> modular<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.560> get<00:02:49.740> to<00:02:49.860> it

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
this is a hybrid modular I get to it

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.730 
this is a hybrid modular I get to it
hang<00:02:50.130> on<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:50.940> here<00:02:51.930> we<00:02:52.050> have<00:02:52.230> our<00:02:52.380> molex

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
hang on so here we have our molex

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.800 
hang on so here we have our molex
connectors<00:02:53.340> and<00:02:53.550> fan<00:02:53.760> connectors<00:02:54.270> we<00:02:54.630> have

what's<00:03:10.380> this<00:03:10.670> here<00:03:11.670> is<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:11.910> little<00:03:12.210> bracket<00:03:12.540> II

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
what's this here is a little bracket II

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.520 
what's this here is a little bracket II
looking<00:03:12.870> thing<00:03:13.490> this<00:03:14.490> is<00:03:14.970> their<00:03:15.420> cord<00:03:16.050> keeper

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
looking thing this is their cord keeper

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.680 
looking thing this is their cord keeper
or<00:03:16.740> cord<00:03:17.100> saver<00:03:17.400> so<00:03:18.030> what<00:03:18.180> this<00:03:18.300> is<00:03:18.480> going<00:03:18.630> to

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
or cord saver so what this is going to

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.350 
or cord saver so what this is going to
do<00:03:18.930> when<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.290> connect<00:03:19.800> it<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.550> outside<00:03:20.760> of

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:14.420 
you an idea of the dimensions of this

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.110 
you an idea of the dimensions of this
power<00:05:14.690> supply<00:05:14.930> so<00:05:15.710> this<00:05:15.830> is<00:05:15.980> standard<00:05:16.220> ATX<00:05:16.760> so

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
power supply so this is standard ATX so

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.400 
power supply so this is standard ATX so
that's<00:05:17.270> gonna<00:05:17.420> give<00:05:17.660> you<00:05:17.750> a<00:05:17.840> hundred<00:05:18.140> and

that's gonna give you a hundred and

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.040 
that's gonna give you a hundred and
fifty<00:05:18.710> millimeter<00:05:19.190> width<00:05:19.970> but<00:05:20.510> the<00:05:20.630> length<00:05:20.840> is

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050 
fifty millimeter width but the length is

fifty millimeter width but the length is
probably<00:05:21.350> what<00:05:21.530> you're<00:05:21.650> more<00:05:21.770> interested<00:05:22.340> in

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
probably what you're more interested in

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.770 
probably what you're more interested in
because<00:05:22.820> that's<00:05:23.060> going<00:05:23.270> to<00:05:23.330> tell<00:05:23.510> you<00:05:23.660> whether

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
because that's going to tell you whether

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.360 
because that's going to tell you whether
or<00:05:23.870> not<00:05:23.930> it's<00:05:24.140> gonna<00:05:24.230> be<00:05:24.380> compatible<00:05:24.680> with<00:05:24.950> the

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
or not it's gonna be compatible with the

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.850 
or not it's gonna be compatible with the
rest<00:05:25.670> of<00:05:25.850> your<00:05:26.030> part<00:05:26.690> so<00:05:26.930> it<00:05:27.080> is<00:05:27.200> a<00:05:27.230> hundred<00:05:27.710> and

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
rest of your part so it is a hundred and

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.120 
rest of your part so it is a hundred and
sixty<00:05:28.280> from<00:05:28.490> edge<00:05:28.670> to<00:05:28.700> edge<00:05:29.350> here<00:05:30.350> but<00:05:30.710> if<00:05:30.980> you

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
sixty from edge to edge here but if you

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.520 
sixty from edge to edge here but if you
want<00:05:31.400> to<00:05:31.490> add<00:05:31.640> in<00:05:31.880> an<00:05:32.120> extra<00:05:32.270> you<00:05:33.080> know<00:05:33.200> ten<00:05:33.500> or

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
so to accommodate the cords needing to

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.620 
so to accommodate the cords needing to
be<00:05:37.220> bent<00:05:37.430> over<00:05:37.610> for<00:05:38.060> your<00:05:38.150> cable<00:05:38.450> management

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
be bent over for your cable management

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.980 
be bent over for your cable management
or<00:05:39.110> any<00:05:39.440> additional<00:05:40.720> cabling<00:05:41.720> that<00:05:41.900> you

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
or any additional cabling that you

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.020 
or any additional cabling that you
install<00:05:42.500> that<00:05:43.160> would<00:05:43.340> give<00:05:43.460> you<00:05:43.550> a<00:05:43.580> hundred

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.030 
install that would give you a hundred

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:45.700 
install that would give you a hundred
and<00:05:44.120> seventy<00:05:44.630> millimeter<00:05:45.050> you<00:05:45.380> might<00:05:45.560> even

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
and seventy millimeter you might even

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:46.750 
and seventy millimeter you might even
want<00:05:45.980> to<00:05:46.010> go<00:05:46.130> a<00:05:46.160> hundred<00:05:46.400> and<00:05:46.610> eighty

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
want to go a hundred and eighty

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.250 
want to go a hundred and eighty
millimeters<00:05:47.300> just<00:05:47.600> to<00:05:47.690> be<00:05:47.810> safe<00:05:48.020> on<00:05:48.230> the

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
millimeters just to be safe on the

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.050 
millimeters just to be safe on the
clearance<00:05:48.680> and<00:05:48.890> give<00:05:49.010> the<00:05:49.190> cables<00:05:49.580> lots<00:05:49.910> of

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
clearance and give the cables lots of

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.410 
clearance and give the cables lots of
breathing<00:05:50.450> room<00:05:51.130> pre-installed<00:05:52.130> as<00:05:52.550> I

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:53.420 
breathing room pre-installed as I

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:55.150 
breathing room pre-installed as I
mentioned<00:05:53.840> this<00:05:53.930> is<00:05:53.990> a<00:05:54.140> hybrid<00:05:54.440> power<00:05:54.830> supply

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 
mentioned this is a hybrid power supply

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.920 
mentioned this is a hybrid power supply
so<00:05:55.310> you<00:05:55.340> do<00:05:55.520> get<00:05:55.670> some<00:05:55.730> cables<00:05:56.300> pre-installed

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
so you do get some cables pre-installed

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.750 
so you do get some cables pre-installed
which<00:05:57.470> is<00:05:57.620> nice<00:05:57.800> because<00:05:58.070> if<00:05:58.280> you're<00:05:58.400> building

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
which is nice because if you're building

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.270 
which is nice because if you're building
kind<00:05:58.940> of<00:05:59.030> a<00:05:59.150> bare-bones<00:05:59.870> system<00:06:00.500> you<00:06:01.010> don't

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280
