people<00:01:56.330> surprised<00:01:56.780> everyone<00:01:57.080> here<00:01:57.290> just<00:01:57.560> how

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
people surprised everyone here just how

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.070 
people surprised everyone here just how
adaptive<00:01:58.310> they<00:01:58.430> are<00:01:58.550> yeah<00:01:59.090> I<00:01:59.330> think<00:01:59.540> so

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
adaptive they are yeah I think so

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.420 
adaptive they are yeah I think so
you<00:02:00.170> know<00:02:00.229> they<00:02:00.350> just<00:02:00.530> fell<00:02:00.770> right<00:02:00.950> back<00:02:01.009> into

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
you know they just fell right back into

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.190 
you know they just fell right back into

there<00:02:48.200> he<00:02:48.350> is<00:02:48.380> there's<00:02:49.070> virtually<00:02:49.640> nothing
