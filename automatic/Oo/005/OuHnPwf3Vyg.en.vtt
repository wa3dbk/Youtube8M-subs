00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.779
 yes hello together now the crisis yes in 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.849
 this video is about my last one 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.929
 which video has been released 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:17.640
 was that with the two blondes from 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.980
 second and third of july 2015 so 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.320
 this video which he can see there 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.390
 has been partially split by me 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.849
 I do not want to be 30 now 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.460
 minutes set only around the moon 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.170
 to show that the most important has therefore 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.700
 So to speak, see that or both 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.750
 Although dogs are only working on one 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.820
 the next few days clapping were red 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.280
 yes and me it is about editing 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.750
 the file itself I have 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.809
 I realized that there was something 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.980
 either on the moon or around 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.670
 the mouth around 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.129
 I have the recording here now 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.800
 set again in timelapse before 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.369
 not only at the first time 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.140
 not that the normal time then 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.210
 Timelapse and then I have the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.860
 it was hard to transform this again 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.110
 in a negative format and there you can 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.310
 also wonderful to recognize and straight 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.619
 especially because the choice if in the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.840
 white or if now accepted that 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.390
 this would have come from outside 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:33.270
 object such two unknown flying object 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.799
 you would have to at least in the negative 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.619
 format can recognize 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.320
 but it is not that which is 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.329
 So something that is disturbed 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.490
 is driving on the moon gentleman colorful 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.340
 bird we can exclude in advance 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.909
 because the day is huge big I had 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.290
 Although a life and or on the evenings 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:57.180
 that is the recording of britta here 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.070
 already in july but so big bird 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.440
 it does not exist and certainly not at night 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.330
 there alone 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.920
 lonely and alone through the area 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.040
 flies that can be something 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.590
 so look in the lowest part of the moon 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.860
 where is still relatively bright 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.810
 Looks like there's something coming up 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.650
 with a huge speed so 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.450
 However, this includes the time trial 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.290
 use to recognize anything at all 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.880
 can be interesting worry 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.600
 I adjust the video now 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.600
 I 'm running 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:44.460
 cloud right there it was then I hope 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.410
 I have you seen that coming now 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.550
 the time before it all at once 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.550
 clearly visible 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:03:01.950
 so now comes exactly so here you can 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.450
 wonderful recognize that from the right so 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.300
 is he from my perspective right from 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.000
 I do not know 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:13.050
 nothing anywhere in the white box 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:19.040
 you can see it is huge 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:23.690
 So part has guaranteed 60 on the moon 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:31.410
 not even a totally slow version 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:32.160
 Is that all right? 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.350
 you are welcome 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.360
 I watch you this part a huge 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.010
 partly no bird can clean and we 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.760
 said left and right see the white 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.760
 that nothing more to see
