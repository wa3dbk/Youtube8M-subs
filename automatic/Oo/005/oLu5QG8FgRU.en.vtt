stuff mom never told you video last week
but<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.799> still<00:01:41.009> wanted<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.369> talk<00:01:41.579> about<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.060> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
but I still wanted to talk about it the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.850 
but I still wanted to talk about it the
question<00:01:42.270> was<00:01:42.750> how<00:01:43.079> healthy<00:01:43.619> are

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
question was how healthy are

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.639 
question was how healthy are
long-distance<00:01:45.020> relationships<00:01:46.020> first<00:01:46.500> up

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
long-distance relationships first up

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:47.960 
long-distance relationships first up
let's<00:01:46.950> talk<00:01:47.009> about<00:01:47.130> research<00:01:47.700> on

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
let's talk about research on

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.940 
let's talk about research on
long-distance<00:01:48.630> relationships<00:01:49.350> versus

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
long-distance relationships versus

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.859 
long-distance relationships versus
geographically<00:01:50.729> close<00:01:51.149> relationships<00:01:51.750> I

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
geographically close relationships I

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.929 
geographically close relationships I
found<00:01:52.079> was<00:01:52.229> a<00:01:52.259> surprisingly<00:01:52.950> mixed<00:01:53.460> bag<00:01:53.670> of

found was a surprisingly mixed bag of

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
relationships were beneficial in the

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.410 
relationships were beneficial in the
sense<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.130> they<00:02:02.130> didn't<00:02:02.549> necessarily<00:02:02.640> come

scientific side note there was one study

scientific side note there was one study
I<00:02:15.120> found<00:02:15.270> looking<00:02:15.870> at<00:02:16.050> women<00:02:16.500> in

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
I found looking at women in

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.380 
I found looking at women in
long-distance<00:02:16.980> relationships<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.120> found

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
long-distance relationships it found

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.160 
long-distance relationships it found
that<00:02:18.540> their<00:02:18.870> levels<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.440> testosterone<00:02:20.090> are

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
that their levels of testosterone are

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.960 
that their levels of testosterone are
elevated<00:02:22.170> in<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.380> days<00:02:22.590> leading<00:02:22.620> up<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.430> when

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
elevated in the days leading up to when

they're going to go meet up with their
long-distance<00:02:26.190> lover<00:02:26.940> that's<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.720> signal<00:02:28.320> of

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
long-distance lover that's a signal of

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.160 
long-distance lover that's a signal of
that<00:02:29.190> hormonal<00:02:29.760> anticipation<00:02:30.540> of<00:02:30.810> like<00:02:30.960> oh<00:02:31.140> my

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
that hormonal anticipation of like oh my

god I'm finally gonna go get to make out

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.960 
god I'm finally gonna go get to make out
with<00:02:33.750> you<00:02:33.930> already<00:02:34.470> there's<00:02:35.190> also<00:02:35.460> this<00:02:35.820> idea

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
with you already there's also this idea

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.490 
with you already there's also this idea
that<00:02:36.630> if<00:02:36.930> you're<00:02:37.050> in<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.260> long-distance

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
that if you're in a long-distance

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.410 
that if you're in a long-distance
relationship<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:38.640> have<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:38.910> greater

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
relationship you have a greater

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.050 
relationship you have a greater
investment<00:02:39.990> in<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.980> positive<00:02:41.190> outcome<00:02:41.850> of

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
investment in the positive outcome of

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.480 
investment in the positive outcome of
that<00:02:42.870> relationship<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.740> have<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.980> make<00:02:44.250> a

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
that relationship you have to make a

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.910 
that relationship you have to make a
choice<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.960> be<00:02:46.200> in<00:02:46.410> a<00:02:46.740> long-distance

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
choice to be in a long-distance

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.160 
choice to be in a long-distance
relationship<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.910> maintain<00:02:48.450> that

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
relationship and maintain that

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.140 
relationship and maintain that
long-distance<00:02:49.520> relationship<00:02:50.520> for<00:02:50.820> however

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
long-distance relationship for however

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.320 
long-distance relationship for however
long<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:52.200> has<00:02:52.740> to<00:02:53.070> be<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.640> also<00:02:53.880> right<00:02:54.300> there

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
long it has to be that also right there

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.260 
long it has to be that also right there
is<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.440> downside<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.040> researchers<00:02:56.730> often

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
is the downside that researchers often

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.050 
is the downside that researchers often
point<00:02:57.600> to<00:02:57.690> that<00:02:58.020> distance<00:02:58.709> factor<00:02:59.400> can

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
point to that distance factor can

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.640 
point to that distance factor can
actually<00:03:00.570> make<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.900> little<00:03:01.020> bit<00:03:01.170> tougher<00:03:01.380> to

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
actually make it a little bit tougher to

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.520 
actually make it a little bit tougher to
readjust<00:03:02.100> once<00:03:02.790> you<00:03:03.000> are<00:03:03.240> finally<00:03:03.690> living<00:03:04.380> in

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
readjust once you are finally living in

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.440 
readjust once you are finally living in

long-distance relationships and we heard

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.330 
long-distance relationships and we heard

to get through that period I do think

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.560 
to get through that period I do think
that<00:03:46.890> there<00:03:47.100> are<00:03:47.190> certain<00:03:47.489> ground<00:03:47.670> rules<00:03:47.880> that

that there are certain ground rules that

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.960 
that there are certain ground rules that
go<00:03:48.720> into<00:03:48.959> long-distance<00:03:49.620> relationships<00:03:50.280> that

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
go into long-distance relationships that

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.310 
go into long-distance relationships that
might<00:03:51.150> be<00:03:51.330> a<00:03:51.360> little<00:03:51.480> bit<00:03:51.660> different<00:03:52.110> from
