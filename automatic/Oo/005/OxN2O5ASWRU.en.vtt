00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.920
 we are right now in the 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.950
 taxi station pledge 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.500
 six hours south of santa cruz de la 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.590
 sierra bolivia 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:21.160
 two hours on dirt road more 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.890
 four hours of paved road and 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.849
 this customer like many others 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:30.850
 Oil and gas operators have 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.920
 very strict rules in terms of driving 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.410
 at night and driving in conditions 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.930
 dangerous what does access to this 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.660
 quite difficult station in this 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:46.540
 station the gas is compressed and the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.520
 station pumps approximately 350 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:51.130
 millions of cubic feet of gas per day 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:54.610
 this gas pipeline is the most important for 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.469
 export this natural gas to Brazil 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.450
 It has to work every day of the 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.480
 year has to have very good rate of 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.789
 maintenance has to have a regime 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.560
 of optimal functioning in this you are 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:09.160
 in the station is here pledge we have 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.229
 4 microturbines of 65 generating energy 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:14.320
 for the whole season you are 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.960
 delivering energy to the compressors 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.970
 building where people live 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.220
 to the control room to the areas 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.490
 conditioned to the lights and this 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.510
 client as it has more than 10 years already 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.720
 working with microturbines 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.220
 capstone sees clearly the advantages that 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.780
 offer the microturbines on the 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.940
 piston engines 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:39.909
 we see that definitely about 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:44.140
 pretty equipment 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:46.600
 Reliable , easy maintenance and 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.149
 especially something very important that we 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.969
 help is the remote access that we can 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.709
 have the stations that have the most 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.329
 of 15 years operating when the 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:57.009
 they built the client used the 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.490
 technology that was available in that 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:04.000
 moment that are the piston engines 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.789
 when the client knew the technology 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.039
 capstone and started working with that 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.509
 technology realized the advantages 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.250
 that have microturbines on the 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.129
 piston engines 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.420
 these advantages include the fact that 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.280
 people by mines do not require 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.930
 lubricating oil that do not require 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.129
 refrigerant liquids and that have a 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.010
 8,000 maintenance interval 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.840
 hours versus the piston engines that 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.120
 they have a maintenance interval that 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.370
 It can be as frequent as every 200 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.329
 hours now we still have very 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:40.090
 motor generator sets in which the 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:43.379
 maintenance tasks that entail 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.379
 enough tasks 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.110
 they need staff maintenance 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.770
 level 3 of a generator engine more or 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.220
 Less lasting 3 days 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:58.650
 it requires a lot of inputs 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.460
 spark plugs filters 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.460
 refrigerants oils 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:10.600
 and fat that somehow make it more 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:13.140
 Therefore, the works of 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.530
 maintenance to generator sets 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:21.700
 relation to the cardboard turbines that 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:25.450
 can have remote accesses see software 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:28.140
 etcetera a little more analysis let's say 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.840
 clean between quotes 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.420
 in some way also less risky 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.220
 because less manual intervention the 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.510
 expectation is great there are actually 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.870
 several projects that we are starting 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:45.450
 for the next five years where 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:49.170
 we contemplate itself as an alternative 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:52.260
 quite valid and 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:55.290
 it is important to continue in the line of 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.980
 capstone to migrate our 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.270
 teams and we hope that suddenly 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.700
 let's get 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:07.710
 all our facilities finally 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.710
 with Japanese microturbines
