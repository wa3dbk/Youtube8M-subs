00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.500
 and with good reason 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.480
 with just strange reason that there is not 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:20.740
 there was cougar directive contact 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:24.039
 with him as him as a person 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:26.110
 head to lion as offended or I 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.509
 because at the end of the day your club 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.919
 is representing an institution 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:34.329
 He talks a lot and we must make it very clear 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:38.350
 things as they really are beyond 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:41.050
 what a lot this obviously is a 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.070
 part of what is cougars sections of 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.870
 the fans in general do not know 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.390
 represent the latest stories or 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.430
 wherever the flying flags go 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.620
 in the stadium are something else is the 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.550
 university then it's a shame 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.160
 that this happens 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.260
 I agree with these misfits because 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.760
 you can not tell him otherwise what 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.970
 only they do is destroy football 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.670
 that's how clear the problem is 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.189
 here lies and we are going to the same thing 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.189
 allowed has been given broadband to 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.720
 that all this type of individuals arrive 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.020
 football to destroy them even if it's a 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.990
 single canticle 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.969
 that is a single gesture one nothing else with 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.200
 enough clouds to destroy everything 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:22.549
 that can have a until hollow 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.380
 closing how many times have we seen 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.320
 around the world in matches 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.950
 international that someone throws 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.360
 objects husks of national plants 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.009
 offensive to people is a disgrace 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.229
 it's a true shame and there's also 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.299
 what to expect he will also say club 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.860
 university these things is that to me 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.619
 knows me like here also gerardo that 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.200
 the university also has people from 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:46.340
 first level educated people and they will take 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.200
 letters in the matter 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.239
 they're not going to leave it like that they're going to be 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.299
 something to me I'm convinced of that hopefully 

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:56.599
 that is because there are already several notices if 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.489
 he said it was in 2012 when what 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:02:01.340
 they made with burga not the same club of 

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:02.720
 pumas you know that in the day tomorrow what 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.720
 what are causing is that soil that is 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.340
 in Europe to balotelli said to me 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.590
 they made me offended one more time and they 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.720
 it came out and lara distributed of course 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.750
 do those things are nonsense for 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.299
 please is football is something that you 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.220

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:21.080
 all players respect 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.580
 players and those who come 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.520

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.560
 show of the everything that has been 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.360
 formed and that those who do something that 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.290
 take a good punishment hopefully so 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.150
