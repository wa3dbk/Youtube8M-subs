trying to help speed up the video now
once<00:01:43.710> I've<00:01:43.860> got<00:01:43.890> done<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.990> that<00:01:45.990> will<00:01:46.170> give

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
once I've got done that that will give

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.950 
once I've got done that that will give
you<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.470> bit<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.710> an<00:01:46.860> idea<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.579> how<00:01:47.610> long<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.810> will

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
you a bit of an idea on how long it will

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.380 
you a bit of an idea on how long it will
be<00:01:49.020> because<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.520> actual<00:01:50.850> Fliss<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.180> going<00:01:51.329> to

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
be because the actual Fliss is going to

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.370 
be because the actual Fliss is going to
be<00:01:51.450> over<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:52.159> but<00:01:53.159> when<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.399> have<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:54.380> high

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
be over this but when I have the high

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.679 
be over this but when I have the high
bank<00:01:55.619> box<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.310> end<00:01:56.520> it'll<00:01:57.299> be<00:01:57.479> probably

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
bank box on the end it'll be probably

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.999 
bank box on the end it'll be probably
half<00:01:58.020> in<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.680> half<00:01:58.710> out<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.570> the<00:02:00.570> arm<00:02:00.719> off<00:02:01.619> the

half in and half out of the arm off the

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.999 
half in and half out of the arm off the
mainframe<00:02:03.229> okay<00:02:04.229> next<00:02:04.500> thing<00:02:04.740> you're<00:02:04.860> going

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
mainframe okay next thing you're going

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.130 
mainframe okay next thing you're going
to<00:02:05.070> want<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.280> do<00:02:05.539> is<00:02:06.539> you're<00:02:06.689> going<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:06.930> want<00:02:07.049> to

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
to want to do is you're going to want to

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.690 
to want to do is you're going to want to
determine<00:02:07.439> how<00:02:07.770> wide<00:02:08.070> you're<00:02:08.369> going<00:02:08.490> to<00:02:08.580> build

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
determine how wide you're going to build

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.330 
determine how wide you're going to build
it<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.000> mean<00:02:09.240> this<00:02:10.020> is<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.500> piece<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.009> scrap

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
it I mean this is just a piece of scrap

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.000 
it I mean this is just a piece of scrap
wood<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.880> I<00:02:11.970> had<00:02:12.120> from<00:02:12.240> the<00:02:12.390> train<00:02:12.600> layout

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
wood that I had from the train layout

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.600 
wood that I had from the train layout
that<00:02:14.010> I'll<00:02:14.160> probably<00:02:14.370> end<00:02:14.670> up

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
that I'll probably end up

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.410 
that I'll probably end up
using<00:02:16.450> that<00:02:16.660> as<00:02:16.990> how<00:02:17.410> wide<00:02:17.710> it<00:02:17.890> will<00:02:18.010> be

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
using that as how wide it will be

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.100 
using that as how wide it will be
because<00:02:19.420> I<00:02:20.070> don't<00:02:21.070> want<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:21.310> have<00:02:21.790> it<00:02:22.600> too<00:02:22.870> wide

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
because I don't want to have it too wide

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.530 
because I don't want to have it too wide
and<00:02:23.410> it<00:02:23.470> doesn't<00:02:23.950> come<00:02:24.310> unported<00:02:24.880> I<00:02:25.210> just<00:02:25.390> want

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
and it doesn't come unported I just want

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.620 
and it doesn't come unported I just want
to<00:02:25.600> have<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:26.530> that<00:02:26.710> I<00:02:27.000> don't<00:02:28.000> have<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.210> pin

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
to have it to that I don't have to pin

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.340 
to have it to that I don't have to pin
all<00:02:29.440> my<00:02:29.830> gold<00:02:30.100> keys<00:02:30.460> or<00:02:31.090> all<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.600> dirt<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:32.080> phone

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
all my gold keys or all the dirt I phone

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.800 
all my gold keys or all the dirt I phone
because<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:33.240> just<00:02:34.240> think<00:02:34.390> it's<00:02:34.480> going<00:02:34.570> to<00:02:34.630> be<00:02:34.750> a

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
because I just think it's going to be a

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.160 
because I just think it's going to be a
bit<00:02:34.990> of<00:02:35.020> a<00:02:35.140> waste<00:02:35.320> of<00:02:35.500> time<00:02:35.790> really<00:02:36.840> if<00:02:37.840> I<00:02:37.990> can

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
bit of a waste of time really if I can

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.790 
bit of a waste of time really if I can
just<00:02:38.290> build<00:02:38.590> their<00:02:38.770> site<00:02:39.010> it'll<00:02:39.910> save<00:02:40.120> me<00:02:40.150> time

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
just build their site it'll save me time

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.120 
just build their site it'll save me time
and<00:02:41.800> everything<00:02:42.180> ok<00:02:43.180> so<00:02:43.680> that's<00:02:44.680> about<00:02:44.830> how

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
and everything ok so that's about how

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.830 
and everything ok so that's about how
wide<00:02:45.430> or<00:02:45.459> be<00:02:47.520> looking<00:02:48.520> all<00:02:48.790> right<00:02:49.000> but<00:02:49.209> with

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
wide or be looking all right but with

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.300 
wide or be looking all right but with
the<00:02:49.900> piece<00:02:50.140> that<00:02:50.170> i<00:02:50.380> have<00:02:50.500> on<00:02:50.530> top<00:02:50.890> position

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
the piece that i have on top position

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.850 
the piece that i have on top position
might<00:02:51.580> stick<00:02:51.910> over<00:02:52.300> the<00:02:52.330> edges<00:02:52.600> just<00:02:53.050> like<00:02:53.470> 20

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
might stick over the edges just like 20

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.360 
might stick over the edges just like 20
mil<00:02:54.070> or<00:02:54.400> 50<00:02:54.820> ml<00:02:55.000> on<00:02:55.150> each<00:02:55.270> side<00:02:55.600> and<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:57.190> mount

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
mil or 50 ml on each side and to mount

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.460 
mil or 50 ml on each side and to mount
the<00:02:57.520> side<00:02:57.959> you're<00:02:58.959> going<00:02:58.989> to<00:02:59.140> have<00:02:59.230> some<00:02:59.380> of

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
the side you're going to have some of

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.600 
the side you're going to have some of
this<00:02:59.590> and<00:03:00.550> I've<00:03:00.700> too<00:03:00.820> long<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.150> top<00:03:01.420> on<00:03:01.630> there

this and I've too long the top on there

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.030 
this and I've too long the top on there
just<00:03:03.610> like<00:03:03.850> that<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:05.080> side<00:03:05.560> brackets<00:03:05.920> are

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
just like that and the side brackets are

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.460 
just like that and the side brackets are
going<00:03:06.160> to<00:03:06.220> go<00:03:06.340> from<00:03:07.060> off<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:08.500> side<00:03:08.709> of<00:03:08.739> this<00:03:10.470> ok
