can use with any camera right off the
bat<00:01:45.119> see<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.720> little<00:01:45.960> thing<00:01:46.200> that<00:01:46.500> says

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
bat see the little thing that says

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.039 
bat see the little thing that says
shutter<00:01:47.579> speed<00:01:47.939> if<00:01:48.149> you<00:01:48.210> raise<00:01:48.479> that<00:01:48.990> number

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
shutter speed if you raise that number

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.139 
shutter speed if you raise that number
to<00:01:49.409> make<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.770> longer<00:01:49.920> whenever<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.880> take<00:01:50.970> a

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
to make it longer whenever you take a

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.149 
to make it longer whenever you take a
picture<00:01:51.270> now<00:01:51.630> your<00:01:52.170> camera<00:01:52.229> will<00:01:52.829> be<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:52.950> for

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
picture now your camera will be on for

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.910 
picture now your camera will be on for
several<00:01:53.790> seconds<00:01:54.509> taking<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.380> picture<00:01:55.439> for

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
several seconds taking a picture for

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.100 
several seconds taking a picture for
that<00:01:56.250> amount<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:57.000> time<00:01:57.060> now<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.719> is<00:01:57.780> really

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that amount of time now this is really

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.660 
that amount of time now this is really
cool<00:01:58.229> because<00:01:58.590> what<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:58.979> do<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.430> take<00:01:59.610> a

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
cool because what you can do is take a

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.370 
cool because what you can do is take a
light<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.390> then<00:02:00.659> move<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:00.960> around<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.320> frame

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
light and then move it around the frame

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.889 
light and then move it around the frame
and<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.890> can<00:02:02.219> actually<00:02:02.460> record<00:02:02.759> light<00:02:03.600> trails

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
and you can actually record light trails

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.319 
and you can actually record light trails
with<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.320> people<00:02:04.729> if<00:02:05.729> you've<00:02:05.969> heard<00:02:06.240> of

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.580 
with that and people if you've heard of
this<00:02:06.450> technique<00:02:06.810> before<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.229> called<00:02:07.380> light

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
this technique before it's called light

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.529 
this technique before it's called light
painting<00:02:08.009> but<00:02:08.160> most<00:02:08.369> people<00:02:08.610> think<00:02:08.849> that<00:02:09.149> oh<00:02:09.450> I

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
painting but most people think that oh I

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.080 
painting but most people think that oh I
just<00:02:09.780> I'm<00:02:10.050> just<00:02:10.500> wave<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.459> flashlight<00:02:11.790> around

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
just I'm just wave a flashlight around

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.930 
just I'm just wave a flashlight around
and<00:02:12.569> then

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
and then

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.820 
and then
done<00:02:13.180> well<00:02:13.510> actually<00:02:13.690> it's<00:02:14.230> a<00:02:14.290> whole<00:02:14.320> art<00:02:14.500> form

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
done well actually it's a whole art form

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.650 
done well actually it's a whole art form
in<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.310> of<00:02:15.460> itself<00:02:15.790> because<00:02:16.090> there<00:02:16.600> are

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
in and of itself because there are

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.470 
in and of itself because there are
dozens<00:02:16.900> of<00:02:17.830> different<00:02:18.280> types<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:19.030> lights<00:02:19.330> that

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
ways in order to create certain shapes

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.910 
ways in order to create certain shapes
and<00:02:28.180> things<00:02:28.480> like<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.200> that<00:02:29.380> is<00:02:29.710> the
