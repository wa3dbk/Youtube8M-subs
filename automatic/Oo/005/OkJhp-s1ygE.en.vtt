so<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.100> next<00:00:08.280> thing<00:00:08.460> I<00:00:08.550> want<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.760> show<00:00:08.969> you<00:00:09.030> is

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
so the next thing I want to show you is

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.900 
so the next thing I want to show you is
this<00:00:09.540> is<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.870> wing<00:00:10.080> spar<00:00:10.590> that<00:00:10.860> that<00:00:11.610> goes

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
this is the wing spar that that goes

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.220 
this is the wing spar that that goes
between<00:00:12.180> the

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
between the

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.400 
between the
and<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.769> one<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:14.040> you<00:00:14.160> get<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:15.420> usually

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
and the one that you get is usually

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.160 
and the one that you get is usually
about<00:00:16.560> five<00:00:16.860> millimeters<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.760> thickness<00:00:18.330> and

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
about five millimeters and thickness and

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.370 
about five millimeters and thickness and
it's<00:00:19.410> very<00:00:19.890> very<00:00:20.279> very<00:00:20.580> thin<00:00:21.029> if<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:21.900> look<00:00:22.110> at

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
it's very very very thin if you look at

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.929 
it's very very very thin if you look at
the<00:00:22.740> thickness<00:00:22.950> of<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.400> you'll<00:00:23.550> see<00:00:23.700> that<00:00:23.820> it's

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
the thickness of it you'll see that it's

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.050 
the thickness of it you'll see that it's
not<00:00:24.060> very<00:00:24.119> thick<00:00:24.419> and<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.439> just<00:00:25.939> feels<00:00:26.939> very

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
not very thick and it just feels very

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.170 
not very thick and it just feels very
flimsy<00:00:27.630> I<00:00:28.140> broke<00:00:28.950> my<00:00:29.099> original<00:00:29.579> one<00:00:29.730> so<00:00:29.790> I<00:00:29.970> had

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
flimsy I broke my original one so I had

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.500 
flimsy I broke my original one so I had
to<00:00:30.270> replace<00:00:30.540> replace<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.970> so<00:00:32.970> when<00:00:33.120> I<00:00:33.149> replace

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
to replace replace it so when I replace

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.120 
to replace replace it so when I replace
that<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.870> replaced<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.380> with<00:00:34.440> one<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.010> was

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
that I replaced it with one that was

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.040 
that I replaced it with one that was
thick<00:00:35.960> this<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> six<00:00:37.530> millimeter<00:00:37.770> tube<00:00:38.460> and

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
thick this is a six millimeter tube and

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.490 
thick this is a six millimeter tube and
which<00:00:40.050> has<00:00:40.380> a<00:00:40.649> smaller<00:00:41.480> tube<00:00:42.480> inside<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.350> to

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
which has a smaller tube inside it to

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.150 
which has a smaller tube inside it to
make<00:00:44.180> make<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.360> stronger<00:00:46.290> but<00:00:46.770> it's<00:00:46.950> much

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
make make it stronger but it's much

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.250 
make make it stronger but it's much
thicker<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.790> probably<00:00:48.330> three<00:00:48.660> millimeters

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
thicker it's probably three millimeters

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.730 
thicker it's probably three millimeters
in<00:00:49.380> thickness<00:00:49.490> total<00:00:51.110> you'll<00:00:52.110> notice<00:00:52.440> if<00:00:52.620> you

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.740 
in thickness total you'll notice if you

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.590 
in thickness total you'll notice if you
do<00:00:52.860> try<00:00:53.130> to<00:00:53.160> put<00:00:53.430> anything<00:00:53.880> greater<00:00:54.120> than<00:00:54.240> five

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
do try to put anything greater than five

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.340 
do try to put anything greater than five
millimeters<00:00:54.870> in<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.560> wing<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.940> won't<00:00:57.240> fit<00:00:57.630> so

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
millimeters in the wing it won't fit so

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.760 
millimeters in the wing it won't fit so
you<00:00:58.410> have<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.570> you<00:01:00.570> actually<00:01:01.050> have<00:01:01.290> to<00:01:01.440> drill

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
you have to you actually have to drill

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.249 
you have to you actually have to drill
out<00:01:02.040> the<00:01:02.280> hole<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.790> little<00:01:03.120> bit<00:01:03.270> if<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.570> want<00:01:03.840> to

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
out the hole a little bit if you want to

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:08.120 
out the hole a little bit if you want to
get<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:05.100> fit<00:01:05.369> that's<00:01:06.329> pretty<00:01:06.720> easy<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.920> do

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
get it to fit that's pretty easy to do

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.940 
get it to fit that's pretty easy to do
if<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.460> take<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.960> can<00:01:10.140> take<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> dowel<00:01:10.710> rod

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
if you take a you can take a dowel rod

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.480 
if you take a you can take a dowel rod
attach<00:01:11.520> some<00:01:11.729> sand<00:01:12.000> paper<00:01:12.270> on<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.310> spin<00:01:14.310> it

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
attach some sand paper on it and spin it

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.340 
attach some sand paper on it and spin it
around<00:01:14.610> on<00:01:14.939> your<00:01:14.970> drill<00:01:15.329> and<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.659> can<00:01:15.840> take<00:01:16.229> it

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
around on your drill and you can take it

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.359 
around on your drill and you can take it
in<00:01:16.530> there<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:17.280> drill<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:17.759> out<00:01:18.679> so<00:01:19.679> there<00:01:19.920> you

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
in there to drill that out so there you

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.489 
in there to drill that out so there you
can<00:01:20.399> fit<00:01:21.149> a<00:01:21.179> rod<00:01:21.539> that's<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.899> little<00:01:22.079> bit<00:01:22.259> bigger

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:22.499 
can fit a rod that's a little bit bigger

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:24.370 
can fit a rod that's a little bit bigger
if<00:01:23.039> you<00:01:23.159> were<00:01:23.280> looking<00:01:23.520> for<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> cheaper<00:01:24.090> way<00:01:24.210> to

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
if you were looking for a cheaper way to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.319 
if you were looking for a cheaper way to
to<00:01:25.380> kind<00:01:25.649> of<00:01:25.679> reinforce<00:01:25.950> this<00:01:26.340> some<00:01:26.609> guys<00:01:26.969> use

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
to kind of reinforce this some guys use

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.190 
to kind of reinforce this some guys use
wooden<00:01:28.109> dowel<00:01:28.469> rods<00:01:28.969> I<00:01:29.969> would<00:01:30.569> go<00:01:30.689> for<00:01:30.899> an<00:01:30.990> oak

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
wooden dowel rods I would go for an oak

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.520 
wooden dowel rods I would go for an oak
one<00:01:31.499> minimum<00:01:32.659> because<00:01:33.659> they<00:01:33.780> won't<00:01:33.899> flex<00:01:34.319> as

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
one minimum because they won't flex as

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.830 
one minimum because they won't flex as
much<00:01:34.770> or<00:01:35.340> you<00:01:35.520> can<00:01:35.700> even<00:01:35.880> get<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.149> smaller<00:01:36.569> die

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
much or you can even get a smaller die

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.529 
much or you can even get a smaller die
out<00:01:37.109> and<00:01:37.439> put<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.829> into<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.549> stock<00:01:40.850> tube<00:01:41.850> that

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
out and put it into the stock tube that

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.919 
out and put it into the stock tube that
you<00:01:42.689> have<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.979> get<00:01:44.219> with<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.399> plane<00:01:44.929> so

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:45.929 
you have that you get with a plane so

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:48.349 
you have that you get with a plane so
that's<00:01:46.109> another<00:01:46.409> option<00:01:47.069> wood<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.119> little

00:01:48.349 --> 00:01:48.359 
that's another option wood is a little

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:51.620 
that's another option wood is a little
bit<00:01:48.569> heavier<00:01:48.929> but<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.130> cheaper<00:01:50.369> than<00:01:50.630> CF

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
bit heavier but it is cheaper than CF

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.819 
bit heavier but it is cheaper than CF
tubes<00:01:52.289> and<00:01:52.649> CF<00:01:52.979> rods<00:01:53.779> and<00:01:54.779> just<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.170> side<00:01:55.380> note<00:01:55.409> I

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
tubes and CF rods and just a side note I

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.039 
tubes and CF rods and just a side note I
recommend<00:01:56.310> getting<00:01:56.490> one<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:56.909> these<00:01:57.090> calipers

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
recommend getting one of these calipers

the next thing you want to do is make

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.339 
the next thing you want to do is make
sure<00:02:20.550> that<00:02:20.910> your<00:02:21.090> motor<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.540> running<00:02:21.900> in<00:02:22.230> the

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
sure that your motor is running in the

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:22.730 
sure that your motor is running in the
prop

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
prop

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.920 
prop
direction<00:02:23.040> and<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:24.120> easiest<00:02:24.420> way<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.630> do<00:02:24.900> that

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
direction and the easiest way to do that

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.400 
direction and the easiest way to do that
is<00:02:25.440> if<00:02:25.740> you<00:02:25.830> take<00:02:26.100> your<00:02:26.370> hand<00:02:26.610> or<00:02:26.910> something

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
is if you take your hand or something

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.130 
is if you take your hand or something
and<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:28.530> put<00:02:28.950> it<00:02:29.480> safely<00:02:30.480> behind<00:02:30.990> the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
and you put it safely behind the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.310 
and you put it safely behind the
propeller<00:02:31.880> I<00:02:32.880> have<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.360> little<00:02:33.930> ribbon<00:02:34.050> right

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
propeller I have a little ribbon right

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.440 
propeller I have a little ribbon right
here<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.860> you<00:02:35.010> gently<00:02:35.550> turn<00:02:35.850> on<00:02:36.030> your<00:02:36.210> motor

here and you gently turn on your motor

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.400 
here and you gently turn on your motor
you<00:02:37.380> should<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.830> should<00:02:37.890> actually<00:02:38.250> blow<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:39.410> it

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
you should it should actually blow it it

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.460 
you should it should actually blow it it
should<00:02:40.620> blow<00:02:40.740> the<00:02:41.070> air<00:02:41.310> behind<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.750> plane<00:02:43.020> so

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
should blow the air behind the plane so

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.270 
should blow the air behind the plane so
you'll<00:02:43.830> notice<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.370> ribbon<00:02:44.670> there<00:02:46.280> it's

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
you'll notice the ribbon there it's

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.090 
you'll notice the ribbon there it's
blown<00:02:47.610> if<00:02:48.180> it's<00:02:48.450> blowing<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.900> air<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.980> the

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
blown if it's blowing the air to the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.930 
blown if it's blowing the air to the
front<00:02:50.310> of<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.460> plane<00:02:51.260> which<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.440> shouldn't

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
front of the plane which it shouldn't

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.730 
front of the plane which it shouldn't
then<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.120> need<00:02:54.300> to<00:02:54.380> fix<00:02:55.380> it<00:02:57.410> now<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.500> way<00:02:58.680> you

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
then you need to fix it now the way you

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.710 
then you need to fix it now the way you
fix<00:02:59.040> that<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.430> it's<00:02:59.610> simple<00:02:59.970> all<00:03:00.300> you<00:03:00.480> have<00:03:00.600> to

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
fix that is it's simple all you have to

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.160 
fix that is it's simple all you have to
do<00:03:00.870> is<00:03:01.140> look<00:03:01.680> at<00:03:01.920> your<00:03:02.340> wires<00:03:02.840> going<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:04.050> your

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
do is look at your wires going to your

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.370 
do is look at your wires going to your
motor<00:03:04.380> you'll<00:03:04.920> see<00:03:05.190> three<00:03:05.640> wires<00:03:06.050> you<00:03:07.050> can

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
motor you'll see three wires you can

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.540 
motor you'll see three wires you can
swap<00:03:08.040> any<00:03:08.460> two<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.810> three<00:03:09.840> wires<00:03:10.550> doesn't

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
swap any two of the three wires doesn't

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.480 
swap any two of the three wires doesn't
matter<00:03:11.700> which<00:03:12.120> two<00:03:12.390> you<00:03:12.420> swap<00:03:12.960> just<00:03:13.860> swap<00:03:14.130> two

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
matter which two you swap just swap two

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.820 
matter which two you swap just swap two
of<00:03:14.610> the<00:03:14.700> wires<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.390> you'll<00:03:15.840> notice<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.290> it

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
of the wires and you'll notice that it

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.460 
of the wires and you'll notice that it
will<00:03:17.000> your<00:03:18.000> motor<00:03:18.270> will<00:03:18.540> spin<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:19.080> in<00:03:19.320> the

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
will your motor will spin the in the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.940 
will your motor will spin the in the
other<00:03:19.620> direction

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.380

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
motor you might have to drill the the

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.960 
motor you might have to drill the the
inside<00:04:13.290> of<00:04:13.680> the<00:04:13.830> hole<00:04:14.040> for<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.460> propeller<00:04:14.910> a

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
inside of the hole for the propeller a

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.360 
inside of the hole for the propeller a
little<00:04:15.300> bit<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.630> get<00:04:15.750> it<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:16.020> fit<00:04:16.260> but<00:04:16.890> it<00:04:17.220> will

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
little bit to get it to fit but it will

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.660 
little bit to get it to fit but it will
fit<00:04:17.840> so<00:04:18.840> I<00:04:18.870> definitely<00:04:19.350> recommend<00:04:19.920> that<00:04:20.250> you

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
fit so I definitely recommend that you

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.430 
fit so I definitely recommend that you
can't<00:04:20.910> fly<00:04:21.150> with<00:04:21.359> ASP<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.690> propeller<00:04:22.140> if<00:04:22.320> you

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
can't fly with ASP a propeller if you

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.900 
can't fly with ASP a propeller if you
want<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.830> but<00:04:23.250> I<00:04:23.520> wouldn't<00:04:24.210> I<00:04:24.570> wouldn't<00:04:25.260> do<00:04:25.410> it

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
want to but I wouldn't I wouldn't do it

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.930 
want to but I wouldn't I wouldn't do it
just<00:04:26.910> you<00:04:27.570> get<00:04:27.780> very<00:04:28.230> poor<00:04:28.530> performance

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:32.610 

okay<00:04:31.420> the<00:04:31.570> other<00:04:31.690> thing<00:04:31.930> that<00:04:31.960> you<00:04:32.170> want<00:04:32.290> to<00:04:32.440> do

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
okay the other thing that you want to do

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.200 
okay the other thing that you want to do
is<00:04:32.890> you<00:04:33.010> want<00:04:33.190> to<00:04:33.280> make<00:04:33.400> sure<00:04:33.430> that<00:04:33.760> you<00:04:33.910> have

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
is you want to make sure that you have

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:36.450 
is you want to make sure that you have
your<00:04:34.750> propeller<00:04:35.380> facing<00:04:36.100> the<00:04:36.280> right

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
your propeller facing the right

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.120 
your propeller facing the right
direction<00:04:37.170> and<00:04:38.170> this<00:04:38.410> does<00:04:38.620> make<00:04:38.830> a

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
direction and this does make a

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.150 
direction and this does make a
difference<00:04:39.840> if<00:04:40.840> you<00:04:40.990> take<00:04:41.170> a<00:04:41.200> close<00:04:41.590> look<00:04:41.950> at

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
difference if you take a close look at

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.420 
difference if you take a close look at
your<00:04:42.190> propeller<00:04:43.060> you'll<00:04:43.810> notice<00:04:44.290> that<00:04:44.620> there

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
your propeller you'll notice that there

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.670 
your propeller you'll notice that there
is<00:04:45.460> a<00:04:46.120> curved<00:04:46.870> side<00:04:47.790> one<00:04:48.790> side<00:04:48.820> curves<00:04:49.570> up<00:04:50.170> and

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
is a curved side one side curves up and

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:56.400 
is a curved side one side curves up and
the<00:04:51.190> other<00:04:51.340> side<00:04:52.080> curse<00:04:53.080> in<00:04:53.970> so<00:04:55.110> what<00:04:56.110> you<00:04:56.260> want

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
the other side curse in so what you want

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.590 
the other side curse in so what you want
to<00:04:56.500> do<00:04:56.680> is<00:04:57.040> you<00:04:57.310> just<00:04:57.340> want<00:04:57.700> to<00:04:57.760> make<00:04:57.910> sure<00:04:57.940> the

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
to do is you just want to make sure the

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.600 
to do is you just want to make sure the
part<00:04:58.900> of<00:04:58.990> the<00:04:59.080> propeller<00:04:59.530> that's<00:04:59.890> curved<00:05:00.340> up

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
part of the propeller that's curved up

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.790 
part of the propeller that's curved up
you<00:05:01.330> want<00:05:01.480> to<00:05:01.510> make<00:05:01.570> sure<00:05:01.810> that<00:05:02.140> part<00:05:02.560> is

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
you want to make sure that part is

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.670 
you want to make sure that part is
facing<00:05:03.640> the<00:05:03.760> front<00:05:03.790> of<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:04.450> plane<00:05:04.750> or<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.500> way

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
facing the front of the plane or the way

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.470 
facing the front of the plane or the way
or<00:05:05.950> the<00:05:06.250> direction<00:05:06.670> that<00:05:06.820> you<00:05:06.970> want<00:05:07.150> the<00:05:07.240> plane

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
or the direction that you want the plane

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.740 
or the direction that you want the plane
to<00:05:07.690> go<00:05:07.870> in<00:05:08.370> this<00:05:09.370> is<00:05:09.430> a<00:05:09.580> really<00:05:10.030> easy<00:05:10.210> mistake

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
to go in this is a really easy mistake

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.320 
to go in this is a really easy mistake
to<00:05:11.020> make<00:05:11.200> a<00:05:12.010> lot<00:05:12.460> of<00:05:12.580> beginners<00:05:12.940> make<00:05:13.180> this

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
to make a lot of beginners make this

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.820 
to make a lot of beginners make this
mistake<00:05:13.840> so<00:05:14.580> just<00:05:15.580> check<00:05:16.240> that<00:05:16.450> make<00:05:17.200> sure<00:05:17.410> you

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
mistake so just check that make sure you

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.940 
mistake so just check that make sure you
have<00:05:17.860> the<00:05:18.130> curved<00:05:18.490> side<00:05:18.910> facing<00:05:19.600> forward

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
have the curved side facing forward

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.670 
have the curved side facing forward
most<00:05:21.670> of<00:05:21.880> the<00:05:22.060> most<00:05:22.360> of<00:05:22.480> the<00:05:22.570> time<00:05:22.780> the<00:05:23.140> writing

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
most of the most of the time the writing

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.740 
most of the most of the time the writing
on<00:05:23.890> the<00:05:24.250> propeller<00:05:24.670> if<00:05:24.940> there's<00:05:25.150> some<00:05:25.330> numbers

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
on the propeller if there's some numbers

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:28.470 
on the propeller if there's some numbers
on<00:05:25.900> them<00:05:26.140> that<00:05:27.070> typically<00:05:27.550> will<00:05:27.850> face<00:05:28.180> the

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:28.480 
on them that typically will face the

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.880 
on them that typically will face the
front<00:05:28.780> of<00:05:29.020> the<00:05:29.710> plane<00:05:30.010> also<00:05:30.400> so<00:05:30.940> you<00:05:31.030> can<00:05:31.890> do

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
front of the plane also so you can do

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.360 
front of the plane also so you can do
that<00:05:33.100> some<00:05:33.970> point<00:05:34.740> you<00:05:35.740> can't<00:05:35.980> do<00:05:36.190> that

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
that some point you can't do that

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:39.870 
that some point you can't do that
sometimes<00:05:37.800> but<00:05:38.800> I<00:05:38.830> would<00:05:39.070> really<00:05:39.250> just<00:05:39.610> look

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
sometimes but I would really just look

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.390 
sometimes but I would really just look
to<00:05:40.120> see<00:05:40.150> if<00:05:40.600> the<00:05:40.750> curve<00:05:41.110> the<00:05:41.890> part<00:05:42.160> that's

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
to see if the curve the part that's

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.240 
to see if the curve the part that's
curved<00:05:42.730> outward<00:05:43.270> is<00:05:43.680> facing<00:05:44.680> the<00:05:44.800> front<00:05:44.830> of

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
curved outward is facing the front of

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:53.770 
curved outward is facing the front of
the<00:05:45.370> plane

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.690 

you

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.890 

okay<00:05:57.700> guys<00:05:57.850> the<00:05:58.060> other<00:05:58.150> thing<00:05:58.420> that<00:05:58.450> you<00:05:58.690> want

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
okay guys the other thing that you want

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:01.770 
okay guys the other thing that you want
to<00:05:58.990> do<00:05:59.200> is<00:05:59.440> add<00:05:59.830> some<00:05:59.890> carbon<00:06:00.670> fiber<00:06:00.700> to<00:06:01.660> the

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
to do is add some carbon fiber to the

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.260 
to do is add some carbon fiber to the
plane<00:06:02.050> to<00:06:02.350> help<00:06:02.590> stiffen<00:06:03.130> it<00:06:03.460> up<00:06:03.610> a<00:06:03.730> little<00:06:03.910> bit

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
plane to help stiffen it up a little bit

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.110 
plane to help stiffen it up a little bit
make<00:06:04.570> it<00:06:04.690> stronger

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
make it stronger

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.970 
make it stronger
what<00:06:07.120> I<00:06:07.150> did<00:06:07.660> here<00:06:07.690> and<00:06:08.410> what<00:06:08.500> a<00:06:08.530> lot<00:06:08.710> of<00:06:08.770> guys

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:08.980 
what I did here and what a lot of guys

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.630 
what I did here and what a lot of guys
do<00:06:09.280> is<00:06:09.430> I<00:06:09.610> edit<00:06:10.210> a<00:06:10.390> carbon<00:06:10.840> fiber<00:06:11.100> spar<00:06:12.100> along

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640 
do is I edit a carbon fiber spar along

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.510 
do is I edit a carbon fiber spar along
the<00:06:13.050> underside<00:06:14.050> of<00:06:14.350> the<00:06:14.590> fuselage<00:06:15.130> there

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
the underside of the fuselage there

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:16.620 
the underside of the fuselage there
you'll<00:06:15.760> see<00:06:15.940> that<00:06:15.970> there's<00:06:16.270> actually<00:06:16.570> a

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
you'll see that there's actually a

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.260 
you'll see that there's actually a
little<00:06:16.840> channel<00:06:17.170> there<00:06:17.530> I<00:06:17.740> added<00:06:18.580> a<00:06:18.820> three

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
little channel there I added a three

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.110 
little channel there I added a three
millimeter<00:06:19.570> spar<00:06:20.490> or<00:06:21.490> three<00:06:21.730> millimeter

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
millimeter spar or three millimeter

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.940 
millimeter spar or three millimeter
carbon<00:06:22.870> fiber<00:06:23.140> rod<00:06:23.830> that's<00:06:24.340> a<00:06:24.520> solid<00:06:25.030> rod

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
carbon fiber rod that's a solid rod

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.880 
carbon fiber rod that's a solid rod
there<00:06:26.950> and<00:06:27.280> I<00:06:27.930> there's<00:06:28.930> already<00:06:29.170> a<00:06:29.410> channel

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:29.890 
there and I there's already a channel

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.550 
there and I there's already a channel
there<00:06:30.070> that<00:06:30.280> you<00:06:30.460> use<00:06:30.730> but<00:06:31.060> I<00:06:31.090> actually<00:06:31.410> cut<00:06:32.410> it

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:32.560 
there that you use but I actually cut it

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.380 
there that you use but I actually cut it
a<00:06:32.650> little<00:06:32.950> bit<00:06:33.250> bigger<00:06:33.430> just<00:06:33.820> so<00:06:33.910> I<00:06:33.970> could<00:06:34.060> fit

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.390 
a little bit bigger just so I could fit

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:36.450 
a little bit bigger just so I could fit
that<00:06:34.630> in<00:06:34.870> there<00:06:35.080> and<00:06:35.260> then<00:06:35.680> I<00:06:35.740> spray<00:06:36.130> painted

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:36.460 
that in there and then I spray painted

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.370 
that in there and then I spray painted
it<00:06:36.580> white<00:06:36.850> to<00:06:37.180> start<00:06:37.450> blend<00:06:37.780> it<00:06:37.900> in<00:06:38.050> a<00:06:38.080> little

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:38.380 
it white to start blend it in a little

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.390 
it white to start blend it in a little
bit<00:06:38.470> better<00:06:38.620> the<00:06:39.340> other<00:06:39.490> thing<00:06:39.730> is<00:06:40.060> I<00:06:40.090> added<00:06:40.480> a

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 
bit better the other thing is I added a

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:46.200 
bit better the other thing is I added a
carbon<00:06:42.400> fiber<00:06:44.400> tube<00:06:45.400> right<00:06:45.820> here<00:06:46.090> I<00:06:46.120> think

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210 
carbon fiber tube right here I think

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.000 
carbon fiber tube right here I think
this<00:06:46.480> was<00:06:46.690> a<00:06:46.720> four<00:06:47.020> millimeter<00:06:47.260> you<00:06:47.770> could<00:06:47.920> do

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.010 
this was a four millimeter you could do

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.360 
this was a four millimeter you could do
a<00:06:48.040> 4-3<00:06:48.640> ml<00:06:48.820> or<00:06:48.970> three<00:06:49.540> millimeter<00:06:50.020> on<00:06:50.350> the<00:06:50.740> vert

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:51.370 
a 4-3 ml or three millimeter on the vert

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.840 
a 4-3 ml or three millimeter on the vert
on<00:06:51.640> the<00:06:52.110> horizontal<00:06:53.250> stabilizer<00:06:54.250> there<00:06:54.670> I

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:54.850 
on the horizontal stabilizer there I

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:59.910 
on the horizontal stabilizer there I
also<00:06:55.750> took<00:06:55.930> and<00:06:56.370> put<00:06:57.370> a<00:06:57.960> carbon<00:06:58.960> fiber<00:06:59.170> tube<00:06:59.590> up

00:06:59.910 --> 00:06:59.920 
also took and put a carbon fiber tube up

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.970 
also took and put a carbon fiber tube up
through<00:07:00.220> this<00:07:00.340> hole<00:07:00.400> at<00:07:01.150> the<00:07:01.570> end<00:07:01.840> of<00:07:02.020> the<00:07:02.260> tail

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:02.980 
through this hole at the end of the tail

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.630 
through this hole at the end of the tail
I<00:07:03.310> put<00:07:03.880> that<00:07:04.030> a<00:07:04.600> tube<00:07:05.140> up<00:07:05.470> through<00:07:05.980> the

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:06.640 
I put that a tube up through the

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.650 
I put that a tube up through the
vertical<00:07:06.970> stabilizer<00:07:08.670> up<00:07:09.670> through<00:07:10.060> here<00:07:10.450> and

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:10.660 
vertical stabilizer up through here and

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.080 
vertical stabilizer up through here and
to<00:07:11.020> do<00:07:11.140> that<00:07:11.320> I<00:07:11.380> used<00:07:11.710> a<00:07:11.830> drill<00:07:12.160> bit<00:07:12.430> that<00:07:13.030> I

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:13.090 
to do that I used a drill bit that I

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.690 
to do that I used a drill bit that I
just<00:07:13.480> kind<00:07:13.690> of<00:07:13.840> hand<00:07:14.410> drilled<00:07:14.920> I<00:07:15.130> kind<00:07:15.370> of<00:07:15.460> put

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:15.700 
just kind of hand drilled I kind of put

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:18.540 
just kind of hand drilled I kind of put
the<00:07:15.820> drill<00:07:16.030> bit<00:07:16.240> in<00:07:16.450> and<00:07:16.990> just<00:07:17.170> turned<00:07:18.040> it<00:07:18.280> very

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:18.550 
the drill bit in and just turned it very

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.390 
the drill bit in and just turned it very
slowly<00:07:18.970> and<00:07:19.330> it<00:07:19.570> went<00:07:19.780> up<00:07:20.020> into<00:07:20.470> the<00:07:21.010> tail

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400 
slowly and it went up into the tail

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.110 
slowly and it went up into the tail
about<00:07:21.700> three<00:07:22.120> or<00:07:22.270> four<00:07:22.480> inches<00:07:23.280> up<00:07:24.280> up<00:07:24.730> into

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 
about three or four inches up up into

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.290 
about three or four inches up up into
the<00:07:25.270> vertical<00:07:25.600> stabilizer<00:07:26.190> so<00:07:27.190> you<00:07:28.060> know<00:07:28.180> if

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:28.300 
the vertical stabilizer so you know if

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:29.640 
the vertical stabilizer so you know if
you<00:07:28.420> want<00:07:28.630> to<00:07:28.720> strengthen<00:07:29.020> plane<00:07:29.470> a<00:07:29.500> little

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:29.650 
you want to strengthen plane a little

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.670 
you want to strengthen plane a little
bit<00:07:29.920> those<00:07:30.130> are<00:07:30.310> the<00:07:30.400> besides<00:07:31.210> putting

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 
bit those are the besides putting

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.810 
bit those are the besides putting
replacing<00:07:32.680> the<00:07:32.770> wing<00:07:32.950> spar<00:07:33.370> I<00:07:33.400> think<00:07:33.670> those

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:33.820 
replacing the wing spar I think those

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.440 
replacing the wing spar I think those
are<00:07:34.060> some<00:07:34.360> good<00:07:35.580> good<00:07:36.580> places<00:07:36.850> where<00:07:37.180> you<00:07:37.270> can

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:37.450 
are some good good places where you can

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:47.980 
are some good good places where you can
strengthen<00:07:37.750> the<00:07:38.080> plane

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:47.990 

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.050
