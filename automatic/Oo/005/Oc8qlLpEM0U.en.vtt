00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:24.460
 this tutorial on how to create a banner 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:28.630
 party channel of either the new design 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:31.440
 of youtube 2013 without programs without estes 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.090
 virus and nothing like that 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.970
 totally online the first thing we have 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.700
 What to do is enter the page that 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:44.570
 I leave in the description and the following is 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:47.840
 upload a photo in this case I already have 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.960
 Attach a photo prior pre keel 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.440
 of beer already depending on its 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.510
 channel either of gaming technology 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.379
 all that is mine is gaming is 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.659
 totally from minecraft and I'm sorry that 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.049
 we would have to add a photo 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:11.730
 for 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:13.159
 of a special photo to be able to guide us 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.100
 p 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:20.020
 I also leave the link where the serve 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.020
 so they can save it 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.870
 and since we have it great then 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.420
 we would have these lines and then we would 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.240
 this is totally what will be 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.340
 except in our banana ok in this case 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.440
 I want to add a text in all the 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.610
 people in this picture 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:46.180
 like a little cartoon symbol 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.750
 well here we put for example in my 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:54.530
 name of the channel is today with apps 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.530
 90 in this case the one with capital letters 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.810
 what is about 90 here we will have 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.180
 enough 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.660
 style of letter 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:14.420
 for example other families are not 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:16.730
 and so they make it here 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.129
 we could lend 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.549
 the red lines that the image sells is 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:25.040
 how far does he go completely sure of the 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.950
 area that girls are never going to move 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:32.000
 blue until this tablet and the following 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.170
 is the desk so in this case I 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.510
 I want more or less 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.870
 well and let's put one more color 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.870
 Dark 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:53.690
 this high is our 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:55.760
 suppose it is the name of the channel and 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.390
 we can put 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.760
 ps 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.689
 do not 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.689
 we'll see 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.970
 as then 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.130
 how good 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:15.630
 we can change the font for 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.630
 example for example to this pair 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:28.280
 and this I say I already do it fast and my 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:32.150
 real go with this already 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.720
 good since we have we can add by 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:43.090
 example an image of a peak by 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:43.090
 example speak talking in the little ones 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:50.060
 we close like that to make it fast I'll go 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.810
 to duplicate what we explain with this 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.550
 tool of these little stars then 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:00.330
 we turn with this 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:03.030
 and we started to put it here for example 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.070
 then suppose that this is already 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.420
 our image what we would have to 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:12.660
 to do is eliminate this image and 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:17.970
 we have to give in our vain then 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:19.500
 we give you here to download let's go 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.139
 to save it on the desktop for 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.820
 do it fast 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.650
 6 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.870
 now we go with her that we are in 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.249
 paint is what we should do 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.349
 is 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:34.400
 paste our image as it is not of the 

00:04:32.349 --> 00:04:37.479
 correct proportions 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.479
 suppose it is 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.280
 and we will change the size ok 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.930
 let's see that it does not keep the regression 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:51.260
 training in the aspect we put 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:55.290
 2 thousand 120 x 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:58.380
 1,193 and well we usually get 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.860
 would thus convert the image and already 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.610
 we can for example 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.610
 save 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:10.350
 now let's put that without title is 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:14.130
 good since I have already saved 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:16.620
 we would already have what is our image 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.920
 well here it's a matter of what 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.770
 enter your channel and it would be all good 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.060
 prothese liked I hope it's from 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:28.480
 help do not have to create 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:31.140
 absolutely nothing and good 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.140
 goodbye
