00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello to all our competitors here 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.180
 so today we count that you can fun it's how to get a cd but 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:09.639
 by his side here 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:11.139
 transparent 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.389
 so percent an hour 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:14.859
 to complicate 

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:16.619
 you will need 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.239
 a transformer see a little 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:21.339
 around he set himself 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.720
 we can not continue 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.859
 a little word is to say 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:27.760
 above 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.489
 goal is set in these countries 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:31.499
 Yes 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:32.950
 for how long 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.950
 projection to the head 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.690
 but that's all 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.880
 wauquiez there is an article on the camera she is any other pressure point 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.880
 until the end 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.550
 I think we have a little 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.900
 at the rochelle 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.900
 the married - 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.450
 to angels 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.410
 the thief so I do not believe in flames 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.460
 to set foot there like that why the first three years 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.760
 Christine Lagarde a few hours 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.090
 whatever 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.830
 here's the problem 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.090
 18 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.280
 Villiers' call was not ready to take in person 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.250
 a little hard not me a survey conducted with the afp 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.350
 so the debates 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.350
 the thing 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.740
 the third deputy 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.410
 138 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.970
 that's when I go on the plane and sometimes we could progress to 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:43.520
 when I'm on the bench 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.390
 poitiers of the ends of 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.390
 over the star beams that is here 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.680
 seeing the door back the blunders 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.860
 The imperial homologue coating 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.469
 the idea bardot 

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:11.469
 yes especially as to compete in power 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:16.839
 for as much the contents 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:28.619
 so 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:39.259
 for 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:59.429
 the killer to the 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:02.349
 wait back to business in europe one of them to small glitters 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.759
 frozen laughs 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:09.119
 I stop and motels from his extensive tour 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:12.119
 mclaren and I'm proud that he broke the 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:14.159
 in what way 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.700
 we saw her sides louisiane which nick fry that I was 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:20.619
 the other side 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:23.590
 your body can not plan your reaction 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.999
 CertEurope 

00:03:24.999 --> 00:03:27.999
 yes again it is that we are like that 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:34.699
 and well near the breakthroughs of transportation at the heart of what you want 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:36.110
