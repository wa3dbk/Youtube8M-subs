00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
pieces of paper and I scrolled and

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.280

screamed<00:02:21.510> onto<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.050> writing<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:23.240> a

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
screamed onto the writing and a

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.090 
screamed onto the writing and a
completely<00:02:25.290> different<00:02:25.740> kind<00:02:25.980> of

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
completely different kind of

completely different kind of
autobiography<00:02:27.230> emerged<00:02:28.230> using<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:28.950> lot<00:02:29.070> of

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
autobiography emerged using a lot of

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.780 
autobiography emerged using a lot of
metaphor

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
metaphor

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.440 
metaphor
and<00:02:30.000> images<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:32.909> was<00:02:33.030> absolutely

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
and images and and that was absolutely

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.610 
and images and and that was absolutely
life-saving<00:02:34.170> for<00:02:34.349> me

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
life-saving for me

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.610 
life-saving for me
and<00:02:35.299> so<00:02:36.299> that<00:02:36.510> was<00:02:36.599> what<00:02:36.750> brought<00:02:36.780> me<00:02:37.200> into<00:02:37.379> the

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
and so that was what brought me into the

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
various other marginal states like that

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.240 
various other marginal states like that
when<00:03:02.730> people<00:03:02.909> are<00:03:03.150> in<00:03:03.209> personal<00:03:04.200> trouble<00:03:04.680> it's

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
when people are in personal trouble it's

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.339 
when people are in personal trouble it's
poetry<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.760> they<00:03:05.849> both<00:03:06.000> read<00:03:06.239> and<00:03:06.450> write<00:03:06.840> I

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
poetry that they both read and write I

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.729 
poetry that they both read and write I
think<00:03:08.010> what<00:03:08.940> poetry<00:03:09.420> does<00:03:09.659> is<00:03:09.959> it<00:03:10.079> uses<00:03:10.560> our

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
think what poetry does is it uses our

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.490 
think what poetry does is it uses our
ordinary<00:03:11.190> old<00:03:11.340> everyday<00:03:11.780> words<00:03:12.780> our<00:03:13.139> ordinary

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
ordinary old everyday words our ordinary

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.399 
ordinary old everyday words our ordinary
old<00:03:13.620> language<00:03:14.099> and<00:03:14.840> it<00:03:15.840> puts<00:03:16.049> them<00:03:16.230> together

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
old language and it puts them together

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.830 
old language and it puts them together
in<00:03:17.099> different<00:03:17.280> ways<00:03:17.549> so<00:03:18.000> rather<00:03:18.239> than<00:03:18.480> tearing

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
in different ways so rather than tearing

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.280 
in different ways so rather than tearing
apart<00:03:19.109> I<00:03:19.680> think<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.909> think<00:03:21.180> poetry<00:03:21.359> puts

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
apart I think I think poetry puts

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.289 
apart I think I think poetry puts
elements<00:03:23.099> together<00:03:23.310> that<00:03:23.730> weren't<00:03:24.000> together

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
elements together that weren't together

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:28.729 
elements together that weren't together
before<00:03:25.079> and<00:03:25.670> it's<00:03:26.670> that<00:03:27.319> that<00:03:28.319> that

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
before and it's that that that

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.580 
before and it's that that that
congruence<00:03:29.459> that<00:03:30.019> meeting<00:03:31.019> of<00:03:31.170> different

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
congruence that meeting of different

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.330 
congruence that meeting of different
things<00:03:32.030> that<00:03:33.030> can<00:03:33.209> make<00:03:33.420> poetry<00:03:34.010> flash<00:03:35.010> fire

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
things that can make poetry flash fire

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.390 
things that can make poetry flash fire
and<00:03:36.109> and<00:03:37.109> make<00:03:37.290> things<00:03:37.590> happen<00:03:37.769> for<00:03:38.129> us<00:03:38.160> so<00:03:38.340> I

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
and and make things happen for us so I

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.430 
and and make things happen for us so I
think<00:03:38.459> one<00:03:38.730> of<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.910> really<00:03:39.440> significant

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
think one of the really significant

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.240 
think one of the really significant
writings<00:03:41.340> for<00:03:41.790> me<00:03:42.000> is<00:03:42.329> his<00:03:43.290> words<00:03:43.590> with<00:03:43.829> long

writings for me is his words with long

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.170 
writings for me is his words with long
poem<00:03:44.639> the<00:03:44.879> prelude<00:03:45.269> which<00:03:46.519> tells<00:03:47.519> of<00:03:47.970> his

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
poem the prelude which tells of his

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.569 
poem the prelude which tells of his
childhood<00:03:48.690> it's<00:03:49.049> it's<00:03:49.650> autobiographical<00:03:50.040> it

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.050 
the Lake District and it's it I think
it's<00:03:56.519> significant<00:03:57.030> for<00:03:57.209> me<00:03:57.389> because<00:03:57.930> it<00:03:58.230> is<00:03:58.290> so

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
profoundly stronger than your internal

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.619 
profoundly stronger than your internal
critic<00:05:11.409> and<00:05:11.740> in<00:05:12.490> our<00:05:12.639> culture<00:05:12.909> we<00:05:13.270> tend<00:05:13.300> to

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:13.629 
critic and in our culture we tend to

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:16.080 
critic and in our culture we tend to
hear<00:05:13.810> our<00:05:13.960> internal<00:05:14.470> critics<00:05:14.889> too<00:05:15.550> strongly

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
hear our internal critics too strongly

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:18.779 
hear our internal critics too strongly
and<00:05:16.330> I<00:05:16.990> think<00:05:17.199> one<00:05:17.380> of<00:05:17.409> the<00:05:17.590> real<00:05:17.860> forces<00:05:18.370> of

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
and I think one of the real forces of

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.040 
and I think one of the real forces of
therapeutic<00:05:19.449> and<00:05:19.569> personal<00:05:19.990> development

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
therapeutic and personal development

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.010 
therapeutic and personal development
writing<00:05:20.770> is<00:05:21.039> to<00:05:21.310> enable<00:05:21.550> us<00:05:21.880> to<00:05:21.909> hear<00:05:22.300> our

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
writing is to enable us to hear our

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.740 
writing is to enable us to hear our
internal<00:05:23.800> mentors<00:05:24.250> are<00:05:24.490> joyful<00:05:25.060> sites<00:05:25.389> our

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
internal mentors are joyful sites our

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.159 
internal mentors are joyful sites our
inner<00:05:26.050> children<00:05:26.620> the<00:05:27.009> life<00:05:27.250> force<00:05:27.990> within<00:05:28.990> us

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
inner children the life force within us

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:30.600 
inner children the life force within us
and<00:05:29.409> I<00:05:29.440> think<00:05:29.500> perhaps<00:05:29.919> that's<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.430> most

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
and I think perhaps that's the most

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.730 
and I think perhaps that's the most
important<00:05:31.180> element<00:05:32.080> of<00:05:32.199> it<00:05:33.090> this<00:05:34.090> book<00:05:34.740> writes

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
important element of it this book writes

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.279
