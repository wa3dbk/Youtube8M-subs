further maybe a 600 700 yards to the

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.550 
further maybe a 600 700 yards to the
west<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:45.030> have<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.209> train<00:02:45.660> that's<00:02:46.020> been<00:02:46.230> blown

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
west you have a train that's been blown

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.520 
west you have a train that's been blown
over<00:02:46.950> about<00:02:47.130> 30<00:02:47.370> cars<00:02:47.730> have<00:02:48.120> been<00:02:48.360> blown<00:02:49.200> over

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
over about 30 cars have been blown over

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.320 
over about 30 cars have been blown over
on<00:02:49.650> their<00:02:49.800> side<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:50.070> couple<00:02:50.490> of<00:02:50.580> sawing<00:02:51.000> down<00:02:51.150> an

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
on their side a couple of sawing down an

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.510 
on their side a couple of sawing down an
embankment<00:02:51.480> that<00:02:52.110> whole<00:02:52.530> back<00:02:52.860> end<00:02:53.160> of<00:02:53.370> that

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
embankment that whole back end of that

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.520 
embankment that whole back end of that
train<00:02:53.820> has<00:02:54.090> been<00:02:54.390> derailed<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:55.080> there's<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.320> big

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
train has been derailed so there's a big

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.620 
train has been derailed so there's a big
mess<00:02:55.770> there<00:02:55.800> it's<00:02:56.250> kind<00:02:56.400> of<00:02:56.459> fallen<00:02:57.120> over<00:02:57.390> on

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
mess there it's kind of fallen over on

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.540 
mess there it's kind of fallen over on
to<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.230> other<00:02:58.380> side<00:02:58.770> of<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:58.950> track<00:02:59.220> so<00:02:59.250> it's

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
to the other side of the track so it's

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.370 
to the other side of the track so it's
blocked<00:02:59.760> both<00:03:00.120> ways<00:03:00.450> for<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.720> trains<00:03:00.989> up<00:03:01.200> here

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
blocked both ways for the trains up here

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.130 
blocked both ways for the trains up here
definitely<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.010> lot<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.400> damage<00:03:02.730> that<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:03.360> is

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
definitely a lot of damage that that is

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.540 
definitely a lot of damage that that is
going<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.410> take<00:03:04.530> a<00:03:04.560> long<00:03:04.890> time<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.310> clean<00:03:05.520> up

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
going to take a long time to clean up

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.400 
going to take a long time to clean up
but<00:03:05.910> uh<00:03:05.970> fortunately<00:03:06.720> we're<00:03:06.840> not<00:03:06.930> hearing<00:03:07.140> too

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410
