00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
like the beginning and basically I

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.590 
like the beginning and basically I
wanted<00:00:35.539> to<00:00:35.660> kind<00:00:36.170> of<00:00:36.230> explore<00:00:37.190> why<00:00:37.670> Bach's

still<00:00:42.469> so<00:00:42.649> relevant<00:00:42.829> today<00:00:43.280> why<00:00:43.850> his<00:00:44.390> sonatas

00:00:45.369 --> 00:00:45.379 
still so relevant today why his sonatas

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
remember how to laugh so I found that

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.230 
remember how to laugh so I found that
kind<00:01:13.969> of<00:01:14.090> metaphor<00:01:14.479> very<00:01:14.750> touching<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:19.240> then

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
kind of metaphor very touching and then

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.999 
kind of metaphor very touching and then
interestingly<00:01:20.750> enough<00:01:21.320> structurally

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
interestingly enough structurally

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:24.219 
interestingly enough structurally
locking<00:01:22.789> is<00:01:23.149> written<00:01:23.600> in<00:01:23.689> the<00:01:23.780> form<00:01:23.930> of<00:01:24.109> the

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
locking is written in the form of the

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.410 
locking is written in the form of the
Chaconne<00:01:24.619> which<00:01:25.100> of<00:01:25.280> course<00:01:25.310> is<00:01:25.789> related<00:01:25.939> to

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
Chaconne which of course is related to

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.660

what's<00:02:18.530> so<00:02:18.770> fascinating<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.760> me<00:02:19.790> is<00:02:20.180> how<00:02:20.660> they

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
what's so fascinating to me is how they

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.440 
what's so fascinating to me is how they
take<00:02:21.560> that<00:02:21.800> tradition<00:02:22.310> for<00:02:22.520> mock<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:22.880> make<00:02:23.270> it

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
take that tradition for mock and make it

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.930 
take that tradition for mock and make it
completely<00:02:23.600> their<00:02:24.110> own<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:24.710> I<00:02:24.980> wanted<00:02:25.790> this

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
completely their own so I wanted this

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.240 
completely their own so I wanted this
program<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.570> be<00:02:26.720> about<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.440> connection<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.160> the

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
program to be about a connection to the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.390 
program to be about a connection to the
past<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.820> how<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.150> moves<00:02:29.510> as<00:02:29.690> the<00:02:29.840> future

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.560 

they<00:02:36.400> didn't<00:02:36.640> want<00:02:36.820> this<00:02:36.970> program<00:02:37.180> to<00:02:37.390> be

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
they didn't want this program to be

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.840 
they didn't want this program to be
about<00:02:37.840> me<00:02:38.110> playing<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.620> violin<00:02:39.070> I<00:02:39.280> wanted<00:02:39.730> it

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
about me playing the violin I wanted it

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.090 
about me playing the violin I wanted it
to<00:02:40.000> be<00:02:40.180> about<00:02:40.450> taking<00:02:40.780> a<00:02:41.050> journey<00:02:41.260> from<00:02:41.980> the

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
to be about taking a journey from the

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.730 
to be about taking a journey from the
past<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.120> present<00:02:43.210> and<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.110> looking<00:02:44.530> into

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
past to the present and and looking into

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.830 
past to the present and and looking into
the<00:02:44.830> future<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:46.270> I<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.750> feel<00:02:47.200> because<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:48.250> Y<00:02:48.400> is

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
the future and I I feel because the Y is

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.860 
the future and I I feel because the Y is
kind<00:02:49.840> of<00:02:49.930> this<00:02:50.050> great<00:02:50.560> cultural<00:02:51.070> entity<00:02:51.870> it
