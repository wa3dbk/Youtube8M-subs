00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:03.950 
okay so this is the these are the three

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.619 
okay so this is the these are the three
lenses<00:00:04.950> with<00:00:05.130> three<00:00:05.400> different<00:00:05.520> focal<00:00:06.029> same

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
lenses with three different focal same

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.379 
lenses with three different focal same
focal<00:00:06.990> lengths<00:00:07.370> this<00:00:08.370> is<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.550> 85mm

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
focal lengths this is the 85mm

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.289 
focal lengths this is the 85mm
and<00:00:09.690> no<00:00:09.900> they're<00:00:10.110> not<00:00:10.820> 85<00:00:11.820> millimeter<00:00:14.120> this<00:00:15.120> is

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
and no they're not 85 millimeter this is

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.390 
and no they're not 85 millimeter this is
a<00:00:15.360> 70<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.780> 200<00:00:16.609> and<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:18.289> 85<00:00:19.289> millimeter<00:00:19.800> 1/8<00:00:20.130> I

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
a 70 to 200 and the 85 millimeter 1/8 I

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.950 
a 70 to 200 and the 85 millimeter 1/8 I
had<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.510> 25<00:00:21.990> millimeter<00:00:22.289> 25<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.279> 105<00:00:23.960> also

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
had the 25 millimeter 25 to 105 also

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.130 
had the 25 millimeter 25 to 105 also
part<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.350> test<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:26.510> did<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:27.599> review<00:00:27.990> and

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
part of this test I did this review and

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.019 
part of this test I did this review and
then<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.260> dumped<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.340> decided<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:29.939> not

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
then I dumped that I decided it's not

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.049 
then I dumped that I decided it's not
even<00:00:30.240> worth<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.570> we<00:00:31.260> should<00:00:31.410> be<00:00:31.880> considering<00:00:32.880> a

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
even worth it we should be considering a

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.709 
even worth it we should be considering a
24<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.600> 105<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.260> test<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.719> doesn't

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
24 to 105 in this test it just doesn't

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.170 
24 to 105 in this test it just doesn't
even<00:00:36.780> fit<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.440> boat<00:00:37.790> who<00:00:38.790> knows<00:00:38.940> maybe

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
even fit in the boat who knows maybe

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.060 
even fit in the boat who knows maybe
I'll<00:00:39.329> grab<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.570> still<00:00:39.930> here's<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.710> 50

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
I'll grab it still here's a 50

I'll grab it still here's a 50
millimeter<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:42.239> let's<00:00:42.420> take<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> look<00:00:42.780> at<00:00:42.870> the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
millimeter so let's take a look at the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.660 
millimeter so let's take a look at the
image<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.800> what<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.010> looks<00:00:44.160> like<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.550> know

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
same thumbnail with this since this is

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.290 
same thumbnail with this since this is
85<00:00:51.539> millimeter<00:00:52.199> by<00:00:52.500> millimeter<00:00:53.300> perspective

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
85 millimeter by millimeter perspective

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.450 
85 millimeter by millimeter perspective
it's<00:00:54.809> gonna<00:00:54.930> be<00:00:55.050> tighter<00:00:55.320> but<00:00:56.100> if<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.280> see

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
it's gonna be tighter but if you see

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.029 
it's gonna be tighter but if you see
this<00:00:56.840> highlight<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.109> right<00:00:58.620> here<00:00:58.859> that

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
little distance there and I use my mouse

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.900 
little distance there and I use my mouse
to<00:01:00.840> see<00:01:01.079> how<00:01:01.170> far<00:01:01.440> it's<00:01:01.590> away<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.160> then<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:02.879> a

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
range just flattens it out and gives you

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.960 
range just flattens it out and gives you
a<00:02:14.190> different<00:02:14.550> color<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:14.850> fact<00:02:16.970> interpretation

would<00:02:22.440> be<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.710> slight<00:02:22.980> advantage<00:02:23.130> of<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:24.380> 70

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
would be the slight advantage of the 70

would be the slight advantage of the 70
to<00:02:26.000> 200<00:02:27.050> as<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.200> can<00:02:28.350> see<00:02:28.590> you'll<00:02:28.770> get<00:02:28.980> more

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
to 200 as you can see you'll get more

this<00:02:48.780> is<00:02:48.930> beautiful<00:02:49.350> now<00:02:50.360> like<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:51.510> said<00:02:51.570> that's

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
this is beautiful now like I said that's

wanted something to fade off you'd be
faster<00:02:59.459> you<00:03:00.150> would<00:03:00.269> use<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.739> 70-200<00:03:02.120> you'll

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
faster you would use the 70-200 you'll

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.080 
faster you would use the 70-200 you'll
get<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:03.300> lot<00:03:03.720> more<00:03:03.750> fade<00:03:04.260> out<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.680> bokeh<00:03:05.550> faster

get a lot more fade out and bokeh faster
but<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:07.110> also<00:03:07.260> have<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.739> have<00:03:08.250> your<00:03:08.400> plenty<00:03:08.730> of

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
but you also have to have your plenty of

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.610 
but you also have to have your plenty of
talent<00:03:09.300> on<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.450> same<00:03:09.720> plane<00:03:10.019> pretty<00:03:10.320> pretty

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
talent on the same plane pretty pretty

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.729 
talent on the same plane pretty pretty
pretty<00:03:10.980> tight<00:03:11.959> okay<00:03:12.989> that's<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.470> 50

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
pretty tight okay that's the 50

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.880 
pretty tight okay that's the 50
millimeter<00:03:13.920> version<00:03:14.670> of<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:15.290> it's<00:03:16.290> close<00:03:16.590> as<00:03:16.769> I

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
millimeter version of it it's close as I

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.040 
millimeter version of it it's close as I
wanted<00:03:17.190> to<00:03:17.250> do<00:03:17.370> keeping<00:03:17.670> it<00:03:17.760> it

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
wanted to do keeping it it

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.490 
wanted to do keeping it it
20:55<00:03:19.110> let's<00:03:19.560> go<00:03:19.709> down<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.660> 102<00:03:21.660> just<00:03:22.230> like<00:03:22.350> the

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
20:55 let's go down to 102 just like the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.460 
20:55 let's go down to 102 just like the
rest<00:03:25.220> there<00:03:26.220> we<00:03:26.280> go<00:03:26.430> honey<00:03:26.610> -<00:03:27.320> not<00:03:28.320> too<00:03:28.440> bad

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
rest there we go honey - not too bad

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.570 
rest there we go honey - not too bad
this<00:03:29.010> is<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.280> 50<00:03:29.610> millimeter<00:03:29.790> one<00:03:30.480> for

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
this is the 50 millimeter one for

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.670 
this is the 50 millimeter one for
version<00:03:32.580> 2<00:03:32.730> as<00:03:32.850> you<00:03:32.970> can<00:03:33.120> see<00:03:33.380> let's<00:03:34.380> look<00:03:34.470> at

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
version 2 as you can see let's look at

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.170 
version 2 as you can see let's look at
tonal<00:03:35.010> Rangers<00:03:35.370> and<00:03:35.580> let's<00:03:35.730> put<00:03:35.940> all<00:03:36.060> these

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
tonal Rangers and let's put all these

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.770 
tonal Rangers and let's put all these
change<00:03:36.480> back<00:03:36.690> up<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.580> you<00:03:38.580> can<00:03:38.730> see<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.330> is

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
change back up and you can see that is

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.600 
change back up and you can see that is
source<00:03:40.230> pretty<00:03:40.739> make<00:03:40.950> its<00:03:41.190> own<00:03:41.340> line<00:03:41.580> of

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
source pretty make its own line of

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.320 
source pretty make its own line of
awesome<00:03:42.470> so<00:03:43.470> a<00:03:44.010> lot<00:03:44.850> of<00:03:44.880> people<00:03:45.030> don't<00:03:45.269> think

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
awesome so a lot of people don't think

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.600 
awesome so a lot of people don't think
of<00:03:45.600> it<00:03:45.720> but<00:03:45.900> there<00:03:46.320> we<00:03:46.410> are<00:03:46.440> we<00:03:46.739> can<00:03:47.160> get<00:03:47.280> tonal

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
of it but there we are we can get tonal

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:48.690 
of it but there we are we can get tonal
ranges<00:03:47.940> from

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
ranges from

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.199 
ranges from
one<00:03:49.060> camera<00:03:49.360> all<00:03:49.690> the<00:03:49.930> same<00:03:50.170> exact<00:03:50.530> settings

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
one camera all the same exact settings

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.320 
one camera all the same exact settings
that<00:03:52.209> are<00:03:52.680> it<00:03:53.680> will<00:03:53.800> produce<00:03:54.000> three<00:03:55.000> different

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
that are it will produce three different

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.240 
that are it will produce three different
images<00:03:55.650> so<00:03:56.650> when<00:03:56.739> you're<00:03:56.860> switching<00:03:57.040> your

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
images so when you're switching your

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.130 
images so when you're switching your
lenses<00:03:57.580> out<00:03:57.819> don't<00:03:58.630> forget<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:58.989> white

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.140 
lenses out don't forget the white

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:00.300 
lenses out don't forget the white
balance<00:03:59.349> again<00:03:59.709> if<00:03:59.830> you<00:03:59.890> want<00:04:00.040> to<00:04:00.099> make<00:04:00.220> it

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
balance again if you want to make it

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.360 
balance again if you want to make it
easy<00:04:00.459> for<00:04:00.580> yourself<00:04:02.099> if<00:04:03.099> you're<00:04:03.340> going

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
easy for yourself if you're going

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.660 
easy for yourself if you're going
somewhere<00:04:03.910> else<00:04:04.150> with<00:04:04.330> it<00:04:04.530> and<00:04:05.530> reality<00:04:06.190> which

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
somewhere else with it and reality which

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:08.750 
somewhere else with it and reality which
one<00:04:06.880> do<00:04:07.060> I<00:04:07.090> still<00:04:07.390> like<00:04:07.569> I<00:04:07.750> like<00:04:07.989> this<00:04:08.170> one

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
one do I still like I like this one

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.360 
one do I still like I like this one
clearly<00:04:09.760> we<00:04:10.030> can<00:04:10.150> see<00:04:10.180> that<00:04:10.510> this<00:04:10.630> gives<00:04:10.870> you

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
clearly we can see that this gives you

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.349 
clearly we can see that this gives you
smooth<00:04:12.370> great<00:04:13.890> great<00:04:14.890> ability<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.459> grab<00:04:15.700> the

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
smooth great great ability to grab the

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.940 
smooth great great ability to grab the
veins<00:04:16.630> even<00:04:19.739> amazing

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
veins even amazing

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.770 
veins even amazing
all<00:04:21.370> right<00:04:21.549> so<00:04:21.760> you<00:04:21.940> do<00:04:22.090> have<00:04:22.120> something<00:04:22.510> else

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
all right so you do have something else

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.460 
all right so you do have something else
and<00:04:23.020> do<00:04:23.169> I<00:04:23.200> have<00:04:23.410> again

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.250 

let's<00:04:27.310> so<00:04:27.610> we<00:04:28.120> can<00:04:28.300> see<00:04:28.479> that<00:04:28.720> I've<00:04:28.840> oak<00:04:29.080> there

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
let's so we can see that I've oak there

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.280 
let's so we can see that I've oak there
now<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.620> start<00:04:29.860> picking<00:04:30.010> up<00:04:30.220> on<00:04:30.900> just<00:04:31.900> as<00:04:32.020> far

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
now to start picking up on just as far

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.080 
now to start picking up on just as far
as<00:04:32.380> I<00:04:32.470> can<00:04:32.530> deal<00:04:32.710> with<00:04:32.740> that<00:04:33.010> can't<00:04:33.970> get<00:04:34.060> up

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
as I can deal with that can't get up

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.800 
as I can deal with that can't get up
anymore<00:04:35.130> it<00:04:36.130> was<00:04:36.280> close<00:04:36.550> my<00:04:37.150> composition<00:04:37.720> you

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
anymore it was close my composition you

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.580 
anymore it was close my composition you
can<00:04:37.870> see<00:04:38.080> it's<00:04:38.200> closing

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
can see it's closing

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.200 
can see it's closing
and<00:04:39.010> so<00:04:39.190> that<00:04:39.310> way<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.520> composition<00:04:40.000> does

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
and so that way the composition does

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.780 
and so that way the composition does
change<00:04:40.510> a<00:04:40.630> little<00:04:40.840> bit<00:04:40.960> with<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.520> 70-200<00:04:42.520> face

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
change a little bit with the 70-200 face

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.520 
change a little bit with the 70-200 face
2085<00:04:43.770> as<00:04:44.770> you<00:04:44.889> can<00:04:45.040> see<00:04:45.190> with<00:04:45.340> this<00:04:46.500> he's<00:04:47.500> a

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
2085 as you can see with this he's a

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.340 
2085 as you can see with this he's a
