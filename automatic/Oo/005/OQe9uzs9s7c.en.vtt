00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Hello dear friends today will be 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.000
 a small review let's call it even in mini 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.160
 review because we have such 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.639
 small typesetter and star series lego 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.639
 wars 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.929
 I bought this planet a long time ago 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:18.600
 couldn't open it 2012 and you many 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:23.430
 asked I decided to still need to do 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.500
 on the planet this is a review, I donâ€™t know 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.439
 let's see what he is 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.769
 I honestly never opened it 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.669
 this box itself is shown here 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.890
 minifigure 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.600
 which is proper unity minifigure 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.840
 presented in this set 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.940
 on the back is also shown this 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.510
 minifigure a spaceship like him 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.329
 looks like the planet nabu and two others 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.000
 recruitment of the first series 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:54.000
 here are these planets and then you know what 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.789
 you can hang it then let's go now 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.370
 let's open anyone in front of you i'm honest 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.039
 saying don't even know what it looks like 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.409
 where are the details see us here 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.020
 Immediately lay on top of the instruction as 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.590
 always difficult in half 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:14.130
 build ends on page 26 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:17.040
 a dozen waist rishni set also 2012 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.250
 years of minifigures on this set 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.090
 to one of six semesters and 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.530
 win lego set well as usual here 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.869
 apparently everything just goes one planet 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.119
 let's get her somehow 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.479
 Crasher box we can get somehow 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.729
 not so much but I clicked decided so 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.259
 barbaric method 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:40.430
 deliver the planet itself here it is 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:44.040
 looks interesting planet nabu in such 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.100
 small version is not written understand 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.049
 what diameter was it like how do you 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.930
 say yourself know yes there one to one 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.229
 1 to two of him so this is all I do not remember 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.369
 when the scale is called yes it seems and 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:02.520
 here we open you the bags with the details 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:06.020
 1 sachet and two sachets are you 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.989
 some know with chocolate egg 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.760
 something calendars of any that 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.590
 Well let's put it rolled planet 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.580
 let's collect this set and 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.730
 let's see what he is 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.260
 assembled 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.420
 Well guys I collected this all this 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.879
 it looks like it is very cool very 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.370
 collectible straight so the only thing 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:30.099
 I would like to say that the assembly was 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.000
 very unpleasant it's all because of this 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.640
 flexible 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.349
 instructions are very unpleasant so it was 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.720
 keep it all the time and somehow not 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.420
 especially enjoyed the build though she 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.900
 was as guessed five minutes 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.819
 turned out to be builds but it's okay it's me 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.950
 I will say more summarizing and now 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:52.329
 let's look at the minifigure and 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.190
 tell a little about all this but 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:57.129
 1 single minifigure of this set 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.430
 this is a pilot from the planet nabu exactly these 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.159
 the guys drove the starships 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.569
 actually with which it comes 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.879
 there is nothing particularly remarkable about him 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.299
 because these guys have been dozens or even 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.760
 hundreds but just show you his robe 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:16.180
 so cool red is real 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.430
 very cool man made him here 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.549
 which vest is even present as 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.620
 body armor seems blaster in general all 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.310
 done very cool minifigure at all 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.230
 test 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.269
 and worthy of this set here these 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.549
 spaceships took a huge part 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.489
 in the battle for the planet nabu in the first part 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:35.919
 the film when the droid secessionists attacked 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:39.400
 on the planet nabu tried to capture 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:42.040
 in space , these starships fought 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.410
 by droid vultures and in one of these 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.720
 starships sat our young anakin 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.930
 skywalker thanks to which was 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:52.449
 destroyed the base of the separatists in which 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.819
 Actually it was a special one such 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:57.790
 say whether the sensor is due to which 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:01.419
 droids were fed and as soon as he was 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.489
 destroyed they immediately turned off as 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:06.790
 not because of this 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:10.150
 good guys and beat separatists 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.639
 bad but here's our review 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.370
 come to an end is it worth buying this 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:18.130
 I think the set is worth it and in some 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.769
 stores in my even tape Auchan 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.300
 somewhere but such a shop 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.190
 there must surely be some 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.800
 planets about this not sure but 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.640
 I think some of the planet there yet 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.380
 remained 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.200
 so if you are so avid 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.050
 collector and star warrior then I consider 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.180
 that this set is mandatory for purchase as 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.160
 at least and of course the ethnic soup 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.220
 suitable for people who just love this 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.130
 saga love this movie and so know 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.770
 buy a couple of planets and put on your 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:50.680
 wand small such modelki very 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:54.160
 even be cool it does not take 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:57.010
 costly or not 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.870
 takes a big place just put 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.810
 neat pair naborchikov at all 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.640
 super there will be such a small collection 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.440
 fans of the movie for example not necessarily 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.840
 even lek lovers just fans 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.810
 film and I would like to say more know 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.570
 what's what exactly planets me 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.060
 liked more than microfighters but 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.220
 This is my personal opinion because the planets 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.650
 really cooler than micro fighter 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:23.440
 they order more collectible and micro 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.650
 fighter and already some more baby well 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.990
 this opinion is purely personal from you I ask 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.490

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.650
