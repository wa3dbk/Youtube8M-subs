00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
but anyway um this book it was really

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.630 
but anyway um this book it was really
good<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.269> was<00:02:18.330> not<00:02:19.170> what<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.620> expected<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:20.129> to<00:02:20.190> be

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640

owl<00:02:20.760> which<00:02:21.510> is<00:02:21.840> good<00:02:22.290> but<00:02:22.650> then<00:02:22.800> it's<00:02:22.920> also<00:02:23.069> bad

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
owl which is good but then it's also bad

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.920 
owl which is good but then it's also bad
because<00:02:23.640> since<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.480> had<00:02:24.660> such<00:02:24.900> high

because since I had such high

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.840 
because since I had such high
expectations<00:02:25.380> for<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:26.040> i<00:02:26.130> think<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.550> was<00:02:26.700> kind
