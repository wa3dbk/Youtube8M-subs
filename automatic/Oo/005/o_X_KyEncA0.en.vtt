four<00:00:48.140> sounds<00:00:48.590> at<00:00:48.710> once<00:00:49.210> so<00:00:50.210> there's<00:00:50.420> 100<00:00:50.960> of

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
four sounds at once so there's 100 of

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.490 
four sounds at once so there's 100 of
these<00:00:51.200> if<00:00:52.160> you<00:00:52.399> haven't<00:00:52.910> figured<00:00:53.059> out<00:00:53.239> the

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:53.500 
these if you haven't figured out the

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.010 
these if you haven't figured out the

organization of the stage settings

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.959 
organization of the stage settings
basically<00:00:57.020> they're<00:00:57.440> set<00:00:57.620> up<00:00:57.649> in<00:00:57.920> groups<00:00:58.640> so

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
basically they're set up in groups so

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.319 
basically they're set up in groups so
that<00:00:59.290> within<00:01:00.290> ten<00:01:00.829> stage<00:01:01.190> within<00:01:01.820> one<00:01:02.030> bank

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329

through the instrument if it ends in one

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.749 
through the instrument if it ends in one
you'll<00:01:30.259> find<00:01:30.529> a<00:01:30.649> sound<00:01:30.829> that<00:01:31.159> is<00:01:31.310> most<00:01:31.579> likely

like<00:01:39.020> this<00:01:39.200> one<00:01:39.910> and<00:01:40.910> all<00:01:41.000> the<00:01:41.030> way<00:01:41.180> through

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
like this one and all the way through

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:42.940 
like this one and all the way through
the<00:01:41.420> instrument<00:01:41.780> if<00:01:41.900> it<00:01:41.990> ends<00:01:42.200> in<00:01:42.320> two<00:01:42.590> it's

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
the instrument if it ends in two it's

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.940 
the instrument if it ends in two it's
going<00:01:43.250> to<00:01:43.370> be<00:01:43.490> some<00:01:43.700> type<00:01:43.940> of<00:01:44.440> Reed<00:01:45.440> electric

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
going to be some type of Reed electric

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.210 
going to be some type of Reed electric
piano

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.560 

so<00:01:52.220> that'll<00:01:52.550> you'll<00:01:52.700> find<00:01:52.970> that<00:01:53.150> all<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.479> way

so that'll you'll find that all the way

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.969 
so that'll you'll find that all the way
through<00:01:53.750> the<00:01:53.840> instrument<00:01:54.260> number<00:01:54.560> 12<00:01:54.830> number

that<00:07:08.140> I<00:07:08.200> want<00:07:09.810> dial<00:07:10.810> and<00:07:11.020> I<00:07:11.080> guess<00:07:11.290> I<00:07:11.470> should

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:11.650 
that I want dial and I guess I should

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.680 
that I want dial and I guess I should
look<00:07:11.770> at<00:07:11.920> the<00:07:12.430> front<00:07:12.700> panel<00:07:12.910> instead<00:07:13.450> of<00:07:13.570> my

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:13.690 
look at the front panel instead of my

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.580 
look at the front panel instead of my
camera<00:07:14.170> and<00:07:14.440> be<00:07:14.590> a<00:07:14.620> little<00:07:14.830> bit<00:07:14.950> easier<00:07:15.160> so<00:07:16.590> I

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:17.590 
camera and be a little bit easier so I

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.840 
camera and be a little bit easier so I
can<00:07:17.890> put<00:07:18.130> in<00:07:18.310> something<00:07:19.300> here<00:07:19.510> that<00:07:19.660> says

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:20.850 
can put in something here that says

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:24.030 
can put in something here that says
Joe's<00:07:21.850> piano<00:07:22.450> or<00:07:22.600> something<00:07:22.840> that's<00:07:23.800> Joe's

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:24.040 
Joe's piano or something that's Joe's

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:30.570 
Joe's piano or something that's Joe's
watching

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:30.580 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:35.710 

so<00:07:31.580> you<00:07:31.669> get<00:07:31.940> the<00:07:32.060> idea<00:07:32.090> so<00:07:33.050> use<00:07:33.650> the<00:07:34.480> knob<00:07:35.480> to

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:35.720 
so you get the idea so use the knob to

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:40.210 
so you get the idea so use the knob to
as<00:07:36.020> data<00:07:36.770> entry<00:07:38.470> knob<00:07:39.470> one<00:07:39.740> will<00:07:39.919> actually

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:40.220 
as data entry knob one will actually

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.580 
as data entry knob one will actually
move<00:07:40.400> you<00:07:40.550> around<00:07:40.880> through<00:07:41.090> parameters<00:07:41.600> and

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:42.590 
move you around through parameters and

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.650 
move you around through parameters and
now<00:07:42.800> you<00:07:42.860> can<00:07:43.100> save<00:07:43.699> this<00:07:43.940> new<00:07:44.150> stage<00:07:44.389> setting

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:44.660 
now you can save this new stage setting

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.050 
now you can save this new stage setting
