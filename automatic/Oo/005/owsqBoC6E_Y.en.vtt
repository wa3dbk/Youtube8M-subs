00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:13.049
 Ok I do not need your tricks 

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:16.260
 demon hello and welcome again today 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.790
 I present a trick with a guide as it says 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.730
 the other time to get to a good 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.970
 high round 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:26.190
 and now I'm going to teach what basically 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.350
 we need and this serves for several 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.099
 players also like the other time and 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.570
 Well now I'm going to show you how it's done 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.760
 Well the first thing we need is 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.340
 know how to get to this trick and how 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.460
 it is done or I will leave the link above in case 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.410
 you do not know how to get to the trick or something and good 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.660
 the truth is that it is quite easy 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.300
 trick is to place yourself in a site looking 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.860
 down as you can see I'm 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.020
 here on this site from looked down 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.370
 a moment ago and when you are well 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.010
 they placed by zombies will go for 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.710
 you but here is a pretty thing 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.310
 curious as you see behind me is my 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.860
 partner you see 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.390
 this trick I uploaded it so that it could be 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.640
 do with a person now what am I 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.410
 watching with two people as you see 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.290
 do they work 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:15.030
 the other person is there so comfortable 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.720
 shooting the funds with me and there's no 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.420
 no problem 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.890
 and the truth is that here you do not miss 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.230
 no also unless you approach 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.760
 or whatever and the truth that is very 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.680
 well to make a good round and to 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.860
 hold or to make points leaves where 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.770
 you want this trick is pretty good 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.780
 and good as you can also see the 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.700
 girl that is the one that I have behind can 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.090
 catch what are the power apps now 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.930
 you will see it as you see it they take it away 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.400
 put back 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.890
 but as you have seen we have been 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.200
 escaped is normal because as it 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.480
 closer families detect and not by 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.900
 us to see also how he takes the 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.900
 ammunition 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.870
 and to take the ammunition well 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.210
 we cleared a little bit what is the area 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.640
 he throws back there quickie that 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.840
 you put the corner and as you see again 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.869
 to put the zombies there 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.720
 the truck can be picked up directly 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.190
 good the truth that later happens to me 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.750
 a rather curious thing that 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.959
 shooting zombies in the head 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.170
 I get what the trick is a giant is 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:23.180
 a trick is worth to have the quiz survive 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.830
 and I get a very similar thing when 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.890
 he shot the tomes in his head more 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.099
 go ahead or you will observe it and I believe that 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.739
 This used to be such as 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.010
 daiquiri de black ops 1 I think it is 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.620
 that 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.860
 well this is all I hope you like it 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.769
 is half guide and good to give like if you 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.659
 they have served and you have liked and 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.659

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.920
 ah 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.250
 But is it worth it 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.700
 and the opening and 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.700
 no to submarines 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.200
