oh alright this move right here still
equally<00:02:11.870> easy<00:02:12.140> to<00:02:12.320> dodge<00:02:12.470> but<00:02:12.710> now<00:02:12.830> we<00:02:12.890> have

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
equally easy to dodge but now we have

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.110 
equally easy to dodge but now we have
glide<00:02:13.400> so<00:02:13.700> it's<00:02:13.880> just<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.090> little<00:02:14.210> easier<00:02:14.420> if

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
glide so it's just a little easier if

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.800 
glide so it's just a little easier if
