just<00:00:22.170> because<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.500> was<00:00:22.529> really<00:00:22.920> really

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
just because it was really really

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.410 
just because it was really really
chaotic<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.580> game<00:00:23.730> synced<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.090> Rico's

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
chaotic in the game synced of Rico's

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.880 
chaotic in the game synced of Rico's
everyone<00:00:24.750> was<00:00:24.869> always<00:00:24.990> rushing<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.590> the<00:00:25.680> point

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
everyone was always rushing to the point

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.670 
everyone was always rushing to the point
so<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.250> do<00:00:26.310> believe<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.900> map<00:00:28.170> definitely

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
so I do believe this map definitely

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.030 
so I do believe this map definitely
needs<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.039> be<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.490> ground<00:00:30.090> war<00:00:30.500> 999<00:00:31.500> sort<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.830> map

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
needs to be a ground war 999 sort of map

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.979 
needs to be a ground war 999 sort of map
because<00:00:32.369> it's<00:00:32.910> such<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> big<00:00:33.480> map<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.870> it's

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
because it's such a big map and it's

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.420 
because it's such a big map and it's
like<00:00:34.079> a<00:00:34.110> whole<00:00:34.350> underground<00:00:34.590> network<00:00:35.250> and

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
like a whole underground network and

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
like a whole underground network and
there's<00:00:35.550> loads<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.820> little<00:00:35.910> roads<00:00:36.270> and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
there's loads of little roads and

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.420 
there's loads of little roads and
something<00:00:36.690> into<00:00:36.870> wine<00:00:37.020> de<00:00:37.140> also<00:00:37.649> thought<00:00:38.100> like

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
something into wine de also thought like

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.690 
something into wine de also thought like
in<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.760> 66<00:00:39.329> format<00:00:39.890> it<00:00:40.890> works<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.460> lot<00:00:41.640> better

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
in the 66 format it works a lot better

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.670 
in the 66 format it works a lot better
and<00:00:42.030> domination<00:00:42.329> about<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.840> game<00:00:43.110> mode<00:00:43.350> oh

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
and domination about this game mode oh

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.170 
and domination about this game mode oh
if<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.250> ground<00:00:44.489> war<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:44.879> going<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.120> be

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
if it's in ground war it's going to be

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.639 
if it's in ground war it's going to be
absolutely<00:00:45.360> insane<00:00:46.140> because<00:00:46.350> you're<00:00:46.559> gonna

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
absolutely insane because you're gonna

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.319 
absolutely insane because you're gonna
have<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.039> have<00:00:47.250> think<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.910> little<00:00:48.030> bit<00:00:48.149> more

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
have to have think a little bit more

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.240 
have to have think a little bit more
because<00:00:48.480> especially<00:00:49.050> ten<00:00:49.649> seconds<00:00:50.129> to

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
because especially ten seconds to

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.650 
because especially ten seconds to
capture<00:00:50.430> point<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.030> have<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> have<00:00:51.449> some

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
capture point you can have to have some

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.990 
capture point you can have to have some
people<00:00:51.930> defending<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:53.129> some<00:00:53.520> people<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:53.850> go

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
people defending and some people just go

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.130 
people defending and some people just go
in<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.270> attack<00:00:54.360> because<00:00:54.750> if<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.930> just

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
in for the attack because if you just

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.180 
in for the attack because if you just
leave<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.289> completely<00:00:55.649> thing<00:00:55.800> they<00:00:55.920> can<00:00:56.039> just

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
leave a completely thing they can just

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.709 
leave a completely thing they can just
stack<00:00:56.460> your<00:00:56.640> point<00:00:56.910> in<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.480> lose

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
stack your point in this you just lose

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.930 
stack your point in this you just lose

enjoyed it and the dog guys I don't

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.440 
enjoyed it and the dog guys I don't
think<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.170> when<00:01:04.530> we<00:01:04.650> first<00:01:04.680> saw<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.189> k-9<00:01:05.729> unit

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
think I when we first saw the k-9 unit

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.969 
think I when we first saw the k-9 unit
or<00:01:06.600> Riley<00:01:07.170> or<00:01:07.350> whatever<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.680> want<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.860> call

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
or Riley or whatever you want to call

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.469 
or Riley or whatever you want to call
him<00:01:08.130> we<00:01:08.280> kind<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.520> thought<00:01:08.760> he<00:01:08.970> was<00:01:09.090> gonna<00:01:09.299> be<00:01:09.450> a

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
him we kind of thought he was gonna be a

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.210 
him we kind of thought he was gonna be a
bit<00:01:09.659> useless<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.260> like<00:01:10.380> yeah<00:01:10.590> a<00:01:10.619> dog<00:01:11.070> that

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
bit useless it's like yeah a dog that

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.130 
bit useless it's like yeah a dog that
runs<00:01:11.400> around<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.820> follows<00:01:12.150> me<00:01:12.330> whoo<00:01:12.570> as<00:01:12.990> a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
runs around and follows me whoo as a

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.929 
runs around and follows me whoo as a
rubber<00:01:13.350> suit<00:01:13.530> life<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.950> found<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.520> usefulness

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
rubber suit life I found the usefulness

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.060 
rubber suit life I found the usefulness
of<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.360> actually<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.080> because<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:16.890> more

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
of it actually it because it's more

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.560 
of it actually it because it's more

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
I something i didn't really know just

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.730 
I something i didn't really know just
too<00:01:45.240> much<00:01:45.390> during<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.720> event<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.259> i<00:01:46.439> actually

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
too much during the event and i actually

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.819 
too much during the event and i actually
managed<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.280> rank<00:01:47.610> up<00:01:47.790> while<00:01:48.720> playing<00:01:49.049> I<00:01:49.470> think

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
managed to rank up while playing I think

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:50.929 
managed to rank up while playing I think
it's<00:01:49.950> like<00:01:50.040> they're<00:01:50.189> custom<00:01:50.579> games<00:01:50.759> are

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
it's like they're custom games are

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.310 
it's like they're custom games are
saying<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.329> reminded<00:01:51.810> it's<00:01:51.960> like<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
saying and it reminded it's like the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.649 
saying and it reminded it's like the
modern<00:01:52.680> warfare<00:01:52.829> 2<00:01:53.460> 10th<00:01:53.939> procedure<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.479> think

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
modern warfare 2 10th procedure I think

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.810 
modern warfare 2 10th procedure I think
it's<00:01:54.780> mine<00:01:54.869> warfare<00:01:54.990> 2<00:01:55.259> 10<00:01:55.500> prestige<00:01:55.860> like

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
it's mine warfare 2 10 prestige like

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.399 
it's mine warfare 2 10 prestige like
