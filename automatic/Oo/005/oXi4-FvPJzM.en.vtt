how<00:00:15.480> I<00:00:15.509> do<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.470> first<00:00:16.740> let's<00:00:17.010> start<00:00:17.130> with

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
how I do it so first let's start with

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.870 
how I do it so first let's start with
the<00:00:17.609> frame<00:00:17.910> of<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.180> cannon<00:00:19.400> you<00:00:20.400> just<00:00:20.640> want<00:00:20.820> to

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
the frame of the cannon you just want to

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.840 
the frame of the cannon you just want to
start<00:00:21.150> with<00:00:21.210> one<00:00:21.600> block<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.529> then<00:00:23.100> run<00:00:23.460> two

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
start with one block and then run two

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.720 
start with one block and then run two
rows<00:00:24.119> all<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.869> way<00:00:24.930> down<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:26.099> find<00:00:26.519> that

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
rows all the way down the I find that

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.349 
rows all the way down the I find that
the<00:00:26.849> longer<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:28.580> longer<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.029> better

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
the longer the longer it is the better

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.749 
the longer the longer it is the better
but<00:00:31.260> you<00:00:31.410> don't<00:00:31.619> have<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:31.890> make<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.489> long

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
but you don't have to make it this long

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.740 
but you don't have to make it this long
five<00:00:33.270> will<00:00:34.110> do<00:00:34.260> just<00:00:34.530> fine<00:00:35.329> and<00:00:36.329> then<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.600> need

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
five will do just fine and then you need

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.470 
five will do just fine and then you need
to<00:00:36.870> pick<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.079> side<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.890> one<00:00:38.700> side<00:00:38.969> has<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.360> be

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
to pick a side and one side has to be

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.020 
to pick a side and one side has to be
two<00:00:39.690> blocks<00:00:39.960> tall<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.800> normally<00:00:41.550> go<00:00:41.760> at<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
two blocks tall I normally go at the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.670 
two blocks tall I normally go at the
left<00:00:42.800> but<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.920> doesn't<00:00:44.280> matter<00:00:44.489> either<00:00:44.879> way

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
left but it doesn't matter either way

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.790 
left but it doesn't matter either way
and<00:00:46.680> then<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.920> need<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.190> put<00:00:47.430> one<00:00:47.640> right<00:00:48.149> here

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
and then you need to put one right here

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.250 
and then you need to put one right here
and<00:00:49.850> because<00:00:50.850> your<00:00:51.420> water<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.870> going<00:00:52.050> to<00:00:52.110> go

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
and because your water is going to go

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.069 
and because your water is going to go
underneath<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.579> basically<00:00:54.300> then<00:00:54.960> you

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
underneath that so basically then you

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.439 
underneath that so basically then you
take<00:00:55.289> your<00:00:55.320> slab<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.160> stick<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.820> at<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> very

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
take your slab and stick it at the very

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.020 
take your slab and stick it at the very
last<00:00:57.690> one<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.410> now<00:00:59.340> you're<00:00:59.550> ready<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.760> put

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
last one and now you're ready to put

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.569 
last one and now you're ready to put
your<00:01:00.149> water<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.800> put<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.920> underneath<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.399> one

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
your water in put it underneath that one

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.140 
your water in put it underneath that one
it<00:01:02.730> will<00:01:02.820> flow<00:01:03.059> down<00:01:03.090> stop<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.840> slab<00:01:04.110> alright

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
it will flow down stop the slab alright

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.210 
it will flow down stop the slab alright
so<00:01:06.150> now<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.600> comes<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.200> redstone<00:01:07.680> place

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
so now it comes to the redstone place

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.410 
so now it comes to the redstone place
one<00:01:08.640> there<00:01:09.049> one<00:01:10.049> there<00:01:10.080> one<00:01:10.350> there<00:01:10.799> and

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
one there one there one there and

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.920 
one there one there one there and
continue<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:14.060> to<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.240> end<00:01:15.390> not<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
continue it up to the end not on the

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.969 
continue it up to the end not on the
last<00:01:16.140> one<00:01:16.409> now<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:17.040> up<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:18.659> here

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
last one now just up to this one here

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.270 
last one now just up to this one here
and<00:01:20.060> then<00:01:21.060> right<00:01:22.020> here<00:01:22.049> is<00:01:22.350> where<00:01:22.560> i<00:01:22.799> use<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
and then right here is where i use the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.330 
and then right here is where i use the
redstone<00:01:23.729> repeaters<00:01:24.740> this<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.950> just<00:01:26.130> going<00:01:26.250> to

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
redstone repeaters this is just going to

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.380 
redstone repeaters this is just going to
delay<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:28.070> tnt<00:01:29.070> block<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.520> get<00:01:29.700> shot<00:01:29.939> out<00:01:29.970> of<00:01:30.180> a

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
delay the tnt block to get shot out of a

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.380 
delay the tnt block to get shot out of a
win<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.720> explodes<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.310> can<00:01:32.520> put<00:01:32.729> those<00:01:32.970> up

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
win it explodes so you can put those up

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.600 
win it explodes so you can put those up
into<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.960> very<00:01:34.170> last<00:01:34.380> one<00:01:34.680> then<00:01:35.070> put<00:01:35.310> redstone

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
into the very last one then put redstone

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.719 
into the very last one then put redstone
and<00:01:36.210> i<00:01:36.930> normally<00:01:37.259> set<00:01:37.590> my<00:01:37.740> repeaters<00:01:38.280> at<00:01:38.520> two

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
and i normally set my repeaters at two

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.539 
and i normally set my repeaters at two
clicks<00:01:39.140> but<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.350> can<00:01:40.530> play<00:01:40.710> with<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.280> make

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
clicks but you can play with it to make

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.480 
clicks but you can play with it to make
them<00:01:42.000> explode<00:01:42.540> sooner<00:01:43.229> or<00:01:43.409> faster<00:01:43.979> which

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
them explode sooner or faster which

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.310 
them explode sooner or faster which
would<00:01:44.670> make<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.850> travel<00:01:45.329> farther<00:01:45.570> or<00:01:45.840> shorter

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
would make it travel farther or shorter

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.130 
would make it travel farther or shorter
just<00:01:46.759> you'll<00:01:47.759> have<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:48.000> mess<00:01:48.149> with<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.390> so

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
just you'll have to mess with it so

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.020 
just you'll have to mess with it so
basically<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.100> what<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.790> should<00:01:50.820> look

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
basically this is what it should look

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.100 
basically this is what it should look
like<00:01:51.149> when<00:01:51.329> it's<00:01:51.689> all<00:01:51.960> said<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.350> done<00:01:54.049> now<00:01:55.049> you

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
like when it's all said and done now you

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.590 
like when it's all said and done now you
just<00:01:55.649> put<00:01:55.920> your<00:01:56.100> switch<00:01:56.490> right<00:01:57.149> here<00:01:58.040> and

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
just put your switch right here and

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.830 
just put your switch right here and
basically<00:02:00.600> you're<00:02:00.990> done<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:02.000> now<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.600> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
basically you're done and now for the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.770 
basically you're done and now for the
T&amp;T<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.860> just<00:02:05.219> load<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.640> up<00:02:05.969> do<00:02:06.240> not<00:02:06.450> put<00:02:06.719> it

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
T&amp;T you just load it up do not put it

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.210 
T&amp;T you just load it up do not put it
underneath<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.259> block<00:02:07.500> because<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.950> need

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
underneath this block because you need

everything<00:02:17.490> is<00:02:17.640> correct<00:02:17.730> this<00:02:18.480> block<00:02:18.780> should

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
everything is correct this block should

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:28.450 
everything is correct this block should
shoot<00:02:19.470> off<00:02:23.300> it<00:02:24.300> did<00:02:24.510> so<00:02:25.410> basically<00:02:26.190> once<00:02:27.150> again

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
shoot off it did so basically once again

shoot off it did so basically once again
this<00:02:29.460> is<00:02:29.520> how<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:29.910> make<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.600> very<00:02:31.050> simple<00:02:31.560> and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
this is how you make a very simple and

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.660 
this is how you make a very simple and
fast<00:02:32.310> hangin<00:02:33.740> and<00:02:35.870> it's<00:02:36.870> about<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.290> so<00:02:37.890> then

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
fast hangin and it's about it so then

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.560 
fast hangin and it's about it so then
stand<00:02:39.180> like<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.080> comment<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.440> video
