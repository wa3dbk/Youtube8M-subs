specifically<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.320> trampoline<00:00:32.149> more

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
specifically on a trampoline more

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.350 
specifically on a trampoline more
specifically<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.930> backflip<00:00:35.719> okay<00:00:37.760> I<00:00:38.760> think

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
specifically a backflip okay I think

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.030 
specifically a backflip okay I think
we'll<00:00:39.600> be<00:00:39.690> fine<00:00:39.870> okay<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.440> this<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.829> first

of three

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.569 
of three
this<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.270> trampoline<00:00:42.660> will<00:00:42.899> be<00:00:43.079> doing<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.620> water

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
this is trampoline will be doing a water

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.150 
this is trampoline will be doing a water
backflip<00:00:45.149> as<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.809> can<00:00:45.930> see<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.410> also

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
backflip as you can see that and also

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.869 
backflip as you can see that and also
flatland<00:00:49.309> right<00:00:50.309> there

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
flatland right there

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.600 
flatland right there
sort<00:00:51.390> yeah<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.949> also<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.190> first<00:00:53.399> time

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
sort yeah and this is also a first time

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.750 
sort yeah and this is also a first time
trying<00:00:53.910> our<00:00:54.149> new<00:00:54.510> microphone<00:00:55.610> so<00:00:56.610> we're

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
trying our new microphone so we're

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.910 
trying our new microphone so we're
excited<00:00:57.000> about<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.260> okay<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.320> here's<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.710> clip

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
excited about that okay so here's a clip

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.310 
excited about that okay so here's a clip
of<00:00:59.039> Conrad<00:00:59.460> doing<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.760> backflip<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.930> front

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
of Conrad doing a backflip and a front

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.310 
of Conrad doing a backflip and a front
flip<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.710> so<00:01:02.329> people<00:01:03.329> tend<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.750> be<00:01:03.899> able<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.170> do

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
flip and so people tend to be able to do

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.929 
flip and so people tend to be able to do
a<00:01:04.350> front<00:01:04.739> flip<00:01:04.799> more<00:01:05.070> than<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.250> back<00:01:05.430> flip<00:01:05.640> but<00:01:05.909> a

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
a front flip more than a back flip but a

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.260 
a front flip more than a back flip but a
back<00:01:06.180> flip<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:06.810> as<00:01:06.930> easy<00:01:07.430> but<00:01:08.430> people

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
back flip is just as easy but people

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.590 
back flip is just as easy but people
mess<00:01:09.450> up<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.780> lot<00:01:09.900> kind<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:10.380> that

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
mess up a lot kind of like that

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.149 
mess up a lot kind of like that
so<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:13.049> first<00:01:13.290> step<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.680> really<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.040> is

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
so the first step it really is is

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.359 
so the first step it really is is
getting<00:01:14.340> over<00:01:14.580> your<00:01:14.670> fear<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.909> back<00:01:15.240> foot

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
getting over your fear a back foot

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.649 
getting over your fear a back foot
Connor<00:01:17.369> doesn't<00:01:17.580> agree<00:01:17.850> with<00:01:17.909> me<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.299> much<00:01:18.450> but

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
Connor doesn't agree with me so much but

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.050 
Connor doesn't agree with me so much but
it's<00:01:19.080> true<00:01:19.259> I<00:01:19.500> want<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.890> talk<00:01:22.220> now<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.729> get<00:01:23.880> over

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
it's true I want to talk now to get over

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.359 
it's true I want to talk now to get over
your<00:01:24.150> fear<00:01:24.210> do<00:01:25.080> some<00:01:25.290> simple<00:01:25.619> backdrops<00:01:26.189> to

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
your fear do some simple backdrops to

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.469 
your fear do some simple backdrops to
get<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.549> feeling<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:26.939> going<00:01:27.119> backwards

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
get the feeling of going backwards

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.530 
get the feeling of going backwards
because<00:01:28.460> it's<00:01:29.460> not<00:01:29.610> even<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.880> scary<00:01:30.150> what

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
because it's not even that scary what

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.780 
because it's not even that scary what
people<00:01:30.750> don't<00:01:30.810> like<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.110> fact<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.500> going

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
people don't like the fact of going

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.850 
people don't like the fact of going
straight<00:01:32.790> over<00:01:32.820> their<00:01:33.150> head<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.619> kind<00:01:34.799> of

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
straight over their head so to kind of

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.289 
straight over their head so to kind of
get<00:01:34.950> over<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.250> fear<00:01:35.610> what<00:01:35.850> you're<00:01:35.970> going<00:01:36.270> to

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
get over that fear what you're going to

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.510 
get over that fear what you're going to
want<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.570> do<00:01:36.750> is<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.380> some<00:01:37.590> backwards<00:01:38.220> rolls

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
want to do is just some backwards rolls

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.840 
want to do is just some backwards rolls
just<00:01:39.420> like<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.130> all<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.280> does<00:01:41.520> really

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
just like this and all that does really

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.880 
just like this and all that does really
it<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.210> get<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:43.079> through<00:01:43.350> the<00:01:43.409> initial<00:01:43.560> fact

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
it just get you through the initial fact

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.929 
it just get you through the initial fact
that<00:01:44.040> you're<00:01:44.130> not<00:01:44.250> going<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.520> hurt<00:01:44.640> yourself

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
that you're not going to hurt yourself

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.460 
that you're not going to hurt yourself
on<00:01:45.060> your<00:01:45.149> neck<00:01:45.360> as<00:01:45.600> long<00:01:45.750> as<00:01:45.869> your<00:01:45.990> chin<00:01:46.259> if

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
on your neck as long as your chin if

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.780 
on your neck as long as your chin if
touch<00:01:46.740> down<00:01:46.979> your<00:01:47.189> chest

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
touch down your chest

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.300 
touch down your chest
you're<00:01:48.299> not<00:01:48.420> going<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.689> stretch<00:01:48.899> your<00:01:49.079> neck<00:01:49.310> so

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
you're not going to stretch your neck so

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.020 
you're not going to stretch your neck so
yeah<00:01:51.409> and<00:01:52.409> then<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:53.009> here<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.369> combining<00:01:53.790> the

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
yeah and then this here is combining the

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.550 
yeah and then this here is combining the
two<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.540> see<00:01:54.750> there's<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.049> backdrop

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
two so you can see there's the backdrop

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.580 
two so you can see there's the backdrop
and<00:01:55.939> then<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.119> roll<00:01:57.299> unconscious<00:01:58.290> tuck<00:01:58.469> in

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
and then the roll unconscious tuck in

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.109 
and then the roll unconscious tuck in
his<00:01:58.649> legs<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.130> he's<00:01:59.369> showing<00:01:59.670> how<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.820> tuck

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
his legs and he's showing how to tuck

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.999 
his legs and he's showing how to tuck
which<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.170> really<00:02:01.409> important<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.920> whole

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
which is really important to the whole

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.649 
which is really important to the whole
flip<00:02:02.340> it's<00:02:02.549> probably<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.090> most<00:02:03.210> important

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
flip it's probably the most important

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.719 
flip it's probably the most important
thing<00:02:03.689> which<00:02:04.170> comes<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.619> this<00:02:04.740> step<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.430> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
thing which comes to this step to the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.940 
thing which comes to this step to the
flip

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
flip

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.480 
flip
now<00:02:07.729> the<00:02:08.270> flip<00:02:08.479> is<00:02:08.660> in<00:02:08.810> three<00:02:09.080> parts<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:10.459> first

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
now the flip is in three parts the first

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.559 
now the flip is in three parts the first
one<00:02:10.789> coming<00:02:11.180> up<00:02:11.300> right<00:02:11.660> now<00:02:13.180> part<00:02:14.180> one<00:02:14.390> the

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:14.569 
one coming up right now part one the

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.229
