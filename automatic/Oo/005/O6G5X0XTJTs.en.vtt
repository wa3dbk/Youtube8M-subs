00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.220
 good you are united to a new video 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:07.580
 good as you already know michael 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.110
 country co-founder of summer games 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.369
 usually good for only answer 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.449
 questions on your personal twitter in this 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:17.689
 occasion he has answered questions 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:20.960
 quite interesting a lot of people are 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.640
 worried about the steam ability that 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.960
 well you know what it provides is 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.580
 that increases the level of health 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.220
 they have temporarily asked many 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.099
 people who are over powered or 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.879
 know that you are sitting or something by the 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.980
 style how good that specifically to a 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:39.559
 kid told him something like he has 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.899
 removed the reservation because his style is 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.039
 very unbalanced so to what he 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.350
 has answered that although it is not 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:46.250
 unbalanced for nothing in fact in 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.010
 Other questions you have answered 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.019
 also that it will not take two shots of 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.329
 snipers to kill a person 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.949
 that has the ability connected with what 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.829
 what if you go with the sniper and 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.149
 others will not need two shots with what 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.039
 which makes me think that this skill 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.289
 where you are sitting that is a 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.480
 because he chose then or he does not have no 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.920
 has no point sense I do 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.780
 I put an ability of this one 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.159
 of this time so that I do not get killed 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.200
 a bang and especially so that nothing 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.780
 more than one shot in close to 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.580
 have a little more life and so on but 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.830
 good if you only focus the 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.820
 snipers and others a fast now 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.890
 quite happier in that sense 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.229
 but we'll see how it is how 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.290
 it ends up being all this then also 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.470
 well they have made sure that they keep 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.619
 devoted a lot of system to the system 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.000
 spawn or disappear and others with 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.650
 which then good we will see to see if in 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.080
 this time they do not have to take a 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.420
 patch the next day to return it to 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.520
 do 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.930
 we will understand how long they have 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.030
 dedicated but good you can do that 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.040
 to get into the restaurant and come to 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.250
 kill kill kill I hope it's a 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.910
 little more in random but inside the 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.289
 normality needed not also so 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.550
 well we 'll see how it ends up being 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:07.700
 everything all these so many things because they are 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.080
 quite interesting we can see how it 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.480
 focus then they have also pulled out 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.850
 a new trailer in case you want to take a 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.450
 look at gamestop 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.370
 it's pretty short of 30 seconds 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.030
 those new suits and others 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.510
 and well this has been all in the next 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.510
 video
