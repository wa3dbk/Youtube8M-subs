00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.319
 I gave it to z 

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.540
 already practically entering normal 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:10.330
 let's hope tomorrow accelerate a little more 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.610
 so he can be part of the game and 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.390
 Maurizio of an important evolution 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.400
 but will also be approved at high 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.970
 intensities tomorrow to see if it can be 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.730
 in a party as important as the 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.329
 of Tuesday basically with the 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:31.839
 responsibility that deserves this 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:34.630
 event not knowing what there is a 

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:36.840
 lot of things at stake and that does not 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.840
 we're 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:44.420
 we are trying to meet a goal 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.420
 that we draw once we assume 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.579
 we work a lot for the game of 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.130
 colombia we work a lot for this 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:54.130
 match and let's hope out there having the 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.090
 response that we had in many lapses 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.330
 of 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.450
 of this process knowing also or 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.879
 keeping in mind that there are a lot of 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.700
 things at stake that really do not 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.630
 has to hurt in relation to everything 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.630
 what is being played does not 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.390
 very well the testimony of sampaoli the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.250
 question is the following to the players 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.680
 I asked him if they were facing a 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.050
 situation that tied they took advantage 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.360
 in the table or in a classification you 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.250
 happens once it happened to me some time but not 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.800
 in this instance and much less of that 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.660
 transcendence happened to me ever playing 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.040
 because I was very young, it's not 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.300
 professional not professionals not 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.030
 approaching 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.680
 luckily in a marcelo bazaar in this 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.500
 instance not but it happened to me but not because 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.200
 tie in the followed a result in the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.030
 game and it is if there is a result in the 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:52.340
 game while playing the game 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.260
 and after being result that was given 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:00.140
 because yes yes 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.140
 it's something split one match a match 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.400
 that's why I say jorge that if you get to 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.690
 a tie has to be because ecuador 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.690
 it is tied chile 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.440
 exactly 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:23.070
 can go thinking that the tie with everything 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.770
 as it has come out in all the past 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.410
 matches to look for will go to 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.240
 look for the best comes against fast you 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.490
 wins the game uruguay came to 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.500
 Argentina decimated him but he 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:37.560
 you have to earn for how much and you have to 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.230
 win for how much Uruguay is not and Uruguay 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.300
 wins 2 0 and chile loses 12 2 remain and of 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.910
 equality in terms of goals for and in 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.590
 points and goals for and against 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.330
 I really do not know if it is later defined between 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.100
 results between them just are not 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.440
 results in friends to me it seems to me that 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.180
 we have to evaluate watching the match 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.250
 what is happening on the court for 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.020
 speak or believe or not believe that you can 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.230
 have some 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:04.010
 I do not think we're telling you there's 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.010
 only the result 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:14.840
 who have rowed for a long time 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.840
 just around the corner 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.210
 almost the first minute playing soccer 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.860
 and it does not assure you anything the game ends 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:28.140
 for it is convenient to tie if you think that no 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.680
 it suits you to score goals to draw and 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.680
 if he makes a goal 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.350
 menacho as giovanni trapattoni that 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.140
 say that more defensive is of those not 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:43.080
 there is good cesare maldini 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.700
 he always said the best way paper 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.860
 of a party and leave the portable 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.400
 because if you transmitted them to the 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.110
 players as sure as the passer 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.570
 he has to put it together so that he comes out 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.730
 court to win after as he said very 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:04:00.570
 well marcelo nobody eats glass in a 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.580
 court of 270 states to 2 are going to look 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.270
 on the faces 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:08.610
 until the 70th minute I think I believe 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:13.320
 who are going to play and I personally am 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:16.320
 convinced that there is something that I am a 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.350
 little beyond conventions there is something that 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.650
 destroys a bit the thesis of going out to 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:25.710
 raise some variety from before is 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:27.990
 that the five that are are defined 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.270
 I think I say that if this instance 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.010
 had to do with a team that did 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.410
 gets to lose to win 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.330
 the repechage would enter to handle 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.920
 other situations but with the five 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.560
 defined but as a player to other people 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.390
 I want jordan not good but also 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.810
 just said he visited jordan if you 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.610
 They say Italy is something else Spain is another 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.130
 thing jordan I do not think he looks at it 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.750
 australia would be another do not look at it with 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.770
 another with other eyes very nice 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.770
 my sister 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.440
 Uruguay important what's important too 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.510
 is that we talk a little football and 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.000
 say that Chile the other day played 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.530
 what the best first but I do not know if 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.720
 it was not the best first time of a 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.670
 team in these playoffs so 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.830
 less in visitor status 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:20.190
 I do not know if it was not the best team in those 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.020
 45 minutes of truth with a player who 

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:24.960
 he also played a great match with Uruguay 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:26.340
 and that we can see a nice game that 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.320
 people did not know us last Friday 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.900
 we talked we looked at the work of chile 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.180
 and the work the player does not repeat 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.130
 because we are in the preview and you have the 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.860
 party but there is a stone to take it would be 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:40.170
 really the best first time but 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.320
 I also neglect the effect guarantees 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.320
 power 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:54.890
 72 hours of care for attention is not 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:57.390
 so aggressive second time 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:59.820
 that nothing else happens that's why the 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:04.070
 good had another or other second effect 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.070
 the other day the referee 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:11.780
 as we said it is not clear 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:14.740
 but the other day to the referee and good but 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.740
 it's a car that benefits 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:22.540
 but good things so clear is my 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:22.540
 opinion
