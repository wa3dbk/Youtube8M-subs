00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.430 
with a labar can we get someone good and
to<00:00:47.430> begin<00:00:47.820> with<00:00:48.030> we<00:00:48.420> get<00:00:49.129> nothing<00:00:51.440> also

sometimes<00:00:52.680> these<00:00:53.129> videos<00:00:53.550> are<00:00:53.789> very<00:00:54.180> short

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
sometimes these videos are very short

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.180 
sometimes these videos are very short
guys<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.780> reason<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.500> sometimes<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.129> just

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
guys the reason is sometimes I just

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.040 
guys the reason is sometimes I just
don't<00:00:56.430> manage<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.910> get<00:00:57.149> any<00:00:57.300> place<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.750> show<00:00:57.930> in

don't manage to get any place to show in
the<00:00:58.170> video<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.859> that's<00:00:59.129> why<00:00:59.280> sometimes<00:00:59.609> they

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
the video so that's why sometimes they

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.029 
the video so that's why sometimes they
are<00:00:59.940> very<00:01:00.270> very<00:01:00.570> short<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.289> we<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> panda
