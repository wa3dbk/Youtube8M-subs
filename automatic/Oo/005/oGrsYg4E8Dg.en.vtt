the<00:00:36.390> speed<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.960> how<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.440> prints<00:00:38.030> in<00:00:39.030> a

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
the speed of how it prints in a

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.670 
the speed of how it prints in a

description<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.500> pronouncing<00:00:44.399> into<00:00:44.610> the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
description so pronouncing into the

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.910 
description so pronouncing into the
unboxing<00:00:45.770> so<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:47.750> just<00:00:48.750> needed<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.110> simple

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
unboxing so I just needed a simple

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.369 
unboxing so I just needed a simple
printer<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.640> want<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.480> go<00:00:51.570> with<00:00:51.629> laser<00:00:51.899> because

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
printer I want to go with laser because

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.310 
printer I want to go with laser because
I<00:00:52.469> don't<00:00:52.590> print<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.890> lot<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.690> inkjets<00:00:54.690> tend<00:00:55.110> to

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
I don't print a lot and inkjets tend to

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.610 
I don't print a lot and inkjets tend to
dry<00:00:55.649> up<00:00:55.829> if<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.100> don't<00:00:56.280> use<00:00:56.399> it<00:00:56.430> too<00:00:56.640> often<00:00:57.620> so

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
dry up if you don't use it too often so

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.470 
dry up if you don't use it too often so
that's<00:00:58.800> why<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.949> went<00:00:59.070> with<00:00:59.129> laser<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.359> is

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
that's why I went with laser and this is

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.869 
that's why I went with laser and this is
also<00:01:00.629> monochrome<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:02.250> doesn't<00:01:02.579> print<00:01:02.699> in

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
also monochrome so it doesn't print in

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.719 
also monochrome so it doesn't print in
color<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.329> black<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.780> white<00:01:04.580> so<00:01:05.580> we

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
color it's just black and white so we

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.649 
color it's just black and white so we
have<00:01:05.880> here<00:01:06.180> okay<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:08.150> basically<00:01:09.150> tell<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.570> to

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
sure what this is product safety guide

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.910 
sure what this is product safety guide
okay<00:02:17.780> so<00:02:18.200> let's<00:02:18.350> put<00:02:18.530> into<00:02:18.770> this<00:02:18.920> side<00:02:20.920> now

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
okay so let's put into this side now

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.530 
okay so let's put into this side now
this<00:02:22.310> is<00:02:22.460> going<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.670> be<00:02:22.820> a<00:02:22.850> fairly<00:02:23.270> large

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
this is going to be a fairly large

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.720 
this is going to be a fairly large
unboxing<00:02:24.380> so<00:02:24.560> just<00:02:24.740> bear<00:02:24.920> with<00:02:24.950> me<00:02:25.130> as<00:02:25.370> I<00:02:25.490> try

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
unboxing so just bear with me as I try

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.040 
unboxing so just bear with me as I try
to<00:02:25.760> struggle<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.360> get<00:02:26.510> this<00:02:26.630> out<00:02:26.780> on<00:02:26.900> my<00:02:27.020> own

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
to struggle and get this out on my own

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.160 
to struggle and get this out on my own
I'll<00:02:27.980> be<00:02:28.220> shifting<00:02:28.640> it<00:02:28.730> around<00:02:29.000> and<00:02:29.270> get<00:02:30.050> it

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
I'll be shifting it around and get it

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.750 
I'll be shifting it around and get it
close<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.320> the<00:02:30.470> camera<00:02:31.930> ok<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:32.990> this<00:02:33.410> is<00:02:33.650> the

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
close to the camera ok so this is the

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.280 
close to the camera ok so this is the
cartridge<00:02:34.760> I'll<00:02:35.540> put<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.810> to<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.020> side

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
cartridge I'll put it to the side

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.140 
cartridge I'll put it to the side
somewhere<00:02:36.620> safe<00:02:38.410> okay<00:02:39.410> so<00:02:39.470> here<00:02:40.310> begins<00:02:40.700> the

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
somewhere safe okay so here begins the

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.210 
somewhere safe okay so here begins the
struggle<00:02:41.810> just<00:02:41.990> bear<00:02:42.140> with<00:02:42.170> me<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.650> I'll<00:02:42.830> try

to this quickly as possible see how am I
going<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.150> do<00:02:47.270> this

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:23.670 

it's<00:03:02.269> homey<00:03:05.739> all<00:03:06.739> right

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:34.080 

okay<00:03:24.610> so<00:03:32.220> see<00:03:33.220> if<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.340> can<00:03:33.489> turn<00:03:33.670> this<00:03:33.849> for<00:03:34.000> you

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
okay so see if I can turn this for you

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.789 
okay so see if I can turn this for you
guys<00:03:35.250> okay<00:03:36.250> so<00:03:36.280> this<00:03:36.760> is<00:03:36.879> pretty<00:03:37.060> much<00:03:37.150> it

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
guys okay so this is pretty much it

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.860 
guys okay so this is pretty much it
obviously<00:03:38.799> it's<00:03:38.980> larger<00:03:39.340> than<00:03:39.370> your<00:03:39.670> typical

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
obviously it's larger than your typical

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.140 
obviously it's larger than your typical
inkjet<00:03:40.870> printer<00:03:41.349> um<00:03:41.620> actually<00:03:42.340> much<00:03:42.519> larger

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
inkjet printer um actually much larger

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.330 
inkjet printer um actually much larger
than<00:03:43.239> your<00:03:43.359> average<00:03:43.510> print<00:03:43.989> in<00:03:44.319> ink<00:03:44.799> jet

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
than your average print in ink jet

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.410 
than your average print in ink jet

function<00:03:52.599> I<00:03:52.780> don't<00:03:53.319> know<00:03:53.379> if<00:03:53.470> this<00:03:53.560> is<00:03:53.590> duplex

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
function I don't know if this is duplex

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.890 
function I don't know if this is duplex
I<00:03:54.310> think<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:54.849> might<00:03:55.000> be<00:03:55.030> I<00:03:55.150> think<00:03:55.209> it<00:03:55.450> prints

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
I think it might be I think it prints

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.449 
I think it might be I think it prints
double-sided<00:03:56.349> bulk<00:03:56.680> confirm<00:03:57.040> that<00:03:57.190> in<00:03:57.310> the

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
overview video um this is just the

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:05.190 
overview video um this is just the
unboxing<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:00.690> I<00:04:01.690> know<00:04:02.730> you<00:04:03.730> know<00:04:03.849> what<00:04:04.030> I<00:04:04.269> was

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
unboxing and I know you know what I was

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.420 
unboxing and I know you know what I was
going<00:04:05.349> to<00:04:05.409> save<00:04:05.560> it<00:04:05.650> for<00:04:05.799> the<00:04:05.859> overview<00:04:06.010> but

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
going to save it for the overview but

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.929 
going to save it for the overview but
let<00:04:07.150> me<00:04:07.239> get<00:04:07.359> all<00:04:07.480> this<00:04:07.599> sticky<00:04:08.290> stuff<00:04:08.590> off

00:04:08.929 --> 00:04:08.939 
let me get all this sticky stuff off

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:10.979 
let me get all this sticky stuff off
just<00:04:09.939> to<00:04:10.060> show<00:04:10.120> you<00:04:10.299> guys<00:04:10.480> a<00:04:10.510> quick<00:04:10.750> glance

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
just to show you guys a quick glance

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.160 
just to show you guys a quick glance
what<00:04:11.260> it<00:04:11.349> looks<00:04:11.500> like<00:04:12.480> so<00:04:13.480> I'll<00:04:13.780> leave<00:04:13.930> it<00:04:14.079> at

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
what it looks like so I'll leave it at

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.969 
what it looks like so I'll leave it at
that<00:04:14.200> um<00:04:15.389> all<00:04:16.389> these<00:04:16.660> I'm<00:04:17.169> not<00:04:17.199> all<00:04:17.769> these

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979 
that um all these I'm not all these

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.710 
that um all these I'm not all these
generic<00:04:18.400> stickers<00:04:18.789> I'll<00:04:19.060> leave<00:04:19.269> them<00:04:19.389> on<00:04:19.449> for

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
generic stickers I'll leave them on for

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.150 
generic stickers I'll leave them on for
now<00:04:19.810> maybe<00:04:20.139> I'll<00:04:20.260> take<00:04:20.410> them<00:04:20.560> off<00:04:20.620> after<00:04:20.829> if

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
now maybe I'll take them off after if

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.670 
now maybe I'll take them off after if
you<00:04:21.250> feel<00:04:21.430> like<00:04:21.579> it<00:04:21.840> but<00:04:22.840> that's<00:04:23.440> pretty<00:04:23.560> much

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
you feel like it but that's pretty much

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.339 
you feel like it but that's pretty much
it<00:04:23.770> so<00:04:24.099> that's<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.460> unboxing<00:04:24.550> of<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.349> printer

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
it so that's the unboxing of the printer

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.409 
it so that's the unboxing of the printer
and<00:04:26.760> again<00:04:27.760> if<00:04:27.880> you<00:04:27.940> guys<00:04:28.000> want<00:04:28.210> to<00:04:28.270> see<00:04:28.360> an

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:28.419 
and again if you guys want to see an

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:29.640 
and again if you guys want to see an
overview<00:04:28.539> which<00:04:28.990> I<00:04:29.110> go<00:04:29.229> over<00:04:29.349> some<00:04:29.500> of<00:04:29.530> the

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
overview which I go over some of the

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.439 
overview which I go over some of the
function<00:04:30.070> the<00:04:30.310> average<00:04:30.820> speed<00:04:31.120> of<00:04:31.330> the

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
function the average speed of the

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.379 
function the average speed of the
printing<00:04:31.900> itself<00:04:32.550> stuff<00:04:33.550> like<00:04:33.729> that<00:04:33.940> and<00:04:34.180> I'll

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
printing itself stuff like that and I'll

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.500 
printing itself stuff like that and I'll
try<00:04:34.510> to<00:04:34.539> confirm<00:04:34.900> if<00:04:35.050> it<00:04:35.169> is<00:04:35.289> duplex<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:36.510> so

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
try to confirm if it is duplex and so

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.899 
try to confirm if it is duplex and so
you<00:04:37.720> find<00:04:38.050> that<00:04:38.169> link<00:04:38.410> in<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.740> description<00:04:39.490> so

00:04:39.899 --> 00:04:39.909 
you find that link in the description so

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:40.890 
you find that link in the description so
that's<00:04:40.060> pretty<00:04:40.180> much<00:04:40.300> it<00:04:40.510> if<00:04:40.570> you<00:04:40.630> guys<00:04:40.720> found

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900
