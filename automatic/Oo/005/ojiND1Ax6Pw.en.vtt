00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
stuff and yep so on and so on it's not

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:24.780 
stuff and yep so on and so on it's not
very<00:02:15.430> much<00:02:15.819> now<00:02:16.090> but<00:02:18.300> it<00:02:19.300> might<00:02:20.430> be<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:21.459> lot<00:02:23.790> some

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
very much now but it might be a lot some

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.190 
very much now but it might be a lot some
time<00:02:25.060> later<00:02:25.360> when<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.230> build<00:02:26.470> yeah<00:02:27.959> so<00:02:28.959> now

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
time later when you build yeah so now

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.979 
time later when you build yeah so now
you<00:02:29.830> can<00:02:30.010> double<00:02:30.340> tap<00:02:30.550> on<00:02:30.610> space<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:31.510> fly

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
you can double tap on space and you fly

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.970 
you can double tap on space and you fly
and<00:02:32.290> you'll<00:02:32.470> double<00:02:33.010> tap<00:02:33.400> on<00:02:34.560> w<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.800> then

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
and you'll double tap on w and then

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.449 
and you'll double tap on w and then
you'll<00:02:36.190> sprint<00:02:36.780> so<00:02:37.980> that's<00:02:38.980> probably

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
you'll sprint so that's probably

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.220 
you'll sprint so that's probably
everything<00:02:41.220> by
