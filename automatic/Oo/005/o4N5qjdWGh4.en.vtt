00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.779
 hello how about my good 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:08.240
 to everything and good today we are going to make a 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.090
 very curious and good thing the truth 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.730
 is that I was reading what are the 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.789
 ingredients I'm not going to draw this were 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.289
 reading what are the ingredients 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.600
 exactly what chewing gums are and 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.070
 Well the truth is that I have stayed 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.840
 stunned of what they bring what are the 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.080
 chewing gum I thought chewing gum brought 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.150
 that is the conservative and little more but 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.560
 the truth is that they have one of things that 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.780
 I really do not understand 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.489
 absolutely nothing of what the 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.800
 products that are made what are the 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:38.390
 chewing gum I thought that this was coming a 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.579
 something natural and not so many 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.579
 chemical products the truth is that a 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.739
 quite unusual thing and not the 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.710
 truth is that I'm going to read you exactly 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.559
 in Spanish in Spanish what are the 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.750
 ingredients and well then after I go to 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.020

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.820
 s in Spanish says chewing gum here 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.770
 sugar with mint flavor sweetener 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.380
 up there all normal there is no type 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.240
 of explanation or nothing and now says 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:14.149
 here sweeteners 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:22.330
 parentheses I vítol maniató and vítolo 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:24.610
 blue zafamos acesulfame can we separate 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.860
 that is the truth that I do not understand 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.750
 exactly what do you mean things 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.600
 that says here no and then says here 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.150
 gum base rubber base is understood from what 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.100
 it's exactly for when thematic that 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.110
 it lasts what gum is not there 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.690
 he is not no problem and then 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:46.620
 it says here on shelves 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.290
 for before and in 429 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:53.940
 and what did he do what they have been 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.930
 there after also has the 15 18 for 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.480
 each 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.040
 aroma was a normal thing not for that 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.710
 have saturday this says the taste 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.270
 mint is normal to have mint flavor and 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:10.260
 well it 's normal no and well says here 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:12.720
 emerging sunflower lecithin lecithin 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.270
 Sunflower says here that it also brings 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.790
 sunflower a chewing gum 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:21.300
 apart from the smell of coma I do not know what gums 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:24.410
 I do not know how much Lecithin says here 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:29.520
 of sunflower also says here says 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:32.640
 antioxidant for before and in 321 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:36.570
 but good for a chewing gum I think that 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.180
 just by putting rubber on it that's already 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:42.210
 can scent and also the rubber so that 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:45.330
 everything is a chewing gum but already leds 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.970
 and sunflower tones is necessary 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.650
 take that and good 2 for the people 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.090
 it can be eat even there are people who 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.570
 Swallow the gum that's not right 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.190
 adequate because that can with the step 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.440
 of time can cause our 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.330
 body can even people who have died 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.870
 for eating gum and good for people who 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:07.240
 be very careful not and good says here 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.360
 contains a source defined the mine 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.150
 zen and the mine contains a source decides 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.610
 the feline amine I'm saying no and 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:21.010
 well says that excessive consumption can 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:23.320
 have laxative effect laxative effect that 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.600
 I understand perfect the saint is that you 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.490
 have here to the bathroom that is a thing a 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.710
 laxative some things of him here direct 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.420
 to the bathroom because it is that you 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.360
 does the need for the road does not and 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:38.940
 well after here information 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:44.140
 nutritional 100 grams energy value 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:46.390
 685 calories bar 165 calories fat 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.880
 therefore it means that apart from the 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.100
 chewing gum has even fat that does not 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.920
 I understand because it has even fat 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.440
 when you are not going to eat it normally 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.330
 I come here not that it generates fat when 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.150
 you are like a product that does not generate 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.850
 fat but one thing that you chew how 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.940
 can have fat I do not understand how 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:10.840
 can have fat like that and good says 0.4 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.840
 of which saturated the 0.1 a gram 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.440
 they are saturated fats but good 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.230
 saturated 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.570
 I had swallowed the gum but that then 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.549
 what they make chewing gum if they think that 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.250
 we swallow the chewing gum and for 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.230
 that says it has saturated fat I 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.420
 I do not understand, I do not know if anyone will understand 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.310
 or will make what are chewing gum and 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.080
 will know a bit about the subject but I really 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.120
 I do not understand how you can have a 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.890
 gum saturated fat saturated fat 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.630
 you eat a serum something with fat and 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:42.460
 that's if you have saturated fats but a 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:44.020
 chewing gum that you do not work to swallow like 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.800
 to be able to have fat and what is true 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:52.930
 I do not understand it and well it says here 0.1 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:55.420
 grams carbohydrate 66.5 grams of 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.070
 which sugars have sugar that does not 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.630
 it is understood not to a thing that is not 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:05.350
 understand no and well I said here 00 grams 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:08.850

 what flowers and flowers will be 

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:18.640
 well the truth is that after it says here 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:21.880
 consumer information and good the 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.130
 truth is that I do not know what they will think or 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.710

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.660

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.910
 that are the chewing gums you see normal that you 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.430
 throw that kind of stuff to the gum or to 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:34.720
 one thing that we do not understand the truth 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.960
 I do not understand how you can have 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:40.150
 even saturated fats it 's as if 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.250
 was a type of drug exactly the 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.870
 chewing gum are drugs or that is what we 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.600
