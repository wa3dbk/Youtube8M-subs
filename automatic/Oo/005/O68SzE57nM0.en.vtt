00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:38.729 
minute and a half ok so the healer had

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:41.930 
minute and a half ok so the healer had
to<00:00:38.850> stay<00:00:39.030> alive<00:00:39.329> for<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.109> minute<00:00:40.589> and<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:41.039> half<00:00:41.069> so

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
to stay alive for a minute and a half so

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.160 
to stay alive for a minute and a half so
that<00:00:42.179> means<00:00:42.479> at<00:00:42.839> UM<00:00:43.729> one<00:00:44.729> tin<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.749> that<00:00:45.929> what<00:00:46.079> it

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
that means at UM one tin is that what it

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.129 
that means at UM one tin is that what it
is<00:00:46.579> 110<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.760> healer<00:00:47.969> still<00:00:48.359> has<00:00:48.569> to<00:00:48.749> be<00:00:48.870> alive

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:49.139 
is 110 the healer still has to be alive

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:54.379 
is 110 the healer still has to be alive
ok<00:00:50.449> and<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:52.350> had<00:00:53.249> to<00:00:53.519> a<00:00:53.549> hundred<00:00:53.850> percent<00:00:53.999> the

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:54.389 
ok and I had to a hundred percent the

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:57.289 
ok and I had to a hundred percent the
base<00:00:54.569> so<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.429> do<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.609> in<00:00:56.969> three

00:00:57.289 --> 00:00:57.299 
base so we have to do that in three

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:58.849 
base so we have to do that in three
minutes<00:00:57.479> and<00:00:57.749> for<00:00:57.929> half<00:00:58.139> of<00:00:58.319> the<00:00:58.440> time<00:00:58.589> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859

though<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.970> doing<00:02:15.300> it<00:02:15.450> but<00:02:15.570> look<00:02:15.780> at<00:02:15.900> this<00:02:16.080> so

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
though to doing it but look at this so

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.720 
though to doing it but look at this so
literally<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.900> last<00:02:18.930> I<00:02:19.680> think<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.490> got

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
literally in the last I think that I got

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.710 
literally in the last I think that I got
this<00:02:20.880> in<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.120> last<00:02:21.480> second<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:23.220> this<00:02:23.820> thing<00:02:24.180> I

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
this in the last second of this thing I

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.560 
this in the last second of this thing I
think<00:02:25.440> there<00:02:25.590> might<00:02:25.710> have<00:02:25.770> been<00:02:26.060> 11<00:02:27.060> literally

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
think there might have been 11 literally

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.210 
think there might have been 11 literally
one<00:02:27.750> second<00:02:28.170> left<00:02:28.320> to<00:02:28.470> get<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.680> three<00:02:28.950> stars
