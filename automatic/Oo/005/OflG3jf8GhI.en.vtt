00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.059
 but obviously they won't take me to hogwarts 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.200
 or at least not all at once 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.480
 my name is ginger 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.269
 with me my tame panda as always and 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.279
 we are glad to welcome you again with us 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.760
 Away and today we begin 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.689
 so to speak actively move fantasy on 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.369
 our channel 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.760
 Originally the video was conceived for 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:30.779
 headings 10 books namely 10 fantasy 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:34.440
 books but you know just have a fantasy about 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.450
 which seems like there is no point 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.489
 speak again and again because all 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.469
 they know but for quickstry did not say about 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.590
 I can't let them because I have them 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.100
 very, very much and thatâ€™s why it will be mine 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.739
 little top 5 fantasy in fifth place 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.399
 me chronicles narnia cycle of 7 books 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.870
 claive lewis about three brothers and two 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.570
 sisters and how they got into 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:03.000
 the magical world of narnia and about not 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.890
 what was happening there they were doing and more 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.470
 just crashed into my memory for that 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.630
 simple reason apart from of course 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.840
 what is a wonderful story 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.820
 wonderful tale he does not fall asleep 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.729
 because it was my first episode 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.250
 clip rotate class with this in the fifth not from 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.450
 not ashamed of year conscious remembrance and 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.659
 about the book and about heroes and impressions about 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.939
 this piece because to me this is a series 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.189
 fantasy gift of gas in memory and in fact 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.500
 I will now play myself reread 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.380
 again the spark was built here in the world 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.689
 watch all movies shot for this series 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.670
 books because Olya Monday gave 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.189
 If I run a magic book 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.829
 chronicles of narnia sophia 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.770
 shew'll read if some points 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.950
 I probably will not even remember now 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.079
 so read looked and then to 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.420
 chronicles on the sandbanks and philosophies on 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.299
 fourth most recently read but 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.009
 I really love time trilogy 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.500
 like a time travel alone 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.960
 girls who teaches they are not very 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.110
 craved type travel a lot at 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.540
 least immediately in general about this book already 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.440
 told the video all the details you 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.990
 can find out 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.040
 In the afternoon, why does this trilogy take 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.550
 fourth place 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.830
 the fact is that of the last fantasy 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.000
 Books recently read a lot 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:29.310
 perhaps the most successful let 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.040
 may not be all perceive fantasy 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.300
 and maybe it's in intensity 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.420
 reach for ears 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.700
 but nevertheless I have it on the fourth 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.340
 location know the top 5 fantasy 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.220
 in third place in a riot of rings and 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.860
 the hobbit and in principle would be all 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.140
 the rest of the books in this series if I 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.090
 they bothered to read and early or 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.700
 late and twins deal but so far that 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.440
 dream he rings and the hobbit in third place in 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.780
 this top 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.980
 but you know I already admired 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.990
 repeatedly by this piece 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.780
 the works and the world that created 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.580
 Tolkien he and some not so much 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.350
 thoughtful when you start reading 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.470
 completely immersed in this world 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.840
 immersed in this story and in fact 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.410
 really put it is impossible or even 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.230
 if you have the fear of big books like u 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.650
 me periodically it arises then with this 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.350
 a book 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.620
 everything passes because you start 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:31.410
 read and not notice the posts and her from 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.550
 start to read to the end and want more 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.470
 more more more 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.310
 in second place is Harry Potter 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.410
 is it worth explaining why he walks my 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.090
 Top 5 I think rather some 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.450
 explain why we are not only on the second 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.480
 the place is not really I am always from the very 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.700
 the first book they gave me 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.980
 long ago and I'm being silly to them 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.140
 didn't even really want to read it but 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.570
 after all other things so here it is actually 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.570
 from the first to the last book I 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.970
 delight in the world of the heroes of everything 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.000
 this magic from adventure from 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.610
 fictional stories in this book in these 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.920
 books and i'm ready to read them again and 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.800
 again and again and again especially in 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.300
 Ukrainian translation for some reason he is me 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.130
 right probably because it is on 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.140
 Ukrainian language was read first 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.600
 the book and all subsequent ones too 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.580
 I tried and read them in English 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.530
 Russian but actually Ukrainian 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.470
 question 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:30.389
 created for this book more precisely these books and 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.230
 created for ukrainian language just 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:37.440
 as a view so everything is perfect and successful 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.600
 translated in general I am delighted with books 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.000
 and ready to reread again and again and 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:45.389
 I would gladly attended Hogwarts from 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.200
 8 conjured along with Harry and Ron and 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:51.389
 Hermione but obviously they won't take it from me 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.639
 in hogwarts or at least not immediately but 

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:56.970
 all because in the first place in my 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:05:00.950
 topa flat world terry pratchett this 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:04.020
 cycle of a huge number of books and 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.630
 beautiful prescribed straight to the 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.990
 small details of the world and beautiful 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.120
 heroes in this world and i'm actually still 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.380
 not all read the book has not yet mastered it 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.150
 their question is 40 books 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:20.640
 only in one cycle is a flat world but 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:23.580
 you understand it and fiction and truth 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:27.320
 and humor and sarcasm and all here it is 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.850
 together it's just a divine cycle and 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.650
 probably pokemon in my first place 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:35.460
 attack us with a panda stepped in 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:38.340
 the fantasy topic is in fact now 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:42.330
 we still make a selection of ten books 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.789
