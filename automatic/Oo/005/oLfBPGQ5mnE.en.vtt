00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:24.050
 I really do not know 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.099
 because I'm lost he asked me a series of numbers and they said they were here 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:30.380

 cotino told him none of those who had told him to live

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.870
 19 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.870

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.500

 those agreements that there are exemplary 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.510
 because he was worried if he wants to sell it 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.090

 my oldest daughter, scale of consumption and activity 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.810
 in guayana are saying that it is possible that sales is possible that the 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.020
 veins 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.850
 is that once the blockade is determined 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.299

 and well we follow who will inherit these questions ceased so the reason 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.299
 these penalties for the general strike because 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.389
 from whom more time and we are focused on certain types of topics in 

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:11.270
