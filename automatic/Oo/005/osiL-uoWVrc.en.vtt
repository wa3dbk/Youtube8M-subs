00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 very good photos kids and welcome 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.870
 to a new video and today I bring you the 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.630
 first part of the video of the players 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.240
 and cliché to 2 as I promised you I was going to 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.519
 bring a video of all play slipped 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.580
 not everything in the game but before 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.199
 nothing I wanted to tell you like Richard to the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.900
 players there are a few types of players 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.640
 that you can click good or you can 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.260
 do in any season is worth not 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.210
 it has to be a new one but I 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.570
 I'm going to create a new season by law 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.210
 example see a team that has many 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.920
 players with good progression by 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.559
 example we are not going to take the weight that 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.940
 has many young promises and 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.980
 well the most important thing of this is that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.930
 you have to put or customized 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.789
 current or predetermined are I 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.200
 I always put current custom 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.629
 to have all the signings made by 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.129
 simon pre finished I do not like it well no 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.070
 have internet if I put download the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.629
 more recent because it will not leave you 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.520
 watching here an initiation and I'm also going 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.460
 to leave then I always put 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.440
 Current custom values ​​are worth competing 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.660
 the equal weight this can put it to 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.270
 your measure except templates 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.700
 used pallet we will have to continue this 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.350
 it's all the same we all jump and see each other 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.900
 now with the template to teach you 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.509
 how to make the players glitch 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.360
 gonzález here we are in the menu 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.520
 main in this way career what 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.250
 we have to do is go to report of 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.230
 Voucher template come first 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.480
 As you can see on the right side of the 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.790
 screen comes out player status takes 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.360
 in the club since 2009 is worth in this game 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.400
 for example but for example in retro 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.990
 Williams comes out proves to have a great 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.920
 good potential 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.430
 here comes the importance of this glitch 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.040
 jetró willems 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.950
 is a player who progresses a lot is a 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.000
 young promise and good has 75 on average 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:55.649
 with 20 years very well we do not also have 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.710
 to georgina wijnaldum 23 years 78 and sale 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.350
 that has something special this state is 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.030
 the best with the best potential and wants 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.110
 say that this player is going to get 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.420
 minimum 90 on average between 90 and 95 of 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.050
 average more or less we also have by 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.800
 here to adam yesterday another player 76 of 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.900
 average with 20 years but weighs a lot 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.050
 but we can also use the cliché as 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.110
 that I go the players that go out take 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.960
 the club since and has just arrived 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.690
 you can not do the ritz with them is 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.340
 very very important but the ones he puts down 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.080
 country example all a young promise 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.110
 they have lowered the potential by the way 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.270
 a whole young promise 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.940
 Adam Mazer proves to have a great 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.810
 potential georgina wijnaldum has something 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.120
 special and williams we are going to do it with 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.010
 williams and with pay vale de paí has 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.220
 a whole young promise is the potential 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.000
 lowest of the is the lowest state that 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.610
 can have a ballet player does not want 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.920
 say that the country progresses little but 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.230
 can increase the potential and by 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.260
 example wijnaldum has the maximum 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.570
 potential has something special that's what 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.690
 that we want to get that from pai and 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:15.959
 williams have in your state have something 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.790
 special good first of all let's 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.500
 do the best with mayer and with willem 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.180
 It is worth missing only one for 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.160
 reach the maximum potential what 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.850
 we have to do is to put is to put it 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.280
 in seasonal sessions 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.710
 to both players to arrive 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.510
 offers for them very decision 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:35.030
 important do not put it to sell because 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.280
 if you are not going to shit 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.860
 now we simulate a few days until 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.690
 that some offer comes this I do not know 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.040
 how long will it take? 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.410
 the episode may have to do 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.510
 another way and put them back this is 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.430
 very random it may come out maybe 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.370
 no but for example here we just 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.090
 to get an offer decision voucher of lightning 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.380
 vallecano eye in the ray wants the 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.209
 cession of adam mazer good 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.410
 obviously we give you to accept or not 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.510
 obviously we could not give it to 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:05.450
 accept but in this case you have to give it 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:09.470
 to accept worth once we have given to 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:12.709
 accept let's simulate like 34 days 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:15.019
 it's just we're on day 6 eye that 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.640
 another one has arrived for us from Williams 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.980
 almeria team eye spanish want 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.040
 recruit game is Dutch for their 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:24.919
 teams and well we were on day 6 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.389
 with mayer on day 9 more or less we go 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:29.270
 to stop now 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.639
 well now we have to go to 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.590
 transfers 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.020
 to sell players and now they will come out 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.449
 all of us who have transferred are worth you see 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.270
 jethro williams and adam mazer the first 

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:42.639
 we have yielded to lower ourselves to lightning 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.669
 vallecano because now we revoke the cession 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.469
 before remember that he had proved to have 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.740
 great potential if it went well the 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:52.569
 the glitch now instead of having we have 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.599
 of having a potential should have 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:58.060
 there are kids has something special has 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.099
 changed the status of the player and so 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.490
 which it has also changed over the 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:06.550
 potential of the same adam yesterday to the best 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.550
 had a potential of 84-85 now it's going to 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:12.400
 have a minimum of 90 you do not know in what year 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.039
 to get to 90 but in about 23 seasons 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.180
 you will reach at least 84 at 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:18.460
 potential that I had before that's going to 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.930
 get there much faster than before and 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.930
 now let's do the same with jethro 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:25.479
 willens pretty much a couple of ten more 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.449
 there is stop we already do the same 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.529
 we go to transfers to sell players 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:31.930
 we selected jason williams and 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:34.089
 we revoke the cession that is the bad thing of 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.350
 this is the only value we are going to lose a 

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:38.810
 little money yes but 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.390
 that's what I say and now we're going in 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.040
 willens and this one has not worked for 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.240
 example but you can continue doing it 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.450
 until it comes out has great potential 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.570
 or something else that comes out can happen 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:52.400
 in the club since 2012 2011 or since 

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:54.350
 when the club arrives that can also 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.780
 pass and fuck is the potential of player 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.760
 but this for example this time has 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.260
 it went very well because we could not 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.020
 power of williams we have not 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:05.360
 improved but we have not fucked up and we have 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.670
 enhanced to the fullest the potential of adam 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.070
 mayer so good kids this has 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:12.200
 been the first part of the players and 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.570
 clicks and how gleacher is worth it with him 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.150
 with this little trick that I already tell you 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:18.770
 that works one hundred percent so 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.170
 good 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:23.210
 I'm going to divide it into about 34 more videos 

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:27.050
 with all the signed players there 

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:29.540
 in the fifa there are like 40 50 or 60 players 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.530
 there are a lot a lot of new juárez 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:35.510
 that hides esports with glitch players 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:38.750
 and I hope you liked it if 

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.520
 we got to 50 likes upload tomorrow be this 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.100
 video will be uploading on Wednesday
