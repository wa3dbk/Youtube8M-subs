00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.090 

already<00:00:00.810> I've<00:00:01.020> done<00:00:01.199> as<00:00:01.319> much<00:00:01.469> as<00:00:01.620> I<00:00:01.740> can<00:00:01.800> do

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
already I've done as much as I can do

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.970 
already I've done as much as I can do
and<00:00:02.340> I<00:00:03.319> believe<00:00:04.319> I<00:00:04.410> could<00:00:04.589> have<00:00:04.680> done<00:00:04.830> that

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
and I believe I could have done that

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.710 
and I believe I could have done that
myself<00:00:05.040> if<00:00:05.580> I'd<00:00:05.700> had<00:00:05.879> a<00:00:05.910> little<00:00:06.120> longer<00:00:06.359> ladder

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
myself if I'd had a little longer ladder

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.110 
myself if I'd had a little longer ladder
I<00:00:07.080> couldn't<00:00:07.410> reach<00:00:07.589> that<00:00:07.919> top<00:00:08.250> where<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:08.940> top

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
I couldn't reach that top where that top

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.970 
I couldn't reach that top where that top
bracket<00:00:09.660> is<00:00:09.780> way<00:00:10.260> up<00:00:10.469> there

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
bracket is way up there

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.220 
bracket is way up there
I<00:00:11.010> took<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.759> stick<00:00:12.179> and<00:00:12.360> I<00:00:12.450> pushed<00:00:12.719> it<00:00:12.870> up<00:00:12.990> into

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
I took a stick and I pushed it up into

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.700 
I took a stick and I pushed it up into
place<00:00:13.469> after<00:00:13.799> I've<00:00:14.070> bent<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.580> tines<00:00:14.849> on<00:00:15.179> it

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
place after I've bent the tines on it

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:18.200 
place after I've bent the tines on it
and<00:00:16.710> pretty<00:00:17.190> much<00:00:17.279> all<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.550> need<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.940> do<00:00:18.060> is

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
and pretty much all you need to do is

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.300 
and pretty much all you need to do is
shoot<00:00:18.900> two<00:00:19.109> screws<00:00:19.439> into<00:00:19.800> it<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:19.980> tighten<00:00:20.160> up

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
shoot two screws into it and tighten up

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.509 
shoot two screws into it and tighten up
the<00:00:20.369> bolt<00:00:20.640> but<00:00:21.630> my<00:00:21.750> ladder<00:00:22.160> just<00:00:23.160> wouldn't

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
the bolt but my ladder just wouldn't

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.550 
the bolt but my ladder just wouldn't
reach<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.119> couldn't<00:00:24.480> reach<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.660> from<00:00:25.350> my

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
reach and I couldn't reach it from my

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.890 
reach and I couldn't reach it from my
ladder<00:00:25.830> so<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.550> figure<00:00:27.210> okay<00:00:27.480> I'll<00:00:27.660> leave<00:00:27.869> that
