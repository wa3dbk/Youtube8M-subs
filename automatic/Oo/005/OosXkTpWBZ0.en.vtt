00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.950
 today we want to tell you the updates 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.580
 production tehkrim the first one is 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.250
 balloon called dragon volume 650 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.580
 milliliters is 1 in the Russian market 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.580
 a cylinder of this size it is generally for 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.439
 corresponds to its volume including 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:27.000
 so called American balloon 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.990
 counter bear world that's balloon 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.579
 pepper contains substance in with 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.870
 the concentration of capsaicin species in general about 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.480
 content is 0 21 percent 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.460
 it can be said that little is enough 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.280
 there is a restriction on false 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.460
 our Ministry of Health namely 1 gram 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.590
 substances on the balloon respectively 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.770
 here 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.690
 950 milligrams of capsaicin species i.e. 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.710
 maximum bar 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.050
 on which are possible in principle from the point 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.780
 view of the use of raw materials 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.360
 here's a balloon has a very high consumable 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.840
 valve namely 28 glue per gram per 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.450
 give me a sec 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.360
 that is, it is more than any other 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.250
 cylinder miss tehkrim and other 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.509
 manufacturers up to this point 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:22.049
 the highest expendable was the torch 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.450
 him order if they don not dare 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.200
 fire a 25 grams second valve here 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.770
 even a little more powerful it turns out 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.350
 barrel with its volume 650 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.330
 milliliters can work time that is 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:40.140
 full release time 16 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.550
 seconds in this here is indicated not very 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.450
 visible we will then show this to another 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.280
 the cylinder is equipped with a fuse 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.850
 the fuse is located right here 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.210
 below the idea where there is usually a gun 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.909
 there is a disk hook here's a button 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.170
 which accordingly leads to 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:04.460
 ejection outpost located on top 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:07.040
 football he is quite comfortable grip well 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.170
 here he is quite heavy to him yet 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.550
 among other things, a cover is attached 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.320
 for carrying 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.900
 Here is a version of the cover so 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.430
 called urban civil 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.319
 Here, respectively, the test balloon we 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.870
 we will spend from 3 distances in general 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:26.680
 manufacturer indicates that the balloon 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.959
 acts on a distance of 4 meters here 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.790
 we will not experience such a distance 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.420
 let's see what will be up to three meters like 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.730
 probably such a reasonable maximum 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.400
 self defense distance with gas 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.260
 spray cans the composition of this balloon he is not 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.960
 flammable that is 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:49.590
 he is safe enough in this regard 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:53.470
 that's theoretical and you can even be small 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:58.000
 put out the fire and so 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:03.840
 dragon 650 milliliter distance 1 meter 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.130
 spraying for 1 second and and mine 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.700
 Of course, I was a little surprised that 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.700
 happened 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.410
 very powerful opened 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:39.520
 and a little as I understand it went aerosol in 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:43.050
 let's take a further distance now 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.050
 2 meters right there balloon naturally 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.050
 sprayed 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.550
 but very powerful hat 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:11.290
 frankly there is an aerosol therefore 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.290
 I turn away just in case 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.580
 so this is the result of spraying with 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.570
 distance 1 meter 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.010
 actually froth here 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.810
 flows slowly 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.240
 foam volume 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.509
 big 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.509
 here 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.300
 this is a result of 2 meters respectively 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:45.580
 so the distance is 3 meters 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:48.030
 Mr. Dragon 650 Well, the campaign case is not 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.030
 flies 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:54.660
 try one more time wind now 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.660
 there is no moment 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.350
 poker hit 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.300
 it can be seen that the system blows in the right 

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.460
 the side 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:09.990
 apparently it is insignificant though 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:12.200
 here is a subtree of unnoticeable mobile cap 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.200
 grandfather 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.570
 here 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.570
 i'm slowly flowing 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:35.850
 so do not affect the 3 meters settled feud 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:35.850
 650 along the way does not reach 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:42.610
 let's try again 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.610
 I say goodbye channel because between 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.620
 re-split it from a distance of 2 meters 

00:05:53.820 --> 00:06:03.810
 do re-spraying from 1 meter well 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.810
 how beautiful 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.450
 happened 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:19.370
 the targets are wet all the way through it 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:22.570
 with completely 

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.570
 impregnated with composition
