00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
the end of pretty much the TV spot they

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.359 
the end of pretty much the TV spot they
released<00:00:18.359> about<00:00:18.720> a<00:00:18.869> month<00:00:19.140> ago<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.680> believe<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
released about a month ago I believe the

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.010 
released about a month ago I believe the
TV<00:00:20.670> spot<00:00:20.880> they<00:00:21.000> released<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.420> month<00:00:21.539> ago<00:00:21.750> was<00:00:21.990> a

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
TV spot they released a month ago was a

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.050 
TV spot they released a month ago was a
minute<00:00:22.350> long<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.800> it<00:00:23.160> basically<00:00:23.340> was<00:00:23.880> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
minute long and it basically was the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.300 
minute long and it basically was the
most<00:00:24.240> epic<00:00:24.449> thing<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.350> think<00:00:25.800> they<00:00:26.070> have

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
most epic thing I think they have

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.710 
most epic thing I think they have
released<00:00:26.519> for<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:26.880> avengers<00:00:27.359> age<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.539> ultron

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
pretty much and it's not going to be

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.340 
pretty much and it's not going to be
very<00:01:59.729> exciting<00:02:00.570> because<00:02:00.719> we've<00:02:00.990> seen<00:02:01.200> it

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350
