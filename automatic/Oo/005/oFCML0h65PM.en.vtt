 very good friends that such as 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.740
 we were wishing what was 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.019
 wishing to start this I was wanting 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.240
 to go to sims 4 because you are going to 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.919
 ask good a simple reason does 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.130
 that he did not play the sims but a 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:24.380
 barbaridad the sims 3 and I think I played 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.740
 two days counted but well this one has 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.320
 new things that he already needed and has 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.780
 said why not do a series with the 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.699
 sims but instead of being playing me that 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.090
 I have my alternative game with my 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:39.820
 Character I said 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.260
 now it is to know and why we do not 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.109
 a series in which 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.079
 my sim is your sim look we are going to put 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:50.420
 this title to this series my sim is your 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.820
 sim let's do the following you are going to 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.789
 be you who are going to decide in 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.949
 every moment what is going to happen in the 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.930
 world of the sims with the character that 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.239
 we believe this video is going to be very short 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.129
 because it's going to be presentation but good 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.130
 I'm going to show you a little bit how the 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.619
 matter as you are seeing we have a 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.479
 character that already comes by default 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.189
 we have this one that is not going to be 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.720
 this obviously but now in the 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.479

 option has more likes of 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.750
 normal people get more likes to 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.010
 a specific comment because the 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:43.010

 alternative trait options that 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.620
 go together to this main feature and 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:31.060

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:24.750
 three that are going to be subject to the trait 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.350
 principal that you already know which ones are good 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:30.100
 after 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:34.210
 aspect this is going to be the important issue 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:37.480
 what aspect you want is worth in face then in 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.220

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.620
 exposed I'm going to choose clothes and everything 

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:12.840
 the rest because that we can already 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.430
 change the wardrobe at any given time 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.280

 eyes and such you can also put me in 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.919
 the comments that you do not put it on me 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:25.590
 you worry , I already choose myself but good 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:28.139
 the intention is that this game of 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.150
 sims this is this series that you are going to create 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.069
 you do not I am going to play with the 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:33.960
 indications that you give me you are going 

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:36.750
 to be what you decide or is going 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.400
 to be your sip and on the other hand what 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.560
 last as you called me you have to say 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.120
 a name and a surname here and you will say 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.949
 good as you are going to choose it good then of 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.360
 in all that I do them the same 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:47.340
 I will choose from all those who are willing 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.139
 or if someone has more likes than normal 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.270
 I will go directly to that 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:52.979
 and get out the weirdest thing in the good world like 

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.909
 you are watching this is very random 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:58.439
 buddies so let's fuck and for 

00:06:55.909 --> 00:07:02.370
 keep this character that we already have 

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:04.199
 here, nothing, we will not keep it in 

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:06.210
 see all the comments 

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:07.860
 We started a new game and you will see 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.449
 and there already I start with all the 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.490
 traits and with all the features 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:14.279
 what have you said to me I hope you like it 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:16.270
 the idea is a bit crazy we will try that 

00:07:14.279 --> 00:07:18.520
 from this 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.650
 I do not know if a daily video but every two 

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:23.230
 days would be interesting to keep it 

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.970
 I am alive and active to see if I see you this way I see you 

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:27.880
 with desire so let's laugh a 

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:29.980
 little bit because I see that this promises 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.390
 friends this promises and you know if 

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.860
 you want to get the game is so 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.690
 simple me in this case I have 

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:36.610
 got in all cases I leave the 

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:37.930
 description in the description in the 

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:40.570
 link 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:42.250
 and you can also create our 

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:44.350
 world logically but let's enjoy 

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.389
 a little bit of the sims 4 together 

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:47.800
