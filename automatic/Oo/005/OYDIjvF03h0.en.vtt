00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:05.040
 and after overcoming political problems with a monarchy of more than 200 years 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.330
 mentally one of the countries where football has improved its level in the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.950
 last years now he expects his leaders and fans to remain active 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.700
 in the league that develops its players this sector 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.420
 officially democratic federal republic in the country after a long 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.410
 and bloody civil war that ended more than 200 years monarchy today is one 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.470
 of the countries that make up southern Asia 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.350
 their language is in Nepal and their culture is mainly influenced by the 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:36.990
 Indian and Tibetan 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.540
 this nation whose population is about 30 million inhabitants football is 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.790
 a passion despite the inconveniences to keep the league active 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.560
 arica pca considered one of the best footballers in history in spain 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.220
 is now the sports director of the police of that country and rejects 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.860
 openly how the organization has been organized in recent years 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.640
 lic 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.560
 the fact that politics is causing our league to be postponed 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.670
 It is often ridiculous and typical of Nepal 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.540
 I think politics should never be involved with sport unless 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.939
 that people are helping and letting it grow, I think that 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.700
 disputes and disagreements should not cause the collapse of a league 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.719
 two teams integrate the first division of football 3 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:24.430
 and there after the retirement of javi 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.640
 one of the players that stands out is for something more 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.950
 young man who is called to improve the performance of the now police chief 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.620
 b 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.830
 we are very confident and without being arrogant this we feel timba civilians in 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.090
 this moment it is important to maintain our concern and we have to 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.880
 keep winning to do it we work very hard train what is necessary to 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.370
 be the best team 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.710
 so we keep working hard and I'm sure we will continue to be the 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.020
 team to beat 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.230
 the team that everyone wants to win and that would be very good with me 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.610
 In addition to the title of his team aspires beaten the record that has jaric 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.610
 kaka with more goals in the national team 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.540
 puccio 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.500
 The national team of Nepal only plays one or two international matches 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.239
 year 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.789
 so it's more to be very difficult to break the record in ariz 

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:19.259
 if we got to play a little more games then I'm sure that 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.259
 I will be able to break your record 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.580
 maintaining the level of the last campaign is one of the leaders' objectives 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.719
 curbelo will start in reality 

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:32.239
 I feel good right now because right now we have a league in full 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.259
 functioning 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:37.239
 it's a very competitive league with good players and having a good league 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.849
 stable national is crucial if we want young players to be 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:45.109
 develop and aspire to be footballers like javi as captain of the club's 

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.109
 police want to inspire young people to win more trophies 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:52.899
 for now the leaders and fans of the football club of the police of 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:54.380
 called the Himalayan country 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.980
 they expect the team to maintain the level and that it earned the title reached 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.870
 last campaign
