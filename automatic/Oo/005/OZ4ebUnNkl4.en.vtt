00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.649
 in times of internet and social networks 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.900
 it is difficult to imagine that the albums of 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.840
 cups still awake in 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.269
 fascination in collectors and this only 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.500
 until you reach this bank of the Duke Avenue 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.100
 of caxias 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.199
 here young children and adults gather 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.720
 to change cards and complete the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.060
 albums the tables and chairs were 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.179
 placed by the owner of the bank 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.489
 to facilitate the exchange within a few days of 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.610
 week the bank is open from seven 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.469
 midnight to ten at night everything to 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.360
 meet the collectors 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:45.989
 We really want to improve. 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.690
 playing so the staff is tested the exchange 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.129
 the more tranquil you have a place of support 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.780
 to sign the squares there 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.730
 so it makes it easier for everyone to stay a little 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.160
 more comfortable Claudius came to the 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.170
 put together a list to get easier 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.170
 identify the cards that are 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.510
 missing and collectors can leave 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.210
 to the bank to make the 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.090
 but there are those who prefer to fill the 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.640
 album is gradually the case of Pedro 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.530
 came to the bank with his father in search of 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.560
 last cards 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.180
 About 20 cards are missing for 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.720
 end up like this 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.830
 but it was easy for me because I have 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.830
 a lot of people are collecting 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.310
 My father is helping me. He 's coming. 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.560
 in the stands here it was easy and 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.360
 accompanying Peter is not a task 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.270
 difficult for the team 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.729
 I like football and you notice that. 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.979
 feeling of filling the album with 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.630
 change the cards you buy 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.820
 have to buy to start but then 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.640
 and it's cool for you to interact with people 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.470
 changing and that's what he likes and I 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.229
 I even participate, I'll start a 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.369
 hotel collection hoping to get the album 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.990
 hardcover 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.790
 As soon as I arrive I will start a collection 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.040
 for me it will wait too 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.440
 collecting the cards can be a 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.630
 way to feel more present in the 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.910
 competition is what this 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.680
 Unesp Researcher in Bauru 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.420
 in a way the world cup in the 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.850
 countries in which football is a sport 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:26.910
 prevalence is very close to a 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:30.330
 rite that it is periodic and the 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.510
 people have is one way or another to 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.200
 to accuse the collection of cup cards 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.950
 as a kind of come join be 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.130
 there and from there the memory the memory 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.709
 not have the memory not only of the event but also 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.720
 also the collector own your 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:51.959
 celso knows well what it is to revive the memory 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.330
 for a while his first collection was 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.470
 in childhood with little cards that came in 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.709
 bullets 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.410
 this does not stop being refer to 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:06.209
 people to childhood refer to childhood does 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.040
 what do we remember about time 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.170
 from childhood this is very good wine 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.959
 brings satisfaction to us, huh? 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.150
 but he recognizes that today's albums 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:18.540
 in no way resemble those of old 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.660
 improved quality and access to 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.590
 Cards are easier, only pleasure is 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.280
 the same 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.350
 we relate with child 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.440
 adult with 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.340
 a woman man and the girls of everything 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.470
 How much is it? 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.090
 they come here to change the card as if 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.370
 people were friends with the house 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.630
 besides the interaction between the others 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.910
 collectors 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.280
 albums are also a way of 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.940
 acquire knowledge of my childhood 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:50.940
 I collected the theme cards were 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.920
 flags and uniforms of the 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.810
 Truth I met, of course I knew countries. 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.450
 which do not exist today but due to 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.810
 decolonization everything else but I believe 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.000
 that a significant part in that 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.220
 moment of knowledge in the world and the 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.510
 history of the world has occurred through 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.830
 motive figures is the knowledge 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.280
 sociability of negative we have 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.810
 some situations such as 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.140
 first they cost money 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.000
 the cards are linked 11 in the 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.200
 market around some industry 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.980
 cultural 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:29.010
 and we sometimes see situations in which 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:33.210
 adults and children spend more than 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:35.640
 can influence saw money from other 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.160
 activities for the gustavo figurines 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.680
 son of the bank owner has already spent around 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.200
 thousand and five hundred reais in the purchase of 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.230
 he resells the cards 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.080
 separate to make it easier for 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.310
 the people complete the album is the cable 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.560
 over five cents in each 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.590
 card with the reseller is a crazy as well 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.510
 Little you'll see, but it's more for 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.480
 even a matter of helping people 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:03.030
 the supermarket parking lot is another 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.550
 place of exchange of cards in the city 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.490
 here is the owner of the bank who also 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.790
 stimulates the exchange between collectors 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.270
 the incentive brings return of the trade the 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.730
 You must bring the willful crime into the 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.250
 it seems she has only consolidated person 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.700
 come because the figure drunk only in banking 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.100
 huh 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:26.040
 milena came for the first time with 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.840
 children and approved the space for 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.540
 buy very encourages but it stays 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.240
 switching means so well understand 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.640
 slowly and then complete a 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.070
 new car for free between an exchange and 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:41.129
 another little girl did not resist fatigue 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:43.649
 ended up taking a nap right there 

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:45.239
 seems to indicate that the movement still 

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:48.869
 should increase 

00:05:45.239 --> 00:05:50.580
 the cup passed by last year 2010 was 

00:05:48.869 --> 00:05:52.319
 very good but now this period 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.529
 trying to Brazil in the person wants 

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:57.779
 save a recollection there so she I 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:06:00.869
 I think I already know that we do not have numbers. 

00:05:57.779 --> 00:06:03.919
 exact but dubbed quietly 

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:03.919
 double interest
