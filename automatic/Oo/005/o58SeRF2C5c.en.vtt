the basics how do you exactly perform a
chip<00:00:44.040> shot<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.850> will<00:00:44.970> need<00:00:45.150> to<00:00:45.300> press<00:00:45.570> l1<00:00:45.900> and

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
chip shot you will need to press l1 and

in<00:00:53.460> my<00:00:53.520> opinion<00:00:54.060> there<00:00:54.300> are<00:00:54.330> two<00:00:54.450> types<00:00:55.080> of

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
in my opinion there are two types of

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.160 
in my opinion there are two types of
cheap<00:00:55.770> shots<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.370> spectacular<00:00:56.640> ones<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.720> the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
cheap shots the spectacular ones and the

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.710 
cheap shots the spectacular ones and the
efficient<00:00:58.950> ones<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.400> we'll<00:00:59.850> start<00:01:00.240> with<00:01:00.480> the

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
efficient ones and we'll start with the

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.290 
efficient ones and we'll start with the
second<00:01:01.260> category<00:01:01.610> you<00:01:02.610> will<00:01:02.730> need<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.090> perform

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
second category you will need to perform

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.090 
second category you will need to perform
this<00:01:03.810> finishing<00:01:04.260> technique<00:01:04.620> when<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.010> are

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
this finishing technique when you are

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.710 
this finishing technique when you are
out<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.730> counter-attack<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.600> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
out on a counter-attack and the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.720 
out on a counter-attack and the
goalkeeper<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.560> coming<00:01:08.070> out<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.550> goal

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
goalkeeper is coming out of the goal

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.090 
goalkeeper is coming out of the goal
this<00:01:08.940> is<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> most<00:01:09.420> basic<00:01:09.810> chip<00:01:10.440> shot<00:01:10.680> finish

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
this is the most basic chip shot finish

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.030 
this is the most basic chip shot finish
but<00:01:11.730> we<00:01:11.910> have<00:01:12.210> another<00:01:12.600> efficient<00:01:13.290> one<00:01:13.500> when

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
but we have another efficient one when

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.130 
but we have another efficient one when
you<00:01:14.190> are<00:01:14.220> performing<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:15.090> cheap<00:01:15.390> pass<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
you are performing a cheap pass in the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.350 
you are performing a cheap pass in the
opponent's<00:01:16.650> penalty<00:01:17.070> box<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:18.000> ball<00:01:18.210> is

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
opponent's penalty box and the ball is

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.810 
opponent's penalty box and the ball is
bouncing<00:01:18.870> and<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.260> is<00:01:19.500> very<00:01:19.830> important<00:01:20.580> if

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
bouncing and this is very important if

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.660 
bouncing and this is very important if
the<00:01:21.090> ball<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.420> bouncing<00:01:21.900> or<00:01:22.110> if<00:01:22.770> it's<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
the ball is bouncing or if it's in the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.880 
the ball is bouncing or if it's in the
air<00:01:23.880> after<00:01:24.120> your<00:01:24.420> first<00:01:24.750> touch<00:01:25.020> this<00:01:25.650> will

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
air after your first touch this will

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.980 
air after your first touch this will
increase<00:01:26.370> your<00:01:26.550> chances<00:01:27.120> of<00:01:27.180> lobbing<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
increase your chances of lobbing the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.680 
increase your chances of lobbing the
goalkeeper<00:01:28.680> even<00:01:29.130> if<00:01:29.310> he<00:01:29.580> is<00:01:29.700> not<00:01:29.729> so<00:01:30.210> far<00:01:30.659> from

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
goalkeeper even if he is not so far from

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.899 
goalkeeper even if he is not so far from
the<00:01:31.140> goal<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.890> fact<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.370> the<00:01:32.490> ball<00:01:32.700> is

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
the goal the fact that the ball is

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.270 
the goal the fact that the ball is
bouncing<00:01:33.600> will<00:01:33.810> allow<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.170> striker<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:35.040> give

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
bouncing will allow the striker to give

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.580 
bouncing will allow the striker to give
a<00:01:35.310> higher<00:01:35.790> curve<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.510> ball<00:01:36.720> thus<00:01:37.320> being

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
a higher curve to the ball thus being

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.160 
a higher curve to the ball thus being
more<00:01:37.920> precise<00:01:38.580> and<00:01:38.940> fooling<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.600> goalkeeper

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
more precise and fooling the goalkeeper

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.750 
more precise and fooling the goalkeeper
and<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.620> is<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> most<00:01:41.070> common<00:01:41.610> and

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:41.760 
and this is the most common and

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.200 
and this is the most common and
risk-free<00:01:42.630> way<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.500> using<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.220> chip<00:01:44.460> shot<00:01:44.729> now

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
risk-free way of using a chip shot now

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.210 
risk-free way of using a chip shot now
that<00:01:45.450> we<00:01:45.630> are<00:01:45.659> done<00:01:46.080> with<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.500> normal<00:01:46.950> chip

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
that we are done with the normal chip

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.130 
that we are done with the normal chip
let's<00:01:47.520> move<00:01:47.760> to<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> advanced<00:01:48.720> one<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
let's move to the advanced one the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.039 
let's move to the advanced one the
spectacular<00:01:50.100> chip<00:01:50.490> that's<00:01:51.120> a<00:01:51.270> bit<00:01:51.450> risky<00:01:51.720> but

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
spectacular chip that's a bit risky but

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.399 
spectacular chip that's a bit risky but
sometimes<00:01:52.590> can<00:01:53.159> be<00:01:53.400> so<00:01:53.790> reward<00:01:54.360> full<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:54.990> order

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
sometimes can be so reward full in order

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.830 
sometimes can be so reward full in order
to<00:01:55.560> perform<00:01:56.190> this<00:01:56.490> type<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.850> chip<00:01:57.299> shot<00:01:57.540> you'll

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
to perform this type of chip shot you'll

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.990 
to perform this type of chip shot you'll
need<00:01:58.080> to<00:01:58.229> be<00:01:58.409> coming<00:01:58.950> from<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.340> more<00:01:59.549> narrow

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
need to be coming from a more narrow

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.450 
need to be coming from a more narrow
angle<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.200> only<00:02:01.409> reason<00:02:01.740> why<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.130> is

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
angle and the only reason why this is

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.520 
angle and the only reason why this is
needed<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:03.000> because<00:02:03.450> if<00:02:03.690> you<00:02:03.869> are<00:02:04.020> in<00:02:04.229> this

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
needed is because if you are in this

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.859 
needed is because if you are in this
type<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.799> angle<00:02:05.400> the<00:02:05.820> goalkeeper<00:02:06.420> will<00:02:06.630> have

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
type of angle the goalkeeper will have

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.889 
type of angle the goalkeeper will have
to<00:02:07.110> exit<00:02:07.830> a<00:02:08.009> bit<00:02:08.369> more<00:02:08.789> from<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.359> goal<00:02:09.659> to

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
to exit a bit more from the goal to

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.160 
to exit a bit more from the goal to
close<00:02:10.259> even<00:02:11.219> even<00:02:11.639> more<00:02:11.879> your<00:02:12.090> angle<00:02:12.510> thus<00:02:12.959> you

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
close even even more your angle thus you

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.940 
close even even more your angle thus you
will<00:02:13.230> have<00:02:13.469> the<00:02:13.590> upper

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
will have the upper

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.550 
will have the upper
tunity<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.340> chip<00:02:14.730> him<00:02:15.030> but<00:02:15.209> only<00:02:15.660> do<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.290> chip

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
tunity to chip him but only do the chip

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.430 
tunity to chip him but only do the chip
and<00:02:16.800> the<00:02:17.190> far<00:02:17.550> corner<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.269> order<00:02:18.720> for<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.260> ball

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
and the far corner in order for the ball

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.710 
and the far corner in order for the ball
to<00:02:19.620> get<00:02:19.769> as<00:02:20.010> much<00:02:20.370> curve<00:02:20.849> and<00:02:21.120> for<00:02:21.540> the

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
to get as much curve and for the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.630 
to get as much curve and for the
goalkeeper<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.410> have<00:02:22.650> difficulty<00:02:23.459> in

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
goalkeeper to have difficulty in

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.850 
goalkeeper to have difficulty in
reaching<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.330> place<00:02:24.629> where<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.379> ball<00:02:25.620> will

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
reaching the place where the ball will

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.880 
reaching the place where the ball will
land<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.670> also<00:02:26.879> helps<00:02:27.390> if<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.750> are<00:02:27.900> not<00:02:28.140> facing

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890
