00:00:54.055 --> 00:00:58.055
(TAJIRI says)Ok good! They have been practicing actually since 12:00PM. 

00:00:59.493 --> 00:01:03.493
(Do it participate in the practice of SMASH and how?)

00:01:04.864 --> 00:01:08.864
There are a lot of players at the same level as me in Ice ribbon. 

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:13.219
However, I am utmost to run after because a lot of people whose level is higher than I are here. 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.710
Though I might not be able to catch up.

00:01:21.683 --> 00:01:24.683
I am feelings that became trainees.

00:01:28.656 --> 00:01:32.656
(Did it notice because it practiced with Syuri?)

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.470
I do not only understand because I am not after it begins a workout.

00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:51.741
(Then, in view of you, how about Makoto's impression?)

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:19.902
I do not think that it is often naturally understood to practice for the first time. 

00:02:22.443 --> 00:02:26.443
However, she can adapt oneself at once at the time of beginning.

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:44.555
When I was a beginner, I think that she is wonderful because I was not able to do at all. 

00:02:56.677 --> 00:03:00.677
(The ambition for fighting with Serena of former WWE DIVA?)

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:42.419
I think that I am rich because I can fight against Serena in the first game this year though I was allowed to play a game with the player of former WWE last year. 

00:03:51.832 --> 00:03:55.832
I think that I can make the best use of by absorbing a good point in the future. 

00:04:02.276 --> 00:04:06.276
I am never defeated. 

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:16.986
I had been looking at Serena on the television a long time ago. 

00:04:21.293 --> 00:04:25.293
So,I cannot believe to fight with her still. 

00:04:26.568 --> 00:04:30.568
I make this chance myself without fail. 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.840
I show it exceeding her. 

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:41.079
(Do you think about something a new technique?)

00:04:45.254 --> 00:04:49.254
I think about it. 

00:04:53.862 --> 00:04:57.862
(Can it be shown now?)

00:06:25.486 --> 00:06:29.486
(TAJIRI says)You are made the next chance to show them a new technique. 

00:06:37.097 --> 00:06:41.097
(What is your ambition of this year?)

00:06:55.916 --> 00:06:59.916
I want to learn a lot and to improve the step. 

00:07:04.393 --> 00:07:08.393
I want to approach my dream. 

00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:13.331
I advance my story even a little early.
