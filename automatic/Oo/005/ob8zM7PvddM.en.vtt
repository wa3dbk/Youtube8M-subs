00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.650
 we are going to weave this point that is very 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.800
 simple is a fantasy point that 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.440
 We can use in different 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.760
 and projects is based on whole points 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.900
 chains and media embossed dots 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.380
 we will work for this I already have a 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:28.160
 chain and from number five I go 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:32.689
 to start making whole points 1 2 3 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:39.170
 4 5 in number 6 I will make 3 points 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:41.060
 integers from there 1 2 and 3 I leave a 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:46.230
 base chain and some chain of 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:48.800
 separation and I will go back to do 3 1 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.800
 two 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.540
 3 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.940
 again a chain of separation and 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.680
 I leave a base chain and go back to 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.260
 work 1 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.460
 everyone 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.250
 and 3 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.990
 again a chain of separation one 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:16.530
 base chain and I go back to work 3 1 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.530
 two 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:22.299
 3 and to finish to be at our 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:27.470
 edge we make a separation chain 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:30.590
 we leave a base and a whole point 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.980
 we finish this row in the next 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.760
 we raise a chain and we make a medium 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.130
 point 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.570
 in the first point we make a chain 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.880
 okay 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.600
 we are in the reverse then we are going to 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.600
 do here 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.900
 one 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:57.090
 half point in back relief we make 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.630
 1 2 3 chains and again a half 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.330
 posterior embossed point so that this 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.480
 it's like that ok 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.450
 we make a chain and again half 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:14.220
 back relief point 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:18.569
 1 2 3 and we go back to work half a point 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:22.379
 in back relief a chain of 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:28.780
 separation a half point in relief 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:31.690
 later in the first integer 1 2 3 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.500
 again of posterior relief 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:39.250
 we leave a chain again we take a 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.130
 emboss the back one two three 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.750
 chains 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.630
 again we take the whole highlighted 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.180
 after a chain and we finish 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.640
 leaving a chain we end up doing 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:58.200
 a half point 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:03:01.400
 we raise 1 2 3 and 4 and we flip this is 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.400
 what we are going to have now 

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:09.350
 are the aritos we have here ahead 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.510
 ok then now how are we going to work 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.940
 we already raised our three more chains 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.990
 a separation where are the 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.240
 We're going to make three integers 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.720
 two 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.720
 Y 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:31.160
 ok let's make a chain of 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:33.640
 separation and again let's do 3 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.370
 two 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.290
 chains one of separation and in the 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.440
 next ring let's make three 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.040
 Wave heads 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.040
 two 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:51.950
 one of separation and again we make 3 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.160
 integers 2 and 3 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.480
 a separation chain and we're going to do 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:02.180
 one whole point at the end of the row 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:05.359
 look, there it was 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:08.989
 how we work now in the same way 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:12.500
 we raise a chain we turn and go 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.599
 to make a half point at the start a 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.540
 chain we made back relief no 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:23.100
 we do the same posterior relief 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:26.220
 1 2 3 chains and again the relief 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.650
 later in the last whole a string 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:32.100
 of separation in the first whole 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:35.190
 back relief half point 1 2 3 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:38.250
 chains and again in the last whole 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:45.260
 back relief so let's work 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:45.260
 the whole row to finish 1 2 3 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:52.819
 again highlight a separation in 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:57.409
 this half point of relief one two three 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:57.409
 of that half point relief 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:05.409
 a chain and we leave a chain here 

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.810
 of separation and we make our means 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:10.889
 point 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:13.729
 we raise 1 2 3 and a chain of 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.979
 separation and there it is 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.919
 we repeat the same thing in the 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.520
 rings let's make 3 integers 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.009
 two 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.919
 3 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:27.740
 a separation chain and we go back to 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:31.219
 make three integers in the next 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.139
 ring 2 and 3 

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:35.210
 a chain of separation and in the 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:36.990
 next ring we go back to work what 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.530
 same 1 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.530
 two 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:47.050
 one of separation and the next 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:50.530
 we work like 3 integers we do 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:54.240
 our separation chain and a 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:54.240
 whole at the end 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:00.270
 there being this work 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:03.650
 They see that it looks cute and there it is as we 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.650
 it's behind 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:11.569
 it looks perfect I hope you have them 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.569
 enjoyed enjoy weaving
