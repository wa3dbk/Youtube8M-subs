00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.839
 I welcome a colleague with you pavel gray hair and 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.059
 Now I invite you to make 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:10.980
 boat trip on the beautiful 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.719
 the Caribbean Sea along the coast 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.509
 Dominican Republic 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.029
 but during this walk we will not 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.619
 so much rest so much discuss one of 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.169
 the most topical 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:27.620
 for very many no one 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:30.440
 this question concerns our customers 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.750
 Unfortunately absolutely everyone who 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:36.320
 engaged in the sewing business come across 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.440
 customers who just endure us 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.740
 brain shakes nerves boil water and so on 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.360
 makes a bunch of unfounded claims 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:49.670
 on which we spend a lot of our 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.620
 precious time and by the end these people 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.180
 still not happy 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:00.019
 remain so that we do for them what 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:05.449
 what to do with such people what to do 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:06.350
 with such from the client heads of so many 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.070
 sewers 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.159
 there is a very clear belief that 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.830
 the client is always right in our time for 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.159
 any customer needs to cling to any 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.650
 the client must be valued therefore it is better 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.280
 be silent and endure all these troubles 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.310
 which are related to working with exactly here 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.010
 such customers as the right thing to do 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.260
 in the case of missing a customer and 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.900
 it would be desirable but at the same time fine 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.170
 do you understand 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.710
 the client is likely to be unhappy yet 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:46.960
 and washed out of you looking for nerves and take 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:49.480
 taught your time I suggest enters 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.910
 as follows , firstly you need to very 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.900
 clearly understood by the neighbor and engaged 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.850
 shakes business 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.370
 we deal mainly because of two 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.130
 of things because it brings us 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.910
 satisfaction is pleasure from work and 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.300
 Secondly 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.630
 of course 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.310
 that too 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.790
 it is important . 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.600
 we have good money so here's a combination 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.800
 these two things will not promote your 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.620
 business forward 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.260
 if you do not enjoy 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.700
 work with such answers understand this your 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.270
 business and better 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:31.200
 it is better to refuse such clients immediately 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.750
 spend this time on those people who 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.640
 will be more adequate which end 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.060
 the ends will turn your sweat 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.750
 regular customers and will be later 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.030
 advise other people to contact you 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.180
 familiar relatives and colleagues 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.400
 so on and unfortunately our time 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.340
 life and our working time is pretty 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:57.480
 limited so let's spend it on 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:59.489
 those customers that we like to 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.310
 which I like with whom we have 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:06.380
 there are mutual sympathies and which 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:09.870
 will bring us much more income and 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.900
 save us our precious nerves 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.989
 time and by and large the same 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.570
 children and what to do with such 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:21.290
 negative customers I'll open here 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:25.170
 one small secret of such customers 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.660
 better send our competitors let 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.990
 it will be a secret weapon against ours 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.500
 competitors yes if we give up 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:35.900
 work with such a person and he goes 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.000
 he is also a competitor in most cases 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.120
 will make our competitor a bridge will 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.480
 boil water will tie hands and 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.400
 feet will push some 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.980
 impracticable demands give them a way 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.590
 I propose to consider such 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.620
 negative customers as our secret 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.370
 weapons against competitors and do not need 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.050
 to be afraid 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:02.600
 refuse to work to those customers who 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.940
 you don't like it and that just shakes 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.980
 you nerves imagine that on this 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.440
 the boat now the man will be exactly 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.480
 life vest and will start something 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.090
 tell the captain how you think 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.760
 what will he do with him I think that everything 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.950
 Pirates of the Caribbean watched the movie 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.210
 and we are now in the Caribbean 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:26.140
 and roughly imagine what will be so 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:29.180
 clients who are on the sea walk 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.430
 starts to create water and wind nerves 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.870
 captain 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.810
 so just use the right ones 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.510
 technology to attract customers and then 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.360
 you will not have a lack of customers 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.790
 then you can choose those people with 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.940
 which you nicer and profitable 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.010
 work for now so far thank you for 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.150
 attention with you was pavel fitting and i 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.150
 I wish you noted
