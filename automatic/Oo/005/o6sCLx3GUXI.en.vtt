going<00:01:13.740> on<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.369> as<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.000> say<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.270> was<00:01:15.390> its<00:01:15.600> told

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
going on and as I say it was its told

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.320

outside<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.350> chronological<00:01:16.619> order<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.460> it's

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
outside of chronological order so it's

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.969 
outside of chronological order so it's
really<00:01:18.570> one<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.020> those<00:01:19.200> things<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.619> comes

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
really one of those things that comes

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.440 
really one of those things that comes
together<00:01:20.189> right<00:01:20.610> at<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> end<00:01:20.970> where<00:01:21.270> you

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
together right at the end where you

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.969 
together right at the end where you
realize<00:01:21.840> everything<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.530> you've<00:01:22.650> done<00:01:22.680> up

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
realize everything that you've done up

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.039 
realize everything that you've done up
to<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.159> point<00:01:23.460> has<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> significance<00:01:24.840> and

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
to that point has a significance and

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.020 
to that point has a significance and
makes<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.830> big<00:01:26.340> difference<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.850> code<00:01:27.000> of

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
makes a big difference in the code of

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.149 
makes a big difference in the code of
the<00:01:27.180> story<00:01:27.509> even<00:01:27.930> though<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.259> takes<00:01:28.409> over<00:01:28.829> 15

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the story even though it takes over 15

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.100 
the story even though it takes over 15
or<00:01:29.280> 16<00:01:29.520> years<00:01:29.790> of<00:01:29.880> her<00:01:30.000> life<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.780> know<00:01:30.869> one

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
or 16 years of her life you know one

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.510 
or 16 years of her life you know one
scene<00:01:31.350> in<00:01:31.530> which<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.770> might<00:01:31.890> be<00:01:32.040> six<00:01:32.280> years

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
scene in which you might be six years

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.730 
scene in which you might be six years
old<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:32.970> seems<00:01:33.210> she<00:01:33.390> might<00:01:33.540> be<00:01:33.659> 23<00:01:34.259> it's

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
old and it seems she might be 23 it's

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.170 
old and it seems she might be 23 it's
time<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.040> think<00:01:35.189> so<00:01:35.460> what<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.640> means<00:01:35.909> for<00:01:36.000> the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
time to think so what that means for the

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.630 
time to think so what that means for the
story<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.799> does<00:01:38.040> jump<00:01:38.280> little<00:01:38.460> jump

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
story is that it does jump little jump

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.330 
story is that it does jump little jump
