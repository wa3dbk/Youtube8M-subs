 five tips to take pictures outside 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.570
 I like to express you outside 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.210

 in the winter again you can be beautiful 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.310
 go out and take some nice pictures 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.500
 a kind of small photowork maybe 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.550
 do with yourself and his girlfriend and 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.910
 maybe also around dogs or 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.650

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.940
 which one should pay attention to the me 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.460
 In any case considered here 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.580
 he gets now tip number one take 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.989

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.629
 shooting I always have everything with me 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.309
 tripod softbox here without pocket on 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.559
 every case two reflectors 180 he too 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.239
 always important and here a camera 600d 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.680
 I also have half-size one knows 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.050
 yes never what else is my backpack 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.059
 us5 lenses still up to the 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.800
 clean so if synonymous raining so 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.449
 plastic bags everything with it so must it 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.430
 must be so prepared will can 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.110
 anything can happen come models 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.460
 everything is coming so always 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.680
 In any case, everything is prepared 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.640
 start and water bottle always important 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.990
 drink catalogs 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.850
 I really do when I'm outside 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.010
 Just take a picture of the camera 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.930
 while an objective only with it 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.979
 mostly a zoom lens sometimes but 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.899
 also really a fixed focal length and 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.460
 then still a very small one 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:21.020
 camera bag I can easily do the whole 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.390
 relax quickly put in again 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.469
 get out and that's all there is to it 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.729
 do not have anymore 

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:27.740
 if I just so spontaneous times 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.979
 go out and take pictures number 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.380
 Two sets a goal thought through 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.640
 before what you wanted to photograph 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.680
 it's much easier outside then 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.090
 to find cool motives because many people 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.219
 are just outside and are 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.189
 overwhelmed because they perceive everything 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:45.079
 conceivable and therefore still form part of it 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.640
 supersprinter play here 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.590
 Dogs are from the children's playground 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.159
 keep away from me I sit down today 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:53.090
 aim 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.859
 I only take pictures and signs 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.600
 then try it cool somehow in 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:57.890
 set scene and maybe 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.140
 just always from the same 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.939
 perspective of this shield or others 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.030
 signs to photograph or 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.780
 for example, the sign up here 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.579
 street signs just different times 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.560
 Take a photo of his street signs or his 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:11.060
 sons draw there are whole blocks 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.700
 Volvo just always a note 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.270
 to be photographed etc 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.830
 bicycles or whatever uli deck to 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.590
 example can also be interesting 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.090
 always from above and then consciously times 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.160
 go out and 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.610
 just that just photographed tip number 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.319
 three let yourself be inspired 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.599
 even if your plan just has it easy 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.040
 times to be inspired so times off 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.200
 maybe also from what you thought 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.769
 just look if horny this horny 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.569
 flowers age really fresh roster 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.970
 bells the first ones already blooming 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.980
 and then just take a picture 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.160
 must be so fun to make and must 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.780
 now important only force only 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.090
 signs or just anything 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.959
 has also photograph break times 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.120
 short fun again 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.500
 and then it goes back to 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.810
 the pictures or what you say 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.569
 actually wanted to photograph this 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.650
 but still keep your eyes open 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.299
 be inspired and maybe find 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.610
 her also a shield with a flower 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.190
 Together or a flower foreground 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.760
 represents in the background whatever 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:15.040
 Tip number four also quiet in the 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.599
 semi-automatic modes change just when 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.650
 it should be a bit more spontaneous or 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.420
 for example, on vacation 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.000
 is on the way or something he uses me 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.620
 very often the av mode and goes 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.540
 Just like that, if I know where the sun is 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.430
 seems so open aperture 8 yes if the 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.799
 Sun laughs dazzle the eight or even 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.959
 a shutter 9 and then read the camera 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.220
 just adjust the rest because it should 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.600
 yes sometimes go fast yes 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:40.180
 a beautiful exciting fast photo 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:43.090
 i was simply mode and hereditary 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.859
 I have the picture correct that is like there 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.209
 you do not always have to wait where was 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.590
 but is sometimes quite nice if 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.389
 It should be fast a day 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.480
 Experience mode and no fear of it 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:56.019
 there you can as an active photo 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.220
 historically with a shield i got myself 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:03.099
 today only signs are focused 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.780
 take pictures and take photos 

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:10.569
 smartphone mode is a little bit different 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:12.010
 to dark corrected after and shield 10 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.220
 watch student I think it is right 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:18.130
 children and tim robbins pay attention to the 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.630
 daytime the daytime all this 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.050
 decisive what we need well graf 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.539
 your light and the light 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.639
 is different at different times of the day 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.680
 That's why when I take pictures outside 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.340
 and I really have the choice 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.229
 in the evening or in the morning before work 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.540
 the work anyway not 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.950
 beautiful 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.990
 newspaper to take pictures at lunchtime 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.240
 the sun is very high 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.300
 light very very hard very very strong 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:47.690
 now in the evening you have completely different warm 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.430
 soft curved quality from the light 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.250
 and can bach much smaller photos 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.510
 At least I feel 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.770
 Of course, it also has its charm at noon 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.050
 it always depends on what you do 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.970
 Therefore , be aware of it 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.980
 on the daytime when we are outside 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:02.480
 photographed that was for this week 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.850
