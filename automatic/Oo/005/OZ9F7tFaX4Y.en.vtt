00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.910
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:04.890
 This is a table tennis wisdom bag 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.170
 Nice to meet you Today is 7 o'clock in the morning 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.320
 Nice to meet you Today's theme 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.789
 About Back Magic Serve 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:20.300
 I would like to introduce it to you There is no such thing as serve of great skill 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.630
 It is okay if you only have a small back serve 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.650
 If you can do basic back service 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.430
 This time Back Magic Serve Service Ace 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.300
 Give everyone a serve you can easily go to 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.219
 I will introduce two in a word 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.170
 What does this back magic serve say 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:43.059
 At the very last minute of serving back serve 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:01:00.559
 It is a technique such as changing the rotation 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.989
 Recommended serve first eye it is everyone 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.750
 First of all, please prepare the back serve of the side down rotation 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.280
 The last moment to put out the side down rotation 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.710
 It is a skill that changes to the sideways rotation at the last minute 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.300
 In fact, it is back serve and everyone's usual back serve 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.540
 First of all the basics of the back serve toss up 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.490
 While moving the racket from left to right 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.770
 Rubbing the ball directly behind this is the basic of the back 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.960
 For example, the angle of the side rotation server bracket is 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.520
 With the back side facing the ceiling with a feeling like facing the ceiling 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.200
 When serving back with the back side facing the ceiling 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.390
 The side of this racket is side down rotation 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.860
 Back side waking up waking up 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.620
 When I put back serve, it turned sideways 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.990
 I think everyone knows 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.820
 Among them, I am very effective 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.420
 How to get in this back down rotation 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.730
 Side-down rotation The surface is correctly directed upward 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.420
 I really say I'm going out sideways 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.730
 I say by putting on the atmosphere and putting out the side down rotation 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.650
 Take a spin on the side at the moment you strike and pretend to hit 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.840
 It is very effective now If it is a serve of usual fore 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.390
 It is a bit difficult to change the rotation just before 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.280
 If it is a back serve, put out the side of the side down rotation 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.140
 By the time it had fallen to the end 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.500
 Suddenly raise the face and change to sideways rotation 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.530
 I can do it at the last minute I'll serve 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.420
 It is a technique of changing the rotation 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.010
 I can do this with a back serve 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.880
 So I often use this side down sideways clearly 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.700
 I think everyone is cut off in the horizontal system too 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.580
 As you say, I think last time 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:07.490
 When you hit the ball, you will be on the side and raise the side. 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:10.290
 So shake the lower side and finally the upper side 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.660
 So while the other party put out the atmosphere of Tsutsuki 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:17.540
 In fact, the other party's Tsutsuki 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:26.709
 Easy to float 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.370
 It is worth enough to have only one interesting thing 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.370
 It's a serve but the second way 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.849
 Please try this too It is a back serve 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:41.319
 This time how to put out the back serve of side-to-side rotation 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.900
 Please face the racket 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.959
 It feels like it happens a bit 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.900
 Toss up with the atmosphere that the Yokogami system is about to start 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.879
 When hitting in this way when pulling left or right 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.739
 Suddenly open the surface at the last minute 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.129
 It is the exit of the face of the racket by going out sideways 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.300
 I am ready to put out the sideways 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.069
 Last but not least, the best part of back serve 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.459
 Take out the upper side like this and finally go down like this 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.470
 The top side is put out and finally it's just below 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.370
 At the last minute of the day 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.090
 I can betray this is interesting 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:21.590
 The really nice thing about backserve 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.910
 You can pretend at the end of the last and give a big swing 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.690
 How to put it out even if you give a big back serve 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.280
 Show it up with the face up 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.870
 At the last moment I hit it down 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.930
 Then you say that the other party comes up 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.380
 Because the lower side in the stance will rotate sideways 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.240
 For the time being, the other party will match or drop 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.280
 Missy receive becomes half-finished 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.230
 If it is very easy to receive a situation that is easy to receive mistakes 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:13.430
 think 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.910
 It's only this special way of rubbing 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.290
 I do not need a special rotation Everyone's simple 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.400
 Such last to usual usual back serve 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.280
 Now the technique of changing the rotation at the last moment 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.350
 You can reciprocate your opponent by inserting two patterns 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.610
 It's easy to do just because it's back serve 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.830
 These two serve will be the technique 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.310
 Please mix it with your serve. 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.230
 Thank you very much
