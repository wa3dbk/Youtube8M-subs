00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.300 
the first thing one of the first things
I<00:01:16.110> know<00:01:16.170> it's<00:01:16.350> from<00:01:16.470> this<00:01:16.590> picture<00:01:16.740> anyway<00:01:17.130> is

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
I know it's from this picture anyway is

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.710 
I know it's from this picture anyway is
that<00:01:17.340> next<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.970> action<00:01:18.299> bar<00:01:18.420> there's<00:01:18.689> a

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
that next the action bar there's a

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.030 
that next the action bar there's a
number<00:01:18.840> seven<00:01:19.320> which<00:01:19.470> means<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.799> we're

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
number seven which means that we're

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.590 
number seven which means that we're
getting<00:01:20.250> more<00:01:20.520> than<00:01:20.790> five<00:01:21.000> action<00:01:21.390> bars

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
getting more than five action bars

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.210 
getting more than five action bars
hopefully<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.680> means<00:01:22.830> we<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.189> have

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
hopefully that means we can have

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.800 
hopefully that means we can have
multiple<00:01:23.580> action<00:01:24.119> bars<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.479> spread<00:01:24.659> them

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
names different colors which is you know

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.939 
names different colors which is you know
it<00:03:17.430> solved<00:03:17.879> you<00:03:18.810> know<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:19.229> sets<00:03:19.680> them<00:03:19.829> apart

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:19.949 
it solved you know it sets them apart

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.740 
it solved you know it sets them apart
quite<00:03:20.609> easily<00:03:20.669> in<00:03:21.090> shot<00:03:21.269> so<00:03:21.419> you<00:03:21.510> don't<00:03:21.690> have

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
quite easily in shot so you don't have

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.619 
quite easily in shot so you don't have
to<00:03:21.959> pay<00:03:22.500> attention<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.979> who's<00:03:23.159> who<00:03:23.190> really<00:03:23.790> I

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
to pay attention to who's who really I

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:26.599 
to pay attention to who's who really I
guess<00:03:25.199> I'll<00:03:25.379> be<00:03:25.530> customizable<00:03:26.129> to<00:03:26.280> i'm<00:03:26.400> not

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
guess I'll be customizable to i'm not

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:27.920 
guess I'll be customizable to i'm not
sure<00:03:26.760> if<00:03:26.849> we'll<00:03:26.970> be<00:03:27.180> like<00:03:27.359> that<00:03:27.569> in<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.780> main

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
sure if we'll be like that in the main

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.210 
sure if we'll be like that in the main
game<00:03:27.959> but<00:03:28.409> you<00:03:28.470> can<00:03:28.620> see<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.799> different<00:03:29.099> tabs

right<00:03:40.260> hand<00:03:40.769> corner<00:03:40.919> I<00:03:41.280> think<00:03:41.459> it's<00:03:41.579> a<00:03:41.639> bit

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
right hand corner I think it's a bit

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.369 
right hand corner I think it's a bit
bigger<00:03:42.060> than<00:03:42.269> I<00:03:42.389> would<00:03:42.510> prefer<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.840> personal

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
bigger than I would prefer a personal

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.399 
bigger than I would prefer a personal
knee<00:03:43.500> but<00:03:43.709> obviously<00:03:44.069> that's<00:03:44.310> resizable<00:03:45.409> you

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:46.409 
knee but obviously that's resizable you

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.219 
knee but obviously that's resizable you
know<00:03:46.849> it's<00:03:47.849> not<00:03:48.090> in<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.329> right<00:03:48.449> place<00:03:48.810> for<00:03:48.840> a

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:49.229 
know it's not in the right place for a

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.969 
know it's not in the right place for a
star<00:03:49.470> but<00:03:49.709> obviously<00:03:50.069> it's<00:03:50.280> it's<00:03:50.549> an<00:03:50.699> alpha

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:51.979 
star but obviously it's it's an alpha

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:54.469 
star but obviously it's it's an alpha
then<00:03:52.979> you've<00:03:53.129> got<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.370> invent<00:03:53.729> in<00:03:53.940> action<00:03:54.329> bar

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:54.479 
then you've got the invent in action bar

then you've got the invent in action bar
and<00:03:54.629> things<00:03:54.780> at<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.019> bottom<00:03:55.229> which<00:03:55.349> i<00:03:55.500> think

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
and things at the bottom which i think

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.909 
and things at the bottom which i think
is<00:03:55.859> probably<00:03:56.159> how<00:03:56.430> I'll<00:03:56.579> have<00:03:56.790> my<00:03:56.970> lao<00:03:57.919> when

is probably how I'll have my lao when

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.469 
is probably how I'll have my lao when
i'm<00:03:59.099> doing<00:03:59.370> ppm<00:03:59.909> or<00:04:00.030> something<00:04:00.299> like<00:04:00.419> that

we're not entirely sure and there might

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.519 
we're not entirely sure and there might
be<00:04:21.150> an<00:04:21.329> adrenaline<00:04:21.779> but<00:04:21.930> it<00:04:22.079> just<00:04:22.200> hasn't<00:04:22.380> been
