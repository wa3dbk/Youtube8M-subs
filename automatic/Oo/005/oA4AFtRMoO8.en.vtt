00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:19.599 
the first a super awesome we wouldn't do

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:22.319 
the first a super awesome we wouldn't do
10<00:00:19.960> to<00:00:20.050> 12<00:00:20.320> years<00:00:20.560> except<00:00:21.520> I<00:00:21.760> saved<00:00:22.060> them<00:00:22.270> the

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:22.329 
10 to 12 years except I saved them the

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.780 
10 to 12 years except I saved them the
10<00:00:22.630> or<00:00:22.750> 12<00:00:22.990> years<00:00:23.079> of<00:00:23.829> running<00:00:24.130> around<00:00:24.340> pulling

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:24.790 
10 or 12 years of running around pulling

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.300 
10 or 12 years of running around pulling
on<00:00:25.060> the<00:00:25.210> debt<00:00:25.419> by<00:00:26.110> starting<00:00:26.680> off<00:00:26.860> in<00:00:26.890> the<00:00:27.130> first

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.310 
on the debt by starting off in the first

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.210 
on the debt by starting off in the first
three<00:00:27.730> minutes<00:00:28.380> teaching<00:00:29.380> them<00:00:29.590> the<00:00:29.619> same

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220 
three minutes teaching them the same

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.080 
three minutes teaching them the same
exercise<00:00:30.849> which<00:00:31.300> is<00:00:31.480> yield<00:00:31.750> to<00:00:31.960> the<00:00:32.050> pressure

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
exercise which is yield to the pressure

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.360 
exercise which is yield to the pressure
yeah<00:00:34.090> and<00:00:34.510> it's<00:00:34.750> a<00:00:34.810> pretty<00:00:35.020> channel<00:00:35.980> pressure

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.709 

and<00:00:39.370> then<00:00:39.519> I<00:00:39.550> don't<00:00:39.940> know<00:00:40.030> if<00:00:40.090> you<00:00:40.180> can<00:00:40.359> see<00:00:40.570> if

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
and then I don't know if you can see if

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.099 
and then I don't know if you can see if
there's<00:00:40.930> a<00:00:41.050> tiny<00:00:41.530> little<00:00:41.980> yielding<00:00:43.109> their

00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:44.109 
there's a tiny little yielding their

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:49.110 
there's a tiny little yielding their
tiny<00:00:44.649> little<00:00:44.980> bit<00:00:45.129> it's<00:00:45.250> often<00:00:45.640> not<00:00:45.820> much<00:00:48.120> is

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
tiny little bit it's often not much is

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.209 
tiny little bit it's often not much is
that<00:00:49.149> I<00:00:49.570> would<00:00:49.870> love<00:00:50.050> this<00:00:50.469> mirror<00:00:50.710> to<00:00:51.070> go

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
that I would love this mirror to go

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:53.400 
that I would love this mirror to go
around<00:00:51.460> like<00:00:51.760> that<00:00:51.969> that<00:00:52.960> would<00:00:53.109> be<00:00:53.199> just

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
around like that that would be just

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.029 
around like that that would be just
ideal<00:00:53.890> that's<00:00:54.550> my<00:00:54.760> goal<00:00:55.059> is<00:00:55.390> to<00:00:56.260> teach<00:00:56.500> her<00:00:56.769> how

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
ideal that's my goal is to teach her how

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.369 
ideal that's my goal is to teach her how
to<00:00:57.100> do<00:00:57.489> with<00:00:58.059> a<00:00:58.089> vintner<00:00:58.449> mouth<00:00:58.719> reaching<00:00:59.260> out

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
to do with a vintner mouth reaching out

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.459 
to do with a vintner mouth reaching out
over<00:00:59.800> the<00:00:59.890> top<00:01:00.129> line<00:01:00.399> like<00:01:00.640> that<00:01:01.289> what<00:01:02.289> do<00:01:02.350> we

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
over the top line like that what do we

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.530 
over the top line like that what do we
spent<00:01:02.769> like<00:01:02.949> five<00:01:03.160> minutes<00:01:03.519> in<00:01:03.789> fat<00:01:03.999> so

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:04.540 
spent like five minutes in fat so

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:07.260 
spent like five minutes in fat so
you<00:01:04.960> I<00:01:05.199> mean<00:01:05.560> this<00:01:05.920> is<00:01:06.100> like<00:01:06.130> live<00:01:06.610> TV<00:01:07.030> here

I'm going to go with the other stuff you
can<00:01:14.740> just<00:01:14.920> do<00:01:15.100> it<00:01:15.190> like<00:01:15.370> this<00:01:15.580> and<00:01:16.270> as<00:01:17.170> soon<00:01:17.350> as

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
can just do it like this and as soon as

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.940 
can just do it like this and as soon as
she<00:01:17.650> starts<00:01:18.040> to<00:01:18.190> get<00:01:18.370> it<00:01:18.520> again<00:01:19.710> even<00:01:20.710> if<00:01:20.800> she's

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
she starts to get it again even if she's

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.070 
she starts to get it again even if she's
backing<00:01:21.190> up<00:01:21.490> at<00:01:21.850> that<00:01:22.060> point<00:01:22.360> sure<00:01:22.570> yeah

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
backing up at that point sure yeah

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.620 
backing up at that point sure yeah
because<00:01:23.980> because<00:01:24.550> what's<00:01:24.790> happening<00:01:24.880> is<00:01:25.450> when

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
because because what's happening is when

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.030 
because because what's happening is when
you<00:01:25.720> put<00:01:25.900> on<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.140> pressure<00:01:26.350> they<00:01:26.710> start

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:27.040 
you put on the pressure they start

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.650 
you put on the pressure they start
backing<00:01:27.340> up<00:01:27.640> it's<00:01:27.910> like<00:01:28.090> they're<00:01:28.270> pushing

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:28.660 
backing up it's like they're pushing

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.180 
backing up it's like they're pushing
themselves<00:01:28.840> backwards<00:01:29.680> against<00:01:30.070> the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
themselves backwards against the

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.400 
themselves backwards against the
beckstead<00:01:30.670> of<00:01:30.790> giving<00:01:31.060> to<00:01:31.210> it<00:01:31.330> yeah<00:01:31.660> so<00:01:32.200> that's

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
beckstead of giving to it yeah so that's

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.950 
beckstead of giving to it yeah so that's
gonna<00:01:32.650> stop<00:01:33.010> you<00:01:33.070> cold<00:01:33.490> yeah<00:01:34.330> in<00:01:34.570> terms<00:01:34.750> of

gonna stop you cold yeah in terms of

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.720 
gonna stop you cold yeah in terms of
making<00:01:35.110> any<00:01:35.410> progress<00:01:35.680> if<00:01:36.250> she's<00:01:36.460> always

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
bracelet many horses always bracing

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.320 
bracelet many horses always bracing
against<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:39.100> business<00:01:39.430> basically<00:01:39.880> nothing

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:47.980 
the muscles and give to the bed so they

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.460 
the muscles and give to the bed so they
can<00:01:48.190> work<00:01:48.570> literally<00:01:49.570> within<00:01:49.870> their<00:01:50.200> body

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
can work literally within their body

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.120 
can work literally within their body
yeah<00:01:51.210> so<00:01:52.210> go<00:01:52.990> and<00:01:53.050> just<00:01:53.230> ask<00:01:53.440> her<00:01:53.650> again<00:01:53.770> to

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
yeah so go and just ask her again to

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:03.460 
yeah so go and just ask her again to
step<00:01:54.400> over<00:01:54.550> now

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.310 

okay<00:02:04.160> do<00:02:04.790> you<00:02:04.880> notice<00:02:05.060> that<00:02:05.180> last<00:02:05.630> step<00:02:05.990> before

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
okay do you notice that last step before

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.050 
okay do you notice that last step before
that<00:02:06.770> you've<00:02:06.980> done<00:02:07.160> like<00:02:07.340> this<00:02:07.580> and<00:02:07.850> then<00:02:07.970> the

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
that you've done like this and then the

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.359 
that you've done like this and then the
last<00:02:08.210> step<00:02:08.420> she<00:02:08.899> stepped<00:02:09.200> over<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:10.100> so<00:02:10.250> that's
