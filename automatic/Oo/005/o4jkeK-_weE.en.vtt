the cymbal pattern let's take a closer
look<00:00:29.140> also<00:00:30.069> take<00:00:30.220> note<00:00:30.249> of<00:00:30.460> the<00:00:30.639> location<00:00:31.119> of

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:31.179 
look also take note of the location of

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.569 
look also take note of the location of
the<00:00:31.239> intervals<00:00:31.720> in<00:00:31.929> the<00:00:32.469> future<00:00:32.829> knowing

00:00:33.569 --> 00:00:33.579 
the intervals in the future knowing

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.069 
the intervals in the future knowing
where<00:00:33.760> the<00:00:33.850> intervals<00:00:34.239> are<00:00:34.390> will<00:00:34.600> enable<00:00:34.750> you

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
where the intervals are will enable you

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:36.869 
where the intervals are will enable you
to<00:00:35.140> play<00:00:35.320> more<00:00:35.469> musically<00:00:35.949> by<00:00:36.519> knowing<00:00:36.730> where

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
to play more musically by knowing where
