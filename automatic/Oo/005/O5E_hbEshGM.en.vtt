bought these on eBay and you could get
the<00:00:17.869> this<00:00:18.439> set<00:00:18.680> for<00:00:19.539> minimum<00:00:20.539> I<00:00:20.779> would<00:00:21.199> say<00:00:21.350> $25

upwards<00:00:22.910> to<00:00:23.090> $40<00:00:24.189> but<00:00:25.189> the<00:00:25.340> reason<00:00:25.580> I<00:00:25.640> got<00:00:25.789> this

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
upwards to $40 but the reason I got this

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.480 
upwards to $40 but the reason I got this
this<00:00:26.689> said<00:00:26.900> instead<00:00:27.199> of<00:00:27.260> getting<00:00:27.619> them<00:00:27.769> you

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
this said instead of getting them you

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.429 
this said instead of getting them you
know<00:00:28.640> separate<00:00:29.119> because<00:00:29.779> you<00:00:29.990> can<00:00:30.230> buy<00:00:30.380> the

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
know separate because you can buy the

know separate because you can buy the
separate<00:00:30.830> sets<00:00:31.070> or<00:00:31.490> the<00:00:31.730> separate<00:00:32.120> you<00:00:32.270> know

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
in the tumbler by itself is because the

the tumbler that you get in the 150th
scale<00:00:39.290> package<00:00:39.550> doesn't<00:00:40.550> have<00:00:40.670> the<00:00:40.820> proper

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360

color on the on the wheels and it's

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.140

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
some reason as well it's still not a

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.970 
some reason as well it's still not a
movie<00:00:50.330> accurate<00:00:50.510> if<00:00:51.200> I<00:00:51.440> could<00:00:51.590> get<00:00:51.680> a<00:00:51.710> close-up

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
movie accurate if I could get a close-up

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
it's it's gold and in the movie it's

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.090 
it's it's gold and in the movie it's
supposed<00:00:54.620> to<00:00:54.680> be<00:00:54.830> gray<00:00:55.120> so<00:00:56.120> I<00:00:56.420> mean<00:00:56.810> once<00:00:57.770> again

diecast model is the back I like how the
thruster<00:01:34.790> looks<00:01:35.260> chromed<00:01:36.260> out<00:01:36.470> and<00:01:36.740> the

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
thruster looks chromed out and the

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.550 
thruster looks chromed out and the
wheels<00:01:37.790> look<00:01:38.000> pretty<00:01:38.240> nice<00:01:38.450> obviously<00:01:39.409> that

wheels look pretty nice obviously that

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.170 
wheels look pretty nice obviously that
but<00:01:39.920> that's<00:01:40.070> just<00:01:40.130> a<00:01:40.370> tumbler<00:01:40.640> that's<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.090> way

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
but that's just a tumbler that's the way

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.710 
but that's just a tumbler that's the way
should<00:01:41.390> be<00:01:41.510> on<00:01:41.600> every<00:01:41.810> tumbler<00:01:43.510> and<00:01:44.510> the

should be on every tumbler and the

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.640 
should be on every tumbler and the

or if you bought it in a single package
it's<00:01:51.110> that<00:01:51.440> it<00:01:52.370> doesn't<00:01:52.700> have<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:52.880> single

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
it's that it doesn't have the single

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.910 
it's that it doesn't have the single
packages<00:01:53.570> in<00:01:53.690> half<00:01:53.840> black<00:01:54.140> I<00:01:54.380> guess<00:01:54.620> this<00:01:54.770> was

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
packages in half black I guess this was

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.469 
packages in half black I guess this was
more<00:01:55.130> of<00:01:55.190> a<00:01:55.250> prototype<00:01:55.760> that's<00:01:56.180> why<00:01:56.299> I<00:01:56.330> was

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
more of a prototype that's why I was

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.719 
more of a prototype that's why I was
giving<00:01:56.750> out<00:01:56.840> and<00:01:57.080> in<00:01:57.560> Comicon<00:01:58.340> that's<00:01:58.610> what

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
giving out and in Comicon that's what

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.710 
giving out and in Comicon that's what
I'm<00:01:58.850> guessing<00:01:59.500> so<00:02:01.150> but<00:02:02.150> like<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:02.390> said<00:02:02.570> that's

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
I'm guessing so but like I said that's

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.200 
I'm guessing so but like I said that's
how<00:02:02.900> that's<00:02:03.500> how<00:02:03.620> I<00:02:03.680> got<00:02:03.890> this<00:02:04.040> 2-pack<00:02:04.670> let<00:02:05.150> me

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
how that's how I got this 2-pack let me

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.910 
how that's how I got this 2-pack let me
show<00:02:05.330> you<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.510> package<00:02:05.840> for<00:02:05.990> this<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.380> the

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
reason I have been showing the packages

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:09.850 
reason I have been showing the packages
in<00:02:08.300> my<00:02:08.569> other<00:02:08.899> reviews<00:02:09.229> is<00:02:09.380> because<00:02:09.679> I<00:02:09.709> already

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
in my other reviews is because I already

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.640 
in my other reviews is because I already
showed<00:02:10.190> what<00:02:10.819> all<00:02:11.000> the<00:02:11.540> 150th<00:02:11.990> scale<00:02:12.260> packages
