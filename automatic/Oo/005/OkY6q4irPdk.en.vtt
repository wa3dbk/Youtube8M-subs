when I run is to track everything

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.720 
when I run is to track everything
because<00:00:10.290> if<00:00:10.620> you<00:00:10.889> don't<00:00:11.099> track<00:00:11.340> your<00:00:11.460> speed<00:00:11.610> if

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.959 
you don't track your pace if you don't
track<00:00:13.769> your<00:00:13.950> route<00:00:14.160> then<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:14.519> makes<00:00:14.639> it<00:00:14.790> hard
