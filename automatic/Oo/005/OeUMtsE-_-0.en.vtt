00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.570
 the legend of goes is a legend 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.189
 belonging to the first generation in 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.080
 this is narrated the events that led 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.060
 to the creation of gose and as his 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.039
 behavior was perceived in the game 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.910
 In addition, details about its 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.910
 possible attack 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.309
 according to the coast theory initially it would be 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.320
 part of hunter's evolution this 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.809
 it would be evolution through level and 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.940
 it was through exchange however 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.620
 it was finally decided to program it as 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.500
 secondary form of any pokemon 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.449
 ghost hunter code is much resembles 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.000
 but more fat and buy are more 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.339
 small in the remakes resembles more 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.079
 castle and this may mean that your 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.079
 attacks would be of the ghost type 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.640
 has participated in a well-known legend 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.560
 like pokemon black version the legend 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.600
 revolves around him and his only attack is 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.009
 course that differentiates the attack of the 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.810
 second generation 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.299
 this attack can make a person disappear 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.399
 Pokemon besides this can kill 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.110
 trainers however the game 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.149
 ends with the character of goes 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.490
 becoming visible for the last time as 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.440
 rival and eliminating his own coach 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.570
 what shows a kind of rivalry 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.369
 with any coach like the 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.020
 ghosts do not trust anyone and as 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.020
 they do not have feelings either 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.369
 the difference between the games is that the 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.829
 first generation goes was one color 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.570
 dark violet with white eyes and 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.850
 a macabre smile that frightens the 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.159
 pokemon his two hands were always 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.530
 stuck to his body and it seemed to be a 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.329
 kind of solid ghost in the 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.729
 remakes happens to be a kind of cloud 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.009
 Lilac gas with yellow eyes te 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.560
 you die before and without showing limbs or 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.460
 something similar resembling to a large extent 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.460
 click 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.050
 playing with a goes is just as 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.030
 dangerous to play with my signs and 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.070
 Equally beneficial is the trick 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.440
 in entering a code in the pokemon 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.930
 blue English version to appear 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.550
 is my sign in the form of a coach this one 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.370
 may be attacked but will have a level 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.350
 very high yet still very powerful 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.100
 in the wild it will be very weak and 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.100
 difficult to catch 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.090
 they know mackerel gonal was a bit like 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.330
 a type of pure ice introduced in the 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.160
 fifth generation know and taquan is a 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.459
 fictional god invented by the writer 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.879
 american august erler associated with the myth 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.830
 from the good I say dragon to taqwa belong 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.840
 to two different universes but 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.420
 coincide in many data relating to their 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.069
 lifestyle is possible that at the time 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.160
 to design to create diagonal 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.410
 will inspire in ItaguÃ¡ born between 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.299
 clouds of snow and ice and capture their 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.510
 victims surrounding them with a chain of 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.560
 ice that is capable of generating 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.630
 physically it is usually a figure of 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.870
 ice but when it decreases its 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:16.840
 temperature goes to gaseous state now 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.269
 let's move on to how it manifests itself as 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.950
 a cloud of snow and ice and captures 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:23.349
 their victims wrapping them with a 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.319
 tissue composed of pure ice that he 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:29.410
 segrega can manifest itself as a 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.880
 monstrous hominid or in code but 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.250
 it is also that it happens to maintain a 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.360
 hazy appearance characterized by 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.430
 the bright eyes 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.440
 how can you notice its characteristics 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.540
 they are very similar but not only their 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.580
 features but also the way 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.010
 in which they represent this pokemon 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.840
 along with this god a very 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.310
 interesting especially on how it 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:53.230
 they based to create this pokemon 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.819
