00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
to the fact that they have switched to

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.619 
to the fact that they have switched to
the<00:00:57.289> old-style<00:00:57.620> spoiler<00:00:58.190> as<00:00:59.030> opposed<00:00:59.329> to<00:00:59.539> the

00:00:59.619 --> 00:00:59.629 
the old-style spoiler as opposed to the

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:01.779 
the old-style spoiler as opposed to the
wing<00:00:59.809> that<00:00:59.989> they<00:01:00.170> had<00:01:00.409> now<00:01:01.129> i<00:01:01.190> don't<00:01:01.429> see<00:01:01.699> the

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
wing that they had now i don't see the

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.180 
wing that they had now i don't see the
point<00:01:01.969> as<00:01:02.359> you<00:01:02.690> know<00:01:02.839> i<00:01:02.870> collect<00:01:03.530> largely<00:01:03.980> the

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
point as you know i collect largely the

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.610 
point as you know i collect largely the
older<00:01:04.460> shaped<00:01:04.699> cars<00:01:04.970> with<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.360> spoilers<00:01:05.810> so<00:01:06.590> i

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
older shaped cars with the spoilers so i

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.690 
older shaped cars with the spoilers so i
don't<00:01:06.890> think<00:01:07.040> there's<00:01:07.159> much<00:01:07.280> point<00:01:07.340> in<00:01:07.640> me

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
don't think there's much point in me

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.630 
don't think there's much point in me
getting<00:01:07.970> anymore<00:01:08.360> co<00:01:09.350> t<00:01:09.620> models<00:01:10.070> with<00:01:10.430> the
