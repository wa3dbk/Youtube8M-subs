and I want to show you closely and of
course<00:00:25.950> I<00:00:26.310> will<00:00:26.460> make<00:00:26.759> a<00:00:27.029> tutorial<00:00:27.270> about<00:00:27.750> this

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.310 
course I will make a tutorial about this
earring<00:00:28.200> but<00:00:29.130> I'm<00:00:29.610> thinking<00:00:30.210> that<00:00:30.809> it<00:00:31.020> will<00:00:31.169> be

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
earring but I'm thinking that it will be

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.610 
earring but I'm thinking that it will be
better<00:00:31.500> if<00:00:31.860> I<00:00:32.540> make<00:00:33.540> three<00:00:34.350> different

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
better if I make three different

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.270 
better if I make three different
tutorial<00:00:35.460> because<00:00:35.760> my<00:00:36.059> idea<00:00:36.539> is<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:38.010> make<00:00:38.129> it

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
tutorial because my idea is to make it

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.849 
tutorial because my idea is to make it
as<00:00:38.399> sorry<00:00:38.550> about<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.090> /<00:00:39.329> then<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.500> tutorial

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:40.859 
as sorry about the / then a tutorial

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.119 
as sorry about the / then a tutorial
about<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:42.260> component<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.589> middle<00:00:43.949> and

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
about this component in the middle and

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.720 
about this component in the middle and
then<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:45.230> further<00:00:46.230> tutorial<00:00:47.070> about<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.489> post

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
then a further tutorial about the post

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.410 
then a further tutorial about the post
earring<00:00:48.179> here<00:00:48.679> because<00:00:49.679> I<00:00:49.710> think<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.820> these

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
earring here because I think that these

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.410 
earring here because I think that these
three<00:00:51.899> components<00:00:52.699> can<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:53.820> used<00:00:53.999> separately

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
three components can be used separately

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.069 
three components can be used separately
and<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.289> if<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:56.010> want<00:00:56.390> you<00:00:57.390> can<00:00:57.629> choose

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and so if you want you can choose

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.729 
and so if you want you can choose
wherever<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:59.249> piece<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.850> need<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.749> create

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
wherever the piece you need to create

wherever the piece you need to create
your<00:01:01.769> bead<00:01:02.219> work<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.489> then<00:01:03.480> also<00:01:04.070> in<00:01:05.070> the
