00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.149
 all 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.040
 the bar invites the call of call 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.090
 duty goes through the years and travels in 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.219
 times with ease 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.510
 disconcerting modern station there are five 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.100
 years cold war for the first 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.480
 blackops the latter type being 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.440
 sufficiently inspired to be able to 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.359
 imagine a sequel 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.010
 his main argument the promise 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.150
 to combine past and future to tell 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.150
 the story of two generations 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.180
 we find alex mason veterans of 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.130
 first episode in some missions 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.260
 taking place in the late 80s but 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.390
 also and especially his son david who him 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.140
 evolves in 2025 within a new 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.000
 cold War 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.500
 empathy felt for the different 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.150
 protagonists is at the heart of a scenario 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.620
 putting more emphasis on the 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.940
 personal revenge that on the 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.010
 socio economic context 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.540
 achievement side pure detractors 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.339
 can argue once more that the 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.960
 engine has not changed for five years or 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.640
 still that the aesthetic bias of 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.949
 multiplayer maps evoke a futurism 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.150
 dated and flashy however tour de force 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.650
 renew some sequences 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.030
 still works perfectly and he 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.030
 remains difficult to cry scandal 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.600
 we do not change a formula that 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.250
 works treyarch does not seem to be 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.020
 entirely in agreement with this maxim 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.520
 of course the fundamentals remain the 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.470
 same but a wind of novelty seems 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.119
 finally blow out the possibilities of 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.829
 customizations to the envi are found 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.479
 tenfold and gadgets multiply 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.830
 innovations that affect the mode in 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.030
 line since you have access to 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.740
 new bonuses using its 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.939
 advanced technologies but also to 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.130
 weapons accessories and equipment 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:43.539
 futuristic tactics also note that 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:45.009
 now you have to perform 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.789
 score series to unlock the 10 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.049
 bonus 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:48.520
 concretely it means that the 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.380
 game system also rewards 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.369
 support players and goals and 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.840
 pushes to play as a team 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.520
 solo side the new missions 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.649
 strikeforce take the bet a bit 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.030
 risky but almost successful to incorporate 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.569
 an ounce of strategy in the countryside 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.009
 primary 

00:01:58.569 --> 00:02:01.750
 by proposing to manage 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.369
 skirmishes from above by keeping the 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.679
 possibility to embody any 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.119
 ground unit when you want it to 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.709
 final everything is done to maintain the 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.709
 player in breath from beginning to end 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.960
 yes yes you have heard this call 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.370
 of duty there is even the luxury of us 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.870
 offer a branching history and 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.360
 so many different purposes 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.070
 as always the senses the flavor lies 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.660
 in multiplayer modes the mode 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.430
 zombie has also grown and 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.140
 now proposes an open world that 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.700
 you can cross new buses 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.440
 wacky weapons and bonuses and the 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.570
 ability to create objects with 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.950
 spare parts but the competition the 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.540
 true it is on the network that then 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.460
 place and everything was done to make it 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.020
 hard total redesign of classes for 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.180
 more farm sharing options 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.470
 internet via a direct stream realization 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.600
 videos and live commentary 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.160
 thanks to the casting codes the platform 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.470
 free elite community 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.120
 we pass black ops 2 will remain without 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.580
 doubt the call of duty that will have known 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.730
 shake up the status quo and do it with 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.730
 brio 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.790
