CES unveil 2015 checking out a new
activity<00:00:13.740> tracker<00:00:14.160> this<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.820> activity<00:00:15.210> by

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
activity tracker this is the activity by

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.170 
activity tracker this is the activity by
we<00:00:16.440> things<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.490> actually<00:00:17.820> out

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
we things so this is actually out

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.439 
we things so this is actually out
tomorrow<00:00:18.810> it's<00:00:19.529> going<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.740> be<00:00:19.890> 150<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.270> the

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
tomorrow it's going to be 150 and so the

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.200 
tomorrow it's going to be 150 and so the
difference<00:00:21.779> between<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.260> one<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:23.210> one

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
difference between this one and the one

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.120 
difference between this one and the one
that<00:00:24.390> we<00:00:24.480> thinks<00:00:24.750> had<00:00:24.900> out<00:00:25.050> previously<00:00:25.560> this

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
that we thinks had out previously this

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.800 
that we thinks had out previously this
one<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.430> not<00:00:26.580> swiss<00:00:26.939> made<00:00:27.210> with<00:00:27.420> sapphire

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
one is not swiss made with sapphire

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.779 
one is not swiss made with sapphire
glass<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.470> clearly<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:29.039> more<00:00:29.460> budget

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
glass it is clearly a more budget

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.279 
glass it is clearly a more budget

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
watch you can see that it tells the time

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.670 
watch you can see that it tells the time
and<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.090> here<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:36.660> actually<00:00:36.899> what

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680

so i wish that it sometimes would turn

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.290 
so i wish that it sometimes would turn
it<00:00:58.440> off<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:59.070> taking<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.670> look<00:00:59.820> at<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.030> device

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
watch right got a really nice silicon

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.550 
watch right got a really nice silicon
band<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:06.990> then<00:01:07.080> we're<00:01:07.170> going<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.380> take<00:01:07.439> a

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
band and then we're going to take a

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.350 
band and then we're going to take a
quick<00:01:07.680> look<00:01:07.890> at<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.280> app<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.240> air

quick look at the app so this is the air

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.330 
quick look at the app so this is the air
quality<00:01:09.750> for<00:01:10.020> say<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.619> way<00:01:10.799> things<00:01:10.860> at<00:01:11.189> home

because these guys have a whole
comprehensive<00:01:13.409> package<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.840> connected

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
comprehensive package of connected

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.450 
comprehensive package of connected
devices<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.799> just<00:01:17.009> one<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
devices this is just one of the

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.310 
devices this is just one of the
activities<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.630> if<00:01:18.780> we<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:19.049> had<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.170> number

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
activities so if we just had a number

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.020 
activities so if we just had a number

even show you your fat mass and
am<00:01:28.210> I<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:28.690> how<00:01:29.080> you're<00:01:29.260> tracking<00:01:29.500> over<00:01:29.920> time

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
am I and how you're tracking over time

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:32.219 
am I and how you're tracking over time
so<00:01:30.400> it's<00:01:30.549> attempting<00:01:31.000> to<00:01:31.119> take<00:01:31.330> all<00:01:31.659> the<00:01:31.990> data

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
so it's attempting to take all the data

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.859 
so it's attempting to take all the data
that<00:01:32.530> you're<00:01:32.710> using<00:01:33.070> with<00:01:34.060> like<00:01:34.330> all<00:01:34.540> the<00:01:34.659> dumb

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
data that's actually being collected it

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.890 
data that's actually being collected it
with<00:01:36.580> these<00:01:36.670> actually<00:01:37.090> with<00:01:37.330> a<00:01:37.420> activity

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
with these actually with a activity

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.200 
with these actually with a activity
trackers<00:01:38.530> and<00:01:38.650> making<00:01:39.549> it<00:01:39.610> a<00:01:39.729> little<00:01:39.880> more
