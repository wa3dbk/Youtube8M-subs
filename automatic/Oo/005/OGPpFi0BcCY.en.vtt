00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.849
 hey people are back today we do 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.830
 a mega delicious listless 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.080
 Pastor has is that you can 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.279
 wonderful to eat noodles yes and if he 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.980
 Let's see how I like the meal 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.689
 simply prepared so that it - 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.250
 starting with a preheated 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:35.190
 oven 180 degrees a baking tray and 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:37.950
 must know 200 grams hashish 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.140
 every 200 grams we go here already 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.850
 on it all distribute a bit 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.809
 that not all lie to each other and 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.840
 then they stayed in the oven now 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:53.460
 roast the once ten minutes at 180 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.680
 At the moment we have something for you 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.809
 become dark as you see but that 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.620
 Never mind are nicely done one 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.690
 the whole apartment only smells like many 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:08.250
 have to eat delicious turf 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.350
 and I have now and then pulling the 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.330
 Actually it's the laundry but it 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:17.750
 is still enough here and it is even dirtier 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:28.290
 to make because the guests in media 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:36.720
 franken also from the bread baking like that 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:40.980
 and now that I'm the beautiful one 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.930
 have lawn bowl from the peels and 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:48.650
 which will then try the whole 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:53.700
 be careful the bunnies partly solved 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:56.070
 do not burn yourself we still have one 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.820
 few times more pure but the nostrils 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.290
 you see here 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.740
 they are getting really shiny and the shell 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.900
 collects here yes and that stops 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.000
 Most of them are so dirty 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.890
 become relatively blank like this one 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.209
 some are still a little bit more 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.290
 I just do not have you complete 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.650
 get asked then it's just me 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.959
 equal to bitter note change or is 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.900
 just out and I'll give it here now 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:24.540
 in such a coffee grinder lightning hacker like 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.080
 always in it mostly my spices 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.220
 certainly can mix is out of my 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.640
 spice mixture videos or from a 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.480
 Grill videos actually wonderful 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.010
 the things are chopping to lightning 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.290
 turf had to do media and that 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:48.230
 Let's go on this whole mail now 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:51.140
 we will give it once in a pot 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:55.980
 next we will take here 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:58.440
 green and clear this time water one 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.420
 abatement in water broth in the 400th 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:10.250
 gram touched and quite normal 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:13.440
 vegetable broth and that will be one time 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.810
 boiled up and the next one is next to me 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.459
 Knobloch and I have three weeks 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.320
 this is a huge ballermann like you 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.890
 see here and the others are something 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.500
 smaller 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.830
 you take three to four cloves of garlic 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.239
 depending on the size you see yes 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:30.209
 and they will peel now 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:34.610
 and then we will slice them 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:36.100
 cut this part the same 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.670
 easy 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:45.520
 cut into thin slices because 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:48.590
 We will cook the same broth 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.150
 is still cooking properly what are we doing 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:58.670
 Now we are only going to a knob hole here 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:04:00.620
 just say it again and then tear it up 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.780
 the two toast seem that is in 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.140
 my case can wholemeal toast all 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.630
 every tourstart will take them in pieces 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:14.120
 you saw it like here 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:18.799
 duck feeding now we're leaving and 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:22.130
 Syrup is always my one 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:26.990
 Touran syrup type C darken so much 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:31.340
 caramel I mega delicious that comes to me 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.670
 stop by once and then go 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:39.280
 we still have this damn nice one 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:41.630
 golden brown hazelnut fit more 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.680
 and I tell you the whole kitchen is 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.100
 After that, legally it's all over now 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.210
 stir and get it right 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.430
 women snake me you see this 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.680
 but that must be so 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.830
 I 'm looking forward to it 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.270
 great to pasta so then we go 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.630
 a few spices to it or 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:05.720
 a really good spice and indeed take 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.070
 we do not care if it's mine 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.130
 favorite supplier bremer 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:12.970
 spice trade oregano gets her victim 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:17.270
 in the Amazon shop on the homepage or 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:22.600
 ordered directly from the spice trade and 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:25.250
 from the oregano we take a nice one 

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:28.060
 heaped teaspoon artificially on three 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:31.400
 stretch fresh americans take 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.560
 but the way is not here I have 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.710
 shadow balcony and a kitchen now 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.860
 First, get back in business 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:43.280
 let it boil up and then 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:45.260
 simmer for about 15 to 18 minutes 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.900
 everything is on a low flame 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.199
 a little bit less 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:57.410
 So , let's see you maybe 

00:05:51.199 --> 00:06:00.620
 so now that cooked that 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:06.560
 looks a bit like sloppy 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:08.090
 but the main taste is there are others 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.520
 the level of the art was very good 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:15.139
 little now is not such problems 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:18.410
 just everything here so we have it 

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:19.240
 Tried tastes really right 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.280
 orderly 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:27.830
 tastes very bad really good but 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:32.180
 we still need seasoning salt to a 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:34.250
 a little bit more pepper and then another 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:38.150
 a bit to give a whole step 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:42.949
 a little bit of chili and I'll take it 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:45.620
 just then chili powder therefore here 

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:48.080
 stir in once and see 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:53.500
 already skin on top of that forms that is whole 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:07:02.889
 normal and now we add olive oil 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:07:05.419
 and four tablespoons resp 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:08.750
 eight tablespoons feel but with the 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:13.099
 the recipe was made so once 

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:15.979
 could introduce into the country also under 

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:18.260
 Girls start Mixa is only one 

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:22.099
 plane now too and then are 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:25.099
 we already finished and the water already 

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:28.340
 Worth seeing this pesto nut sauce what 

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:29.870
 whatever it is, it is really wonderful 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.880
 just to do it yourself you can do one 

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:33.380
 is peace as reforms in the refrigerator 

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.000
 about two three weeks though 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.970
 freeze had longer what of it 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.409
