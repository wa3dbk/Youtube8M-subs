and a zoom was where something is

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.360 
and a zoom was where something is
optically<00:00:49.900> magnified<00:00:50.710> but<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:51.040> camera

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:55.799 
doesn't move closer to it but one of the
most<00:00:54.159> effective<00:00:54.790> camera<00:00:55.239> movements<00:00:55.690> is<00:00:55.780> a

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:55.809 
most effective camera movements is a

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.990 
most effective camera movements is a
dolly<00:00:56.199> in<00:00:56.500> which<00:00:56.949> the<00:00:57.129> camera<00:00:57.339> physically

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
dolly in which the camera physically

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.090 
dolly in which the camera physically
moves<00:00:58.269> through<00:00:58.659> space<00:00:59.019> towards<00:00:59.559> the<00:00:59.680> object

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100 
moves through space towards the object

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.399 
moves through space towards the object
or<00:01:00.250> away<00:01:00.580> from<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:01.000> object<00:01:01.269> or<00:01:01.570> along<00:01:02.170> the

or away from the object or along the

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:04.229 
or away from the object or along the
side<00:01:02.710> of<00:01:02.739> the<00:01:02.979> object<00:01:03.190> and<00:01:03.610> it<00:01:03.879> gives<00:01:04.059> the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
side of the object and it gives the

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.120 
side of the object and it gives the
camera<00:01:04.420> a<00:01:04.629> real<00:01:04.809> sense<00:01:05.080> of<00:01:05.170> being<00:01:05.229> involved<00:01:05.740> in

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
camera a real sense of being involved in

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.730 
camera a real sense of being involved in
the<00:01:06.250> scene<00:01:06.490> if<00:01:06.760> you<00:01:07.510> stand<00:01:07.960> back<00:01:08.140> from<00:01:08.350> a<00:01:08.500> scene

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
the scene if you stand back from a scene

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.070 
the scene if you stand back from a scene
and<00:01:08.920> you<00:01:08.979> simply<00:01:09.220> use<00:01:09.520> static<00:01:09.909> setups<00:01:10.420> and<00:01:10.570> cut

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
and you simply use static setups and cut

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.170 
and you simply use static setups and cut
a<00:01:11.110> lot<00:01:11.439> around<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:11.950> shot<00:01:12.250> you're<00:01:12.850> not<00:01:12.880> going

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
a lot around the shot you're not going

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.310 
a lot around the shot you're not going
to<00:01:13.240> get<00:01:13.360> the<00:01:13.450> same<00:01:13.660> sense<00:01:13.900> of<00:01:14.020> involvement

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
to get the same sense of involvement

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.070 
to get the same sense of involvement
that<00:01:14.710> you<00:01:14.950> do<00:01:15.130> if<00:01:15.790> you<00:01:15.970> use<00:01:16.210> a<00:01:16.240> dolly<00:01:16.630> to<00:01:16.870> really

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
that you do if you use a dolly to really

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.230 
that you do if you use a dolly to really
bring<00:01:17.290> the<00:01:17.410> viewer<00:01:17.650> into<00:01:18.550> the<00:01:18.790> scene<00:01:19.030> and

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
bring the viewer into the scene and

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.760 
bring the viewer into the scene and
that's<00:01:19.300> what<00:01:19.540> a<00:01:19.570> dolly<00:01:19.810> really<00:01:20.170> does<00:01:20.380> or<00:01:20.560> take

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
that's what a dolly really does or take

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.960 
that's what a dolly really does or take
them<00:01:20.920> out<00:01:21.130> of<00:01:21.160> a<00:01:21.550> scene

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:21.970 
them out of a scene

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:23.820 
them out of a scene
there's<00:01:22.330> also<00:01:22.510> crane<00:01:22.960> shots<00:01:23.320> where<00:01:23.590> you<00:01:23.620> take

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
there's also crane shots where you take

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.170 
there's also crane shots where you take
the<00:01:23.860> camera<00:01:24.010> and<00:01:24.430> mount<00:01:24.490> it<00:01:24.700> in<00:01:24.790> a<00:01:24.880> cherry
