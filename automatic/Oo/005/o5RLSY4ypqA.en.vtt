00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.519
 112 today we are going to explain to you about 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.019
 I'm driving because I'm driving 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.660
 good 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:17.480
 we will play slowly and carefully we 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.480
 let's go to the app trivia 2 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.289
 inside trivia 2 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.199
 and you will see what 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:28.810
 you can good first there is a 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:32.029
 previous registration very simple and once 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:35.780
 that you register because you do not have the link 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:39.559
 facebook mines of tucano because he taught 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:43.399
 Now that it's my turn, we're talking 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:48.339
 internet and good time then we will 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.339
 to cool we refresh in the second 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.920
 from here you can start a game 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.690
 new with someone you know the leader 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.610
 for example this game that I have 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.370
 open with vinyl 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.949
 up here on the left I am where 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.260
 Put your green and the daisies that 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.540
 I have here they are as I want to call 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.280
 and by colors each colony you know that 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.360
 after one 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.520
 well one 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.909
 a different subject no 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.950
 then down here you have the statistics 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.990
 both mine in responses to 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.119
 finished like those of my opponent in 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.920
 this case came that pretty much 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.049
 we are on par but I am having 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.030
 more luck in terms of getting the 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.930
 key questions that are those of the 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.200
 leaves 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.870
 now and face to which he throws me we go to 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.450
 behind 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:43.920
 let's see and tell me that I have to play 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.790
 in the smooth game then I go and the 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.880
 dices 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.810
 I give it to him and he tells me to choose a question 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.790
 for example history throw again we 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.100
 let's throw again 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.710
 that takes away points, I think it has not 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:03.220
 got a daisy aunt 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:06.550
 colom although he guessed right a question is worth 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.310
 come on let's ask us about everything 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.160
 I do not believe you do not suck me the finger 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.040
 the question is right why we have 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.830
 to throw star and science we're going to 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.840
 the star called daisy said I 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.210
 which graphic adventure handles more manual 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.550
 skull harvester of souls winner of 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.880
 packages before the end of the this 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:30.280
 filter well I was not successful was great 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.970
 fandango with which I do not take the 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.130
 star the daisy and now throw the 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.460
 miss and come out that simple and 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.350
 easy 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.440
 Well, here we will have the games 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:45.620
 pending to play and if we want to open 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.650
 one in the green zone we open an exit 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.600
 I know we know of some friend or 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.180
 we can also play randomly with 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.520
 the people that have the network 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.310
 Well, that's all 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.870
