here<00:02:34.680> ambrosini<00:02:35.250> maybe<00:02:35.490> I<00:02:35.580> think<00:02:35.819> that's<00:02:36.000> who

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
here ambrosini maybe I think that's who

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.600 
here ambrosini maybe I think that's who
it<00:02:36.240> was<00:02:36.420> but<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.500> know<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.739> players<00:02:38.370> have

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
it was but you know the players have

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.330 
it was but you know the players have
been<00:02:38.760> pretty<00:02:39.420> low<00:02:39.720> priced<00:02:40.140> here<00:02:40.440> ambrosini<00:02:41.220> in

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
been pretty low priced here ambrosini in

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.699 
been pretty low priced here ambrosini in
a<00:02:41.430> 3412<00:02:42.000> not<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.480> best<00:02:42.630> formation<00:02:43.140> but

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
a 3412 not the best formation but

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.340 
a 3412 not the best formation but
definitely<00:02:44.310> be<00:02:44.400> keeping<00:02:44.550> him<00:02:44.959> who<00:02:45.959> else<00:02:46.170> do<00:02:46.290> we

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
definitely be keeping him who else do we

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.880 
definitely be keeping him who else do we
got<00:02:46.440> here<00:02:47.000> not<00:02:48.000> nothing<00:02:48.660> else<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.290> special

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
got here not nothing else to special

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.070 
got here not nothing else to special
here<00:02:50.250> doesn't<00:02:51.030> look<00:02:51.120> like<00:02:51.270> anybody<00:02:51.690> amazing

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
here doesn't look like anybody amazing

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.020 
here doesn't look like anybody amazing
but<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.190> problem<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.580> is<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:53.730> I'm<00:02:53.910> gonna

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
but the problem is is that I'm gonna

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.520 
but the problem is is that I'm gonna
have<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.239> discard<00:02:54.570> some<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.840> these<00:02:54.900> contracts

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
have to discard some of these contracts

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.340 
have to discard some of these contracts
because<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:55.860> don't<00:02:56.070> really<00:02:56.130> have<00:02:56.459> any<00:02:56.610> space<00:02:56.970> in

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
because I don't really have any space in

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.820 
because I don't really have any space in
player<00:02:58.350> 443<00:02:59.160> that<00:02:59.430> is<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.610> good<00:02:59.910> pick<00:03:00.120> up<00:03:00.150> there

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
player 443 that is a good pick up there

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.000 
player 443 that is a good pick up there
put<00:03:01.830> that<00:03:01.950> in<00:03:02.130> my<00:03:02.220> trade<00:03:02.550> pile<00:03:03.410> but<00:03:04.410> as<00:03:04.860> you

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.150 
guys probably know I did just head to
