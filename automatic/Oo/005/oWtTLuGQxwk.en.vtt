00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.969 
either vertically or horizontally which
is<00:01:45.280> super<00:01:45.610> nice<00:01:45.930> it's<00:01:46.930> really<00:01:47.350> easy<00:01:47.530> to<00:01:47.829> do

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
is super nice it's really easy to do

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.280 
is super nice it's really easy to do
disassemble<00:01:48.970> the<00:01:49.060> light<00:01:49.270> making<00:01:49.570> sure<00:01:49.930> to<00:01:50.140> pay

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
disassemble the light making sure to pay

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.200 
disassemble the light making sure to pay
attention<00:01:50.530> so<00:01:50.920> you<00:01:51.280> know<00:01:51.490> how<00:01:51.700> to<00:01:51.759> put<00:01:51.970> it<00:01:52.090> all

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
attention so you know how to put it all

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.749 
attention so you know how to put it all
back<00:01:52.360> together<00:01:52.570> then<00:01:53.439> measure<00:01:54.040> a<00:01:54.189> mark<00:01:54.520> where

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
back together then measure a mark where

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.460 
back together then measure a mark where
you'll<00:01:54.939> drill<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.360> holes<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.900> put<00:01:56.049> the<00:01:56.170> bolts

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
you'll drill the holes to put the bolts

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.319 
you'll drill the holes to put the bolts
through<00:01:56.649> I<00:01:56.890> put<00:01:57.430> mine<00:01:57.640> right<00:01:57.670> in<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.060> middle

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
through I put mine right in the middle

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.149 
through I put mine right in the middle
because<00:01:58.509> that<00:01:59.020> just<00:01:59.229> made<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.500> most<00:01:59.619> sense<00:01:59.860> to

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
because that just made the most sense to

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.039 
because that just made the most sense to
me<00:02:00.310> put<00:02:00.970> your<00:02:01.090> bolts<00:02:01.420> through<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.630> conduit

drilled<00:02:04.180> the<00:02:04.750> conduit<00:02:05.110> hangers<00:02:05.530> should<00:02:05.950> be<00:02:06.340> on

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
drilled the conduit hangers should be on

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.639 
drilled the conduit hangers should be on

can see it mounts easily vertically and

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.220 
can see it mounts easily vertically and
horizontally<00:02:44.569> to<00:02:45.569> keep<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:45.840> from<00:02:45.989> swinging

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
horizontally to keep it from swinging

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.620 
horizontally to keep it from swinging
around<00:02:46.470> I<00:02:46.800> use<00:02:47.010> cheap<00:02:47.550> clamps<00:02:47.970> that<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.209> just

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
around I use cheap clamps that I just

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.780 
around I use cheap clamps that I just
always<00:02:48.810> have<00:02:49.080> on<00:02:49.230> hand<00:02:49.260> this<00:02:49.950> lets<00:02:50.250> me<00:02:50.400> rotate

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
always have on hand this lets me rotate

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.640 
always have on hand this lets me rotate
the<00:02:50.940> light<00:02:51.120> with<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.450> clamp<00:02:51.690> really<00:02:52.290> easily

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
the light with the clamp really easily

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.650 
the light with the clamp really easily
one<00:02:53.400> thing<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.700> note<00:02:53.880> is<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.330> should

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
one thing to note is that you should

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.840 
one thing to note is that you should
make<00:02:54.690> sure<00:02:54.900> your<00:02:55.350> PVC<00:02:55.920> will<00:02:56.100> actually<00:02:56.519> fit

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
make sure your PVC will actually fit

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.430 
make sure your PVC will actually fit
over<00:02:57.180> your<00:02:57.209> light<00:02:57.480> stand<00:02:57.810> before<00:02:57.989> you<00:02:58.290> go

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
over your light stand before you go

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.410 
over your light stand before you go
building<00:02:58.830> this<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.220> don't<00:02:59.640> overdo<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.120> on<00:03:00.300> the

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
building this and don't overdo it on the

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.290 
building this and don't overdo it on the
PVC<00:03:00.720> glue<00:03:01.080> if<00:03:01.410> you<00:03:02.280> do<00:03:02.519> have<00:03:02.730> too<00:03:02.910> much<00:03:03.060> glue

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
PVC glue if you do have too much glue

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.180 
PVC glue if you do have too much glue
you<00:03:03.510> may<00:03:03.690> need<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.170> scrape<00:03:04.440> some<00:03:04.500> away<00:03:04.980> in

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
you may need to scrape some away in

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.340 
you may need to scrape some away in
order<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.519> get<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.940> stamp<00:03:06.209> to<00:03:06.569> fit<00:03:06.810> inside<00:03:07.080> the

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
order to get the stamp to fit inside the

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.750 
order to get the stamp to fit inside the
PVC<00:03:08.269> okay<00:03:09.269> so<00:03:09.330> here's<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.840> real<00:03:10.140> issue<00:03:10.760> with

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
PVC okay so here's the real issue with

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.640 
PVC okay so here's the real issue with
using<00:03:12.150> fluorescent<00:03:12.720> lights<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:13.290> should<00:03:13.530> be

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
using fluorescent lights you should be

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.740 
using fluorescent lights you should be
able<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.890> see<00:03:14.069> like<00:03:14.250> these<00:03:14.459> bars<00:03:14.819> either<00:03:15.330> going

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
able to see like these bars either going

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.150 
able to see like these bars either going
up<00:03:16.080> or<00:03:16.350> down<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.530> think<00:03:16.709> they're<00:03:17.010> probably

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
up or down I think they're probably

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.460 
up or down I think they're probably
going<00:03:17.610> up<00:03:17.940> about<00:03:18.269> like<00:03:18.510> this<00:03:18.750> right<00:03:19.049> now

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
going up about like this right now

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.280 
going up about like this right now
and<00:03:20.150> that<00:03:21.150> has<00:03:21.329> to<00:03:21.360> do<00:03:21.480> with<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.750> frame<00:03:22.019> rate

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
and that has to do with the frame rate

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.650 
and that has to do with the frame rate
so<00:03:22.590> what<00:03:22.950> you've<00:03:23.670> got<00:03:23.850> to<00:03:23.940> be<00:03:24.000> really<00:03:24.420> careful

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
so what you've got to be really careful

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.900 
so what you've got to be really careful
with<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.769> frame<00:03:26.010> rate<00:03:26.220> with<00:03:26.400> these<00:03:26.549> because

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
with the frame rate with these because

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.210 
with the frame rate with these because
otherwise<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:27.959> looked<00:03:28.200> super<00:03:28.440> nasty<00:03:28.980> it's

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
otherwise it looked super nasty it's

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.610 
otherwise it looked super nasty it's
pretty<00:03:29.400> much<00:03:29.579> unusable<00:03:29.820> unless<00:03:30.510> like<00:03:30.840> for

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
pretty much unusable unless like for

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:32.990 
pretty much unusable unless like for
whatever<00:03:31.799> reason<00:03:32.280> this<00:03:32.370> is<00:03:32.579> the<00:03:32.670> look<00:03:32.850> you're

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
whatever reason this is the look you're

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.640 
whatever reason this is the look you're
going<00:03:33.180> for<00:03:33.299> so<00:03:33.989> I'm<00:03:34.049> going<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.230> go<00:03:34.350> ahead<00:03:34.410> and

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
going for so I'm going to go ahead and

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.800 
going for so I'm going to go ahead and
change<00:03:35.010> my<00:03:35.810> shutter<00:03:36.810> speed<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.560> it<00:03:37.890> should

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
change my shutter speed and it should

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:46.250 
change my shutter speed and it should
change<00:03:39.810> those<00:03:40.170> lines<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.890> tell<00:03:43.040> so<00:03:44.120> at<00:03:45.120> 125<00:03:45.959> it

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
change those lines and tell so at 125 it

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.690 
change those lines and tell so at 125 it
looks<00:03:46.680> pretty<00:03:46.950> good<00:03:47.100> at<00:03:47.280> 125<00:03:47.910> like<00:03:48.269> I<00:03:49.250> can<00:03:50.250> move

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
looks pretty good at 125 like I can move

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.250 
looks pretty good at 125 like I can move
around<00:03:50.910> and<00:03:51.329> stuff<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.810> I<00:03:51.870> don't<00:03:51.900> get<00:03:52.200> that

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
around and stuff and I don't get that

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.220 
around and stuff and I don't get that
weird<00:03:52.590> flicker<00:03:52.920> um<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:54.150> then<00:03:54.420> if<00:03:54.660> I<00:03:54.840> keep

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
weird flicker um and then if I keep

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.970 
weird flicker um and then if I keep
adjusting<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:57.150> get<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:58.019> much<00:03:58.579> brighter<00:04:00.140> on<00:04:01.140> my

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
adjusting and get it much brighter on my

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:09.229 
adjusting and get it much brighter on my
F<00:04:02.640> 6.3<00:04:03.570> right<00:04:03.870> now<00:04:04.079> and<00:04:05.150> ISO<00:04:06.320> 1000<00:04:07.320> so<00:04:08.239> anyway

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
F 6.3 right now and ISO 1000 so anyway

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.860 
F 6.3 right now and ISO 1000 so anyway
um<00:04:09.890> well<00:04:10.890> yeah<00:04:11.070> so<00:04:11.340> if<00:04:11.760> you<00:04:12.150> just<00:04:12.329> know<00:04:12.630> that

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
um well yeah so if you just know that

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.319 
um well yeah so if you just know that
that's<00:04:13.019> a<00:04:13.170> limitation<00:04:13.799> of<00:04:13.890> this<00:04:14.070> is<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:14.579> you

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
that's a limitation of this is that you

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:20.930 
that's a limitation of this is that you
can<00:04:15.540> get<00:04:15.720> those<00:04:15.930> weird<00:04:17.209> banding<00:04:18.209> things<00:04:19.940> just

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
can get those weird banding things just

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.550 
can get those weird banding things just
know<00:04:21.090> that<00:04:21.269> that's<00:04:21.390> a<00:04:21.660> limitation<00:04:22.289> and<00:04:22.409> then

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
know that that's a limitation and then

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.140 
know that that's a limitation and then
you<00:04:22.710> should<00:04:22.919> be<00:04:23.039> able<00:04:23.159> to<00:04:23.310> overcome<00:04:23.700> that<00:04:23.909> and

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
you should be able to overcome that and

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.290 
you should be able to overcome that and
just<00:04:24.450> be

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
just be

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.999 
just be
extra<00:04:25.509> cautious<00:04:25.960> when<00:04:26.409> it<00:04:26.440> comes<00:04:26.710> to<00:04:26.830> that

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:27.009 
extra cautious when it comes to that

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:29.399 
extra cautious when it comes to that
here<00:04:27.909> you<00:04:28.060> can<00:04:28.240> see<00:04:28.389> the<00:04:28.509> completed<00:04:28.900> lights<00:04:29.229> on

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.409 
here you can see the completed lights on

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:31.379 
here you can see the completed lights on
the<00:04:29.530> stands<00:04:29.949> the<00:04:30.099> idea<00:04:30.400> is<00:04:30.490> that<00:04:30.699> you<00:04:30.849> get<00:04:31.030> soft

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
the stands the idea is that you get soft

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:33.180 
the stands the idea is that you get soft
even<00:04:31.690> light<00:04:31.990> over<00:04:32.289> a<00:04:32.319> large<00:04:32.530> area<00:04:32.800> that's

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
even light over a large area that's

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.740 
even light over a large area that's
cheap<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:33.759> doesn't<00:04:34.090> heat<00:04:34.240> everything<00:04:34.479> up

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
cheap and doesn't heat everything up

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.719 
cheap and doesn't heat everything up
this<00:04:35.409> can<00:04:35.590> be<00:04:35.680> nice<00:04:35.860> for<00:04:36.039> green-screen<00:04:36.520> as

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
this can be nice for green-screen as

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.309 
this can be nice for green-screen as
I'll<00:04:36.909> show<00:04:36.940> you<00:04:37.090> in<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.360> few<00:04:37.539> seconds<00:04:37.900> you<00:04:38.289> can

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:38.319 
I'll show you in a few seconds you can

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:40.649 
I'll show you in a few seconds you can
also<00:04:38.590> use<00:04:38.889> them<00:04:39.129> for<00:04:39.430> some<00:04:39.940> interesting<00:04:40.270> catch

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:40.659 
also use them for some interesting catch

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:42.570 
also use them for some interesting catch
lights<00:04:40.960> in<00:04:41.169> the<00:04:41.229> eyes<00:04:41.409> or<00:04:41.740> for<00:04:42.310> adding

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
lights in the eyes or for adding

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.610 
lights in the eyes or for adding
reflections<00:04:43.120> along<00:04:43.419> the<00:04:43.539> body<00:04:43.690> of<00:04:43.900> cars<00:04:44.199> or

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
reflections along the body of cars or

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.580 
reflections along the body of cars or
bottles<00:04:45.159> or<00:04:45.430> other<00:04:45.460> reflective<00:04:46.210> surfaces<00:04:46.720> the

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
bottles or other reflective surfaces the

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.040 
bottles or other reflective surfaces the
t12<00:04:48.069> ballasts<00:04:48.550> are<00:04:48.759> the<00:04:49.030> biggest<00:04:49.389> problem<00:04:49.810> for

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
t12 ballasts are the biggest problem for

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.379 
t12 ballasts are the biggest problem for
the<00:04:50.139> flickering<00:04:50.530> banding<00:04:51.069> issue<00:04:51.250> but<00:04:52.030> you<00:04:52.210> can

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
the flickering banding issue but you can

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.080 
the flickering banding issue but you can
go<00:04:52.509> with<00:04:52.659> TA<00:04:52.870> or<00:04:53.139> t5<00:04:53.650> shop<00:04:54.009> lights<00:04:54.280> and<00:04:54.490> I<00:04:54.849> think

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
go with TA or t5 shop lights and I think

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.850 
go with TA or t5 shop lights and I think
you'll<00:04:55.240> have<00:04:55.360> better<00:04:55.539> results<00:04:56.110> this<00:04:56.530> next

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
you'll have better results this next

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.170 
you'll have better results this next
shot<00:04:56.979> is<00:04:57.039> the<00:04:57.250> same<00:04:57.460> shot<00:04:57.669> I've<00:04:57.819> been<00:04:57.849> using

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
shot is the same shot I've been using

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.580 
shot is the same shot I've been using
throughout<00:04:58.449> the<00:04:58.659> whole<00:04:58.810> video<00:04:58.930> but<00:04:59.349> I've

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
throughout the whole video but I've

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.709 
throughout the whole video but I've
keyed<00:04:59.919> out<00:04:59.949> the<00:05:00.250> background<00:05:00.699> so<00:05:00.969> it's<00:05:01.240> just

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:01.719 
keyed out the background so it's just

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:05.040 
keyed out the background so it's just
using<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.139> two<00:05:02.770> lights<00:05:03.009> and<00:05:03.280> that<00:05:03.430> is<00:05:03.669> it<00:05:04.050> if

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
using the two lights and that is it if

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.050 
using the two lights and that is it if
you<00:05:05.259> use<00:05:05.620> the<00:05:05.919> lights<00:05:06.159> to<00:05:06.460> just<00:05:06.729> light<00:05:06.909> the

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
you use the lights to just light the

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.159 
you use the lights to just light the
green<00:05:07.240> screen<00:05:07.479> and<00:05:07.509> light<00:05:07.930> yourself

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:08.169 
green screen and light yourself

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.170 
green screen and light yourself
separately<00:05:09.159> you'll<00:05:09.520> get<00:05:09.699> much<00:05:09.909> better

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
separately you'll get much better

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.909 
separately you'll get much better
results<00:05:11.490> it's<00:05:12.490> just<00:05:12.819> great<00:05:13.349> cheap<00:05:14.349> lighting

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:14.919 
results it's just great cheap lighting

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:16.320 
results it's just great cheap lighting
if<00:05:15.069> you're<00:05:15.190> on<00:05:15.310> a<00:05:15.340> budget<00:05:15.610> and<00:05:15.789> you<00:05:15.940> just<00:05:16.180> need

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
if you're on a budget and you just need

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.300 
if you're on a budget and you just need
something<00:05:16.599> that<00:05:16.750> spreads<00:05:17.560> a<00:05:17.800> lot<00:05:17.979> of<00:05:18.129> light

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
something that spreads a lot of light

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.999 
something that spreads a lot of light
that<00:05:18.940> doesn't<00:05:19.150> put<00:05:19.389> out<00:05:19.539> a<00:05:19.569> lot<00:05:19.780> of<00:05:19.840> heat<00:05:20.110> this

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
that doesn't put out a lot of heat this

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:23.909 
that doesn't put out a lot of heat this
is<00:05:21.129> a<00:05:21.159> great<00:05:21.430> way<00:05:21.580> to<00:05:21.610> do<00:05:21.849> it<00:05:22.030> it's<00:05:22.840> not<00:05:23.199> quite<00:05:23.889> a
