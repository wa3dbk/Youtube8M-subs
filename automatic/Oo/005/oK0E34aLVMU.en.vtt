00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 eyelashes so often answers 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.400
 yes yes this is my public faq 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.200
 in which I ask your questions more frequently 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.820
 so we all answer 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.290
 can talk about it or even 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.990
 a few comments to my opinion 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.940
 can leave behind and have today 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.890
 like a classic of me relative 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.480
 I often want to get a new one 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.580
 pc I should still wait to buy 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.380
 Battlefield 4 came out in the 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.900
 principle that is a really good question and 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.560
 I could just with my first 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.970
 personal pc purchase habit 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.590
 I decided to start my own business 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.180
 or do that very much 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.280
 a long time I buy in about every 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.079
 two years new gaming or too 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.940
 computer hardware it does not necessarily have 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.010
 to do something with him but so general 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.899
 put down new calculator every two years 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.660
 or mucking out and new things dar 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:48.510
 shopping has become relative to me 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.430
 Of course, you can also do well 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.690
 More often than not, buy clear then 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.309
 stop again and so on 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.870
 I'm not a friend of this here 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.460
 any stocks are great 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.960
 to build up that means I have no here 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.489
 old cdu there are no motherboards no 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.469
 housing can not fly anything around 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.969
 if something flies out of me then it will 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.299
 that shortly after that if I did not do it for 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.439
 another purpose needed immediately 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.900
 resold to as much as possible 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.939
 coal for holding rauszukriegen again 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.630
 the answer I would give now 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.360
 I personally would not be one 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.220
 computer extra for a specific game 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.229
 unless of course I still have to buy 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.299
 no computer and so on i would 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.979
 Do not wait because if I'm on a game 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.780
 wait for half a year 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.579
 Until it is on the market, yes 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.079
 again new hardware I too 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.280
 Maybe then i will 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.930
 can not afford but then again 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.640
 and then maybe I'll wait 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.380
 again a little bit longer until 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.880
 I buy the new computer and 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.860
 Under it suffers in the principle of mine 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.360
 entire workflow I am now in 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.140
 moment and during the whole time 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.540
 will have 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.280
 I save on this box in 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.720
 or waiting for that 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.399
 this game comes out of me that 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.619
 I made myself dependent on that 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.630
 pc buy something for me however completely 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.880
 okay is from my personal view 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.680
 is if i tell myself i'll buy if 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.880
 Battlefield 4 comes out a new one 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.590
 computer i am looking for maybe now 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.570
 already made the components and then have 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.740
 Of course I have the huge advantage in one 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.110
 the things are already half a year 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.340
 much cheaper experience 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.539
 but you always switched on 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.550
 bit left and right and thinks 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.900
 now time I was rather like the 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.340
 the graphics card this mainboard this 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.290
 RAM or this cpu the 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.520
 just got out and there are 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.410
 we stupidly caught in this 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.770
 hamsterrad the industry that means one 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.000
 turns all the time in a circle and 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.470
 just no decision and 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.820
 I always try that before 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.220
 a bit to push out so I 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.020
 personally, the pc would not buy 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.550
 necessarily dependent on what 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.870
 for a game I think so 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.460
 Today you have a clever computer 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.160
 you buy now at the moment have 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.350
 I want to be able to afford it and it also makes sense 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.660
 and then he will do it all 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.700
 Probability also absolutely 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.510
 suffice for battlefield 4 in one 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.510
 to play half a year
