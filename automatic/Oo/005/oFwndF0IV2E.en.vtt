00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.519
 books and hello hello because we just 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.679
 see divergent and in fact we create a 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.900
 video on your channel if we record a video 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.759
 on my channel where we discussed a bit 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.440
 of the movies or the characters what 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.150
 we liked what we did not like and everything 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.949
 all that so if you want to go through 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.449

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.060
 want down here in the description them 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.970
 I will put the video marianita aha and here in 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.029
 the channel we decided to do a test to 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.920
 know what faction we are if we 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.600
 I would like very much that they did it with 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.760
 we are also in the cinema 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.050
 we said what faction we would be so 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.790
 We decided to do a test and we would like 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.860
 that you did with us already 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.520
 that will leave us the answers if they are the 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.890
 that are they are ready let's start 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.880
 the first question is do you want your 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.970
 friends and family 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.770
 they see you as someone who has someone 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.830
 willing to make sacrifices and help 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.440
 the needy of someone who likes 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.530
 to everyone if someone where you can 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.620
 trust someone who will protect you without 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.600
 import anything and is someone who knows how to give 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.270
 advice your cheese shops 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.440
 I think I would like people 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.840
 they saw me as someone who likes me 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.640
 everybody because that means that 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.100
 you are a very nice person and you are 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.770
 a good person because I choose to 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.740
 someone you can trust your 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.660
 question number 2 when you face 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.690
 a difficult problem you react 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:31.540
 I insist on what is best for greater 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.400
 number of people see creating a job 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.460
 a work of art that expresses how I 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.430
 feel in that situation is debating the 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.740
 problem with my friends facing 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.600
 What else can I do? 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.680
 making a list of pros and cons 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.570
 what would you do I think that facing what 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.390
 you would get the problem, I think the 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.360
 decision that would take would be the one 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.340
 benefits the greatest number of people and 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.880
 fewer people are affected then 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.880
 is the a 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.180
 the next question is what activity 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.570
 you are more likely to do the ends of 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.270
 week to volunteer to paint dance or 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.700
 write poetry I know how to share your opinion 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.340
 with your friends to climb or practice 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.860
 skydiving and catch up with 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.590
 your homework or reading for pleasure 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.330
 I work on the wheel to get to 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.070
 but I would do it for pleasure 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.480
 so in 4 is if you had to 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.540
 choose one of the following options 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:39.400
 as a profession which one you would choose to 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:43.380
 humanitarian see farmer if judge of 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.380
 fireman or the scientist 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.970
 and like none of the ones that are there 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.400
 like only one possibility that 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.020
 scientist I do not think I'm good but it would be 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.970
 scientist if I also scientific 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:57.280
 I also think it will not be good but I 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.910
 I would like to invent calcite things 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.910
 rositas 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.480
 the next question is when do you choose 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.909
 your outfit of the day you choose what 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.549
 attract less attention see something comfortable 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:14.010
 but interesting to see is something simple 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.859
 but that expresses your personality of what 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.720
 that attracts more attention or something that 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:23.189
 Do not distract from what you are going to do in 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.319
 the day I something comfortable but that is 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:27.810
 Nice to see I do not want to leave like this 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.350
 with corridors but neither something very 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.180
 uncomfortable 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.180
 touch tell us 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:42.190
 I think that something simple but expressing 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.600
 my personality asks number 6 if you 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.510
 whole that your friend's partner is 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.740
 being unfaithful what would you insist to 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.570
 tell your friend why do not you think 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.330
 it's healthy that if in a relationship where 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.880
 selfish behavior is presented 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.370
 subsection b to sit down with both to act 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.990
 as an intervener mediator , tell your 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.640
 friend as soon as possible 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.020
 you can not imagine keeping a secret of 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:07.300
 that kind of confronting the infidel and 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.860
 save it for you the statistics say 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.820
 that your friend will find out at some point 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.460
 and go you wanted 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:19.200
 I believe that line 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:20.640
 ok the statistics i think i would tell you 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.470
 my friend is a very good friend 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.160
 I would say ball that the one you are being 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.630
 unfaithful if it depends what friend if I 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.340
 I say 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.740
 the next question is what is your 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.630
 priority at this time to serve the 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.540
 that surround you to find peace and 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.580
 happiness for you to seek the truth of 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:41.280
 develop your effort and your character the 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.920
 success in school or work 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.720
 god am among successes a school and 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.660
 work or base tranquility 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.070
 you can only choose one Alberto I can not 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.340
 be divergent you can take the ones that I 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.340
 want 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.949
 Thank you 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.860
 mine would be to find peace and happiness 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:04.259
 for me I'm selfish I know I'm also a 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.849
 little we already finished the seven questions 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:09.810
 Now what we have to do is tell 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:13.550
 how many abc we have to know about 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:17.470
 what faction are we account encounter 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:21.020
 ready how many you had more good I had 13 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:26.620
 youtube 3a 3b but because I cheated 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.620
 because chosen in one so nothing else 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.760
 they are both if the majority of their 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.960
 Answers were nothing they are abnegation not 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.330
 they like to draw attention to 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.220
 you care a lot about the 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.290
 people so more for the people 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:43.260
 less for you if they were majorities 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:46.560
 see they are amiri who are truly cordial 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.600
 and they are at peace with yourself and with 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.660
 people around you appreciate the 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:54.930
 music and the arts I am this in part 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:57.660
 because if I cheated I already told them that if 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:01.290
 they have a majority are candor that is 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.820
 Honesty is true they are honest with 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.130
 all people no matter what 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.800
 difficult to be and no matter how many 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:11.700
 problems this bring if they came out 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:14.020
 Most of them are doubles they are like 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:18.039
 seriously sir that I knew 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:20.009
 they like adrenaline and do not let 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:24.270
 People tell them what to do 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:27.479
 and the one that mariana ss me too because 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:29.999
 says cheat is scholars like it 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:32.149
 learn new things and like 

00:06:29.999 --> 00:06:35.520

00:06:32.149 --> 00:06:37.529

 see if they are going to be with me with Alberto 

00:06:39.149 --> 00:06:43.499
 for the bar everything is divergent then 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:45.779
 you have to choose for one obviously 

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:48.779

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:53.069
