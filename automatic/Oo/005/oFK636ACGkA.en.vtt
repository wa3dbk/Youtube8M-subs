00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.639
 If you need to send a device to the SAT, it is important that you know how to pack it 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.800
 correctly so that it does not suffer any damage during its transport. 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.049
 Follow these tips to know how to do it. 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.189
 First of all verify that you have made a copy of the data 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.480
 stored on your device and that you want to keep, since when processing the 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.269
 repair, 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.460
 the data will be lost. 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.509
 If you wish, you can enter our website and follow the steps indicated 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.490
 to make a backup. 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:35.940
 Before continuing, 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.520
 Check that the machine is off. 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.110
 Prepare your device without attaching any accessory that has not been 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.380
 expressly requested by the SAT. 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.130
 Whether your device has a removable battery or not, 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.930
 It is necessary that you send it to us. 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.200
 Therefore, do not withdraw it. 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.170
 In the following models you must also attach the micro SD that is 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.580
 included the original packaging: 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.280
 Aquaris 3.5, Aquaris 4 and Aquaris 4.5. 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.410
 Find a box of dimensions suitable for the size of the device, 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:12.340
 preferably rigid. If you prefer, you can use the original box. 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.840
 Pack the device, for example, in bubble wrap, 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.800
 and enter it in the box that you have prepared in advance. 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.290
 If you are asked for another accessory, save it also in the same box, 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.230
 ensuring that the most sensitive areas of the device 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.450
 not in direct contact with the accessory, so that we avoid 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.360
 possible damage to each other. 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.290
 If there are gaps in the box, 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.850
 fill them with paper so that the device does not move. 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.080
 Print now the repair authorization document that we will have 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.189
 sent. Cut it out along the dotted line and include the top of the 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:10.189
 same inside the box. 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:12.889
 Lastly, seal the box sufficiently 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:15.499
 and visibly pastes the bottom of the document 

00:02:15.499 --> 00:02:17.439
 on the outside of the package. 

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:38.179
 Remember to have the device ready for the agreed date of collection.
