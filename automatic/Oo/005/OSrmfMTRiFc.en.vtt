00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.370 
is not the Constructicons that merges
into<00:01:20.860> the<00:01:21.040> Devastator<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.720> this<00:01:22.930> one<00:01:23.110> gets

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
into the Devastator so this one gets

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.960 
into the Devastator so this one gets
killed<00:01:23.590> in<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:23.920> beginning<00:01:24.430> of<00:01:24.549> the<00:01:24.670> movie<00:01:26.970> and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
also sideways which is a big

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.719 
also sideways which is a big
disappointment<00:01:30.340> to<00:01:30.399> me<00:01:30.600> I<00:01:31.600> still<00:01:32.549> don't<00:01:33.549> get

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
disappointment to me I still don't get

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:36.389 
disappointment to me I still don't get
it<00:01:33.790> why<00:01:34.030> they<00:01:34.210> kill<00:01:34.470> sideways<00:01:35.470> I<00:01:35.799> think<00:01:36.100> I<00:01:36.220> was

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
it why they kill sideways I think I was

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.319 
it why they kill sideways I think I was
a<00:01:36.490> cool<00:01:36.759> to<00:01:37.600> living<00:01:37.960> there<00:01:38.170> we<00:01:38.259> have<00:01:39.329> agonizing

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
a cool to living there we have agonizing

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.480 
a cool to living there we have agonizing
the<00:01:40.659> Molitor<00:01:41.110> saying<00:01:41.560> this<00:01:41.710> is<00:01:41.890> not<00:01:42.130> your

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
think it's not in movies just the plane

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.540 
think it's not in movies just the plane
that<00:02:45.040> moves<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.209> Autobots<00:02:46.860> from<00:02:47.860> one<00:02:48.340> place

that moves the Autobots from one place

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.670 
that moves the Autobots from one place
to<00:02:48.580> another<00:02:48.760> but<00:02:49.270> I<00:02:49.540> think<00:02:50.320> that's<00:02:50.560> not

is he actually Soundwave in his
satellite<00:03:12.670> mode<00:03:14.580> hacking<00:03:15.580> into<00:03:15.760> another

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
satellite mode hacking into another

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.199 
satellite mode hacking into another
satellite<00:03:16.810> this<00:03:17.470> is<00:03:17.620> a<00:03:17.650> human<00:03:17.980> satellite<00:03:18.430> and

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
satellite this is a human satellite and

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.350 
satellite this is a human satellite and
there<00:03:19.660> we<00:03:19.750> can<00:03:19.900> see<00:03:20.140> put<00:03:20.890> some<00:03:21.160> strains<00:03:21.580> there

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.930 
there we can see put some strains there
I<00:03:22.470> think<00:03:23.470> hacking<00:03:23.920> or<00:03:24.070> destroying<00:03:24.640> this

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
I think hacking or destroying this

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.360 
I think hacking or destroying this
satellite<00:03:25.750> and<00:03:26.170> taking<00:03:26.590> his<00:03:26.739> place<00:03:26.890> I<00:03:27.220> don't

and goes into some military installation

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.610 
and goes into some military installation
where<00:04:19.160> the<00:04:19.340> I<00:04:19.519> think<00:04:19.970> there's<00:04:20.209> a<00:04:20.410> fragment<00:04:21.410> of

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
where the I think there's a fragment of

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:23.680 
where the I think there's a fragment of
the<00:04:21.769> old<00:04:21.920> spark<00:04:22.220> there<00:04:23.090> you<00:04:23.210> can<00:04:23.360> see<00:04:23.510> the

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
the old spark there you can see the

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.870 
the old spark there you can see the
framing<00:04:23.930> of<00:04:24.110> the<00:04:24.230> old<00:04:24.380> spark<00:04:24.680> and<00:04:25.190> rubbish

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
framing of the old spark and rubbish

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.650 
framing of the old spark and rubbish
trying<00:04:26.570> to<00:04:26.780> get<00:04:27.230> to<00:04:27.410> it<00:04:27.500> I<00:04:27.710> think<00:04:28.280> that<00:04:28.580> he<00:04:28.880> he

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
trying to get to it I think that he he

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.260 
trying to get to it I think that he he
actually<00:04:29.780> succeeds<00:04:30.410> in<00:04:31.130> getting<00:04:31.490> that<00:04:31.790> that

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
actually succeeds in getting that that

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.290 
actually succeeds in getting that that
fragment<00:04:32.750> he<00:04:33.320> also<00:04:33.470> deploys<00:04:33.830> this<00:04:34.300> mini

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
fragment he also deploys this mini

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.440 
fragment he also deploys this mini
insecticons<00:04:36.970> from<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.090> nose<00:04:38.240> I<00:04:40.270> think<00:04:41.270> that

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
insecticons from the nose I think that

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:49.450 
insecticons from the nose I think that
those<00:04:41.750> Rd<00:04:42.080> in<00:04:42.650> septic<00:04:43.070> guns<00:04:43.419> to<00:04:44.419> spy<00:04:46.030> and<00:04:48.460> we

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
those Rd in septic guns to spy and we

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.950 
those Rd in septic guns to spy and we
also<00:04:49.610> see<00:04:49.880> their<00:04:50.860> ravage<00:04:51.860> going<00:04:52.430> down<00:04:52.760> the<00:04:53.270> 900

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
also see their ravage going down the 900

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.580 
also see their ravage going down the 900
to<00:04:54.080> see<00:04:55.360> too<00:04:56.360> risky

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590

to see too risky
Megatron<00:04:58.250> there<00:04:58.460> we<00:04:58.550> see<00:04:58.850> a<00:04:58.880> scalpel<00:04:59.270> the
