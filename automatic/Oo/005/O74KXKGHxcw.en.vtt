really<00:02:01.399> cool<00:02:03.909> so<00:02:04.909> now<00:02:05.350> I<00:02:06.350> think<00:02:06.409> I'm<00:02:06.619> gonna<00:02:06.709> go

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
really cool so now I think I'm gonna go

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.009 
really cool so now I think I'm gonna go
explore<00:02:07.009> downstream<00:02:07.759> a<00:02:07.789> little<00:02:08.030> bit<00:02:08.149> more<00:02:08.330> but

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
explore downstream a little bit more but

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.400 
explore downstream a little bit more but
I'm<00:02:09.979> a<00:02:10.160> stick<00:02:10.429> here<00:02:10.640> because<00:02:10.910> I<00:02:10.940> had<00:02:11.180> a<00:02:11.410> hit

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
I'm a stick here because I had a hit

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.400 
I'm a stick here because I had a hit
from<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:13.030> plank<00:02:14.030> on<00:02:14.299> the<00:02:14.959> other<00:02:15.110> side<00:02:16.930> of<00:02:17.930> that

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
from a plank on the other side of that

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:27.770 
from a plank on the other side of that
turtle<00:02:18.650> line<00:02:18.920> so<00:02:19.100> I'll<00:02:19.190> see

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.800 

so<00:02:28.320> I<00:02:28.350> found<00:02:28.500> an<00:02:28.680> interesting<00:02:28.830> place

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:03:11.690 

where<00:02:32.810> there's<00:02:33.140> a<00:02:33.230> dub<00:02:33.380> bridge

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:30.820 

committed<00:03:12.700> across

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.750 

like<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:31.890> thought<00:03:32.040> it<00:03:32.100> would<00:03:32.220> be<00:03:32.400> but<00:03:32.520> we'll<00:03:32.640> get

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
like I thought it would be but we'll get

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.590 
like I thought it would be but we'll get
a<00:03:32.820> shot<00:03:33.120> anyway

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
a shot anyway

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:39.330 
a shot anyway
place<00:03:34.070> drinking<00:03:35.070> unfishable

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.860 

wasn't<00:03:40.090> anything<00:03:40.239> like<00:03:40.390> I<00:03:40.450> thought<00:03:40.540> it<00:03:40.690> would

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
wasn't anything like I thought it would

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.430 
wasn't anything like I thought it would
be<00:03:42.269> something<00:03:43.269> have<00:03:43.480> to<00:03:43.629> move<00:03:43.810> again

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
be something have to move again

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.640 
be something have to move again
I<00:03:45.060> don't<00:03:46.060> know<00:03:46.180> where

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.220 

the<00:03:49.520> other<00:03:49.640> spots<00:03:50.030> seem<00:03:50.330> fish<00:03:50.660> out<00:03:50.900> fished<00:03:51.680> out

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
the other spots seem fish out fished out

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.630 
the other spots seem fish out fished out
so<00:03:54.230> I<00:03:54.260> don't<00:03:54.830> know<00:03:55.069> where<00:03:55.220> I'm<00:03:55.280> gonna<00:03:55.400> head<00:03:55.610> off
