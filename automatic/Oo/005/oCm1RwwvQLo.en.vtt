00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
you know frictionless and it went

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.400 
you know frictionless and it went
totally<00:00:36.030> viral<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.809> I'd<00:00:36.960> kept<00:00:37.260> that

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
totally viral and I'd kept that

so how successful was this app or has it
been<00:01:49.460> so<00:01:50.180> it's<00:01:50.810> been<00:01:50.990> really<00:01:51.890> successful<00:01:52.070> so

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
been so it's been really successful so

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.520 
been so it's been really successful so
basically<00:01:52.880> like<00:01:53.300> the<00:01:53.450> viral<00:01:53.750> nature<00:01:53.960> of<00:01:54.410> the

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
basically like the viral nature of the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.280 
basically like the viral nature of the
content<00:01:54.890> just<00:01:55.480> allowed<00:01:56.480> the<00:01:56.630> app<00:01:56.720> to<00:01:56.870> take<00:01:57.050> off

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
content just allowed the app to take off

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.140 
content just allowed the app to take off
and<00:01:57.560> within<00:01:57.710> a<00:01:57.830> couple<00:01:57.950> weeks<00:01:58.100> I'd<00:01:58.370> so<00:01:58.550> like

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
and within a couple weeks I'd so like

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.370 
and within a couple weeks I'd so like
when<00:01:59.300> it<00:01:59.390> first<00:01:59.630> was<00:01:59.840> in<00:01:59.900> the<00:01:59.930> App<00:02:00.080> Store<00:02:00.110> it

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
when it first was in the App Store it

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.050 
when it first was in the App Store it
was<00:02:00.470> growing<00:02:00.710> pretty<00:02:00.950> slowly<00:02:01.130> like<00:02:01.790> all<00:02:01.940> my

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
was growing pretty slowly like all my

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.100 
was growing pretty slowly like all my
friends<00:02:02.090> downloaded<00:02:02.690> and<00:02:02.810> they<00:02:02.870> were<00:02:02.960> showing

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
friends downloaded and they were showing

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.210 
friends downloaded and they were showing
to<00:02:03.260> their<00:02:03.380> friends<00:02:03.650> sort<00:02:03.800> of<00:02:03.860> thing<00:02:03.980> it<00:02:04.100> was

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
to their friends sort of thing it was

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.560 
to their friends sort of thing it was
growing<00:02:04.370> like<00:02:04.550> you<00:02:04.820> know<00:02:04.910> moderately<00:02:05.360> for<00:02:05.540> a

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
growing like you know moderately for a

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.180 
growing like you know moderately for a
little<00:02:05.750> bit<00:02:05.870> and<00:02:06.050> then<00:02:06.500> all<00:02:06.620> of<00:02:06.650> a<00:02:06.710> sudden<00:02:06.770> one

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
little bit and then all of a sudden one

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.950 
little bit and then all of a sudden one
day<00:02:07.220> it<00:02:07.370> just<00:02:07.460> started<00:02:07.850> doubling<00:02:08.720> every

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
day it just started doubling every

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.330 
day it just started doubling every
single<00:02:09.170> day<00:02:09.290> thousands<00:02:09.710> of<00:02:09.800> downloads<00:02:09.890> every

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
single day thousands of downloads every

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.040 
single day thousands of downloads every
day<00:02:10.460> what<00:02:11.000> happened<00:02:11.360> what<00:02:11.510> was<00:02:11.600> that<00:02:11.720> turning

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
day what happened what was that turning

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.200 
day what happened what was that turning
point<00:02:12.260> I<00:02:12.440> integrated<00:02:12.890> Twitter<00:02:13.210> initially

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
point I integrated Twitter initially

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.580 
point I integrated Twitter initially
because<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:14.990> was<00:02:15.170> really<00:02:15.440> really

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
because it was really really

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.280 
because it was really really
frictionless<00:02:16.100> with<00:02:16.280> iOS<00:02:16.550> 5<00:02:16.660> super<00:02:17.660> easy<00:02:17.930> to

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
frictionless with iOS 5 super easy to

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.750 
frictionless with iOS 5 super easy to
tweet<00:02:18.590> from<00:02:18.800> in<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.100> app<00:02:19.190> right<00:02:19.460> I<00:02:19.640> think

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
tweet from in the app right I think

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.780 
tweet from in the app right I think
that's<00:02:20.210> what<00:02:20.870> had<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.410> really<00:02:22.160> large<00:02:22.310> effect<00:02:22.640> on

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
that's what had a really large effect on

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.550 
that's what had a really large effect on
the<00:02:22.970> virality<00:02:23.300> so<00:02:23.780> you<00:02:23.870> had<00:02:24.050> more<00:02:24.410> than<00:02:24.500> a

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
the virality so you had more than a

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.340 
the virality so you had more than a
million<00:02:24.980> downloads<00:02:25.540> yeah<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:26.570> had<00:02:26.840> that's<00:02:27.230> a

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
million downloads yeah I had that's a

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.960 
million downloads yeah I had that's a
month<00:02:27.560> ago<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:27.770> I<00:02:27.890> had<00:02:28.010> over<00:02:28.100> a<00:02:28.220> million<00:02:28.370> so

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
month ago that I had over a million so

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.790 
month ago that I had over a million so
now<00:02:29.120> it's<00:02:29.330> now<00:02:30.110> it's<00:02:30.140> somewhere<00:02:30.440> around<00:02:30.530> four

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
now it's now it's somewhere around four

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:33.010 
now it's now it's somewhere around four
what's<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.340> next<00:02:31.490> step<00:02:31.700> for<00:02:31.760> I'd<00:02:32.030> cap<00:02:32.270> that<00:02:32.480> so

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
what's the next step for I'd cap that so

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.380 
what's the next step for I'd cap that so
basically<00:02:33.340> you<00:02:34.340> know<00:02:34.460> my<00:02:34.580> plans<00:02:34.880> are<00:02:35.030> kind<00:02:35.210> of

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
basically you know my plans are kind of

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.150 
basically you know my plans are kind of
creating<00:02:36.020> other<00:02:36.170> apps<00:02:36.380> in<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.590> same<00:02:36.770> space

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
creating other apps in the same space

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.220 
creating other apps in the same space
kind<00:02:37.730> of<00:02:37.880> trying<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.180> expand<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.810> ICAP<00:02:39.080> that

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
kind of trying to expand the ICAP that

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
putting some discovery features in there

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:45.880 
putting some discovery features in there
stuff<00:02:45.050> like<00:02:45.140> that<00:02:45.290> so<00:02:45.470> I'm<00:02:45.530> going<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.710> be<00:02:45.770> it's
