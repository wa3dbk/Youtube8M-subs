00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
built on to the speaker they are just

sticky pads that are put onto the bottom

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.559 
sticky pads that are put onto the bottom
which<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.190> found<00:03:45.459> out<00:03:45.669> right<00:03:45.940> away<00:03:46.060> when<00:03:46.329> I<00:03:46.359> did

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
which I found out right away when I did

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:48.089 
which I found out right away when I did
open<00:03:46.930> up<00:03:47.049> the<00:03:47.199> speaker<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.650> first<00:03:47.889> time

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
open up the speaker the first time

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:49.619 
open up the speaker the first time
because<00:03:48.340> one<00:03:48.579> of<00:03:48.669> them<00:03:48.790> had<00:03:48.940> fallen<00:03:49.150> off<00:03:49.389> right

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
because one of them had fallen off right

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:50.099 
because one of them had fallen off right
away

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
away

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.039 
away
so<00:03:50.799> I<00:03:50.829> think<00:03:50.949> for<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.310> 180<00:03:52.239> dollar<00:03:52.479> speaker<00:03:52.900> I

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
so I think for a 180 dollar speaker I

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.569 
so I think for a 180 dollar speaker I
think<00:03:53.260> they<00:03:53.349> should<00:03:53.470> have<00:03:53.500> just<00:03:53.799> built<00:03:54.370> him

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
think they should have just built him

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.659 
think they should have just built him
right<00:03:54.760> into<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.150> speaker<00:03:56.010> so<00:03:57.010> we'll<00:03:57.489> set<00:03:57.639> that

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:57.669 
right into the speaker so we'll set that

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:00.899 
right into the speaker so we'll set that
aside<00:03:57.819> for<00:03:58.090> just<00:03:58.540> a<00:03:58.629> minute<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:59.790> we'll<00:04:00.790> go

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:00.909 
aside for just a minute and we'll go

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:03.479 
aside for just a minute and we'll go
over<00:04:01.090> to<00:04:01.239> our<00:04:01.359> accessories<00:04:02.099> let's<00:04:03.099> open<00:04:03.220> this

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489

just<00:04:37.110> gotten<00:04:37.440> with<00:04:37.590> a<00:04:37.770> microUSB<00:04:38.550> for<00:04:39.540> charging

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
just gotten with a microUSB for charging

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.080 
just gotten with a microUSB for charging
speaker<00:04:40.830> because<00:04:41.250> I<00:04:41.280> feel<00:04:41.610> like<00:04:41.640> a<00:04:41.760> lot<00:04:42.060> of

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
speaker because I feel like a lot of

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.470 
speaker because I feel like a lot of
people<00:04:42.330> do<00:04:43.050> have<00:04:43.080> micro<00:04:43.680> USBs<00:04:44.330> laying<00:04:45.330> around

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
people do have micro USBs laying around

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.910 
people do have micro USBs laying around
the<00:04:45.660> house<00:04:45.780> if<00:04:45.990> you<00:04:46.080> do<00:04:46.200> lose<00:04:46.380> yours<00:04:46.590> that<00:04:46.740> came

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
the house if you do lose yours that came

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.010 
the house if you do lose yours that came
with<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.310> speaker<00:04:47.580> you<00:04:47.880> most<00:04:48.450> like<00:04:48.660> will<00:04:48.810> have

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
with the speaker you most like will have

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.290 
with the speaker you most like will have
another<00:04:49.290> micro<00:04:49.620> USB<00:04:50.010> laying<00:04:50.250> around<00:04:50.400> when

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
another micro USB laying around when

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.660 
another micro USB laying around when
with<00:04:51.450> an<00:04:51.570> AC<00:04:51.780> adapter<00:04:52.190> for<00:04:53.190> charging<00:04:53.250> your

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
with an AC adapter for charging your

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:54.980 
with an AC adapter for charging your
speaker<00:04:54.120> I<00:04:54.150> don't<00:04:54.390> think<00:04:54.600> that<00:04:54.720> a<00:04:54.750> lot<00:04:54.870> of

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
speaker I don't think that a lot of

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.060 
speaker I don't think that a lot of
people<00:04:55.170> really<00:04:55.320> have<00:04:55.560> those<00:04:55.740> laying<00:04:55.920> around

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
people really have those laying around

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.100 
people really have those laying around
because<00:04:56.370> they're<00:04:57.120> not<00:04:57.150> used<00:04:57.540> as<00:04:57.720> widely<00:04:57.930> as

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
because they're not used as widely as

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.950 
because they're not used as widely as
micro<00:04:58.470> USBs<00:04:58.860> are<00:04:59.070> so<00:04:59.760> if<00:04:59.880> you<00:05:00.000> lose<00:05:00.210> yours<00:05:00.540> you

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
micro USBs are so if you lose yours you

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.750 
micro USBs are so if you lose yours you
probably<00:05:01.500> have<00:05:01.710> to<00:05:01.830> go<00:05:01.950> out<00:05:02.160> and<00:05:02.190> buy<00:05:02.490> a<00:05:02.520> new

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
probably have to go out and buy a new

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.020 
probably have to go out and buy a new
one<00:05:03.410> so<00:05:04.410> underneath<00:05:04.650> that<00:05:04.950> we<00:05:05.280> do<00:05:05.400> have<00:05:05.640> four

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
one so underneath that we do have four

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.090 
one so underneath that we do have four
adapters<00:05:07.130> for<00:05:08.130> the<00:05:08.490> charger<00:05:09.740> and<00:05:10.740> you<00:05:10.830> connect

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
adapters for the charger and you connect

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.760 
adapters for the charger and you connect
one<00:05:11.250> of<00:05:11.340> those<00:05:11.490> I<00:05:11.820> have<00:05:12.630> to<00:05:12.690> do<00:05:12.870> put<00:05:13.620> it<00:05:13.680> right

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:13.770 
one of those I have to do put it right

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.880

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
obviously before I did this unboxing it

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.880 
obviously before I did this unboxing it
does<00:05:38.490> sound<00:05:38.910> very<00:05:39.330> very<00:05:39.720> nice<00:05:39.990> it<00:05:40.410> is<00:05:40.440> the

does sound very very nice it is the
loudest<00:05:41.100> speaker<00:05:41.640> that<00:05:41.820> I<00:05:41.850> personally<00:05:42.300> have

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
loudest speaker that I personally have

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.370 
loudest speaker that I personally have
so<00:05:43.140> far<00:05:43.410> and<00:05:43.680> it<00:05:44.550> also<00:05:44.760> performs<00:05:45.690> very<00:05:46.169> nicely

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
so far and it also performs very nicely

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.860 
so far and it also performs very nicely
