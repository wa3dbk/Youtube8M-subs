00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
flow off your index finger by gently

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.520 
flow off your index finger by gently
relieving<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.810> pressure<00:01:45.930> with<00:01:46.350> your<00:01:46.380> thumb

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
relieving the pressure with your thumb

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.920 
relieving the pressure with your thumb
just<00:01:47.009> kind<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.729> tug<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.240> sometimes<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.869> just

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
just kind of tug it sometimes you just

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.800 
just kind of tug it sometimes you just
have<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.200> tug<00:01:49.530> tug<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.610> tug<00:01:51.000> on<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.270> long<00:01:51.479> loop

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
have to tug tug of tug on the long loop

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.170 
have to tug tug of tug on the long loop
to<00:01:52.290> get<00:01:52.409> those<00:01:52.619> line<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.280> line<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.700> flow<00:01:53.970> off

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
to get those line that line to flow off

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.899 
to get those line that line to flow off
and<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.110> also<00:01:55.259> helps<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.619> lubricate<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:56.610> line

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
and it also helps to lubricate the line

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.179 
and it also helps to lubricate the line
with<00:01:57.149> saliva<00:01:57.530> especially<00:01:58.530> if<00:01:58.619> you're<00:01:58.740> using<00:01:58.950> a

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
with saliva especially if you're using a

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.819 
with saliva especially if you're using a
monofilament<00:01:59.939> line<00:02:00.420> I'm<00:02:00.689> using<00:02:00.719> Dacron<00:02:01.530> here

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
monofilament line I'm using Dacron here

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.310 
monofilament line I'm using Dacron here
just<00:02:02.070> because<00:02:02.340> it's<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.700> high-visibility<00:02:03.540> line

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
just because it's a high-visibility line

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.950 
just because it's a high-visibility line
but<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:04.979> works<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.280> lot<00:02:05.430> easy<00:02:05.700> more<00:02:06.450> easily<00:02:06.840> if

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
but it works a lot easy more easily if

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.100 
but it works a lot easy more easily if
you<00:02:07.069> if<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.250> use<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.459> monofilament<00:02:09.179> so

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
you if you use a monofilament so

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.080 
you if you use a monofilament so
continue<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.890> pull<00:02:11.099> those<00:02:11.310> wraps<00:02:11.640> right<00:02:11.910> off

continue to pull those wraps right off

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.330 
continue to pull those wraps right off
until<00:02:12.420> they<00:02:12.540> cinch<00:02:12.930> down

your foot and a half two foot long

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.240 
your foot and a half two foot long
doubled<00:02:58.310> line<00:02:58.489> and<00:02:59.200> you<00:03:00.200> can<00:03:00.349> get<00:03:00.860> ready<00:03:01.099> to

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
doubled line and you can get ready to

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.839 
doubled line and you can get ready to
and<00:03:01.549> then<00:03:01.670> you'll<00:03:01.880> tie<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:03.110> your<00:03:03.440> tear<00:03:04.130> to

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:04.849 
and then you'll tie that to your tear to

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.670 
and then you'll tie that to your tear to
your<00:03:04.880> leader<00:03:05.209> and<00:03:05.420> we'll<00:03:05.720> show<00:03:06.170> you<00:03:06.200> how<00:03:06.349> to<00:03:06.440> do

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
your leader and we'll show you how to do

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.949 
your leader and we'll show you how to do
that<00:03:06.830> next<00:03:07.160> using<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.700> Bristol<00:03:08.150> not<00:03:10.959> alright

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
that next using the Bristol not alright

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:17.620 
that next using the Bristol not alright
so<00:03:12.170> next<00:03:12.410> step<00:03:12.799> is<00:03:13.010> tying<00:03:13.700> your<00:03:14.380> leader<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:16.670> the

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
so next step is tying your leader to the

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.690 
so next step is tying your leader to the
double<00:03:18.019> line<00:03:18.170> you<00:03:18.350> just<00:03:18.380> created<00:03:18.590> using<00:03:19.579> your

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
double line you just created using your

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.090 
double line you just created using your
spider<00:03:19.970> hitch<00:03:20.269> using<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:21.470> Bristol<00:03:21.829> not<00:03:21.950> the

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
spider hitch using the Bristol not the

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.280 
spider hitch using the Bristol not the
Bristol<00:03:22.430> knot<00:03:22.579> is<00:03:22.730> really<00:03:23.390> really<00:03:23.780> easy<00:03:24.079> to

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
Bristol knot is really really easy to

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.009 
Bristol knot is really really easy to
tie<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:24.829> it's<00:03:25.670> not<00:03:26.329> you're<00:03:26.540> going<00:03:26.660> to<00:03:26.720> want<00:03:26.930> to

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
tie and it's not you're going to want to

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:28.509 
tie and it's not you're going to want to
you're<00:03:27.380> going<00:03:27.560> to<00:03:27.620> definitely<00:03:28.070> want<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.340> have

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
you're going to definitely want to have

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:29.979 
you're going to definitely want to have
in<00:03:28.670> in<00:03:29.120> your<00:03:29.390> arsenal

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
in in your arsenal

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.360 
in in your arsenal
so<00:03:31.000> take<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.480> double<00:03:33.319> loop<00:03:33.470> that<00:03:33.739> you<00:03:33.829> formed

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
so take the double loop that you formed

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.800 
so take the double loop that you formed
with<00:03:34.640> the<00:03:34.730> spider<00:03:34.970> hitch<00:03:35.209> in<00:03:35.359> the<00:03:35.420> end<00:03:35.600> of<00:03:35.720> your

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
with the spider hitch in the end of your

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.309 
with the spider hitch in the end of your
fishing<00:03:36.049> line<00:03:36.350> then<00:03:36.950> take<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.780> tag<00:03:38.780> end<00:03:39.049> of

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
fishing line then take the tag end of

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.809 
fishing line then take the tag end of
your<00:03:39.590> leader<00:03:40.810> pass<00:03:41.810> it<00:03:42.109> pass<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:43.340> leader

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
your leader pass it pass the leader

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.559 
your leader pass it pass the leader
through<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:45.500> end<00:03:45.650> of<00:03:45.799> the<00:03:45.889> loop<00:03:46.130> of<00:03:46.450> formed<00:03:47.450> by

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
through the end of the loop of formed by

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:53.140 
through the end of the loop of formed by
that<00:03:47.750> spider<00:03:48.049> hitch<00:03:49.720> then<00:03:52.030> placing<00:03:53.030> your

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
that spider hitch then placing your

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.210 
that spider hitch then placing your
index<00:03:53.329> finger<00:03:54.319> inside<00:03:55.190> of<00:03:55.639> that<00:03:56.319> just<00:03:57.319> to<00:03:57.889> spit

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
index finger inside of that just to spit

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.129 
index finger inside of that just to spit
to<00:03:58.370> inside<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:58.910> loop<00:03:59.090> basically<00:03:59.780> you're

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139 
to inside the loop basically you're

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:03.129 
to inside the loop basically you're
snugging<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:02.000> leader<00:04:02.269> up<00:04:02.540> against<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:02.959> end

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
snugging the leader up against the end

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:08.140 
snugging the leader up against the end
of<00:04:03.319> that<00:04:03.530> double<00:04:03.739> line<00:04:05.079> take<00:04:06.370> the<00:04:07.370> tag<00:04:07.700> end<00:04:07.940> of

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
of that double line take the tag end of

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.110 
of that double line take the tag end of
the<00:04:08.239> leader<00:04:08.510> and<00:04:08.780> wrap<00:04:09.680> it<00:04:09.920> around<00:04:10.120> that

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
the leader and wrap it around that

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.270 
the leader and wrap it around that
double<00:04:11.450> line<00:04:14.440> three<00:04:15.440> to<00:04:15.590> four<00:04:15.799> times<00:04:16.010> you

your<00:04:26.729> line<00:04:26.879> so<00:04:27.840> you<00:04:27.900> see<00:04:28.110> you<00:04:28.229> have<00:04:28.379> a<00:04:28.409> you<00:04:28.949> have

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:29.129 
your line so you see you have a you have

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:33.499 
your line so you see you have a you have
the<00:04:29.490> leader<00:04:30.150> wrapped<00:04:30.599> around<00:04:30.860> those<00:04:31.860> two<00:04:32.580> legs

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
the leader wrapped around those two legs

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:36.439 
the leader wrapped around those two legs

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
of the double line and then you

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.240 
of the double line and then you
basically<00:04:36.960> all<00:04:37.110> you<00:04:37.259> do<00:04:37.379> is<00:04:37.530> you<00:04:37.650> simply<00:04:37.860> take

basically all you do is you simply take

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.990 
basically all you do is you simply take
the<00:04:38.699> tag<00:04:38.939> into<00:04:39.240> the<00:04:39.300> leader<00:04:39.509> and<00:04:39.800> pull<00:04:40.800> and<00:04:41.310> run

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
the tag into the leader and pull and run

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.179 
the tag into the leader and pull and run
it<00:04:42.120> right<00:04:42.449> back<00:04:42.750> through<00:04:43.110> that<00:04:43.319> line<00:04:43.770> that

00:04:44.179 --> 00:04:44.189 
it right back through that line that

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:46.850 
it right back through that line that
that<00:04:44.819> I'm<00:04:45.000> sorry<00:04:45.180> that<00:04:45.300> loop<00:04:45.870> that<00:04:46.710> you've

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
that I'm sorry that loop that you've

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.309 
that I'm sorry that loop that you've
kept<00:04:47.159> you've<00:04:48.120> kept<00:04:48.389> open<00:04:48.810> there<00:04:48.960> with<00:04:49.080> your

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
your index finger then taking all

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.200 
your index finger then taking all
holding<00:04:53.400> all<00:04:53.659> ends<00:04:54.659> of<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:54.780> line<00:04:56.060> snug<00:04:57.060> it

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
holding all ends of the line snug it

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.390 
holding all ends of the line snug it
right<00:04:57.389> down<00:04:59.659> when<00:05:00.659> you<00:05:00.750> get<00:05:00.840> to<00:05:00.990> this<00:05:01.110> stage

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
right down when you get to this stage

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.879 
right down when you get to this stage
you<00:05:02.400> can<00:05:02.569> just<00:05:03.569> sort<00:05:03.719> of<00:05:03.810> pull<00:05:03.870> on<00:05:04.169> the<00:05:04.409> tag<00:05:04.620> end

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
you can just sort of pull on the tag end

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.580 
you can just sort of pull on the tag end
a<00:05:04.979> little<00:05:05.099> bit<00:05:05.370> then<00:05:06.180> release<00:05:06.810> the<00:05:07.020> tag<00:05:07.259> into

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
a little bit then release the tag into

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.879 
a little bit then release the tag into
the<00:05:07.680> leader<00:05:08.330> grab<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.509> standing<00:05:10.110> part<00:05:10.680> of<00:05:10.800> the

leader and the two ends of the the
double<00:05:13.800> line<00:05:14.009> and<00:05:14.310> pull<00:05:15.300> in<00:05:15.449> opposite

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
double line and pull in opposite

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.930 
double line and pull in opposite
directions<00:05:17.330> to<00:05:18.330> Snug<00:05:18.629> it<00:05:18.659> right<00:05:18.930> down<00:05:19.940> and

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
directions to Snug it right down and

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.170 
directions to Snug it right down and
again<00:05:21.180> we're<00:05:21.389> using<00:05:21.419> very<00:05:22.279> thick<00:05:23.279> heavy<00:05:23.849> line

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
again we're using very thick heavy line

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.200 
again we're using very thick heavy line
to<00:05:25.020> tie<00:05:25.590> these<00:05:25.650> knots<00:05:25.830> with<00:05:26.310> but<00:05:26.610> if<00:05:27.029> you're

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
to tie these knots with but if you're

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.909 
to tie these knots with but if you're
using<00:05:27.389> monofilament<00:05:27.930> thinner<00:05:28.409> monofilament

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
using monofilament thinner monofilament

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.659 
using monofilament thinner monofilament
line<00:05:30.139> these<00:05:31.139> these<00:05:31.620> lines<00:05:31.889> will<00:05:32.129> the<00:05:32.490> knots

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
line these these lines will the knots

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.209 
line these these lines will the knots
will<00:05:32.879> form<00:05:33.150> a<00:05:33.270> lot<00:05:33.479> a<00:05:33.779> lot<00:05:34.229> will<00:05:34.800> cinch<00:05:35.009> down<00:05:35.069> a

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:35.219 
will form a lot a lot will cinch down a

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:37.820 
will form a lot a lot will cinch down a
lot<00:05:35.430> more<00:05:35.580> easily<00:05:35.909> and<00:05:36.500> there<00:05:37.500> you<00:05:37.620> have<00:05:37.650> it

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
lot more easily and there you have it

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:44.809 
lot more easily and there you have it
you<00:05:38.069> clip<00:05:38.370> off<00:05:42.469> clip<00:05:43.469> off<00:05:43.650> the<00:05:43.680> end<00:05:43.979> of<00:05:44.159> the<00:05:44.310> tag

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:44.819 
you clip off clip off the end of the tag

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:48.050 
you clip off clip off the end of the tag
end<00:05:45.120> and<00:05:45.300> there<00:05:46.289> you<00:05:46.440> have<00:05:46.620> it<00:05:46.800> a<00:05:46.949> very<00:05:47.400> very

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060 
end and there you have it a very very

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.730 
end and there you have it a very very
clean<00:05:48.479> connection<00:05:49.110> very<00:05:49.830> low<00:05:50.099> profile<00:05:50.610> not

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
clean connection very low profile not

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.189 
clean connection very low profile not
connecting<00:05:52.740> that<00:05:52.919> that<00:05:53.430> double<00:05:53.849> line<00:05:54.089> to<00:05:55.050> your

00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 
connecting that that double line to your

00:05:55.199 --> 00:05:57.050 
connecting that that double line to your
to<00:05:55.589> your<00:05:55.680> heavier<00:05:55.979> leader<00:05:56.279> and<00:05:56.550> that's<00:05:56.940> a
