you can see I'm standing up George's at

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.390 
you can see I'm standing up George's at
the<00:02:48.810> back<00:02:49.050> barbs<00:02:49.530> in<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.680> middle<00:02:49.980> they're

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
the back barbs in the middle they're

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.820 
the back barbs in the middle they're
very<00:02:50.640> stable<00:02:51.120> they<00:02:51.420> got<00:02:51.570> tons<00:02:51.780> of<00:02:52.020> room<00:02:52.200> but

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
very stable they got tons of room but

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.260 
very stable they got tons of room but
the<00:02:52.980> main<00:02:53.160> thing<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:53.820> you<00:02:53.910> can<00:02:53.940> navigate

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270

the main thing is that you can navigate
through<00:02:54.840> shallower<00:02:55.290> water<00:02:55.680> they're<00:02:56.459> very

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
through shallower water they're very

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.010 
through shallower water they're very
easy<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:57.060> anchor<00:02:57.450> because<00:02:57.660> they're<00:02:57.780> so

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
easy to anchor because they're so

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.110 
easy to anchor because they're so
tapered<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.100> they're<00:02:59.250> ideal<00:02:59.430> for<00:02:59.670> salmon

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120
