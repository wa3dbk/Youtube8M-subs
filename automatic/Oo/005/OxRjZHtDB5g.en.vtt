00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.710
 hello friends of today iphone 

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.210
 welcome to a new analysis of a 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.180
 click of cydia in this case we are going to 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.400
 talk about richard a new tweet that 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.010
 is still in beta and that what 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.540
 does is allow us 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.000
 have two applications open in a way 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:28.099
 simultaneous on our device like 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.680
 I say it's still in beta, it's not 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.720
 not perfect at all but it works 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.610
 quite well and also since it 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.270
 launched the first version has improved by 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.240
 so much 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.480
 I think it's time to power 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.940
 show on video how it works and that 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.880
 even encourage someone to try it 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.800
 because it really is quite 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.590
 amazing richard what he does is use 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.250
 multitasking to know forgiveness the function 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.820
 bridge ability of the 8 that consists of 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.130
 that when 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.960
 you touch the touch twice and from your 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.820
 device the screen goes down to the 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.010
 half to be able to access more easily 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.229
 with only one hand because it uses this 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.900
 function to split the screen in two and 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:13.300
 so you can see two applications at once 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.560
 not only see it but interact with 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.030
 we are going to see it in operation 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.940
 to see it much simpler by 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.520
 example I have open safari touched two 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.180
 times the toachi of of my device and 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.420
 the bottom screen you see that in the part of 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.670
 up that normally with the function 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.050
 rich ability would be black because I 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.300
 appear a series of icons in the 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.039
 which I can see the icons on one side 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.620
 recent applications that I have in 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.410
 background 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.210
 that appears to me at the top but 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.090
 I can also open any application 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.490
 that I have installed on my device 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.120
 without the need for it to even 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.760
 open 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.550
 in multitasking so we are going to choose 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.060
 example this twitter application and 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.670
 As you can see, I already have the application of 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.490
 twitter com 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.759
 all tweets I can scroll 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.300
 perfectly can even do 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.520
 retweet any tweet some of you can 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.349
 interact perfectly with the 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.530
 application and of course with which there 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:22.110
 at the bottom I can also 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.620
 interact and click on any link on 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.420
 What more anger I get and load bridge up 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.640
 also allows 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.700
 modify the height of the different 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.040
 screens like that for example if we play 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.680
 this little eyelash that is in the middle I can 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.650
 go moving the lower window of 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:46.160
 up and down until it suits the 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:48.710
 size that I'm interested in having 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.150
 you know I can scroll without any 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:54.489
 problem and then when 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.010
 I have stopped using it simply because 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:00.090
 put the times again in the tÃ¡chira and 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.090
 everything returns to normal 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.360
 we access the richard settings 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.049
 keeping the safari window open 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.400
 and as you can see I have some small options 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.250
 as an option that may result 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.569
 interesting that is to show the center of 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.530
 notifications in place of any 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.590
 application 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:22.739
 if I activate this option what I get 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.840
 is that when he pressed twice on everything 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.989
 If what I have is my center of 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:32.220
 notifications displayed and I can see 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.989
 everything I have in him back to 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.159
 the configuration screen of the tweet 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:40.060
 richard we found other options like 

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:42.459
 disable what 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.870
 the click is inactive and after a 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.810
 time and the screen returns to the 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.760
 normalcy to force the rotation of the 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.040
 applications is something that does not work 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.450
 Too much this tweet in vertical mode anymore 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.970
 or less we can say it works 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.530
 correct form in horizontal mode the 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.110
 operation still leaves a lot that 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.210
 to wish 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.400
 we can also configure the 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:05.160
 behavior of the start button ie 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:08.120
 that whatever close rich ability or 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:11.820
 well that directly send us to 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.710
 sprint we can also configure the 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.060
 option for the button that we 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:20.290
 allows to modify 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:23.140
 the size of the window or this 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.490
 to this little button that you see that appears 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.910
 nothing more than a good half that 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:34.220
 also appear the lower half that 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:37.330
 would be configured with this option 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.060
 automatically resize the 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.500
 application of the window as we go 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.560
 as we go resizing the 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.470
 window and the most important options 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.990
 the fact that he shows us the app 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.420
 selector the application selector is 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.730
 say this that when you press directly 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.560
 tell what application you want to open but 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.200
 what it will do is choose automatically 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.680
 the application the application that I had 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:07.180
 previously opened and also show 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.180
 the favorites 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.710
 As you can see, we can configure what 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.539
 applications we want you to consider 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.340
 favorite and that is not even 

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.500
 they need to be open so that 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:19.949
 have them there by hand to be able to open it 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.849
 when we want to show us also 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.800
 all the applications that we have 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.930
 installed on the device and a 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.090
 option that is a beta within another 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.919
 beta so it's not for nothing 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.210
 recommended and also works very badly 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:34.340
 What is it 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.620
 good to force applications to be 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.289
 adapt to the screen when you're in 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.580
 horizontal mode I say it does not work well 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:42.319
 do not even try it, I 've tried it 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.400
 a couple of times and I can practically 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:44.930
 say that none of the time have I 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.820
 managed to do things as it should 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:53.150
 but good and I tell you that bridge up 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:56.320
 it's a tweet that I think it still has 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:59.360
 a lot to polish but that works 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:03.400
 quite pretty good at the moment for 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:05.760
 be a beta and that above all is very 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.580
 promising 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:11.340
 we will remain attentive to him and also know 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.680
 if we already get above all that 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:17.850
 work in horizontal mode which is where 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:20.180
 really has more utility until the 

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:20.180
 next
