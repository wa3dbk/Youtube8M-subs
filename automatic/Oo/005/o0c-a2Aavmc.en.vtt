00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
see how that goes and then the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.480 
see how that goes and then the
infallible<00:01:11.250> Pro<00:01:11.730> matte<00:01:11.760> up<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.480> 16<00:01:12.990> hours<00:01:13.460> so<00:01:14.460> I

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
a little bit of shine just a little bit

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.110 
a little bit of shine just a little bit
because<00:05:44.950> you<00:05:45.190> wanted<00:05:45.460> to<00:05:45.520> still<00:05:45.910> look<00:05:46.060> like

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
because you wanted to still look like

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.760 
because you wanted to still look like
skin<00:05:46.540> when<00:05:46.780> you're<00:05:46.930> done<00:05:47.080> when<00:05:47.590> you're<00:05:47.680> all

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:47.770 
skin when you're done when you're all

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.730 
skin when you're done when you're all
set<00:05:47.980> and<00:05:48.130> done<00:05:48.160> so<00:05:48.670> i<00:05:49.650> wouldn't<00:05:50.650> recommend

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 
set and done so i wouldn't recommend

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.280 
set and done so i wouldn't recommend
this<00:05:51.220> even<00:05:51.670> for<00:05:51.940> oily<00:05:52.570> skin<00:05:52.600> types<00:05:53.050> because

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:53.290 
this even for oily skin types because

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.050 
this even for oily skin types because
it's<00:05:53.560> just<00:05:53.620> too<00:05:53.890> drying<00:05:54.280> and<00:05:54.670> it's<00:05:54.790> really

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
it's just too drying and it's really

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.030 
it's just too drying and it's really
hard<00:05:55.270> to<00:05:55.360> work<00:05:55.510> with<00:05:55.660> as<00:05:55.960> far<00:05:56.200> as<00:05:56.500> the<00:05:56.770> Pro

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
hard to work with as far as the Pro

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.940 
hard to work with as far as the Pro
matte<00:05:57.280> powder<00:05:57.580> though<00:05:57.970> I<00:05:58.440> think<00:05:59.440> this<00:05:59.740> stuff

00:05:59.940 --> 00:05:59.950 
matte powder though I think this stuff

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.740 
matte powder though I think this stuff
is<00:06:00.100> pretty<00:06:00.280> pretty<00:06:00.760> awesome<00:06:01.240> this<00:06:01.540> would

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
is pretty pretty awesome this would

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.070 
is pretty pretty awesome this would
probably<00:06:01.990> be<00:06:02.380> full<00:06:02.770> coverage<00:06:03.160> if<00:06:03.550> I<00:06:04.030> wanted<00:06:04.990> to

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:05.080 
probably be full coverage if I wanted to

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.020 
probably be full coverage if I wanted to
just<00:06:05.230> wear<00:06:05.530> it<00:06:05.680> by<00:06:05.860> itself<00:06:05.890> i<00:06:06.610> think<00:06:06.640> i<00:06:06.970> could

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
just wear it by itself i think i could

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.760 
just wear it by itself i think i could
probably<00:06:07.450> get<00:06:07.810> away<00:06:07.840> with<00:06:08.020> that<00:06:08.260> if<00:06:08.440> I<00:06:08.530> just

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770 
probably get away with that if I just

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.140 
probably get away with that if I just
needed<00:06:09.070> to<00:06:09.160> throw<00:06:09.310> on<00:06:09.490> some<00:06:09.670> makeup<00:06:09.820> really

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
needed to throw on some makeup really

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.110 
needed to throw on some makeup really
quickly<00:06:10.450> it<00:06:10.660> definitely<00:06:11.200> is<00:06:11.380> Matt<00:06:11.950> and<00:06:12.400> it

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
quickly it definitely is Matt and it

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.740 
quickly it definitely is Matt and it
actually<00:06:13.420> has<00:06:13.900> met<00:06:14.350> highlighted<00:06:15.250> there<00:06:15.750> right

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
actually has met highlighted there right

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.410 
actually has met highlighted there right
there<00:06:17.050> so<00:06:17.650> they<00:06:18.400> got<00:06:18.580> that<00:06:18.730> right<00:06:19.000> it's<00:06:19.240> not

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:19.420 
there so they got that right it's not

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.570 
there so they got that right it's not
Demi<00:06:19.750> Matt<00:06:20.020> it's<00:06:20.170> very<00:06:20.440> mad<00:06:20.710> I<00:06:20.980> think<00:06:21.490> this

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
Demi Matt it's very mad I think this

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.340 
Demi Matt it's very mad I think this
would<00:06:21.790> be<00:06:21.820> really<00:06:22.090> pretty<00:06:22.360> over<00:06:22.840> another

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.350 
would be really pretty over another

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:28.170 
would be really pretty over another
foundation<00:06:24.750> possibly<00:06:26.670> over<00:06:27.670> a<00:06:27.700> l'oreal

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
foundation possibly over a l'oreal

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.660 
foundation possibly over a l'oreal
infallible<00:06:29.100> foundation<00:06:30.100> I<00:06:30.220> think<00:06:30.430> it<00:06:30.550> might

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:30.670 
infallible foundation I think it might

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.670 
infallible foundation I think it might
actually<00:06:30.820> work<00:06:31.210> really<00:06:31.330> well<00:06:31.600> with<00:06:31.720> that<00:06:31.960> but

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:32.680 
actually work really well with that but

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.860 
actually work really well with that but
I<00:06:32.710> don't<00:06:33.250> like<00:06:33.490> the<00:06:33.730> liquid<00:06:34.060> foundation<00:06:34.630> and

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
I don't like the liquid foundation and

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:38.160 
I don't like the liquid foundation and
if<00:06:35.020> you're<00:06:35.200> dry<00:06:35.500> no<00:06:36.330> too<00:06:37.330> much<00:06:37.570> use<00:06:37.900> this

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.170 
if you're dry no too much use this

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.290 
if you're dry no too much use this
you're<00:06:38.530> gonna<00:06:38.620> really<00:06:39.070> regret<00:06:39.460> that<00:06:39.640> definite

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
you're gonna really regret that definite

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.470 
you're gonna really regret that definite
