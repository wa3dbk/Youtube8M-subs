part of the Creasy part of your brush
which<00:04:25.200> it's<00:04:25.350> a<00:04:25.440> flat<00:04:25.650> brush<00:04:25.800> but<00:04:26.010> will<00:04:26.160> still

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
which it's a flat brush but will still

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.340 
which it's a flat brush but will still
go<00:04:26.580> into<00:04:26.730> the<00:04:26.820> crease<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.450> you're<00:04:28.260> gonna

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
go into the crease and you're gonna

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.130 
go into the crease and you're gonna
trace<00:04:28.710> across<00:04:29.100> the<00:04:29.310> crease<00:04:29.550> line<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.150> now<00:04:30.990> I'm

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
trace across the crease line and now I'm

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.550 
trace across the crease line and now I'm
going<00:04:31.260> to<00:04:31.320> go<00:04:31.410> back<00:04:31.710> to<00:04:31.980> my<00:04:32.430> pencils<00:04:33.380> so<00:04:34.380> I'm

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
going to go back to my pencils so I'm

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.170 
going to go back to my pencils so I'm
going<00:04:34.680> to<00:04:34.740> take<00:04:34.830> this<00:04:34.950> deep<00:04:35.220> end<00:04:35.460> pencil<00:04:35.940> and

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
going to take this deep end pencil and

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.940 
going to take this deep end pencil and
when<00:04:36.419> you<00:04:36.510> do<00:04:36.600> a<00:04:36.630> strong<00:04:36.930> eye<00:04:37.050> like<00:04:37.260> this<00:04:37.500> you

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
when you do a strong eye like this you

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.740 
when you do a strong eye like this you
definitely<00:04:38.520> wanted<00:04:38.790> to<00:04:38.880> find<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.270> eye<00:04:39.300> a<00:04:39.390> lot

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
definitely wanted to find the eye a lot

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.110 
definitely wanted to find the eye a lot
but<00:04:40.470> I<00:04:40.500> think<00:04:40.620> on<00:04:41.010> the<00:04:41.160> lower<00:04:41.370> lash<00:04:41.610> line<00:04:41.730> black

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
but I think on the lower lash line black

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.870 
but I think on the lower lash line black
can<00:04:42.360> be<00:04:42.390> a<00:04:42.480> little<00:04:42.690> harsh<00:04:43.020> with<00:04:43.260> all<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.590> color

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
can be a little harsh with all the color

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.380 
can be a little harsh with all the color
but<00:04:44.880> it's<00:04:45.030> dark<00:04:45.390> enough<00:04:45.690> to<00:04:45.750> add<00:04:46.080> definition

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
but it's dark enough to add definition

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.600 
but it's dark enough to add definition
so<00:04:48.390> I'm<00:04:48.540> gonna<00:04:48.660> take<00:04:48.870> our<00:04:49.020> brand-new

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.980
