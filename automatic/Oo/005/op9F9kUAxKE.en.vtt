grapes<00:02:44.870> we've<00:02:45.870> figured<00:02:46.170> out<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.440> way<00:02:46.680> of

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
grapes we've figured out a way of

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.640 
grapes we've figured out a way of
sealing<00:02:47.280> in<00:02:47.700> concord<00:02:48.510> grape<00:02:48.720> flavor<00:02:49.050> through

sealing in concord grape flavor through
a<00:02:49.680> bathing<00:02:50.160> process<00:02:50.670> grape<00:02:51.600> apple<00:02:52.590> grateful

a bathing process grape apple grateful

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.880 
a bathing process grape apple grateful
so<00:02:53.850> it's<00:02:54.000> apple<00:02:54.510> with<00:02:54.780> great<00:02:55.230> flavor<00:02:55.620> so<00:02:55.800> i'm

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
so it's apple with great flavor so i'm

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.980 
so it's apple with great flavor so i'm
guessing<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.730> there<00:02:57.270> probably<00:02:57.390> aren't<00:02:57.810> any
