00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
cheapo overhang that if this window were

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.910 
cheapo overhang that if this window were
like<00:03:43.019> so<00:03:44.569> with<00:03:45.569> the<00:03:45.690> bevel<00:03:45.870> cut<00:03:46.200> using<00:03:46.590> a<00:03:46.769> much

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
like so with the bevel cut using a much

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.860 
like so with the bevel cut using a much
thicker<00:03:47.190> board<00:03:47.549> you<00:03:48.030> have<00:03:48.150> this<00:03:48.239> big<00:03:48.480> overhang

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
thicker board you have this big overhang

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.930 
thicker board you have this big overhang
over<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.560> window<00:03:49.829> -<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:50.220> any<00:03:50.430> rain<00:03:50.640> were<00:03:50.819> to

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
over the window - so any rain were to

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.550 
over the window - so any rain were to
make<00:03:51.090> it<00:03:51.239> down<00:03:51.389> aside<00:03:52.049> from<00:03:52.230> having<00:03:52.350> the

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.680 
with the hinges sealant above it as well
he<00:04:01.980> do<00:04:02.069> bevel<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.430> top<00:04:02.670> of<00:04:02.849> it<00:04:02.940> too<00:04:03.120> so<00:04:03.450> there's

sashes used to move so I mean you could

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.629 
sashes used to move so I mean you could
move<00:04:27.389> that<00:04:28.110> doesn't<00:04:28.470> matter<00:04:28.650> if<00:04:28.950> it<00:04:29.190> was<00:04:29.340> in

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
move that doesn't matter if it was in

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
its you know like a free hung window

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.550 
its you know like a free hung window
with<00:04:32.610> his<00:04:32.760> tracks<00:04:33.090> and<00:04:33.540> it's<00:04:33.930> meant<00:04:34.110> to<00:04:34.229> open

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
with his tracks and it's meant to open

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.690 
with his tracks and it's meant to open
like<00:04:34.680> this<00:04:34.830> he<00:04:34.979> can't<00:04:35.220> turn<00:04:35.370> it<00:04:35.490> sideways

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
like this he can't turn it sideways

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.300 
like this he can't turn it sideways
because<00:04:36.060> it's<00:04:36.510> meant<00:04:36.720> to<00:04:36.810> drain<00:04:37.169> or<00:04:38.010> a<00:04:38.040> carry

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
again inside you start to harbor water

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.260 
again inside you start to harbor water
in<00:04:43.290> the<00:04:43.380> cracks<00:04:43.680> which<00:04:44.250> overflows<00:04:44.790> and<00:04:45.060> starts

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
in the cracks which overflows and starts

in the cracks which overflows and starts
to<00:04:45.360> leak<00:04:45.570> into<00:04:45.810> your<00:04:45.930> house<00:04:46.169> and<00:04:46.440> that's<00:04:46.530> good

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
to leak into your house and that's good

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
yeah what you can do it like a lot of

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.400 
yeah what you can do it like a lot of
times<00:04:57.030> honestly<00:04:57.479> I<00:04:57.510> would<00:04:57.900> I<00:04:57.930> just<00:04:58.200> want

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
times honestly I would I just want

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.140 
times honestly I would I just want
working<00:04:58.620> with<00:04:58.800> what<00:04:59.039> I<00:04:59.070> have<00:04:59.280> I<00:04:59.550> would<00:04:59.729> take<00:04:59.910> I

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
working with what I have I would take I

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.090 
working with what I have I would take I
would<00:05:00.419> make<00:05:00.660> these<00:05:00.900> longer<00:05:01.440> runs<00:05:01.650> extend

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
would make these longer runs extend

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.130 
would make these longer runs extend
beyond<00:05:02.370> so<00:05:02.610> as<00:05:02.700> water<00:05:02.910> comes<00:05:03.090> down<00:05:03.330> the<00:05:03.390> seam

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
beyond so as water comes down the seam

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.190 
beyond so as water comes down the seam
is<00:05:04.350> here<00:05:04.680> in<00:05:05.130> a<00:05:05.250> more<00:05:05.450> bones<00:05:06.450> in<00:05:06.660> here<00:05:06.960> yeah

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
is here in a more bones in here yeah

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.510 
is here in a more bones in here yeah
because<00:05:07.380> instead<00:05:07.710> right<00:05:07.919> now<00:05:08.039> the<00:05:08.100> way<00:05:08.250> I<00:05:08.280> have

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
because instead right now the way I have

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.980 
because instead right now the way I have
and<00:05:08.669> this<00:05:08.729> was<00:05:08.880> just<00:05:09.030> because<00:05:09.180> my<00:05:09.330> limitations

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
and this was just because my limitations

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.020 
and this was just because my limitations
in<00:05:10.169> salvaged<00:05:10.680> wood<00:05:10.890> the<00:05:11.370> water<00:05:11.610> sits<00:05:11.850> here<00:05:11.970> for

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
in salvaged wood the water sits here for

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.029 
in salvaged wood the water sits here for
a<00:05:12.210> prolonged<00:05:12.390> period<00:05:12.630> and<00:05:13.320> doesn't<00:05:13.680> weep<00:05:13.860> as

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
a prolonged period and doesn't weep as

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.010 
a prolonged period and doesn't weep as
readily<00:05:14.340> through<00:05:14.580> here<00:05:14.910> but<00:05:15.419> again<00:05:15.660> what<00:05:15.900> I<00:05:15.960> do

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
readily through here but again what I do

readily through here but again what I do
is<00:05:16.410> I<00:05:16.500> take<00:05:16.620> that<00:05:16.770> silicon<00:05:17.280> and<00:05:17.460> I<00:05:17.550> use<00:05:17.700> this<00:05:17.820> GE

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
is I take that silicon and I use this GE

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.790 
is I take that silicon and I use this GE
stuff<00:05:18.510> I'll<00:05:18.720> pump<00:05:18.990> it<00:05:19.110> in<00:05:19.229> this<00:05:19.289> gap<00:05:19.560> first

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
stuff I'll pump it in this gap first

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.560 
stuff I'll pump it in this gap first
before<00:05:20.100> I<00:05:20.280> press<00:05:20.520> this<00:05:20.669> board<00:05:20.940> in<00:05:21.030> place<00:05:21.060> you
