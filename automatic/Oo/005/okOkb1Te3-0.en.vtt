00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.000
 ultra bike market and today we are with you 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.670
 do a review on the camera nikon coolpix s30 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.869
 2 this compact camera 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.810
 waterproof shock so much now 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.420
 we will see a complete set of camera cameras 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.740
 it means first in the box we are 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.779
 user manual in Russian 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:35.730
 language with a palette warranty card 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:39.300
 then the camera is very soft in up 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:44.520
 frustration package adapter from yusb 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:48.559
 cable to the network battery date cable to 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.480
 The camera itself is not a big brush to 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.510
 clean it then we tell it and 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.050
 use properly and drawstring to 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.640
 the camera was comfortable to wear and links meant 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.570
 the camera is equipped with a matrix 113 2 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.549
 megapixels 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:11.159
 she has a screen on which is happening 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.810
 with navigation to a minimum size of 26 inches 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.869
 and the camera weighs 175 grams again 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.180
 I repeat she belongs to the class 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:28.770
 compact cameras if the camera has from 125 to 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:31.500
 1600 Well, according to its characteristics 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.900
 it can withstand immersion up to 10 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.900
 meters and falls from a height of one and a half meters 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.610
 but how to abuse shock resistance 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.110
 did not advise because during the tests 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.000
 on the camera it turned out such a scratch 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:49.200
 The camera control is very simple and I have 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.689
 two buttons to start shooting this photo 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.149
 this video is a video by pressing a button 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.820
 recording starts by pressing a button, 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.900
 end the power button these buttons 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.850
 work on under water because 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.830
 the gray part of the body is very good 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:09.080
 rubberized can be pressed under water 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:12.110
 water will not climb on these buttons 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.900
 With this button we start viewing the photo. 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.560
 or the video that we make these 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.330
 buttons we arrange the navigation menu 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.320
 these four buttons also serves to 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.580
 menu navigation 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:29.090
 management is very simple these four 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.690
 The buttons are very useful, that is, it is not necessary here 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.540
 all menus can maximally contain 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.160
 four points and the zoom button approach 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.400
 remove zoom on optical triple 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.459
 zoom 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.730
 this camera has a flash 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:49.760
 also his whole body is very good 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.660
 rubberized and protected from moisture by 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.390
 there you can shoot under water 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.190
 do not take deep water 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.920
 passive element also the camera can 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.440
 secure on a tripod or some on 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.280
 helmet and if there are specialized 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:12.170
 camera mounts camera records sound 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.480
 both above water and under water means both 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:17.120
 camera is shooting under water 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.880
 take pictures under water can take ponds 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:23.150
 in pools without a difference 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:26.150
 the main thing that after shooting you dropped 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.300
 camera for 10 minutes in a vessel with fresh 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:34.550
 With water, then here are these brushes 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:37.990
 cleaned the speaker slots 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:41.470
 and the holes are all a lot of honor for salt from 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:45.370
 dirt that can not get clean 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:49.900
 pool water only minus camera 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:52.660
 this is what it takes bad when bad 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:56.040
 coverage but since it is budget 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.570
 compact camera is on minus and plus 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.880
 the camera is designed for vacation for 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.700
 shooting in the pool in the sun 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.970
 so this camera is unlikely to be 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.180
 take off in the dark or when 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.120
 bad 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.360
 light conditions so this 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.500
 minor minus also 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.630
 a small minus is that 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.489
 there is no mechanical camera 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.130
 so much electronic stabilization 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.650
 stabilization is therefore important to follow to 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.940
 the pictures were not blurred but to 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.440
 hands did not shake and monitors quality 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.120
