00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 workshop is going on holiday with me 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.780
 work for some time now and one 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.269
 few experiences made the device 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.219
 should be known 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.800
 It delivers excellent results 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:19.199
 according to my experiences, it does 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.020
 sound really razor-sharp 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:26.490
 But there are a few points you can 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.769
 It should be noted first of all 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.009
 is the operation of the device actually 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:36.120
 superbly documented next to one 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:38.430
 English-language dvd are one 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.100
 German user manual and 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.550
 a quick guide and above 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.680
 There are also lots of videos 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:50.550
 here at youtube the used 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.969
 describe devices in detail in the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.100
 English-language video to the device is 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.309
 in contrast to the German 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.010
 operating instructions a three-stage one 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.379
 and off switch described the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:08.010
 German description is only the speech 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.619
 from an on switch also on 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.530
 device in the form of a poster, the present 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.470
 means the switch does not snap something 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.810
 also makes sense we see here the 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:23.610
 switch on the bottom of the device 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:25.320
 and as I said he does not rest and then 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.240
 jump back to the off position 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.990
 back when you let him go a pure 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.850
 button and I think so synonymous 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:38.460
 It makes perfect sense because it is not 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.189
 really recommend the knife 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.439
 running abrasive tape in the device 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.399
 how to implement that on some 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.399
 Unfortunately, videos see 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:54.750
 It is better or it is right after 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:58.829
 in my opinion the knife in 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.329
 the corresponding guides then that 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.860
 device to start and the knife 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.649
 to pull through evenly 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.009
 Doing it differently means to lead one 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.640
 the knife with the belt running 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.709
 on 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.470
 then there is the danger that live 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.100
 tied very fast 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.760
 means that is actually in 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.620
 the German operating instructions as well 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.060
 described 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.320
 However, I have in contrast to the 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.430
 German operating instructions the 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:32.450
 experience made that you grind 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:35.030
 and sharpen the knife as well 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.310
 first with the green creep band 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.000
 should work 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:43.340
 here will be sharpening and sharpening 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.440
 in each case exclusively the use of the 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.100
 red and purple sanding ribbon 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.770
 recommended 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.709
 but in my experience it is like that 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:55.070
 that at least at first form give 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:58.610
 the blade so hone the first time 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.520
 a knife with the work &amp; tools 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.790
 Schartner at least once the green 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.800
 Sheep band should be used 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.330
 the sound of a certain basic form 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.740
 give 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.450
 You have to be a bit careful 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.580
 say because the green ribbon tied 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:18.650
 really very strong and attractive 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:22.400
 even relatively much material just takes away 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.980
 with the use of the red and the 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.280
 it is indeed violet schlander 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.860
 succeeded here on the bakery like kate 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.530
 a reasonable cut to install 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:36.489
 but with prior use of the 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:39.590
 green band is this voice really 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.090
 I could have been razor-sharp 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.950
 you at this point now to the proof 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.580
 bald pose and my left 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:50.120
 show forearms or give up times 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.530
 as I said the device inspires me and 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.480
 I think I can be here in a very short time 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.440
 time an excellent result 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.480
 to reach 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.310
 I hope these tips have given you a 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.150
 little bit careful 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.150
 do not hurt yourself
