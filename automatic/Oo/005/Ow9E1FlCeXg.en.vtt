00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.750 
ingredient right down in the middle so
make<00:02:24.840> some<00:02:25.020> room<00:02:25.200> there<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:26.550> way<00:02:26.700> you

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
make some room there and the way you

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.100 
make some room there and the way you
know<00:02:27.000> you've<00:02:27.180> done<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.570> right<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.900> when<00:02:28.020> it

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
know you've done it right is when it

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.550 
know you've done it right is when it
starts<00:02:28.140> spinning<00:02:28.890> around<00:02:29.010> like<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:33.440> so<00:02:34.440> now

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
starts spinning around like that so now

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.830 
starts spinning around like that so now
i'm<00:02:34.710> going<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.950> show<00:02:35.070> you<00:02:35.100> useful<00:02:35.520> ways<00:02:36.090> to<00:02:36.540> use

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
i'm going to show you useful ways to use

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.700 
i'm going to show you useful ways to use
this<00:02:37.170> essence<00:02:37.710> nexus<00:02:38.130> first<00:02:38.670> we<00:02:38.970> have<00:02:39.710> useful

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
this essence nexus first we have useful

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.010 
this essence nexus first we have useful
charge<00:02:41.460> this<00:02:41.670> so<00:02:41.910> if<00:02:42.240> you<00:02:42.300> don't<00:02:42.480> know<00:02:42.720> it

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
charge this so if you don't know it

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.650 
charge this so if you don't know it
charges<00:02:43.590> by<00:02:43.770> throwing<00:02:44.220> items<00:02:44.520> into<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.120> so

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
charges by throwing items into it so

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.040 
charges by throwing items into it so
each<00:02:46.130> item<00:02:47.130> is<00:02:47.340> signed<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.880> certain<00:02:48.780> amount<00:02:48.930> of

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
each item is signed a certain amount of

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.070 
each item is signed a certain amount of
points<00:02:50.300> I'm<00:02:51.300> going<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.510> show<00:02:51.630> you<00:02:51.720> some<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
points I'm going to show you some of the

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.570 
points I'm going to show you some of the
best<00:02:52.710> ways<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.070> use<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:54.330> charge<00:02:54.570> it<00:02:54.810> and<00:02:55.460> we<00:02:56.460> can

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
best ways to use to charge it and we can

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.280 
best ways to use to charge it and we can
use<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.730> sense<00:02:57.060> energy<00:02:57.450> spell<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:57.840> see<00:02:58.050> how<00:02:58.110> much

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
use a sense energy spell to see how much

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.460 
use a sense energy spell to see how much
so<00:02:58.590> now<00:02:58.620> we<00:02:58.980> see<00:02:59.280> there's<00:02:59.490> zero<00:03:00.480> we<00:03:01.020> throwed<00:03:01.320> a

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
so now we see there's zero we throwed a

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.320 
so now we see there's zero we throwed a
light<00:03:01.650> sensor<00:03:01.920> which<00:03:02.550> isn't<00:03:02.850> too<00:03:03.000> hard<00:03:03.210> to

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
light sensor which isn't too hard to

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.330 
light sensor which isn't too hard to
make<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:03.810> we<00:03:04.350> got<00:03:04.700> 5050<00:03:06.680> which<00:03:07.680> is<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.890> good

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
make and we got 5050 which is a good

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.480 
make and we got 5050 which is a good
ratio<00:03:09.200> amount<00:03:10.200> of<00:03:10.290> supply<00:03:10.560> this<00:03:11.220> is

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:11.490 
ratio amount of supply this is

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.990 
ratio amount of supply this is
definitely<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:12.120> best<00:03:12.360> one<00:03:12.750> because<00:03:14.000> there's

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
definitely the best one because there's

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.370 
definitely the best one because there's
an<00:03:15.120> item<00:03:15.330> called<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.600> magic<00:03:15.900> fabricator

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
an item called the magic fabricator

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:22.370 
an item called the magic fabricator
which<00:03:16.560> can<00:03:16.740> make<00:03:19.220> gold<00:03:20.220> out<00:03:21.090> of<00:03:21.150> out<00:03:21.720> of<00:03:21.780> golden

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
which can make gold out of out of golden

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.750 
which can make gold out of out of golden
nuggets<00:03:22.760> so<00:03:23.760> you<00:03:23.820> put<00:03:24.090> that<00:03:24.270> in<00:03:24.480> and<00:03:25.580> and<00:03:26.580> you

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
nuggets so you put that in and and you

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.840 
nuggets so you put that in and and you
can<00:03:26.910> see<00:03:27.090> we've<00:03:27.270> gotten<00:03:27.630> about<00:03:29.270> 10,000<00:03:30.270> ish

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
can see we've gotten about 10,000 ish

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.690 
can see we've gotten about 10,000 ish
8060<00:03:33.830> another<00:03:34.830> one<00:03:35.010> is<00:03:35.130> another<00:03:35.340> brick

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
8060 another one is another brick

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.580 
8060 another one is another brick
because<00:03:36.270> I<00:03:36.450> think<00:03:36.540> they<00:03:36.870> haven't<00:03:37.200> changed<00:03:37.440> the

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
because I think they haven't changed the

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.710 
because I think they haven't changed the
point<00:03:37.830> value<00:03:37.890> since<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.580> weren't<00:03:38.730> originally

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
point value since you weren't originally

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.600 
point value since you weren't originally
you<00:03:40.050> weren't<00:03:40.260> able<00:03:40.380> to<00:03:40.710> smell<00:03:40.980> nether<00:03:41.310> brick

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
you weren't able to smell nether brick

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:47.000 
you weren't able to smell nether brick
or<00:03:41.970> another<00:03:42.390> rack<00:03:44.420> or<00:03:45.500> yeah<00:03:46.500> you<00:03:46.560> weren't<00:03:46.800> able

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
or another rack or yeah you weren't able

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.340 
or another rack or yeah you weren't able
to<00:03:47.220> smell<00:03:47.459> netherrack<00:03:48.000> like<00:03:48.300> netherrack<00:03:49.050> like

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.470 
to smell netherrack like netherrack like
this<00:03:49.530> in<00:03:49.680> another<00:03:49.800> bricks<00:03:50.220> so<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:51.240> had<00:03:51.390> to

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
this in another bricks so you had to

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.910
