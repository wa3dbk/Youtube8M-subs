and you're just going to stick that

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:34.320 
and you're just going to stick that
right<00:02:27.190> under<00:02:29.489> your<00:02:30.489> black<00:02:30.910> piece<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:34.030> make

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
right under your black piece and make

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.710 
right under your black piece and make
sure<00:02:34.360> they<00:02:34.630> kind<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:34.930> match<00:02:35.080> up<00:02:35.320> right<00:02:36.160> there

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
sure they kind of match up right there

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.000 
sure they kind of match up right there
and<00:02:37.720> then<00:02:38.620> this<00:02:38.920> goes<00:02:39.340> on<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:41.590> your<00:02:41.860> Bermuda

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
and then this goes on to your Bermuda

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:50.040 
and then this goes on to your Bermuda
Bay<00:02:42.370> piece<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.760> then<00:02:48.970> that<00:02:49.270> goes<00:02:49.450> on<00:02:49.720> to<00:02:49.959> the

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
Bay piece and then that goes on to the

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.460 
Bay piece and then that goes on to the
blush<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:52.120> reason<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.450> chose<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.870> do<00:02:53.350> the

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
blush and the reason I chose to do the

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.199 
blush and the reason I chose to do the
card<00:02:53.680> this<00:02:53.860> way<00:02:54.100> is<00:02:54.340> because<00:02:54.520> I<00:02:54.820> don't<00:02:55.030> like

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
card this way is because I don't like

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.140 
card this way is because I don't like
having<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:56.020> dark<00:02:56.739> piece<00:02:56.950> of<00:02:57.100> card<00:02:57.340> stock<00:02:57.400> as<00:02:57.790> my
