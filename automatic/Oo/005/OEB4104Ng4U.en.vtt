want them to be nice long and good you

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.000 
want them to be nice long and good you
need<00:02:32.690> to<00:02:32.870> just<00:02:33.019> soak<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.409> rice<00:02:33.500> for<00:02:33.769> at<00:02:33.860> least

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
need to just soak the rice for at least

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.339 
need to just soak the rice for at least
30<00:02:34.340> minutes<00:02:34.430> sometimes<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.480> soak<00:02:35.690> even<00:02:36.019> for<00:02:36.170> one

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
30 minutes sometimes I soak even for one

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.660 
30 minutes sometimes I soak even for one
hour<00:02:36.379> and<00:02:36.790> now<00:02:37.790> I'm<00:02:38.569> going<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:38.989> just<00:02:39.859> mix<00:02:40.430> this

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
hour and now I'm going to just mix this

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.809 
hour and now I'm going to just mix this
once<00:02:41.470> okay

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
once okay

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.490 
once okay
since<00:02:43.819> the<00:02:44.000> rice<00:02:44.150> quantity<00:02:44.659> is<00:02:44.780> less<00:02:45.019> I<00:02:45.290> have

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
since the rice quantity is less I have

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.069 
since the rice quantity is less I have
taken<00:02:45.799> 1<00:02:46.220> is<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.489> 2<00:02:46.639> so<00:02:47.060> 1<00:02:47.329> cup<00:02:47.480> of<00:02:47.629> rice<00:02:47.780> 2<00:02:48.049> cups

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
taken 1 is to 2 so 1 cup of rice 2 cups

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.250 
taken 1 is to 2 so 1 cup of rice 2 cups
of<00:02:48.349> water<00:02:48.530> as<00:02:48.799> the<00:02:49.269> amount<00:02:50.269> of<00:02:50.359> rice<00:02:50.629> increases

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
of water as the amount of rice increases

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.770 
of water as the amount of rice increases
the<00:02:51.769> amount<00:02:52.069> of<00:02:52.250> water<00:02:52.579> decreases<00:02:52.879> so<00:02:53.389> going

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
the amount of water decreases so going

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.479 
the amount of water decreases so going
to<00:02:53.840> put<00:02:54.049> the<00:02:54.170> lid<00:02:54.290> on<00:02:54.409> and<00:02:54.590> I<00:02:55.010> am<00:02:55.069> going<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.310> let

going to let it rest like that for 4 or
5<00:03:42.739> minutes<00:03:42.919> because<00:03:43.669> of<00:03:43.959> so<00:03:44.959> that<00:03:45.139> the

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
5 minutes because of so that the

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.470 
5 minutes because of so that the
moisture<00:03:45.739> that<00:03:46.040> is<00:03:46.340> there<00:03:46.549> will<00:03:46.970> be<00:03:47.120> absorbed

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
moisture that is there will be absorbed

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.330 
moisture that is there will be absorbed
by<00:03:47.569> the<00:03:47.629> rice<00:03:47.810> and<00:03:48.079> it<00:03:48.530> will<00:03:48.620> become<00:03:48.859> perfect

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
by the rice and it will become perfect

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.390 
by the rice and it will become perfect
now<00:03:49.699> after<00:03:50.359> resting<00:03:51.169> for<00:03:51.230> 5<00:03:51.650> minutes<00:03:52.069> look<00:03:52.280> at

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
now after resting for 5 minutes look at

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.059 
now after resting for 5 minutes look at
this<00:03:52.519> rice<00:03:52.760> look<00:03:53.750> at<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:54.109> way<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:54.829> basmati

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
this rice look at the way the basmati

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.750 
this rice look at the way the basmati
rice<00:03:55.370> is<00:03:55.760> you<00:03:56.510> know<00:03:56.599> slightly<00:03:57.459> turned<00:03:58.459> its

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
rice is you know slightly turned its

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.379 
rice is you know slightly turned its
shape<00:03:59.209> and<00:03:59.560> this<00:04:00.560> is<00:04:00.739> what<00:04:01.040> makes<00:04:01.879> this<00:04:02.120> rice

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
shape and this is what makes this rice

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:06.159 
shape and this is what makes this rice
perfect<00:04:03.199> look<00:04:03.349> at<00:04:03.470> this<00:04:03.590> each<00:04:04.340> grain<00:04:04.760> is<00:04:05.169> like

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.169 
perfect look at this each grain is like

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:09.580 
perfect look at this each grain is like
a<00:04:06.199> pearl<00:04:06.590> but<00:04:07.629> individually<00:04:08.629> they<00:04:08.840> cooked<00:04:09.199> so
