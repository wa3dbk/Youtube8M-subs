00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.990
 falsifying matches 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.590
 according to qualities 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.979
 PSV was not good 

00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:11.679
 it was all welcome 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.739
 this year there were still all competitions 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:15.610
 the best from the bus 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.070
 with two faces for the two pieces with the band from Volendam 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:22.269
 what else can you do 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:25.109
 it just wasn't a soccer player to look at 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.399
 here will roda jc 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.259
 that is a bit more because of perseverance, making it a hit 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.220
 of the name 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.530
 I have this new device, but what do you bump into 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.060
 for everyone 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.090
 do radio 2 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.270
 alice this measure 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:47.780
 at the team 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.780
 after months I am a bad idea 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.450
 rommedahl and of course everything was equally 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.630
 final stage 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.020
 single balcony 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.020
 this musical just before the rest of van basts 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.920
 by people from the accident 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.580
 Monday was restless 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.340
 cola light up inside 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.340
 the share was one of the three suspects 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.750
 the all-time report 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.300
 which was also very good 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.050
 i would have son in two months 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.320
 but I for 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.590
 and but oh so 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.510
 I thought urby emanuelson was true 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.010
 four of these are not sufficient for time on 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.750
 is in preparation 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.870
 it all best 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.690
 but 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.880
 that goal came true 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.830
 the parties 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.570
 I thought that was nice 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.540
 the reporter in action action for a good follow-up 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.010
 of course he watches a few riders playing balls 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.010
 the attacker who has been making a lot of noise in recent months 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.600
 it is on the way 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.960
 get rid of the typhoon that immediately ticks 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.380
 I ask myself anyway 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.380
 the station but nothing 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.330
 what did you think of that action was chartered under the direction of 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.330
 but that for very good 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.769
 I also say no 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:19.179
 the tone is set 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:21.449
 the iconic dwindling psv 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:22.950
 yes the previous one when skating 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.549
 writing out the drawing board 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:26.769
 I'm in love 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:29.769
 some respect along and then you actually already sign up 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:31.989
 you often do not see 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.989
 pauli us 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:38.889
 moreover, had run 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.879
 what is possible with the pvv 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.879
 david ferrer 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.879
 chip manufacturers 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:47.169
 what do you expect from our people that kind of guests 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:48.449
 I hope we win 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:51.239
 falls that we want us for sure 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.089
 recipes that again strong and not 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:56.509
 she would then play at home 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.859
 maybe a little better 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.029
 afterwards always made good can sing 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:01.359
 just look in recent years 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.359
 we play against the wkz he plays 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:07.939
 a draw 0 0 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:11.189
 belga it sets itself 

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:12.329
 may hope not succeeded 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.349
 in the program this is the day
