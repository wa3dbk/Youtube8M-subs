00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:14.449
 so how to gain confidence in centered 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.580
 on the digital tool 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.259
 so it's true that on a pipe 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.150
 for example a voice like a pipe 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:22.430
 it's starting to be a little bit 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.910
 difficult especially at the start especially for 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:25.390
 the beginner 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.279
 we'll say it's a little bit 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.439
 discouraging sometimes to start on 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.300
 this tool is where it's better to 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.589
 still having a nice of 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.360
 can draw directly on the screen 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:37.309
 but well not everyone knew that this 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.440
 and it is true that at the beginning we are well 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.379
 obliged to go through a whole nature 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.480
 tablet of the kind so personally 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.489
 I configured my style and way to 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.300
 what can I do a z check 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.289
 ie go back just to 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.510
 my index level 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.859
 so it's pretty handy and you go 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.039
 see that often I come back 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:59.829
 to make a straight line or more 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.850
 sharper 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.250
 so at the level of trust in 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.479
 So show but of course it's going 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.340
 work and with time so that's it 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.690
 has no secrets but by cons there is 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.640
 two techniques that works well so 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.170
 of course it's the control technique 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.819
 z that's what I'm going to explain to you 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.140
 that is, when you want 

00:01:13.819 --> 00:01:17.780
 go back you are not 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:21.289
 satisfied that allows you to draw from a 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.479
 shot of one and say to oneself 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:27.619
 Well, I missed it so I'll be back 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.840
 so sometimes it's going to take you ten 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.819
 or fifteen times the same trait before 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.750
 to have a pretty neat line as if 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:37.789
 as if you are working on paper and 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.310
 the second technique is the technique 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.590
 of the ghost train ie before 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.819
 to trace show I train my wrist 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.039
 I train members age training 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.920
 brain to trace the traits before the 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.770
 do it on paper or on the tablet 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.479
 digital then it's exactly the same 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.840
 technique on paper than on the tablet 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.360
 graph makes you a trait and you 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.069
 will often see in my videos I do 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.929
 a line I come back I make a line I 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.569
 come back but not really touched 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:12.050
 the surface so it really allows me 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:15.319
 to train and memorize the movement 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.510
 just and then trace it to me that 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.579
 allows me to avoid having them all 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.760
 mistakes and not to lose too much 

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:24.739
 too much time in the end so the movements 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.480
 ghost is something that we 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.950
 practice instinctively there are already 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.519
 people who do it before I sleep 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.049
 I explained to them the technique well 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.879
 sure because I started like this 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.640
 so I do it instinctively 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.890
 now I explained it to people but 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.840
 it's true that not everyone does it 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.299
 so I prefer to say it in case 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.170
 it's a technique that works so much 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.170
 to do so much to enjoy 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:54.140
 so there you have seen so I use a 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.650
 layer below my anchor for 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.329
 quickly make a sketch for for 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.870
 establish the main forms and 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:04.879
 then I go to 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.510
 at the anchor or a second fat that by 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:10.250
 on it so what makes all my 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.890
 big mistakes will have been made in the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.379
 little sketch below and when I 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:20.319
 go to the final version between 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:23.090
 Quotation is even cleaner 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.730
 so here I'm showing a technique of 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.650
 Pure drawing is not the technique of 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.049
 real speed painter real 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.519
 concepts artists often concepts 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.530
 artists does not start with a drawing 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.269
 or so it's a little bit rarer 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:37.040
 in the world of artists concepts on 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.720
 will rather destined in volume any of 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.560
 next we will rather destiny in flat 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.930
 then in volume 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.370
 we work immediately light in 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.840
 general we work by silhouette 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.739
 so that's what I'm going to do 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.239
 show in the next video but you 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.290
 can do both techniques of 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.709
 anyway what matters is the 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.629
 result 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.450
 if you do not arrive faster with a 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.140
 trait does the traits if you arrive 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.629
 faster 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.109
 instinctively with silhouettes and 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:04.819
 direct volumes made the whole of 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:08.410
 so there is no rule that is 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.099
 it's the result that told in the end 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:11.599
 personally I am comfortable with 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.950
 both techniques but it's true that 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.099
 I do a lot more drawings at 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:19.430
 so that's because I have 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:22.310
 always admired the animators and I 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.570
 I'm always steeped in everything 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.760
 who is comic etc 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.310
 but by cons I also use the 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.590
 technical artist concepts because 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.110
 that because I use a little bit the 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:37.490
 everybody's technique so I try 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:41.680
 I always tried to take the 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.630
 best of all to arrive 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.100
 always further in my level and 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:50.070
 it is true that I advise you to 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:53.490
 do a little bit tested things from 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.240
 to try to noise to enrich you 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:59.850
 to enrich your technical directory 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.850
 always looking further 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.260
 there you saw that I pose a small 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.750
 quick calculation so layers the 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.090
 so I use a layer where I put in 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.260
 doubt a fairly light gray another 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.220
 call that I like grilled a little more 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:22.170
 dark and I work with one 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.990
 soft brush and then there now I 

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:28.410
 works that a brush lasts so that 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.970
 gives a kind of facts of which brawn 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.120
 is of form 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:36.930
 so it's pretty aesthetic but I'm going 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:39.720
 quickly so that's where I froze 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:43.980
 I put the video twice as fast 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.930
 to not waste time but that's 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.320
 airlocks and sketches that take me 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:52.110
 no more than ten minutes in general 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:54.180
 so do not be discouraged it does not take 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.250
 a long time before using it 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.680
 correctly the graphics tablet and he 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.760
 there is absolutely no magic in there 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.130
 you will see that it is not at all 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:04.080
 simple not only it's not easy 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.490
 but we think it's simple when we 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.660
 arrives on the tablet we do wes 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.690
 finally bah no actually it's 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:11.550
 really not simple so do not you 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.760
 do not be discouraged stay motivated and 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.780
 continue to work 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.890
 so the hardest with the digital tool 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.860
 it's not to get lost because there is 

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.660
 so many options and things to 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:23.340
 use I advise you to use 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:25.860
 no more than three pins I you 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.920
 advise to use no more than 2 5 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.540
 colors at the beginning it's very important 

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.280
 and if you want to work in levels 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:35.630
 of gray maybe it's even a big 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:38.280
 better to use the tools at the beginning 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.710
 it is not by chance that I 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.950
 say that because I have a lot 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:47.030
 a lot much drooled at the start so 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.030
 do not go too fast 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:53.850
 here I have also concocted a 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.740
 little video about speed painting 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:59.030
 so I leave you click on the image 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.030
 to skip the next video
