 u2 well, in this video I bring you 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.669
 the review of a great texture called 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.669
 bain 64 x 64 + shaders and as well as 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:23.880
 they hear is the same texture of find full 64 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:26.099
 by 64 hd but unlike this one 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.710
 contains shaders this texture was 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.169
 published four or five days ago and 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.210
 command me if I remember correctly but good 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.190
 I had not brought them the review because I did not 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.780
 I had been able but good now I bring you 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.220
 what would be the review because 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.739
 the truth that is one of the best 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.899
 textures that I've seen and if you like what 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.000
 that would be the shaders and this 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.739
 texture I recommend you here they go to 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.140
 be seeing things in the inventory 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.809
 they look very, very cool they look more 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.640
 hd etcetera and well I wanted to tell you 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.680
 that the link and everything will be down here 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.600
 in the description of the video and then if 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.699
 nothing more to say let's move on with the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.410
 installation of this texture and good 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.690
 friends I know that many know how 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.610
 install it but if I do not tell you many it 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.440
 They get angry because I do not explain how they 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.539
 they install the textures but well we're going to 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.890
 start simply download it here 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:13.140
 down in the description of the video you 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.940
 I'll leave a download link once 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.530

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.570
 from escom 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.340
 and when there is already it is decompressed 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.020
 you go to the blog launcher that I think already 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.360
 everyone has it if you can not go to 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.830
 look for it in some video on youtube and 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.020
 well, once it has already been opened 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.880
 the blog launcher you're just going to 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.440
 give in the key a way that they are in 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.570
 the key if you are going to be given options 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.550
 of blogs and requires reboot go to 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.320
 pressing there will activate what would come 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.780
 being the texture package option 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.610

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.070

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.140
 folder where they have decompressed it and 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.330

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.050
