 we are one more day and today we are in my 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.300
 desktop as you see I have a background 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.219
 super special I did yesterday special 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.460
 with xe I already invented the words and everything 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.990
 this blog I did yesterday to continue gathering 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.920
 frikis world 3 geeks world 2 and geeks 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.180
 walk 1 with the background of 2 and 3 and what 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.220
 you have below in the description if 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.039
 you want I did it yesterday someone somebody 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.320
 I download it on twitter and there by 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.179
 We're cool background then what will 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.480
 do today today is the tutorial of how 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.760
 play the mods pack of frikis world 3 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.610
 I have everything fully prepared so that 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.280
 it's very easy and very easy to install 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:45.090
 this pack is that this video is 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:47.520
 totally useful and iv and iii and iv easy 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.379
 especially easy because there are some that 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.789
 Well, they have no idea how to install mods 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.070
 it is evident there not everyone knows 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.890
 then it's going to be very simple 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.989
 the description will have four links 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.930
 for download it's worth these four 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.340
 forge links that are the geeks ue 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.250
 motorcycles of geeks world 3 that was the 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.840
 Largest file and they are 100 100 megabytes 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.929
 the largest file 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.090
 mb the map of geeks world 3 that are 10 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:13.770
 mb and the confis that are houses so 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.270
 nothing you are not going to have anything I have put 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.369
 The forge also included so that 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.640
 you have to look for anything better but 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.250
 well I'm going to do an easy tutorial but 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.200
 fast because it's something simple or not 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.329
 it requires a lot more I have the folder here 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.250
 Minecraft point with nothing this one is empty 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:34.560
 then what you need in minecraft 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.959
 1.7 point 10 1.7 point 10 I do not know how it is 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.479
 in pirate and to you there you look for the 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:41.549
 version I do not know how it will be but the 1.7 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.259
 point 10 of agreement for those who have 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.799
 premium because it's simple and you put it 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.959
 here version 1.7 point 10 and nothing to 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.489
 darning shit with a whip but the 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:52.679
 other then that you look for those who do not 

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:54.479
 you have minecraft you look for the 1.7 point 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.829
 10 will be simple because there are many people 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.399
 that plays so I do not think it's very 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.899
 difficult is worth once we have the 1.7 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.579
 points as you see what is installing for 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.649
 that you see step by step what you have to 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.689
 do without having main even create 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.170
 right now we do not have minecraft now 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.970
 this is 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.910
 We are installing the minecraft once 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.410
 that is finished installing is already and 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.440
 As you can see , the 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.700
 folders worth here we already have minecraft 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.099
 as you see has opened minecraft what 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.569
 we close it's ok because we're going now this 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.910
 Once we go for the force hey that you 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:29.380
 I have here the files you can remember 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.580
 pull out right here on the desk and to 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.390
 here we have the force that we have the 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.100
 this 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.860
 we install the forge as it is installed 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:38.500
 easy to open urges the customer in the 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.569
 folder the route you change if you have it 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.850
 in another folder if you have it in the point 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:46.000
 maiker by you give him and it is already worth here 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:48.310
 is installing in the forge for 1.7 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.569
 point 10 the version that ends in 30 os 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.370
 I put this one because it 's the one that's 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.650
 he read so I prefer it to be all the same 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.360
 just in case there is some problem so 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.940
 good once you finish installing 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.580
 this will have to open minecraft again 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.910
 I do not know how it will be in pirate I guess 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.130
 same you give him and open with him forge and already 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.280
 is chávez you give from here 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:14.049
 I guess I do not know I'm sorry but I do not know 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:16.200
 but ramón install very easy does not have 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.200
 plus 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.549
 to see if this ends 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.230
 it also takes a little bit that is 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.450
 true and more when I'm recording to the 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.760
 It's a bit there but it does not take long 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.049
 nothing is worth there is we already have this 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.150
 install as you see, nothing has changed 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:35.299
 it's just to open minecraft again and 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.430
 open it but with the forge since here it 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.469
 will have generated a new 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.780
 and I do not know how the boats will be 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:43.549
 of pirates I'm really sorry no longer 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.870
 you know that I do not support piracy if 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.689
 you are because you can not have 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.760
 minecraft is what it is but not 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:51.590
 I can do more, I do not install it 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.870
 never pirate so I do not know it's worth here 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.239
 we already have the forum installed because 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.799
 have opened the force that is installed 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.019
 all folders and have already changed 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:01.310
 well this is very simple what 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.219
 you have to do now and you do not have to 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.299
 to do anything I practically did 

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:07.549
 bet for that 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:09.260
 in motorcycles frikis world 3 there is a folder 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:11.000
 which is called mods, it is not necessary 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.889
 you open it, take that folder and put it in 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.669
 inside 

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:15.709
 Obviously it will take a little time in 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:17.239
 this but it will take a lot of time already 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.859
 we have all the mods are 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.449
 personalized per thousand already know that 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.789
 some bikes have I changed the 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:24.530
 textures and such that are the mods of 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.910
 miseries and that are perfect with the 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.360
 text and so that you can play without it 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.389
 but 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.800
 since you are playing with him because he does not 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:34.500
 take any problem 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.050
 is worth the following the config the conflict 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.030
 the same thing we have a config folder with 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.310
 two files the only thing that you have to 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.159
 to do is to move this one that has the 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:47.610
 confines of all the mods we replace 

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:50.129
 the files is already we have the 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.229
 config we already have the motor pack 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:54.990
 fully installed that is not necessary 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:57.750
 nothing else but if you want the map very 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:01.249
 simple put this in you know and it is already 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:03.199
 to now we open the minecraft 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:05.359
 As you can see, nothing has taken me 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:08.389
 It took five minutes to install them 

00:05:05.359 --> 00:05:09.559
 not least because I'm explaining that if 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.909
 it's not worth we open it with him because 

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.139
 evidently from now on always 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:14.179
 that we want to play you have to open it with 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:17.689
 the forge obviously because it's the one 

00:05:14.179 --> 00:05:19.969
 makes the mods work then a 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:22.759
 Once opened it will take a little longer in 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:25.519
 open this time because because it will be 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:28.100
 catching the mods and such the first time 

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:32.210
 it is logical 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:34.250
 it is logical that evening is also worth as 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.410
 I said it does not take long as I said 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:39.020
 apart from these four links that you are going to 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.210
 have you going to have the wallpaper this the 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.070
 background if you want it if you like what 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.360
 you have there to download it also and 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.370
 You are also going to have the texture pac 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.840
 in case you want to play it with the text I 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.210
 I recommend it because it is done bet 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.129
 for that, all the aesthetics you have chosen 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.069
 I 'm made for that erpac text 

00:05:54.129 --> 00:05:58.659
 so good if you can do it you can 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:01.060
 do what 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:04.060
 without any more come open man 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:10.199
 It's worth it as you can see, it's already 45 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:10.199
 mods frikis world 3 you open it and that's it 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.170
 come on 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.050
 and there it is 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:25.060
 As you can see I'm here, you'll see it in 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:27.100
 little I do not imagine but good 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.900
 everything is changed as you see the part of 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.360
 up is also with my colors with 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.510

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:38.110

 Enjoy it especially that you spend 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.530
 ok with the pack of mods so nothing 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:54.389
