hey<00:00:03.030> Jessica<00:00:03.449> it's<00:00:03.600> Katie<00:00:03.840> I<00:00:03.959> thought<00:00:04.170> rather

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
hey Jessica it's Katie I thought rather

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.840 
hey Jessica it's Katie I thought rather
than<00:00:04.589> writing<00:00:04.920> out<00:00:05.130> instructions<00:00:05.460> would<00:00:05.790> be

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
than writing out instructions would be

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.780 
than writing out instructions would be
easier<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.270> show<00:00:06.540> you<00:00:06.950> how<00:00:07.950> to<00:00:08.010> make<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.460> cds

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
easier to show you how to make the cds

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.140 
easier to show you how to make the cds
and<00:00:09.030> what<00:00:09.150> goes<00:00:09.330> into<00:00:09.480> them<00:00:09.719> um<00:00:10.469> I<00:00:11.219> pulled<00:00:11.969> this

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
and what goes into them um I pulled this

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.810 
and what goes into them um I pulled this
one<00:00:12.420> here<00:00:12.780> because<00:00:13.190> we<00:00:14.190> should<00:00:14.400> be<00:00:14.519> able<00:00:14.610> to

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
one here because we should be able to

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.109 
one here because we should be able to
see<00:00:15.470> definitely<00:00:16.470> hear<00:00:16.890> how<00:00:17.039> there's<00:00:17.250> this

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
see definitely hear how there's this

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.019 
see definitely hear how there's this
extra<00:00:18.600> adhesive<00:00:19.160> you'll<00:00:20.160> come<00:00:20.340> across<00:00:20.490> some

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
extra adhesive you'll come across some

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.870 
extra adhesive you'll come across some
to<00:00:21.330> where<00:00:21.510> you'll<00:00:21.720> have<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.109> trim<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.470> down

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
to where you'll have to trim it down

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.640 
to where you'll have to trim it down
which<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.000> really<00:00:24.449> straightforward<00:00:25.080> and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
which is really straightforward and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.259 
which is really straightforward and
simple<00:00:25.830> you<00:00:26.160> just<00:00:26.189> take<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:26.789> follow<00:00:27.029> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
simple you just take and you follow the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.560 
simple you just take and you follow the
line<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.630> paper<00:00:28.130> with<00:00:29.130> scissors<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.510> you

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
line of the paper with scissors and you

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.650 
line of the paper with scissors and you
can<00:00:30.720> trim<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.019> adhesive<00:00:31.439> off<00:00:31.590> um<00:00:32.570> something<00:00:33.570> I

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
can trim the adhesive off um something I

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.900 
can trim the adhesive off um something I
talk<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.020> about<00:00:34.079> before<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.710> terms<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
talk to you about before in terms of the

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.500 
talk to you about before in terms of the
need<00:00:36.120> for<00:00:36.360> double<00:00:36.630> stick<00:00:36.840> tape<00:00:38.300> for<00:00:39.300> there

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
need for double stick tape for there

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.030 
need for double stick tape for there
will<00:00:39.690> be<00:00:39.809> some<00:00:40.050> edges<00:00:40.410> where<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.680> adhesive

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
will be some edges where the adhesive

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.470 
will be some edges where the adhesive
doesn't<00:00:41.340> quite<00:00:41.520> come<00:00:41.760> based<00:00:42.059> on<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> length

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
doesn't quite come based on the length

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.209 
doesn't quite come based on the length
of<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.719> adhesive<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.739> there<00:00:43.920> are<00:00:44.040> a<00:00:44.070> couple

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
of the adhesive so there are a couple

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.910 
of the adhesive so there are a couple
options<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:45.030> can<00:00:45.180> do<00:00:45.559> you<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:46.620> either

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
options you can do you can either

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.040 
options you can do you can either
purchase<00:00:47.160> double<00:00:47.700> stick<00:00:47.879> tape<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.329> little<00:00:48.899> bit

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
purchase double stick tape a little bit

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.400 
purchase double stick tape a little bit
of<00:00:49.170> glue<00:00:49.469> or<00:00:50.300> what<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.329> did<00:00:51.629> with<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:51.960> one<00:00:52.020> is

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
of glue or what I did with this one is

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.860 
of glue or what I did with this one is
the<00:00:53.190> excess<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:53.879> trimmed<00:00:54.210> off<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.629> this

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
the excess that was trimmed off of this

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.889 
the excess that was trimmed off of this
side<00:00:55.170> over<00:00:55.379> here<00:00:55.820> fits<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.090> works<00:00:57.120> perfectly

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
side over here fits and works perfectly

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.549 
side over here fits and works perfectly
as<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.739> use<00:00:58.980> for<00:00:59.190> an<00:00:59.309> adhesive<00:00:59.820> over<00:01:00.149> here<00:01:00.559> so

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
as a use for an adhesive over here so

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.369 
as a use for an adhesive over here so
the<00:01:02.370> first<00:01:02.640> step<00:01:03.000> was<00:01:03.840> what<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.049> just<00:01:04.290> showed

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the first step was what I just showed

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.410 
the first step was what I just showed
you<00:01:04.619> which<00:01:04.799> was<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.100> trimming<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.640> there's

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
you which was the trimming if there's

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.450 
you which was the trimming if there's
any<00:01:06.570> excess<00:01:07.080> adhesive<00:01:07.500> there's<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.130> lot<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.280> the

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
any excess adhesive there's a lot of the

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.740 
any excess adhesive there's a lot of the
ones<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.729> are<00:01:08.880> already<00:01:09.000> prepped<00:01:09.390> already

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
ones that are already prepped already

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.240 
ones that are already prepped already
and<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.930> made<00:01:10.080> sure<00:01:10.110> there's<00:01:10.409> adhesive<00:01:10.830> on<00:01:10.979> all

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
and I made sure there's adhesive on all

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.810 
and I made sure there's adhesive on all
of<00:01:11.460> them<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:12.420> all<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.840> have<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:13.170> do<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.820> make

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
of them so all you have to do is make

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.039 
of them so all you have to do is make
sure<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.090> they're<00:01:15.420> trimmed<00:01:15.720> around<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
sure that they're trimmed around the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.420 
sure that they're trimmed around the
edges<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.830> don't<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.189> worry<00:01:17.340> about

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
edges you don't have to worry about

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.960 
edges you don't have to worry about
these<00:01:18.049> tops<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.380> bottom<00:01:19.740> edges<00:01:19.970> because

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
these tops and bottom edges because

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.969 
these tops and bottom edges because
those<00:01:21.540> will<00:01:21.659> get<00:01:21.840> cut<00:01:22.049> off<00:01:22.200> later<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:22.799> just

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
those will get cut off later so just

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.130 
those will get cut off later so just
make<00:01:23.159> sure<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.369> these<00:01:23.759> two<00:01:24.150> side<00:01:24.479> edges<00:01:24.780> are

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
make sure that these two side edges are

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.550 
make sure that these two side edges are
what<00:01:25.439> are<00:01:25.590> trimmed<00:01:26.100> flush<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.729> edge<00:01:27.560> and

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
what are trimmed flush with the edge and

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.010 
what are trimmed flush with the edge and
this<00:01:28.680> is<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.979> exact<00:01:29.400> width<00:01:30.210> that<00:01:30.600> you'll<00:01:30.840> need

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
this is the exact width that you'll need

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.550 
this is the exact width that you'll need
it<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.320> be<00:01:31.500> so<00:01:32.460> then<00:01:32.900> after<00:01:33.900> you've<00:01:34.049> taken<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
it to be so then after you've taken and

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.740 
it to be so then after you've taken and
trimmed<00:01:34.829> down<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.159> adhesive<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.299> next<00:01:36.570> thing

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
trimmed down the adhesive the next thing

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.210 
trimmed down the adhesive the next thing
that<00:01:36.780> you'll<00:01:37.079> do<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.439> you'll<00:01:37.470> take<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.189> a

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
that you'll do is you'll take it to a

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.569 
that you'll do is you'll take it to a
paper<00:01:38.670> cutter<00:01:39.259> which<00:01:40.259> got<00:01:41.130> right<00:01:41.430> here<00:01:43.579> all

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
paper cutter which got right here all

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.550 
paper cutter which got right here all
right<00:01:44.759> so<00:01:45.299> then<00:01:45.509> after<00:01:45.869> you've<00:01:46.049> made<00:01:46.259> sure<00:01:46.439> to

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
right so then after you've made sure to

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.590 
right so then after you've made sure to
trim<00:01:46.799> off<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.670> excess<00:01:48.000> edge<00:01:48.210> you're<00:01:48.420> going<00:01:48.540> to

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
trim off the excess edge you're going to

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.840 
trim off the excess edge you're going to
bring<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> cutting<00:01:49.320> board<00:01:49.560> like<00:01:49.770> this

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
bring it to a cutting board like this

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.910 
bring it to a cutting board like this
there<00:01:50.850> are<00:01:50.880> little<00:01:51.270> lines<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:52.590> you'll<00:01:52.799> be

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
there are little lines that you'll be

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.289 
there are little lines that you'll be
able<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.189> see<00:01:53.549> when<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:53.820> actually<00:01:53.970> are

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
able to see when you actually are

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.340 
able to see when you actually are
holding<00:01:54.570> these<00:01:54.659> are<00:01:54.810> not<00:01:54.930> sure<00:01:55.079> how<00:01:55.110> well

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
holding these are not sure how well

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.690 
holding these are not sure how well
they'll<00:01:55.500> come<00:01:55.770> over<00:01:55.979> on<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.189> camera<00:01:56.520> but

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
they'll come over on the camera but

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.280 
they'll come over on the camera but
those<00:01:57.210> are<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.360> lines<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.689> you<00:01:57.810> trim<00:01:58.110> them

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
those are the lines that you trim them

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.560 
those are the lines that you trim them
to<00:01:58.500> and<00:01:59.130> what<00:01:59.340> these<00:01:59.460> will<00:01:59.670> be<00:01:59.790> is<00:02:00.060> actually

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
to and what these will be is actually

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.420 
to and what these will be is actually
five<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> half<00:02:01.079> inch<00:02:01.380> square<00:02:01.890> when<00:02:02.159> you<00:02:02.250> cut

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
five and a half inch square when you cut

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.679 
five and a half inch square when you cut
them<00:02:02.579> down<00:02:02.610> initially<00:02:03.000> because<00:02:03.509> we'll<00:02:03.659> be

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
them down initially because we'll be

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.959 
them down initially because we'll be
taking<00:02:04.110> more<00:02:04.290> off<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.710> top<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.920> bottom<00:02:05.219> so

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
taking more off the top and bottom so

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.219 
taking more off the top and bottom so
all<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.149> really<00:02:06.390> have<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.659> worry<00:02:06.899> about<00:02:07.020> is

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
all you really have to worry about is

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.719 
all you really have to worry about is
just<00:02:07.320> making<00:02:07.680> sure<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.099> cut<00:02:08.280> these<00:02:08.429> five

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
just making sure that you cut these five

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.760 
just making sure that you cut these five
and<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> half<00:02:09.000> inches<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.690> there<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.470> little

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
and a half inches and there is a little

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.710 
and a half inches and there is a little
excess<00:02:11.129> that's<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.489> between

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
excess that's in between

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.200 
excess that's in between
but<00:02:13.590> that's<00:02:13.800> no<00:02:14.040> problem<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:14.700> long<00:02:14.880> as<00:02:15.090> you

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
but that's no problem so long as you

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.030 
but that's no problem so long as you
remember<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.750> use<00:02:15.930> those<00:02:16.230> lines<00:02:16.620> as<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:16.950> guide

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
remember to use those lines as a guide

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.510 
remember to use those lines as a guide
you'll<00:02:17.970> be<00:02:18.150> fine<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:19.380> because<00:02:20.250> they<00:02:20.370> pick

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
you'll be fine so because they pick

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.370 
you'll be fine so because they pick
another<00:02:20.730> site<00:02:21.120> curl<00:02:21.420> using<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:21.870> paper<00:02:22.080> cutter

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
another site curl using a paper cutter

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.020 
another site curl using a paper cutter
like<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:23.010> like<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.980> flip<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.130> over<00:02:26.430> so<00:02:26.880> that

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
like this I like to flip it over so that

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.850 
like this I like to flip it over so that
the<00:02:27.570> curl<00:02:27.870> works<00:02:28.830> in<00:02:29.160> my<00:02:29.280> benefit<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:30.510> that's

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
the curl works in my benefit so that's

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.680 
the curl works in my benefit so that's
five<00:02:31.860> and<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.160> half<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:33.000> see<00:02:33.210> we've<00:02:33.390> got<00:02:33.420> this

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
five and a half and see we've got this

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.410 
five and a half and see we've got this
nice<00:02:33.930> trim<00:02:34.440> down<00:02:34.620> UT<00:02:35.610> sit<00:02:35.790> on<00:02:35.940> the<00:02:36.030> back<00:02:36.180> and

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
nice trim down UT sit on the back and

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.680 
nice trim down UT sit on the back and
then<00:02:37.350> we'll<00:02:38.130> just<00:02:38.310> continue<00:02:38.520> on<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.240> do<00:02:39.450> that

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
then we'll just continue on and do that

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.980 
then we'll just continue on and do that
this<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.890> here<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.610> then<00:02:42.180> go<00:02:42.390> over<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.810> other

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
this is here I then go over to the other

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:51.550 
this is here I then go over to the other
edge<00:02:43.770> and<00:02:45.440> trim<00:02:46.440> that<00:02:46.680> down<00:02:48.380> and<00:02:49.380> then<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:50.760> know

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
edge and trim that down and then I know

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.560 
edge and trim that down and then I know
because<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.590> those<00:02:52.800> guides<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:54.180> it's<00:02:54.420> a

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
because of those guides that it's a

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.570 
because of those guides that it's a
quarter<00:02:55.110> of<00:02:55.140> an<00:02:55.410> inch<00:02:55.590> in<00:02:56.130> from<00:02:56.630> each<00:02:57.630> side<00:02:58.580> so

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
quarter of an inch in from each side so

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.490 
quarter of an inch in from each side so
then<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.910> next<00:03:00.090> measurement<00:03:00.570> where<00:03:01.080> I<00:03:01.140> cut<00:03:01.380> it

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
then the next measurement where I cut it

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:08.060 
then the next measurement where I cut it
down<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.860> going<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.100> be<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:06.840> then<00:03:07.380> turn<00:03:08.040> it

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
down is going to be and then turn it

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.250 
down is going to be and then turn it
around<00:03:08.280> and<00:03:09.770> polish<00:03:10.770> it<00:03:10.980> off<00:03:12.140> making<00:03:13.140> the

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
around and polish it off making the

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.150 
around and polish it off making the
center<00:03:13.560> section<00:03:14.090> five<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.330> a<00:03:15.360> half<00:03:15.390> inches

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
center section five and a half inches

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:23.240 
center section five and a half inches
square<00:03:17.360> all<00:03:18.360> right<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:18.720> let's<00:03:18.980> take<00:03:19.980> these<00:03:22.250> and

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
square all right so let's take these and

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.280 
square all right so let's take these and
we<00:03:23.459> have<00:03:23.700> our<00:03:24.560> piece<00:03:25.560> which<00:03:25.769> is<00:03:25.920> the<00:03:26.070> front

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
we have our piece which is the front

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.470 
we have our piece which is the front
cover<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.620> back<00:03:28.800> and<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.160> inside<00:03:29.519> piece<00:03:29.760> and

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
cover the back and the inside piece and

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.880 
cover the back and the inside piece and
you're<00:03:30.570> going<00:03:30.660> to<00:03:30.720> turn<00:03:30.900> that<00:03:31.050> over<00:03:33.890> this

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
you're going to turn that over this

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.180 
you're going to turn that over this
piece<00:03:35.310> where<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:35.700> have<00:03:35.880> your<00:03:36.140> note<00:03:37.140> to<00:03:38.070> the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
piece where you have your note to the

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.090 
piece where you have your note to the
people<00:03:38.610> purchasing<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.300> CD<00:03:39.630> goes<00:03:40.380> on<00:03:40.769> the

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
people purchasing the CD goes on the

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.990 
people purchasing the CD goes on the
left<00:03:41.580> hand<00:03:41.910> side<00:03:42.380> because<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.650> edge<00:03:44.000> here

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
left hand side because the edge here

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.780 
left hand side because the edge here
this<00:03:45.900> far<00:03:46.200> edge<00:03:46.410> is<00:03:46.709> the<00:03:46.890> edge<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:47.400> doesn't

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
this far edge is the edge that doesn't

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.400 
this far edge is the edge that doesn't
have<00:03:48.000> anything<00:03:48.299> that<00:03:48.570> gets<00:03:48.660> cut<00:03:48.930> down<00:03:48.959> too

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
have anything that gets cut down too

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.289 
have anything that gets cut down too
that's<00:03:50.100> obviously<00:03:50.549> what<00:03:50.730> matches<00:03:50.910> up<00:03:51.180> with

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
that's obviously what matches up with

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.240 
that's obviously what matches up with
this<00:03:51.450> edge<00:03:51.660> here<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:52.310> then<00:03:54.380> so<00:03:55.380> long<00:03:55.620> as<00:03:55.950> those

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
this edge here and then so long as those

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.560 
this edge here and then so long as those
are<00:03:56.670> flush<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:57.450> even<00:03:58.070> you<00:03:59.070> are<00:03:59.220> fine<00:03:59.640> with<00:04:00.150> the

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
are flush and even you are fine with the

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.090 
are flush and even you are fine with the
rest<00:04:00.780> so<00:04:00.989> don't<00:04:01.140> worry<00:04:01.260> if<00:04:01.410> it's<00:04:01.590> off<00:04:01.799> slightly

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
rest so don't worry if it's off slightly

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.850 
rest so don't worry if it's off slightly
from<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.400> top<00:04:02.640> and<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.880> bottom<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.330> just

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
from the top and the bottom and just

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:06.170 
from the top and the bottom and just
secure<00:04:04.860> and<00:04:04.980> press<00:04:05.190> that<00:04:05.370> down<00:04:05.400> this<00:04:05.730> is<00:04:05.910> usage

secure and press that down this is usage

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.430 
secure and press that down this is usage
is<00:04:06.299> really<00:04:06.570> strong<00:04:06.780> so<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:07.080> could<00:04:07.170> only<00:04:07.290> do

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
is really strong so you could only do

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.770 
is really strong so you could only do
that<00:04:07.560> once<00:04:08.150> otherwise<00:04:09.150> it<00:04:09.330> will<00:04:09.450> completely

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
that once otherwise it will completely

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.240 
that once otherwise it will completely
rip<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.260> paper<00:04:10.440> there<00:04:11.190> are<00:04:11.459> several<00:04:12.390> extra

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
rip the paper there are several extra

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.640 
rip the paper there are several extra
sets<00:04:14.250> of<00:04:14.459> paper<00:04:14.730> though<00:04:15.090> so<00:04:15.780> no<00:04:15.989> worries<00:04:16.350> and

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
sets of paper though so no worries and

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.199 
sets of paper though so no worries and
then<00:04:17.130> because<00:04:17.400> of<00:04:17.519> the<00:04:17.609> thickness<00:04:17.970> of<00:04:18.090> the

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
then because of the thickness of the

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.990 
then because of the thickness of the
paper<00:04:18.390> it's<00:04:18.690> really<00:04:18.870> easy<00:04:19.200> to<00:04:19.350> then<00:04:19.590> flip<00:04:20.180> this

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
paper it's really easy to then flip this

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.820 
paper it's really easy to then flip this
here<00:04:23.000> and<00:04:23.330> it<00:04:23.840> will<00:04:23.870> fold<00:04:24.230> right<00:04:24.500> along<00:04:24.800> that

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
here and it will fold right along that

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.230 
here and it will fold right along that
edge<00:04:25.160> of<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.400> paper<00:04:25.580> and<00:04:25.760> then<00:04:26.000> you<00:04:26.090> can

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
edge of the paper and then you can

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.660 
edge of the paper and then you can
unfold<00:04:26.630> it<00:04:26.840> and<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.560> next<00:04:27.740> section<00:04:28.160> you<00:04:28.310> do<00:04:28.460> is

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
unfold it and the next section you do is

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.850 
unfold it and the next section you do is
the<00:04:28.880> far<00:04:29.180> right-hand<00:04:29.840> side<00:04:30.260> which<00:04:30.470> is<00:04:30.500> the<00:04:30.710> one

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:30.860 
the far right-hand side which is the one

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.320 
the far right-hand side which is the one
with<00:04:31.010> all<00:04:31.160> of<00:04:31.280> the<00:04:31.340> individual<00:04:31.790> portraits<00:04:32.060> of

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
with all of the individual portraits of

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.370 
with all of the individual portraits of
people<00:04:32.390> and<00:04:33.610> again<00:04:34.610> it's<00:04:35.060> this<00:04:35.240> far<00:04:35.780> edge<00:04:35.930> here

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
people and again it's this far edge here

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.710 
people and again it's this far edge here
that<00:04:37.310> you<00:04:37.520> match<00:04:38.140> flush<00:04:39.140> with<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.560> outer<00:04:39.830> edge

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
that you match flush with the outer edge

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.640 
that you match flush with the outer edge
adhesive<00:04:41.720> does<00:04:42.350> have<00:04:44.440> obviously<00:04:45.440> that

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
adhesive does have obviously that

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.880 
adhesive does have obviously that
backing<00:04:46.100> on<00:04:46.220> it<00:04:46.340> that<00:04:46.460> tends<00:04:46.700> to<00:04:46.790> get<00:04:46.940> stuck<00:04:47.890> so

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
backing on it that tends to get stuck so

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:55.530 
backing on it that tends to get stuck so
just<00:04:49.100> make<00:04:49.310> sure<00:04:49.340> that<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:49.910> edge<00:04:50.590> is<00:04:51.590> flush

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:02.130 

and<00:04:56.540> then<00:04:59.110> press<00:05:00.110> down<00:05:00.380> and<00:05:00.680> secure<00:05:01.340> it<00:05:01.430> and

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
and then press down and secure it and

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.720 
and then press down and secure it and
again<00:05:03.140> these<00:05:03.320> top<00:05:03.650> edges<00:05:04.040> will<00:05:04.190> be<00:05:04.280> taken<00:05:04.550> care

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
again these top edges will be taken care

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.910 
again these top edges will be taken care
of<00:05:04.760> later<00:05:04.970> so<00:05:05.330> no<00:05:05.480> worries<00:05:05.780> on<00:05:05.960> those<00:05:06.140> and<00:05:06.410> then

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
of later so no worries on those and then

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.190 
of later so no worries on those and then
the<00:05:07.070> same<00:05:07.310> goes<00:05:07.550> here<00:05:07.580> or<00:05:08.480> you<00:05:08.570> can<00:05:08.750> fold<00:05:08.990> it

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
the same goes here or you can fold it

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.170 
the same goes here or you can fold it
over<00:05:09.290> and<00:05:09.680> it<00:05:10.340> will<00:05:10.430> fold<00:05:10.640> right<00:05:10.910> where<00:05:11.120> it

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
over and it will fold right where it

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.500 
over and it will fold right where it
needs<00:05:11.240> to<00:05:11.450> fold<00:05:11.780> and<00:05:12.220> then<00:05:13.220> we<00:05:13.820> can<00:05:13.970> unfold<00:05:14.330> it

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
needs to fold and then we can unfold it

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.510 
needs to fold and then we can unfold it
there<00:05:14.690> so<00:05:15.410> then<00:05:15.590> the<00:05:15.680> last<00:05:15.920> section<00:05:16.220> we<00:05:16.490> have

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
there so then the last section we have

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.730 
there so then the last section we have
is<00:05:16.850> this<00:05:16.970> middle<00:05:17.360> section<00:05:17.390> this<00:05:18.380> middle

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
is this middle section this middle

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.500 
is this middle section this middle
section<00:05:18.770> because<00:05:19.340> if<00:05:19.760> you<00:05:19.880> remember<00:05:20.120> we<00:05:20.390> had

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
section because if you remember we had

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.120 
section because if you remember we had
to<00:05:20.600> trim<00:05:20.870> about<00:05:21.260> a<00:05:21.290> quarter<00:05:21.680> of<00:05:21.710> an<00:05:21.830> inch<00:05:21.890> off

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
to trim about a quarter of an inch off

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.190 
to trim about a quarter of an inch off
of<00:05:22.310> each<00:05:22.460> side<00:05:22.730> that's<00:05:23.390> roughly<00:05:23.840> what<00:05:23.930> the

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
of each side that's roughly what the

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.930 
of each side that's roughly what the
spacing<00:05:24.680> is<00:05:24.770> going<00:05:24.950> to<00:05:25.010> be<00:05:25.160> between<00:05:25.430> these<00:05:25.700> two

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
spacing is going to be between these two

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.050 
spacing is going to be between these two
sections<00:05:26.890> so<00:05:27.890> you<00:05:28.280> need<00:05:28.430> to<00:05:28.520> make<00:05:28.550> sure<00:05:28.730> that

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
sections so you need to make sure that

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.730 
sections so you need to make sure that
they're<00:05:29.210> centered<00:05:29.660> and<00:05:29.810> you<00:05:30.260> can<00:05:30.440> do<00:05:30.530> it<00:05:30.620> by

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
they're centered and you can do it by

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.370 
they're centered and you can do it by
having<00:05:30.950> either<00:05:31.820> a<00:05:32.030> ruler<00:05:32.480> up<00:05:32.660> at<00:05:32.780> the<00:05:32.900> top<00:05:33.080> and

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
having either a ruler up at the top and

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.780 
having either a ruler up at the top and
then<00:05:33.950> you<00:05:34.070> can<00:05:34.220> just<00:05:34.340> make<00:05:34.490> sure<00:05:34.640> the

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
then you can just make sure the

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:36.190 
then you can just make sure the
dimensions<00:05:35.270> on<00:05:35.390> each<00:05:35.510> side<00:05:35.750> of<00:05:35.780> it<00:05:36.020> are<00:05:36.110> the

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
dimensions on each side of it are the

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.270 
dimensions on each side of it are the
same<00:05:36.440> or<00:05:37.120> it<00:05:38.120> usually<00:05:38.750> has<00:05:38.870> enough<00:05:39.140> leeway<00:05:39.410> to

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
same or it usually has enough leeway to

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.980 
same or it usually has enough leeway to
where<00:05:40.490> you<00:05:40.820> can<00:05:40.970> just<00:05:41.120> eyeball<00:05:41.330> it<00:05:41.570> and<00:05:41.720> it's

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
where you can just eyeball it and it's

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.830 
where you can just eyeball it and it's
completely<00:05:42.500> fine<00:05:42.800> and<00:05:43.160> then<00:05:43.940> it<00:05:44.060> hits<00:05:44.270> dead

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
completely fine and then it hits dead

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.080 
completely fine and then it hits dead
center<00:05:45.250> pretty<00:05:46.250> much<00:05:46.460> ninety-nine<00:05:46.970> percent

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
center pretty much ninety-nine percent

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:55.030 
center pretty much ninety-nine percent
of<00:05:47.330> the<00:05:47.390> time<00:05:48.670> so<00:05:49.670> then<00:05:51.910> making<00:05:52.910> sure<00:05:53.330> to<00:05:54.040> catch

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
of the time so then making sure to catch

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.950 
of the time so then making sure to catch
a<00:05:55.160> part<00:05:55.430> of<00:05:55.520> the<00:05:55.640> backing<00:05:56.150> on<00:05:56.270> the<00:05:56.390> adhesive

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
a part of the backing on the adhesive

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:06.319 
a part of the backing on the adhesive
that<00:05:56.990> it<00:05:57.320> comes<00:05:57.560> off<00:06:00.490> so<00:06:01.490> this<00:06:01.760> is

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:06.329 

00:06:06.329 --> 00:06:15.209 

so<00:06:07.329> then<00:06:07.479> we<00:06:07.599> take<00:06:07.839> a<00:06:10.659> up<00:06:12.269> senate<00:06:14.219> and

00:06:15.209 --> 00:06:15.219 
so then we take a up senate and

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:18.719 
so then we take a up senate and
press<00:06:15.489> it<00:06:15.519> down<00:06:15.699> and<00:06:16.860> then<00:06:17.860> the<00:06:18.189> same<00:06:18.429> as<00:06:18.610> we

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:18.729 
press it down and then the same as we

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:20.969 
press it down and then the same as we
did<00:06:18.849> before<00:06:19.019> which<00:06:20.019> is<00:06:20.049> just<00:06:20.289> use<00:06:20.559> that<00:06:20.589> edge

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
did before which is just use that edge

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:24.839 
did before which is just use that edge
is<00:06:21.459> a<00:06:22.089> new<00:06:22.269> guide<00:06:23.129> you'll<00:06:24.129> have<00:06:24.309> your<00:06:24.459> spines

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:24.849 
is a new guide you'll have your spines

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:26.699 
is a new guide you'll have your spines
of<00:06:25.089> the<00:06:25.239> cities<00:06:25.599> that's<00:06:26.379> how<00:06:26.559> they're

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:26.709 
of the cities that's how they're

00:06:26.709 --> 00:06:34.529 
of the cities that's how they're
supposed<00:06:26.889> to<00:06:27.219> be<00:06:28.889> and<00:06:30.389> unfold<00:06:31.389> off<00:06:33.539> slightly

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:34.539 
supposed to be and unfold off slightly

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:36.059 
supposed to be and unfold off slightly
that's<00:06:34.899> just<00:06:35.079> when<00:06:35.229> you<00:06:35.379> place<00:06:35.589> the<00:06:35.829> center

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:36.069 
that's just when you place the center

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:38.159 
that's just when you place the center
piece<00:06:36.279> off<00:06:36.489> slightly<00:06:36.789> so<00:06:37.749> this<00:06:37.899> is<00:06:38.019> how<00:06:38.110> you

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:38.169 
piece off slightly so this is how you

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:39.959 
piece off slightly so this is how you
take<00:06:38.439> and<00:06:38.649> put<00:06:38.799> these<00:06:38.979> pieces<00:06:39.219> together<00:06:39.549> all

00:06:39.959 --> 00:06:39.969 
take and put these pieces together all

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:41.729 
take and put these pieces together all
of<00:06:39.999> the<00:06:40.239> cds<00:06:40.449> are<00:06:40.749> already<00:06:40.989> in<00:06:41.079> the<00:06:41.169> digi<00:06:41.469> trays

00:06:41.729 --> 00:06:41.739 
of the cds are already in the digi trays

00:06:41.739 --> 00:06:44.699 
of the cds are already in the digi trays
they<00:06:42.009> do<00:06:42.069> need<00:06:42.369> to<00:06:42.429> be<00:06:42.579> burned<00:06:43.499> but<00:06:44.499> that

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:44.709 
they do need to be burned but that

00:06:44.709 --> 00:06:45.929 
they do need to be burned but that
should<00:06:44.949> go<00:06:45.099> it<00:06:45.249> takes<00:06:45.429> about<00:06:45.549> three<00:06:45.909> minutes

00:06:45.929 --> 00:06:45.939 
should go it takes about three minutes

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:48.509 
should go it takes about three minutes
per<00:06:46.449> CD<00:06:46.719> a<00:06:47.079> little<00:06:47.649> bit<00:06:47.769> more<00:06:47.949> since<00:06:48.189> you<00:06:48.369> have

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:48.519 
per CD a little bit more since you have

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:51.329 
per CD a little bit more since you have
more<00:06:48.729> files<00:06:49.089> on<00:06:49.389> your<00:06:49.659> city<00:06:50.039> and<00:06:51.039> then<00:06:51.189> you

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319 
just do a little bit of a dab of epoxy

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:57.449 
just do a little bit of a dab of epoxy
on<00:06:53.849> inside<00:06:54.849> of<00:06:54.969> the<00:06:55.059> digit<00:06:55.329> rate<00:06:55.509> or<00:06:55.689> glue<00:06:56.459> and

on inside of the digit rate or glue and

00:06:57.459 --> 00:07:00.029 
on inside of the digit rate or glue and
then<00:06:58.209> you<00:06:58.360> place<00:06:58.599> the<00:06:59.259> tray<00:06:59.469> on<00:06:59.619> there<00:06:59.799> and

00:07:00.029 --> 00:07:00.039 
then you place the tray on there and

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:01.679 
then you place the tray on there and
depending<00:07:00.669> on<00:07:00.789> the<00:07:00.909> type<00:07:01.059> of<00:07:01.089> glue<00:07:01.360> you<00:07:01.479> use

00:07:01.679 --> 00:07:01.689 
depending on the type of glue you use

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:05.069 
depending on the type of glue you use
there's<00:07:02.559> a<00:07:02.649> set<00:07:02.919> time<00:07:03.129> that<00:07:03.759> you<00:07:03.879> need<00:07:04.079> one

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:05.079 
there's a set time that you need one

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:06.869 
there's a set time that you need one

you make sure that the height the final

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:27.989 
you make sure that the height the final
height<00:07:25.779> is<00:07:25.989> 5<00:07:26.469> and<00:07:26.829> a<00:07:26.979> half<00:07:27.009> you're<00:07:27.669> not<00:07:27.759> going

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:27.999 
height is 5 and a half you're not going

00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:30.540 
height is 5 and a half you're not going
to<00:07:28.059> have<00:07:28.149> sorry<00:07:28.360> five<00:07:28.689> inches<00:07:29.199> let's<00:07:29.979> make

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:30.550 
to have sorry five inches let's make

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.489 
to have sorry five inches let's make
