on this farm
clover<00:00:13.180> plots<00:00:13.390> are<00:00:13.570> really<00:00:13.870> important

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.290 
clover plots are really important

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.890 
clover plots are really important
because<00:00:14.410> they<00:00:15.309> tend<00:00:15.580> to<00:00:15.670> be<00:00:15.849> those<00:00:16.480> locations

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
because they tend to be those locations

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.010 
because they tend to be those locations
where<00:00:17.279> I'll<00:00:18.279> call<00:00:18.460> them<00:00:18.610> staging<00:00:19.450> areas<00:00:19.840> or

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
where I'll call them staging areas or

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.590 
where I'll call them staging areas or
micro<00:00:20.410> plots<00:00:20.710> or<00:00:21.430> the<00:00:21.640> little<00:00:21.850> killing<00:00:22.030> fields

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:22.600 
micro plots or the little killing fields

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.720 
micro plots or the little killing fields
but<00:00:23.289> whatever<00:00:23.560> you<00:00:23.710> call<00:00:23.949> them<00:00:24.100> they're<00:00:24.430> super

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
but whatever you call them they're super

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.010 
but whatever you call them they're super
important<00:00:25.119> spots<00:00:25.330> where<00:00:25.510> we<00:00:25.600> do<00:00:25.720> a<00:00:25.750> lot<00:00:25.990> of

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.020 
important spots where we do a lot of

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.349 
important spots where we do a lot of
hunting<00:00:26.230> during<00:00:27.070> the<00:00:27.130> fall<00:00:27.310> season<00:00:27.520> so<00:00:28.300> we

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
hunting during the fall season so we

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:29.460 
hunting during the fall season so we
want<00:00:28.480> to<00:00:28.570> make<00:00:28.660> sure<00:00:28.779> they're<00:00:28.930> in<00:00:28.960> prime<00:00:29.199> shape

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
want to make sure they're in prime shape

want to make sure they're in prime shape
you've<00:00:30.189> got<00:00:30.340> two<00:00:30.550> different<00:00:30.820> types<00:00:30.970> of<00:00:31.150> weeds

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:31.300 
you've got two different types of weeds

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.640 
you've got two different types of weeds
that<00:00:31.449> you<00:00:31.539> need<00:00:31.660> to<00:00:31.750> control<00:00:32.050> you<00:00:32.439> need<00:00:32.559> to

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650 
that you need to control you need to

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.590 
that you need to control you need to
control<00:00:32.890> the<00:00:33.010> broadleaf<00:00:33.489> weeds<00:00:33.730> and<00:00:34.360> you<00:00:34.449> need

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
control the broadleaf weeds and you need

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.810 
control the broadleaf weeds and you need
to<00:00:34.720> control<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.080> grasses<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.670> there's

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
to control the grasses and there's

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.850 
to control the grasses and there's
different<00:00:37.000> practices<00:00:37.690> that<00:00:37.809> you<00:00:37.960> can<00:00:38.110> use<00:00:38.380> to

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
different practices that you can use to

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.770 
different practices that you can use to
control<00:00:39.160> the<00:00:39.309> broad<00:00:39.640> leaves<00:00:39.910> than<00:00:40.450> what<00:00:40.660> you

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
control the broad leaves than what you

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.900 
control the broad leaves than what you
would<00:00:40.899> use<00:00:41.050> to<00:00:41.079> control<00:00:41.470> the<00:00:41.559> grasses<00:00:42.100> and

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
would use to control the grasses and

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.979 
would use to control the grasses and
with<00:00:43.030> the<00:00:43.149> broad<00:00:43.300> leaves<00:00:43.510> are<00:00:43.660> looking<00:00:43.870> at

00:00:43.979 --> 00:00:43.989 
with the broad leaves are looking at

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.950 
with the broad leaves are looking at
mowing<00:00:44.380> is<00:00:44.559> basically<00:00:45.100> your<00:00:45.399> primary<00:00:46.030> method

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
mowing is basically your primary method

mowing is basically your primary method
to<00:00:47.380> control<00:00:47.739> these<00:00:48.100> weeds<00:00:48.390> broad<00:00:49.390> leaves<00:00:49.600> are

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
to control these weeds broad leaves are

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.200 
to control these weeds broad leaves are
not<00:00:49.989> generally<00:00:50.800> perennials<00:00:51.520> generally

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
not generally perennials generally

they'll<00:00:52.360> seed<00:00:52.690> their<00:00:53.140> annuals<00:00:53.530> they'll<00:00:53.710> seed

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
they'll seed their annuals they'll seed

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.650 
they'll seed their annuals they'll seed
during<00:00:54.610> the<00:00:54.790> year<00:00:55.030> and<00:00:55.239> then<00:00:55.360> they'll<00:00:55.480> grow

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
during the year and then they'll grow

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.810 
during the year and then they'll grow
back<00:00:55.690> from<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.170> seeds<00:00:56.410> next<00:00:56.829> year<00:00:57.070> so<00:00:57.670> if<00:00:57.730> you

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
back from the seeds next year so if you

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.279 
back from the seeds next year so if you
can<00:00:57.969> mow<00:00:58.120> them<00:00:58.329> off<00:00:58.420> and<00:00:58.660> keep<00:00:58.780> them<00:00:58.960> mode<00:00:59.110> off

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
can mow them off and keep them mode off

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.290 
can mow them off and keep them mode off
but<00:00:59.829> the<00:00:59.950> clover<00:01:00.340> get<00:01:00.520> ahead<00:01:00.760> of<00:01:00.820> them<00:01:01.059> and

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
but the clover get ahead of them and

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.540 
but the clover get ahead of them and
shadow<00:01:01.930> them<00:01:02.260> out<00:01:02.410> there's<00:01:03.190> a<00:01:03.219> pretty<00:01:03.399> good

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
shadow them out there's a pretty good

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.829 
shadow them out there's a pretty good
chance<00:01:03.610> that<00:01:03.850> you<00:01:04.000> can<00:01:04.180> subdue<00:01:04.629> those

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839

it's<00:01:06.399> the<00:01:06.550> grasses<00:01:07.030> they<00:01:07.119> give<00:01:07.240> you<00:01:07.330> the<00:01:07.420> most

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:07.539 
it's the grasses they give you the most

it's the grasses they give you the most
trouble<00:01:08.110> sometimes<00:01:08.979> you<00:01:09.100> can<00:01:09.280> mow<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.700> clover

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
trouble sometimes you can mow the clover

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.940 
trouble sometimes you can mow the clover
plots<00:01:10.209> low<00:01:10.420> enough<00:01:10.690> that<00:01:11.350> the<00:01:11.470> clover<00:01:11.800> can

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:22.959 
a grass selective herbicides and I know

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:24.900 
a grass selective herbicides and I know
I've<00:01:23.140> talked<00:01:23.380> about<00:01:23.470> select<00:01:24.039> in<00:01:24.250> the<00:01:24.340> past<00:01:24.580> and

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
I've talked about select in the past and

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.550 
I've talked about select in the past and
we<00:01:25.149> tried<00:01:25.330> to<00:01:25.420> buy<00:01:25.539> some<00:01:25.569> selected<00:01:26.229> recently

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
we tried to buy some selected recently

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.080 
we tried to buy some selected recently
and<00:01:26.709> find<00:01:26.920> out<00:01:27.039> that<00:01:27.220> it's<00:01:27.459> not<00:01:27.520> not<00:01:27.819> made

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
and find out that it's not not made

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.719 
and find out that it's not not made
anymore<00:01:28.330> so<00:01:28.899> I<00:01:29.349> can't<00:01:29.830> remember<00:01:30.069> what<00:01:30.640> the

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
anymore so I can't remember what the

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.520 
anymore so I can't remember what the
herbicide<00:01:31.149> was<00:01:31.660> called<00:01:31.959> that<00:01:32.170> we<00:01:32.229> picked<00:01:32.440> up

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
herbicide was called that we picked up

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.169 
herbicide was called that we picked up
here<00:01:32.770> recently<00:01:32.979> to<00:01:33.280> spray<00:01:33.490> our<00:01:33.610> clover<00:01:33.940> plots

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
here recently to spray our clover plots

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.870 
here recently to spray our clover plots
so<00:01:34.810> you<00:01:34.869> can<00:01:34.959> go<00:01:35.050> to<00:01:35.110> any<00:01:35.289> co-op<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:36.580> just<00:01:36.729> tell

best thing to do is spray the grasses
and<00:01:42.429> then<00:01:42.580> wait<00:01:42.819> let<00:01:43.149> the<00:01:43.270> grasses<00:01:43.660> die<00:01:43.810> and

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
and then wait let the grasses die and

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.809 
and then wait let the grasses die and
then<00:01:44.170> come<00:01:44.380> back<00:01:44.410> and<00:01:44.920> mow<00:01:45.160> the<00:01:45.340> plot<00:01:45.520> later

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
then come back and mow the plot later

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:48.300 
then come back and mow the plot later
for<00:01:46.090> your<00:01:46.179> broad<00:01:46.330> leaves<00:01:46.599> or<00:01:47.289> the<00:01:47.860> qurba<00:01:48.099> these

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
for your broad leaves or the qurba these

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.430 
for your broad leaves or the qurba these
are<00:01:48.429> really<00:01:48.880> taking<00:01:49.209> off<00:01:49.300> fast<00:01:49.660> though<00:01:50.259> the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
are really taking off fast though the

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.680 
are really taking off fast though the
plot<00:01:50.590> first<00:01:50.890> let<00:01:51.369> it<00:01:51.459> grow<00:01:51.610> back<00:01:51.640> and<00:01:52.450> then

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
plot first let it grow back and then

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.859 
plot first let it grow back and then
spray<00:01:52.989> your<00:01:53.020> grasses<00:01:53.560> so<00:01:54.039> either<00:01:54.940> way<00:01:55.149> it's<00:01:55.750> a

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
spray your grasses so either way it's a

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.419 
spray your grasses so either way it's a
two-part<00:01:56.289> process<00:01:56.440> with<00:01:56.950> maintaining<00:01:57.280> the

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
two-part process with maintaining the

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:59.790 
two-part process with maintaining the
clover<00:01:57.880> you<00:01:58.420> got<00:01:58.569> to<00:01:58.690> mow<00:01:58.840> it<00:01:58.869> to<00:01:59.349> control<00:01:59.619> the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
clover you got to mow it to control the

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.469 
clover you got to mow it to control the
broad<00:01:59.950> leaves<00:02:00.220> you<00:02:00.670> got<00:02:00.819> to<00:02:00.910> spray<00:02:01.179> it<00:02:01.330> to

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
broad leaves you got to spray it to

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.479 
broad leaves you got to spray it to
control<00:02:01.720> the<00:02:01.929> grasses<00:02:02.349> and<00:02:02.920> which<00:02:03.069> one<00:02:03.280> you<00:02:03.310> do

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:03.489 
control the grasses and which one you do

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:06.300 
control the grasses and which one you do
first<00:02:03.789> depends<00:02:04.420> upon<00:02:04.509> which<00:02:04.899> of<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.440> weeds<00:02:05.649> is

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
first depends upon which of the weeds is
