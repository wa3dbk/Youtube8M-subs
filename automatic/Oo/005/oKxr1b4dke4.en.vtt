aid these bamboo and surviving is we

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.760 
aid these bamboo and surviving is we
just<00:02:08.910> pack<00:02:09.330> them<00:02:09.599> really<00:02:10.170> tightly<00:02:10.440> together

here which is called a red twig dogwood

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.020 
here which is called a red twig dogwood
they're<00:03:37.470> really<00:03:38.160> really<00:03:38.340> beautiful<00:03:38.850> and

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
they're really really beautiful and

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.180 
they're really really beautiful and
provide<00:03:39.329> a<00:03:39.360> winter<00:03:39.870> interest<00:03:40.380> as<00:03:40.650> well<00:03:40.890> which

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
provide a winter interest as well which

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.280 
provide a winter interest as well which
is<00:03:41.220> something<00:03:41.579> to<00:03:42.000> take<00:03:42.299> into<00:03:42.570> consideration

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
is something to take into consideration

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.710 
is something to take into consideration
up<00:03:43.440> here<00:03:43.709> where<00:03:43.980> people<00:03:44.850> are<00:03:44.970> walking<00:03:45.180> around

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
up here where people are walking around

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.199 
up here where people are walking around
a<00:03:46.140> lot<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.709> they<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:47.579> know<00:03:47.610> want<00:03:47.910> it<00:03:48.000> to<00:03:48.090> look

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
a lot and they you know want it to look

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.470 
a lot and they you know want it to look
pretty<00:03:48.450> all<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.660> time<00:03:48.780> so<00:03:49.470> they're<00:03:49.980> also<00:03:50.160> the

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
pretty all the time so they're also the

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.300 
pretty all the time so they're also the
apartments<00:03:51.480> are<00:03:51.570> towering<00:03:51.959> over<00:03:52.620> this<00:03:52.769> garden

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
apartments are towering over this garden

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.600 
apartments are towering over this garden
so<00:03:53.489> there<00:03:53.640> has<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.970> be<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.120> constant<00:03:54.420> interest

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
so there has to be a constant interest

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:59.030 
so there has to be a constant interest
throughout<00:03:56.610> all<00:03:56.850> the<00:03:57.000> seasons<00:03:57.590> not<00:03:58.590> only<00:03:58.890> from

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
throughout all the seasons not only from

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.250 
throughout all the seasons not only from
high<00:03:59.220> level<00:03:59.610> but<00:03:59.760> also<00:03:59.970> from<00:04:00.630> you<00:04:00.989> know<00:04:01.110> up

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
high level but also from you know up

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.039 
high level but also from you know up
above<00:04:01.560> looking<00:04:01.950> down<00:04:02.010> onto<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.610> gardens<00:04:03.120> what

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
above looking down onto the gardens what

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.780 
above looking down onto the gardens what
we've<00:04:04.230> learned<00:04:04.560> that<00:04:04.860> might<00:04:05.190> be<00:04:05.310> useful<00:04:05.400> to

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
we've learned that might be useful to

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.370 
we've learned that might be useful to
other<00:04:06.090> garden<00:04:06.600> is<00:04:06.690> what<00:04:06.870> we've<00:04:07.019> learned<00:04:07.260> here

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
other garden is what we've learned here

watered<00:04:13.310> in<00:04:14.310> these<00:04:14.760> difficult<00:04:15.000> sites<00:04:15.829> really

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
watered in these difficult sites really

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.620 
watered in these difficult sites really
helps<00:04:17.519> things<00:04:17.989> survive

then<00:04:19.870> some<00:04:20.170> of<00:04:20.200> the<00:04:20.380> other<00:04:20.530> information<00:04:21.040> that

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
then some of the other information that

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.210 
then some of the other information that
we've<00:04:21.580> taken<00:04:21.610> away<00:04:22.210> from<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:23.770> years<00:04:24.010> that

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
we've taken away from the years that

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.570 
we've taken away from the years that
we've<00:04:24.430> been<00:04:24.460> gardening<00:04:25.270> here<00:04:25.690> is<00:04:26.490> using<00:04:27.490> the

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
we've been gardening here is using the

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.940 
we've been gardening here is using the
correct<00:04:27.820> plants<00:04:28.390> this<00:04:29.110> place<00:04:29.380> is<00:04:29.680> on<00:04:29.860> the

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
correct plants this place is on the

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.930 
correct plants this place is on the
water<00:04:30.850> so<00:04:31.420> we<00:04:31.690> tend<00:04:31.990> to<00:04:32.050> try<00:04:32.350> to<00:04:32.410> use<00:04:32.680> seaside<00:04:33.460> I

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
water so we tend to try to use seaside I

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.650 
water so we tend to try to use seaside I
plants<00:04:34.900> anything<00:04:35.410> that<00:04:35.620> zone<00:04:35.950> for<00:04:36.540> water<00:04:37.540> and

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
plants anything that zone for water and

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.770 
plants anything that zone for water and
wind<00:04:38.050> usually<00:04:38.890> will<00:04:39.100> work<00:04:39.310> out<00:04:39.550> fine<00:04:39.940> here<00:04:40.390> so

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
wind usually will work out fine here so

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.150 
wind usually will work out fine here so
the<00:04:41.410> other<00:04:41.530> important<00:04:42.520> thing<00:04:42.790> as<00:04:43.030> far<00:04:43.270> as

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
the other important thing as far as

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.770 
the other important thing as far as
planting<00:04:45.160> is<00:04:45.280> concerned<00:04:45.790> and<00:04:46.090> especially<00:04:46.450> on

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
planting is concerned and especially on

areas massing the plants closely

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:53.420 
areas massing the plants closely
together<00:04:51.450> helps<00:04:52.450> them<00:04:52.570> support<00:04:52.990> each<00:04:53.110> other

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430

against<00:04:54.430> wind<00:04:54.820> and<00:04:55.150> elements<00:04:55.960> as<00:04:56.050> far<00:04:56.200> as

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
against wind and elements as far as

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.050 
against wind and elements as far as
drawing<00:04:56.560> out<00:04:56.860> when<00:04:57.550> there's<00:04:57.730> no<00:04:57.850> other

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
hardscape to protect them waterside is

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
hardscape to protect them waterside is
actually<00:05:01.510> a<00:05:01.540> public<00:05:01.990> space<00:05:02.380> and<00:05:03.090> if<00:05:04.090> I'm<00:05:04.300> 43rd

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:04.810 
actually a public space and if I'm 43rd

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:06.930 
actually a public space and if I'm 43rd
streets<00:05:05.290> it's<00:05:05.560> definitely<00:05:05.950> worth<00:05:06.490> coming<00:05:06.670> out
