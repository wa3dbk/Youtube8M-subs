00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.779
 first of all of course I go to 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.420
 remove hair from the face with a 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.740
 circle then use the clarin fani 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.259
 that combined with this 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.179
 neutromed detergent and I have to say 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.060
 that the combination of these products 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.670
 I really like it thousand, my face is fine 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.740
 leaves my skin already hydrated 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.720
 and I can do later 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.720
 apply makeup without problems 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.829
 I then apply a serum this and in action 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:36.220
 it doesn't cost much and this is very good 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:39.940
 here it is anti imperfections and in any case many 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.460
 black points the eye contour I apply a 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.860
 gel is very easy to apply a lot 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.600
 fast to absorb remains light and me 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.940
 goes to make the basis for the make up that 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.280
 will make this gel too 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.100
 really super moisturizer does great for 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.579
 the eye contour and I'm going to stretch 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.350
 this will not tire in advance 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:04.720
 they tell us that I am immediately absorbed 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.790
 move brands is this way has 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.250
 finished my part and daily 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.950
 now I can not do that but certainly 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.869
 blog my wife's hair 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.579
 and then have the other one thrown 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:20.590
 using this economic decline group 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:22.570
 which is what impact turn like before 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.789
 what I extend my dyed background of 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.619
 chanel the viable minerals being with 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.689
 the fingers because you know that to a covering 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.319
 medium-low and much easier 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:34.000
 take it so that with a brush it is the 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:35.770
 time to cover the dark circles goes by 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.869
 use my usual concealer 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.670
 of the maybelline the football at the age it 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.259
 I lay with the way applicator 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.509
 simply to tap it with 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.959
 this plate torch that they would be at 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.909
 foundation but I find it excellent this way 

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:50.890
 fixed everything with my face powder max e 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.110
 I 've been using my usual brush for years 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.060
 I know you know them and I find them 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.340
 very comfortable because it spends the product in 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.840
 homogeneous way without creating accumulations vi 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.539
 it leaves just this a natural fact 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.709
 of skin to do with her 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.229
 then I focus on the eyebrows 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:08.440
 because I want everything to be in place 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:11.110
 the day to chew on bystanders he has 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.850
 clarified nothing mark and then I go has more 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.370
 spoke this case 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.950
 belin that I like very much for 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.600
 uniform the eyelid use because 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.580
 steps missing 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.530
 even of love the more the shadow this is 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.420
 perfect stop practically I can't 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.940
 golden color you make me 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.280
 they are facts that you would make me flesh-colored 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.050
 giannino from the end if not the same 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:43.349
 however the flat wine on the whole 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:46.349
 movable eyelid to give a slight 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.349
 eye 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.820
 but so typical where above all 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.830
 in Africa I 'm sorry that in the second half 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.700
 don't see fake invalid on that 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.790
 pity but will have to draw one 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.829
 thin line online 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.829
 in india, people like me have a few few 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.829
 cinghialai 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:18.880
 the inferior arena is the only child 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:21.500
 these of pippa miccoli daughter and then 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:24.590
 I'm going to use his mind 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:31.460
 incurvating mascara lengthening fools 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:34.850
 what because on the cheeks it goes by 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.920
 use a very coral-colored blush 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.350
 beautiful and very bright this one makes me here 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.140
 also for illuminating and for the lips 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.120
 I simply choose a lipstick 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.160
 moisturizing and also slightly colored 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.450
 this violet is perfect because it makes you 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.420
 very white teeth 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.670
 so this is my make up for everyone 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.770
 very fast and very comfortable days from 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.750
 to realize it is fine both for 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.770
 the office, however, for occasions 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.750
 like school and now it's time to 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.910
 look at my evening routine 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:09.800
 obviously first of all I slip into 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:11.660
 pajamas remove hair from my face 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.750
 using my usual circle 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.030
 and then I'm going to get this make-up remover 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:19.310
 biphasic chanel after having been 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.560
 Intern vein I made a private jet 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.870
 remove this makeup residue 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.130
 here it is fantastic also eliminates the 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.479
 waterproof log the boulder the past 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.040
 use also to take advantage of the lips and 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.140
 I must say that I do not find it very well 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.090
 for the face instead I go to use 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.010
 micellar water, however, in this case is 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.080
 the one for oily skin not 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.390
 authorized African studio meals 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.700
 simply 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.700
 using a larger quarter 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.990
 deal made that the skin is you 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.850
 completed quality I go to do the various 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:58.040
 sounds that use the 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:05:00.720
 cleaner of mine promises nail but 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.910
 there's a little boy digging his lips for the 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.800
 all that cuticles and to do so 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.020
 which absorb better introduced 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:12.630
 moisturizer which I will then apply 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:16.430
 before sleeping as before it was so much 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:17.689
 all before the queue freely 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.689
 let's play 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:21.649

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:25.020

 tongue now say pretty dense 

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:37.910
 I'm going to moisturize my lips 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.250
 simply using 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:43.760
