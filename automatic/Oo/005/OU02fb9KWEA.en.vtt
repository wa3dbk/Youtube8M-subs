 such a small action made with 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.730
 few subscribers of mine and I thought 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.619
 Just let me do it all 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.930

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.869

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.650
 So what it is about taking a train quasi 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.480
 So now I had to the reviewers 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.000

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.280

 Now you have to change very briefly and 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.539
 We consider trying the 20-year-old to 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.820
 topping or making and 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.520
 then I dominate my candidates so 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.780
 know people changed times very short 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.350
 So you look like the rings alike 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.969

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.649
