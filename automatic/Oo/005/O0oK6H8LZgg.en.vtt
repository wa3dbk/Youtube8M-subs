00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:14.469
 we present our island youth conferences with víctor zambrano a 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.269
 program produced by himself 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.269
 for that reason it informed goods for that value 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.429
 but more active in this title 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:28.560
 it seems a plague 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.259
 Look 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:32.140
 basically 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.140
 God created us to be happy 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.090
 the happiness of God is to see us happy the joy of God is to see they are not 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.090
 measurable 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.710
 I do not think rocket to suffer 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.710
 if not so that they are happy this happiness 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.220
 we want to achieve is 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.560
 in being able to obey his word 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.150
 just as the Bible says to deceive us God can not be mocked because everything 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.970
 that man would sow 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.530
 that will also reap 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.580
 Colon not only from his curse does not mean only that sowing 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.049
 disobedience 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:10.670
 harvested suffering 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.240
 this verse also blessing means that if you always obey 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.100
 harvested happiness 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.100
 God has never promised to fulfill 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.940
 i 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.230
 ap 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.170
 yes no mediocrity 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.250
 and I say this because many young people have not yet made this commitment 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.590
 serious with god 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.820
 may they say 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.260
 but I am a Christian and because God does not bless me 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.280
 is that this Christian goes far beyond carrying a Bible far beyond 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.620
 going to church far beyond having a position in the church goes a lot 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.250
 beyond preaching 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.840
 much beyond singing there was much beyond touching 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.430
 -is a Christian lifestyle and God has promised a request for 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.200
 obedience but never for the warmth nilda mediocrity and why hypocrisy 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.400
 because this topic is called care with sharks 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.409
 any kind of environment to kill 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:11.209
 and kill to live 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:12.819
 and to whom it refers 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.219
 To them 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:16.989
 mens 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.230
 they survive to kill the illusions the dreams the hopes of many 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.209
 ladies 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.349
 Many girls dream of having 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.799
 very happy home many girls dream of having 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:36.389
 very patient very soft very friendly many girls dream of having their side 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.719
 responsible man to see 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.469
 many girls dream 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:46.449
 with getting married in white from having a very nice wedding 

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:48.049
 but these sharks 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:49.820
 they shine their dreams 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.700
 tron song happiness 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.289
 not so your hopes a future 

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:56.870
 there were many undue things 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:57.749
 What do they do 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:03.629
 and today is going to be totally of that impás set to be able to give account 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:06.890
 who really loves that it's worth it 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:12.090
 and you have a bit or a patch of man that looks at you, brings together a woman like 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.370
 object of sexual pleasure but do not worry about her or her 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.919
 happiness 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:19.869
 beware of sharks 

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:22.869
 he knows that he is very sad and God sees him sadly 

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:26.739
 in Peru an average of one thousand abortions per day is calculated 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:31.469
 between 350 thousand and 400 thousand abortions per year 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:35.169
 in Peru 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.169
 it is estimated that more than 70 thousand young people with AIDS 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:39.760
 before 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.420
 the elderly infected decided gays in the 80s 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.260
 but since the 90s and the 2000s the contagion of AIDS is making 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.930
 through couples I expect sexual 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.960
 or of men who sleep with women and women who sleep with 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.070
 poor more than 70 thousand will get 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.589
 and only half know they have AIDS 

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:06.369
 in Peru the other half does not know but does not suspect and does not want to be 

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:07.750
 blood test 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.220
 because he is afraid that because of certain contagious and in this way he is truncated 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.469
 all your lifestyle 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:18.930
 full of debauchery that has no longer going to be able to have more love if it is that 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.879
 he has a little conscience 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:24.510
 you will not be able to study anymore, you will not feel like working 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.379
 and so he prefers to keep and follow 

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:31.400
 having sex irresponsibly a whole enigma 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.680
 in January of the year 2006 the newspaper the commerce published a news that 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.340
 shuddered today directs 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.830
 I have to leave everything to continue serving God 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.860
 this news said that only in Lima is calculated almost one million 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.569
 of single mothers 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:53.180
 not in Peru only in Lima I was scared 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.240
 I said I have to leave everything I can not keep quiet with many amenities 

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:00.969
 While this world is lost God has loved us 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:04.349
 the solution for everything 

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:09.209
 he has given us his word has given us the ability the power to transform everything 

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:12.209
 this and we have to do it 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:14.759
 throughout the year 2006 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:18.319
 It is estimated that about 180 thousand pregnant teenagers 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.370
 it's a shame all this destruction that's being 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:26.120
 is calculated 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.060
 half a million children 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.060
 without wanting to be recognized by their parents 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.410
 also accurate 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.100
 very difficult conferences with víctor zapata visit the website www trini2011 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.889

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:49.080
 this is a program driven by the youth ministry of value
