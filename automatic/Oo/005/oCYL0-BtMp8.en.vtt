I just saw and model airplane used
magazine<00:03:33.849> and<00:03:34.060> I<00:03:34.090> thought<00:03:34.330> I'd<00:03:34.450> give<00:03:34.659> it<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.810> try

this<00:03:36.010> plane<00:03:36.280> would<00:03:36.400> be<00:03:36.580> probably<00:03:36.909> a<00:03:37.090> pretty

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
this plane would be probably a pretty

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.930 
this plane would be probably a pretty
good<00:03:37.569> place<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.930> give<00:03:38.200> it<00:03:38.319> a<00:03:38.379> spin<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:39.459> I've

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
good place to give it a spin and I've

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.500 
good place to give it a spin and I've
got<00:03:40.150> four<00:03:40.510> HS<00:03:41.260> 79<00:03:42.010> 85<00:03:42.400> metal<00:03:42.819> gear<00:03:43.000> correlation

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:45.909 
digital servos going in the plane I

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.089 
digital servos going in the plane I
think<00:03:46.299> they're<00:03:46.510> probably<00:03:47.079> of<00:03:47.590> reasonable

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:48.099 
think they're probably of reasonable

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:49.740 
think they're probably of reasonable
quality<00:03:48.519> and<00:03:48.700> should<00:03:48.940> be<00:03:49.060> well<00:03:49.390> up<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.659> the

quality and should be well up to the
task<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.319> here<00:03:51.129> I<00:03:51.159> picked<00:03:51.430> up<00:03:51.840> off<00:03:52.840> Amazon

a<00:04:08.109> major<00:04:08.470> score<00:04:08.769> I<00:04:08.829> got<00:04:09.010> in<00:04:09.159> there<00:04:09.340> if<00:04:09.459> you<00:04:09.549> can

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:09.579 
a major score I got in there if you can

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:11.460 
a major score I got in there if you can
believe<00:04:09.819> it<00:04:10.060> they<00:04:10.150> were<00:04:10.209> 12<00:04:10.599> bucks<00:04:10.870> each<00:04:11.079> so

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
believe it they were 12 bucks each so

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.069 
believe it they were 12 bucks each so
when<00:04:12.190> you<00:04:12.280> look<00:04:12.430> at<00:04:12.519> the<00:04:12.670> list<00:04:12.849> price<00:04:13.060> that<00:04:13.959> was

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
when you look at the list price that was

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.409 
when you look at the list price that was
a<00:04:14.109> smoking<00:04:14.560> deal<00:04:14.680> I<00:04:14.890> think<00:04:15.010> they<00:04:15.419> were

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
a smoking deal I think they were

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:18.420 
a smoking deal I think they were
supplied<00:04:16.840> by<00:04:17.049> dragonfly<00:04:17.680> so<00:04:17.979> you<00:04:18.039> might<00:04:18.250> want

for<00:04:56.400> for<00:04:57.400> price<00:04:57.610> and<00:04:57.820> availability<00:04:57.910> I

00:04:58.529 --> 00:04:58.539 
for for price and availability I

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:01.230 
for for price and availability I
stumbled<00:04:59.080> upon<00:04:59.169> their<00:04:59.500> website<00:05:00.010> and<00:05:00.240> they

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
stumbled upon their website and they

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.029 
stumbled upon their website and they
also<00:05:01.389> happened<00:05:01.780> to<00:05:01.810> be<00:05:01.870> that<00:05:02.110> I<00:05:02.349> think<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:02.740> US

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
also happened to be that I think the US

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.560 
also happened to be that I think the US
hacker<00:05:03.340> distributors<00:05:04.120> so<00:05:04.300> they've<00:05:04.419> always

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
hacker distributors so they've always

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.150 
hacker distributors so they've always
got<00:05:04.810> a<00:05:04.840> good<00:05:04.990> supply<00:05:05.320> of<00:05:05.380> the<00:05:05.530> hacker<00:05:05.710> motors

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
got a good supply of the hacker motors

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.960 
got a good supply of the hacker motors
but<00:05:07.590> what<00:05:08.590> they<00:05:08.710> do<00:05:08.770> is<00:05:08.949> they<00:05:09.070> offer<00:05:09.220> package

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
but what they do is they offer package

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.270 
but what they do is they offer package
deals<00:05:10.240> and<00:05:10.570> they<00:05:10.990> can<00:05:11.169> vary<00:05:11.530> from<00:05:11.800> just<00:05:12.190> the

deals and they can vary from just the

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.279

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.070 
now I'm not beyond wanting to save a few
bucks<00:05:33.310> so<00:05:33.820> this<00:05:33.970> looked<00:05:34.210> pretty<00:05:34.420> good<00:05:34.600> to<00:05:34.660> me

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
bucks so this looked pretty good to me

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.740 
bucks so this looked pretty good to me
now<00:05:35.620> the<00:05:35.950> other<00:05:36.070> issue<00:05:36.430> of<00:05:36.730> course<00:05:36.940> was<00:05:37.150> that<00:05:37.180> I

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
now the other issue of course was that I

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.860 
now the other issue of course was that I
didn't<00:05:38.140> exactly<00:05:38.920> like<00:05:39.190> the<00:05:39.820> package<00:05:40.540> deals

the way they were laid out in terms of

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:45.090 
the way they were laid out in terms of

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320
