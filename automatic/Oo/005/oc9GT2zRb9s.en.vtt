00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.130
 It is a completely Andalusian product 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.470
 I studied in Córdoba with very large 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.150
 teachers then I studied I studied 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.320
 composition the first courses I'm in 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.539
 followed by a teacher manolo castillo 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.669
 of agreement and then I ended up with ramón 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:32.259
 total in málaga and finally I studied 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.510
 other technical directors about music 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.800
 from Malaga which is the only super center 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.839
 from Andalusia that has a chair 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.010
 orchestral direction and there I graduated was 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:42.660
 the only one who graduated in my promotion 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.250
 to be a director that you have to have 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.500
 many things one of them obviously 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.899
 is talent second a capacity of 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.430
 very serious work in third place there 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.659
 than to have a research capacity 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.979
 of deepening on the score 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.290
 because the truth of the interpretation 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:57.060
 is in the score 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.820
 and I am a pretty person 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.280
 temperamental I am a person with 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.199
 very much impulse I am a person that the 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.450
 I really like the repertoire a lot 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.660
 romantic symphonic and I really like the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.660
 expression 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.000
 naval power the linen of the province 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.159
 from jaén for me as linarense as 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.440
 jienense 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.950
 it's one of the most heartfelt things that I 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.950
 I have done in my life 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.409
 the power also work on how 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.330
 director that is the recording on the 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.720
 that fantastic text wrote Miguel 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.180
 Hernández on the Andalusian from Jaén to 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.740
 fitur to a cetera file and really the 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.970
 to be able to record it with some bonuses of 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.430
 people from a musical level more 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.350
 important that exists in the program of 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.710
 flamenco that is carmelitas my countrywoman 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.710
 carmen linares 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.220
 a director who is Andalusian like in my 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.110
 case an Andalusian orchestra god from above 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.820
 of Andalusia of Jaén and a town that 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.560
 it's called linares that really can 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.600
 be representing your country at a 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.060
 International 25 years ago something 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.399
 unthinkable today is a reality 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.380
 a rollover with each one of them from my 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.020
 student because I think if they see 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.820
 they see those figures probably day 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.319
 tomorrow do not remember me as a good 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.580
 like a bad teacher but maybe I would 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.580
 can you remember even as a teacher
