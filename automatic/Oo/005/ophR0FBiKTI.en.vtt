 Hello, I want to show you today 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.840
 how can you pickle cucumbers very quickly 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.210
 get a little pickles using 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.870
 vacuum container which is at 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:18.740
 me on the channel this is a jar with a lid in 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:23.480
 valve cover and pump pump for 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:27.230
 pumping air from the can we take 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:31.550
 wash my cucumbers and dunk them before 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:35.239
 With this we put the spices in the jar 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:40.000
 salt solution two tablespoons per liter 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:47.840
 water and fill this thing all the brine 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:51.699
 pour brine brine should 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.699
 cover a jar 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.100
 pour brine which is pre 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.570
 cook in a jar so that cucumbers are 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.630
 covered on top 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:09.909
 close the lid lid in 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.909
 screw up and pump out the air 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:19.040
 the pump that is we wind the union and 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.680
 pump out the air he see we have water 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.930
 starts to boil what a vacuum 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:29.290
 a vacuum is formed in the can 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.290
 water boils 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:38.110
 You see in the bank around at this moment 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:42.240
 brine is being absorbed 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:45.869
 cucumbers can then reset a little 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:52.210
 vacuum here I ran the air in the can and 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:58.479
 once again pumping out the air again 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:00.750
 pumping air out here begins again 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:05.020
 boiling up 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:10.500
 boiling up see this suggests that 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:15.989
 cans vacuum then we have this can 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:20.290
 twist a little twist here 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:26.670
 twisted and can be put in the cold 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:30.849
 place see there vacuum goes boiling through 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.880
 3-4 hours cucumbers will be ready that is 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.620
