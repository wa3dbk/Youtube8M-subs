00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.429
 I found the jetpack 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:30.070
 was frank in a madwoman full of pieces 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:34.180
 it is next that in this place that you 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:40.690
 missing possible kills and a new menu 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:43.559
 of the catuaÃ­ place on the map in the map corner 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.559
 well hidden 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:01:09.610
 I do not agree can not be here 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:11.830
 but rather the way you are doing 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.619
 the other way is typed in code that 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:19.390
 it's there on the screen and on the guy's face 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:22.390
 that means the franchise end of 2011 may 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:32.619
 be a year old said 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:38.860
 so duty to decide the coolest in 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:40.210
 net close knows it will not be ignored but 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.799
 I'm sure the vest 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.520
 fire 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.250
 hoff in the guy 's face for that 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.030
 Fuck, it 's a cool thing, you can. 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.649
 swim away with this poetic way 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.930
 You're scared but the team is going to be 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.420
 Normal everyone can use well what 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.100
 solve is this you can see the plan for 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.100
 that's what i was told said 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:11.009
 so I belly you go up all over 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:11.009
 world if possible
