 was born in Germany and 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.760
 grown up with an Afghan

 Father and a German mother is that 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.260
 Project also a personal concern 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.160
 I am very important that you see stop 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.539
 how much fun it is 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.890
 to work together and though one 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.489
 Something is still somehow 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.739
 all are the same 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.850
 That's why the children are involved 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.740
 and have so much with it 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.350
 Examined and the food case 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.119
 action before the big show starts 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.070
 is more exciting and fun for the students 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.460
 intensive workshop day before 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.530
 Let's start with the first rehearsal 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.140
 the stage and like the real models over 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.330
 the catwalk profi rebecca tells me 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.830
 a few more tips and tricks and 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.840
 is studying with the adolescents 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.950
 choreography 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.630
 64 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.810
 Yes 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.810
 exactly 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.760
 so right with roses and 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.710
 hip swing impression and it is 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.030
 quite a lot but still without a job 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.130
 do it really well at the show 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.390
 will rebecca me a whole 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.650
 day time taken with the 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.090
 to practice adolescents 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.310
 get the support 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.130
 young models also from two dancers 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.530
 the flying steps family from berlin with 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.160
 they present costumes from 14 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.500
 countries 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.520
 Integration will be on the catwalk 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.860
 brought integration is important because 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.149
 we with many cultures in ours 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.590
 living together and society 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.020
 have to deal with each other 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.730
 that sounds so negative now i would 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.830
 rather than enriching it because it is 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.120
 just the variety shows and easy 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.290
 an exciting thing is about the 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.000
 different countries too much too 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.240
 experience 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.420
 behind the scenes all kids are vips 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.190
 Photo shooting 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.100
 Here the adolescents come to their star 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.800
 again very close to the photo shoot 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.810
 directly into the show here rises the 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.810
 mood in front of and behind the stage 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.420
 I am very pleased 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.709
 I am looking forward to my departure at the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.160
 I was a bit upset rehearsing though 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.080
 Now everything's okay while the 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.030
 Adolescents can walk on the catwalk 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.209
 show me rebecca moderates 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.380
 country-specific outfits on and gives 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.130
 background information to the countries from the 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.340
 They come from 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.340
 different 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.769
 cultural diversity and a common 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.980
 motto integration needs faire 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.980
 education opportunities 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.819
 very excited but otherwise it was 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.310
 actually expensive it has been very nice 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:15.670
 It felt really great ! 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.670
