00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
those precursors to eruptions but we've

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.880 
those precursors to eruptions but we've
seen<00:01:39.920> similar<00:01:40.220> things<00:01:41.440> on<00:01:42.440> a<00:01:42.500> few<00:01:42.770> occasions

over the last few decades and so far

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.070 
over the last few decades and so far
they've<00:01:46.940> not<00:01:47.120> led<00:01:47.330> to<00:01:47.360> an<00:01:47.660> eruption

they've not led to an eruption

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.020 
they've not led to an eruption
so<00:01:48.790> we<00:01:49.790> could<00:01:50.000> say<00:01:50.270> Katla<00:01:51.230> Merritt<00:01:51.650> but<00:01:52.640> then

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
so we could say Katla Merritt but then

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:59.080 
so we could say Katla Merritt but then
again<00:01:53.150> there<00:01:53.690> is<00:01:54.220> it<00:01:55.220> may<00:01:55.490> take<00:01:56.000> years<00:01:56.300> even<00:01:58.090> in

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090
