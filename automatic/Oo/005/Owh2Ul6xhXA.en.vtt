00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:10.590
 Hi 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.910
 we are again with photo tip 10 oh and this 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.320
 times aperture 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.030
 I've heard quite often and I 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.450
 try to be as clear as possible 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.090
 to lay 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.410
 The all kinds of examples story is in 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.119
 the beginning a bit technical until he 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.340
 We naturally to them briefly as possible 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.590
 technical part and after that I see 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.180
 based on photos and also briefly 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.970
 a short demonstration 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.890
 we go outside with the whole wild animals 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.070
 do feel dangerous dangerous photo 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.860
 typical of this but with an example 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.140
 outside of how aperture works to that 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.090
 to demonstrate your flight well 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.270
 I have a lens here for you that lens 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.969
 now on a very small aperture 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.460
 know you at apertures is team and if you 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.129
 looks well into the lens 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.809
 you also see a small hole 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.129
 means a small maho freight 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.109
 number 16 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.730
 He fool diaphragm crank a 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.010
 hand of the lens 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.140
 then he goes to a point 8 than you 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.720
 your lens over appearance 3 point 5 you so eh 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.960
 well you see that it is really huge 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.040
 opening has become that is aperture 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:19.759
 is yet to show any steps to 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:22.500
 more confidence again curry on hold 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.540
 locoroco de 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.310
 and there is also aperture and fun story 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.560
 with those borrowers opening but what can I do 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.270
 with it was also tell you draw with 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.729
 to make training sessions against one 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.680
 with your light and two with your creativity 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.750
 first let's get the functional it lies 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.750
 just unpack the brain of course 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.360
 the bag as lens opening is very large 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.100
 that also in dark environments 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.670
 if it is a bit dark then i will 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.530
 good photography is very light 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.320
 then also go a small aperture 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.810
 because yes anne I highlight my 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.149
 picture very quickly 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.939
 so that there it is handy for or for 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.170
 for aperture purely now photo good too 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.329
 can illuminate to all kinds 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.520
 different circumstances it 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.140
 creative is also very nice because what 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.790
 happens 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.250
 for example, with an aperture of two 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.660
 point behind them large aperture 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.420
 you set your device screen for example 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.250
 on a model help your face and then put 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.990
 your eyes naturally sharp and then 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.630
 you will see that you fertile of 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.450
 tape figured that out behind a whole 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.730
 environment the back question is therefore like 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.800
 the true thing you want to show you 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.040
 that is reflected in the photo and what 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:36.140
 it is not important that it becomes more vague 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.110
 yes you are good so back but we 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.270
 have a very spectacular one here 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.470
 formation are from here and a goose 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.570
 a goose there 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.239
 then we go along with beautiful photos 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.800
 make you have beautiful pictures it goes 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.530
 of course to the depth of field 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.690
 so we're going to take two photos 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.670
 the first photo is totally awful 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.220
 sharp and goose two 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.590
 out of focus and then we take a picture 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.360
 both the whole heart they are protected 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.840
 him up 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.510
 but now look at how exposures 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:11.570
 3.2 apertures and I had to 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.049
 use a shutter speed of a 600 40th 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:18.010
 and then we print neatly so take off 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.579
 this photo and hind goose is indeed 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.310
 out of focus 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:24.350
 now we turn it around he comes 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.739
 no longer on both geese I want 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.790
 sharp so I'm going to give my one a little 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:35.000
 aperture 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:36.280
 so go to 16 empire in 116 and 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.440
 then you will see how i am with my 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.220
 Shutter really a bit down 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.709
 he must get up and 600 40th and mine 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.790
 my time now lights up that 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.820
 my 30th 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.769
 that he then just exposure okay we go 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:54.590
 just focus then I mean now 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.840
 on the back goose that is now one 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.980
 visor hearts in the sharp and center 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.830
 30th 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.209
 and a diaphragm of sixteen and I press 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.290
 off 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:08.810
 and both the geese are sharp 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.400
 aperture and shutter speed there are two 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.560
 things that are very close together 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.730
 collaborate 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.830
 then I recommend using a 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.669
 light meter and immediately to an example 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.930
 Outside 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:20.720
 he we see how that exactly 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.550
 dance works in this light meter I show you 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.840
 see how shutter speed and aperture with 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.960
 work together 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.210
 take a light measurement and you'll see 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:32.690
 that I have one that you adopt my process team 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:35.180
 point 9 but are just to 22nd because that 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.000
 we find recognizable number so I one 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.130
 very small aperture 22 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.889
 We see that I on a shutter 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.289
 half the second I see my you 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.880
 opening up more freight than is possible 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:47.539
 I also go with faster shutter speeds 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.270
 Brands 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.800
 so I'm going a step lower so that here 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.870
 for my go a diaphragm of 16 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.389
 I have a shutter speed of photography 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:58.970
 the fourth of a second and start 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.710
 aperture of 11 then I can come one 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.419
 Photographing eighth of a second 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.919
 now we continue in the two point 8 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.560
 and if I have an aperture of two 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.599
 can shoot 8 if that is a whole 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.479
 large aperture 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:15.530
 I can set my shutter speed of 125th 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.970
 to photograph 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.620
 because I just met you with the light meter me 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.840
 show that I went into practice now 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.060
 with these two giants 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.610
 already with the geese are now sharp the coming 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.580
 because they can use aperture of 16 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:32.630
 so front and rear will be equally sharp the 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:35.360
 Shutter speed here is a 30th so now I go 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:37.070
 diaphragm I'm going to keep them down 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.110
 work with a large aperture so I go 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.300
 to 3 point five 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.700
 and I want to keep the front goose sharp 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.979
 what you see now is that the image 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.990
 so completely overexposed is the 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:51.380
 I have to compensate for the shutter speed 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:54.680
 that goes from a 30th to that once 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.180
 had to look from behind it next to the 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.099
 again well exposed only the difference 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.530
 with one image and the other image 

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:02.449
 that now only the front edge is sharp 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.400
 and the rear goose 

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.790
 has become out of focus lungs aperture 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.520
 from 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:13.340
 not point 5 boys would be the photo shoot 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:18.590
 about what is going to happen in the pan you 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:21.200
 may you now see 10 examples where 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.970
 I diaphragm is used deliberately 

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.210
 here you can also see the aperture position 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:28.550
 you also see you appear in the photo 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.560
 and first photos are those in 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:32.480
 landscape photos because there used want 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.800
 the small apertures between aperture 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:39.200
 16 or a diaphragm 22 and the last one 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.400
 five photos and photos but I a big one 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.400
 aperture applied 

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:07.850
 Yes Yes 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.850
 Yes 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.860
 during our prototype 10 about aperture 

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:20.629
 I hope she learned a lot from it 

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.530
 and I hope so far next time 

00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:24.310
 see again 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:24.310
 until next time 

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.050
 Oh 

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.050
 l 

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.370
 you
