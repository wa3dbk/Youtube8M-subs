okay<00:00:03.529> I've<00:00:04.529> had<00:00:04.710> people<00:00:04.980> ask<00:00:05.310> me<00:00:05.549> how<00:00:05.730> I<00:00:05.759> put

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
okay I've had people ask me how I put

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.890 
okay I've had people ask me how I put
this<00:00:06.180> car<00:00:06.450> tire<00:00:06.750> on<00:00:07.020> this<00:00:07.200> thing<00:00:11.599> I'll<00:00:12.599> start

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
this car tire on this thing I'll start

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.720 
this car tire on this thing I'll start
with<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.049> frame<00:00:13.380> first<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:13.980> got<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.219> take<00:00:14.400> that<00:00:14.580> in

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
with a frame first I got to take that in

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.140 
with a frame first I got to take that in
considerations<00:00:15.740> you<00:00:16.740> can<00:00:16.920> either<00:00:17.100> build<00:00:17.850> your

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
considerations you can either build your

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.890 
considerations you can either build your
frame<00:00:18.449> or<00:00:18.900> add-on<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.830> your<00:00:19.859> existing<00:00:20.900> cradle

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
frame or add-on to your existing cradle

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.960 
frame or add-on to your existing cradle
I<00:00:22.109> found<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.920> easier<00:00:23.250> just<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.519> go<00:00:23.580> ahead<00:00:23.760> and

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
I found it easier just to go ahead and

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.279 
I found it easier just to go ahead and
build<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.330> frame<00:00:26.359> which<00:00:27.359> really<00:00:27.900> wasn't<00:00:28.140> that

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
build the frame which really wasn't that

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.209 
build the frame which really wasn't that
difficult<00:00:30.470> what<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.500> did<00:00:31.740> is<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.980> took<00:00:32.009> some

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
difficult what I did is I took some

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.720 
difficult what I did is I took some
half-inch<00:00:33.320> concrete<00:00:34.320> reinforcement<00:00:34.920> rod<00:00:35.280> and

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
half-inch concrete reinforcement rod and

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.709 
half-inch concrete reinforcement rod and
bent<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.030> around<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.510> stock<00:00:36.780> frame<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:38.690> after<00:00:39.690> I

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
bent it around a stock frame and after I

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.600 
bent it around a stock frame and after I
got<00:00:39.930> through<00:00:40.140> with<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.980> was<00:00:41.100> basically<00:00:41.489> a

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
got through with that it was basically a

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.350 
got through with that it was basically a
jig

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
jig

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.279 
jig
I<00:00:42.390> took<00:00:42.629> my<00:00:43.020> tubing<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.800> bent<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.160> around

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:48.289 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.479 

the<00:00:49.289> rod<00:00:51.829> so<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.949> got<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.160> taking

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
the rod so you got to taking

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.209 
the rod so you got to taking
consideration<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.809> back<00:00:55.020> here<00:00:55.590> when<00:00:56.190> you're

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
consideration the back here when you're

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.529 
consideration the back here when you're
putting<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.670> big<00:00:56.850> tire<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.829> first<00:00:58.829> off

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
putting the big tire on it first off

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.579 
putting the big tire on it first off
this<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:00.600> just<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.020> regular<00:01:01.230> old<00:01:01.430> board<00:01:02.430> rim<00:01:03.589> it

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
this is just a regular old board rim it

this is just a regular old board rim it
has<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.769> three<00:01:05.070> inch<00:01:05.250> hole<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.030> just

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
has a three inch hole in it and I just

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.410 
has a three inch hole in it and I just
took<00:01:06.479> some<00:01:06.869> pipe<00:01:07.530> actually<00:01:08.369> my<00:01:08.850> clothes<00:01:09.119> line
