hello and welcome to another modeling
video<00:00:04.190> today<00:00:05.190> I'm<00:00:05.430> going<00:00:05.640> to<00:00:05.759> share<00:00:06.029> the

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
video today I'm going to share the

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.740 
video today I'm going to share the
secret<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:07.280> texturing<00:00:08.280> plastic<00:00:08.970> which<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.570> have

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
secret to texturing plastic which I have

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.830 
secret to texturing plastic which I have
done<00:00:10.050> to<00:00:10.290> my<00:00:10.440> sake<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:11.250> kid<00:00:11.580> which<00:00:12.030> was<00:00:12.059> entered

done to my sake to kid which was entered

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.779 
done to my sake to kid which was entered
in<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.280> Vegeta<00:00:14.509> 8259<00:00:15.509> competition<00:00:16.440> and

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
in the Vegeta 8259 competition and

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.700 
in the Vegeta 8259 competition and
received<00:00:17.789> an<00:00:18.150> honorable<00:00:18.779> mention<00:00:18.930> because<00:00:19.350> of

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
received an honorable mention because of

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.300 
received an honorable mention because of
it<00:00:19.939> not<00:00:20.939> much<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.869> secret<00:00:22.289> so<00:00:22.619> let's<00:00:22.980> check

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
it not much of the secret so let's check

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.070 
it not much of the secret so let's check
it<00:00:23.430> out

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.600 

when<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:28.830> think<00:00:29.340> about<00:00:29.429> Zeon<00:00:30.119> heat<00:00:30.539> weapons<00:00:30.990> I

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
when I think about Zeon heat weapons I

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:34.790 
when I think about Zeon heat weapons I
imagine<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.960> there's<00:00:33.960> heat<00:00:34.320> filament

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
imagine that there's heat filament

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.319 
imagine that there's heat filament
inside<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.520> actual<00:00:35.850> object<00:00:36.470> which<00:00:38.030> turns<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
inside the actual object which turns the

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.049 
inside the actual object which turns the
entire<00:00:39.449> metal<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.530> an<00:00:40.680> almost<00:00:40.949> molting<00:00:41.670> effect

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
entire metal to an almost molting effect

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.229 
entire metal to an almost molting effect
which<00:00:42.329> can<00:00:42.629> cut<00:00:42.899> through<00:00:43.230> other<00:00:43.860> metal<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.940> I

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
which can cut through other metal and I

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.170 
which can cut through other metal and I
imagine<00:00:45.839> this<00:00:46.350> would<00:00:46.680> actually<00:00:46.949> warp<00:00:47.879> and

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
imagine this would actually warp and

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.689 
imagine this would actually warp and
distort<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.290> blade<00:00:49.559> which<00:00:50.010> will<00:00:50.250> require

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
distort the blade which will require

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.139 
distort the blade which will require
regular<00:00:51.890> sharpening<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.519> I'm<00:00:53.610> going<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.909> try

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
regular sharpening so I'm going to try

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.759 
regular sharpening so I'm going to try
to<00:00:54.210> replicate<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.710> effect

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
to replicate this effect

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.099 
to replicate this effect
first<00:00:58.769> I<00:00:59.159> will<00:00:59.399> sharpen<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.970> blade<00:01:00.239> using<00:01:00.690> a

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
first I will sharpen the blade using a

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.560 
first I will sharpen the blade using a
file<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:03.170> followed<00:01:04.170> by<00:01:04.559> holding<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.850> actual

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
file and followed by holding the actual

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.100 
file and followed by holding the actual
blade<00:01:06.780> over<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.350> headed<00:01:07.679> surface<00:01:08.190> and

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
blade over a headed surface and

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.790 
blade over a headed surface and
distorting<00:01:10.110> its<00:01:10.500> appearance<00:01:12.320> be<00:01:13.320> extremely

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
distorting its appearance be extremely

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.540 
distorting its appearance be extremely
careful<00:01:14.280> when<00:01:14.460> literally<00:01:15.270> playing<00:01:15.720> with<00:01:15.990> fire

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
careful when literally playing with fire

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.109 
careful when literally playing with fire
to<00:01:17.550> keep<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.970> steady<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.970> using<00:01:20.970> this

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
to keep it steady on using this

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.010 
to keep it steady on using this
extremely<00:01:21.690> ugly<00:01:22.050> candle<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.830> found<00:01:23.160> and<00:01:24.020> unlike

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
extremely ugly candle I found and unlike

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.260 
extremely ugly candle I found and unlike
what<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.229> did<00:01:25.590> hold<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.130> quite<00:01:26.490> far<00:01:26.850> away<00:01:27.060> from

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
what I did hold it quite far away from

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.950 
what I did hold it quite far away from
the<00:01:27.899> flame<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.830> you<00:01:29.399> will<00:01:29.520> see<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.940> slowly<00:01:30.509> but

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
the flame and you will see it slowly but

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.229

I<00:02:25.540> stole<00:02:26.540> this<00:02:26.720> technique<00:02:27.290> from<00:02:27.590> a<00:02:27.800> hobby

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
I stole this technique from a hobby

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.119 
I stole this technique from a hobby
Japan<00:02:28.730> or<00:02:29.450> a<00:02:29.510> Dengeki<00:02:30.170> hobby<00:02:30.410> a<00:02:30.560> little<00:02:30.920> while

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
Japan or a Dengeki hobby a little while

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.320 
Japan or a Dengeki hobby a little while
ago<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.790> believe<00:02:32.390> it's<00:02:32.569> an<00:02:32.720> older<00:02:32.989> edition<00:02:33.530> and

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
ago I believe it's an older edition and

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.390 
ago I believe it's an older edition and
discovered<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:35.540> Tamiya<00:02:36.200> basic<00:02:36.709> type<00:02:37.069> putty

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
discovered that Tamiya basic type putty

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
discovered that Tamiya basic type putty
is<00:02:37.849> soluble<00:02:38.420> in<00:02:38.769> like<00:02:39.769> a<00:02:39.800> thinner<00:02:40.160> that's<00:02:40.849> what

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
is soluble in like a thinner that's what

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.589 
is soluble in like a thinner that's what
it's<00:02:41.569> based<00:02:41.840> in<00:02:42.080> and<00:02:42.349> how<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.400> sets<00:02:43.670> on<00:02:43.910> styrene

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
it's based in and how it sets on styrene

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.800 
it's based in and how it sets on styrene
so<00:02:44.959> well<00:02:45.280> so<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.400> plans<00:02:46.700> this<00:02:47.030> time<00:02:47.360> is<00:02:47.569> to

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
so well so the plans this time is to

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.640 
so well so the plans this time is to
thin<00:02:48.200> down<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:49.790> putty<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:50.720> a<00:02:50.750> consistency<00:02:51.410> of

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
thin down the putty to a consistency of

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.449 
thin down the putty to a consistency of
a<00:02:52.069> thick<00:02:52.209> paint<00:02:53.209> and<00:02:53.569> to<00:02:54.410> stipple<00:02:54.890> it<00:02:55.040> on<00:02:55.190> to

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
a thick paint and to stipple it on to

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:58.630 
a thick paint and to stipple it on to
create<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:55.849> lumpy<00:02:56.840> texture<00:02:57.410> of<00:02:57.769> cast-iron

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
create the lumpy texture of cast-iron

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.220 
create the lumpy texture of cast-iron
metal<00:03:00.310> this<00:03:01.310> techniques<00:03:01.910> a<00:03:02.120> no-brainer<00:03:02.750> and

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
metal this techniques a no-brainer and

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.530 
metal this techniques a no-brainer and
there's<00:03:03.560> a<00:03:03.650> very<00:03:04.130> little<00:03:04.370> chance<00:03:04.670> of<00:03:04.940> anything

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
there's a very little chance of anything

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.650 
there's a very little chance of anything
actually<00:03:05.870> going<00:03:06.560> wrong<00:03:06.860> so<00:03:07.420> definitely<00:03:08.420> give

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
actually going wrong so definitely give

that<00:06:41.879> you<00:06:41.939> just<00:06:42.169> go<00:06:43.169> out<00:06:43.409> and<00:06:43.639> experiment<00:06:44.639> or

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:44.849 
that you just go out and experiment or

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:46.939 
that you just go out and experiment or
do<00:06:44.999> anything<00:06:45.299> that<00:06:45.599> comes<00:06:45.899> out<00:06:46.139> to<00:06:46.169> mind<00:06:46.589> or

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:46.949 
do anything that comes out to mind or

do anything that comes out to mind or
whatever<00:06:47.189> your<00:06:47.639> imagination<00:06:48.439> can<00:06:49.439> master

a personal feel to your kit is a great
idea<00:07:07.649> I<00:07:08.189> added<00:07:08.879> a<00:07:08.999> few<00:07:09.029> bits<00:07:09.809> of<00:07:09.989> odd<00:07:10.199> damage

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:10.649 
idea I added a few bits of odd damage

00:07:10.649 --> 00:07:12.379 
idea I added a few bits of odd damage
around<00:07:10.949> the<00:07:11.099> head<00:07:11.369> because<00:07:11.729> I<00:07:11.849> believe<00:07:12.149> that's

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:12.389 
around the head because I believe that's

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:15.769 
around the head because I believe that's
where<00:07:12.629> the<00:07:12.809> eyes<00:07:13.079> are<00:07:13.110> attracted<00:07:13.949> to<00:07:14.129> and<00:07:14.779> just

00:07:15.769 --> 00:07:15.779 
where the eyes are attracted to and just

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:19.189 
where the eyes are attracted to and just
do<00:07:16.079> whatever<00:07:16.429> fancies<00:07:17.429> you<00:07:17.639> and<00:07:17.909> whatever<00:07:18.839> way

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:19.199
