have to check these virgin like this

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.170 
have to check these virgin like this
well<00:01:06.740> the<00:01:06.860> biggest<00:01:07.010> reason<00:01:07.190> is<00:01:07.670> because<00:01:07.880> with

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
well the biggest reason is because with

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.940 
well the biggest reason is because with
these<00:01:08.300> tightly<00:01:08.690> regulated<00:01:08.960> goose<00:01:09.530> seasons

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
these tightly regulated goose seasons

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.800 
these tightly regulated goose seasons
that<00:01:10.070> were<00:01:10.220> expressing<00:01:10.610> nowadays<00:01:11.180> you<00:01:11.720> know

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
that were expressing nowadays you know

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.980 
that were expressing nowadays you know
we<00:01:11.960> just<00:01:11.990> need<00:01:12.260> to<00:01:12.560> keep<00:01:12.740> a<00:01:13.010> real<00:01:13.520> close<00:01:13.990> watch

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
we just need to keep a real close watch

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.960 
we just need to keep a real close watch
on<00:01:15.320> how<00:01:15.650> many<00:01:15.710> of<00:01:16.130> the<00:01:16.310> different<00:01:16.430> subspecies

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
on how many of the different subspecies

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.609 
on how many of the different subspecies
are<00:01:17.119> being<00:01:17.360> harvested<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:18.050> in<00:01:18.110> particular

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
are being harvested and in particular

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.650 
are being harvested and in particular
those<00:01:18.770> fifties<00:01:19.250> because<00:01:20.060> everything<00:01:20.479> is

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
those fifties because everything is

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.620 
those fifties because everything is
generated<00:01:21.229> by<00:01:21.350> these<00:01:21.410> pesky<00:01:21.800> quotas<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.630> and

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
generated by these pesky quotas and and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.330 
generated by these pesky quotas and and
once<00:01:24.200> we<00:01:24.320> reach<00:01:24.350> those<00:01:24.619> quarters<00:01:25.040> of<00:01:25.160> course

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
once we reach those quarters of course

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.180 
once we reach those quarters of course
the<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.700> goose<00:01:25.850> season<00:01:26.180> is<00:01:26.270> closed<00:01:26.570> but<00:01:27.190> we

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:28.190 
the the goose season is closed but we

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.830 
the the goose season is closed but we
just<00:01:28.490> really<00:01:28.790> need<00:01:28.940> to<00:01:29.030> keep<00:01:29.150> a<00:01:29.270> close<00:01:29.450> handle

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
just really need to keep a close handle

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.090 
just really need to keep a close handle
on<00:01:29.900> that<00:01:30.110> so<00:01:30.259> we<00:01:30.350> know<00:01:30.470> what<00:01:30.619> the<00:01:30.710> make<00:01:30.890> up<00:01:31.009> in

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
on that so we know what the make up in

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.469 
on that so we know what the make up in
the<00:01:31.160> harvest<00:01:31.490> is<00:01:31.670> and<00:01:31.850> what's<00:01:32.000> going<00:01:32.210> on<00:01:32.300> out

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
the harvest is and what's going on out

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.920 
the harvest is and what's going on out
there<00:01:32.509> in<00:01:32.660> the<00:01:32.810> field<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:33.729> this<00:01:34.729> one<00:01:34.970> is<00:01:35.180> an

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
there in the field and this one is an

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.960 
there in the field and this one is an
adult<00:01:36.790> male<00:01:39.250> well<00:01:40.250> then<00:01:40.399> measure<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:40.850> total

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
adult male well then measure the total

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.910 
adult male well then measure the total
length<00:01:41.240> of<00:01:41.360> the<00:01:41.450> bill<00:01:41.660> so<00:01:42.380> why<00:01:42.560> on<00:01:42.619> earth<00:01:42.710> you

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
length of the bill so why on earth you

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.499 
length of the bill so why on earth you
measure<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.250> bill<00:01:43.430> I<00:01:43.729> mean<00:01:44.180> that's<00:01:44.360> something

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
measure the bill I mean that's something

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.529 
measure the bill I mean that's something
that's<00:01:44.750> impossible<00:01:44.990> to<00:01:45.320> on<00:01:45.440> the<00:01:45.560> field<00:01:45.800> and

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
that's impossible to on the field and

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.880 
that's impossible to on the field and
the<00:01:47.539> biggest<00:01:47.810> thing<00:01:47.990> for<00:01:48.020> us<00:01:48.229> is<00:01:48.440> it<00:01:48.560> comes<00:01:48.740> in

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
the biggest thing for us is it comes in

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.430 
the biggest thing for us is it comes in
here<00:01:49.039> it's<00:01:49.310> just<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.610> real<00:01:50.360> good<00:01:50.630> way<00:01:50.840> for<00:01:51.140> us<00:01:51.289> to

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
here it's just a real good way for us to

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.410 
here it's just a real good way for us to
break<00:01:51.619> it<00:01:51.800> out<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.250> subspecies<00:01:54.009> it's<00:01:55.420> yeah

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
break it out to the subspecies it's yeah

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.029 
break it out to the subspecies it's yeah
it's<00:01:56.600> part<00:01:56.840> of<00:01:56.899> the<00:01:57.050> legal<00:01:57.319> definition<00:01:57.470> that's

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 
it's part of the legal definition that's

00:01:58.039 --> 00:02:01.930 
it's part of the legal definition that's
adopted<00:01:58.580> by<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.789> states<00:01:59.240> to<00:02:00.670> classify<00:02:01.670> birds

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
adopted by the states to classify birds

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.419 
adopted by the states to classify birds
to<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:02.420> dusky<00:02:02.840> subspecies<00:02:03.289> and<00:02:04.100> also

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
to a dusky subspecies and also

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.550 
to a dusky subspecies and also
scientifically<00:02:05.179> the<00:02:05.300> Coleman<00:02:05.750> is<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.350> best

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
scientifically the Coleman is the best

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.949 
scientifically the Coleman is the best
criteria<00:02:07.190> to<00:02:07.280> use<00:02:07.310> okay<00:02:08.030> there<00:02:08.509> is<00:02:08.660> a<00:02:08.690> little

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
criteria to use okay there is a little

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.380 
criteria to use okay there is a little
bit<00:02:09.140> of<00:02:09.259> overlap<00:02:09.590> on<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.069> bill<00:02:10.789> measurement

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
bit of overlap on the bill measurement

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.030 
bit of overlap on the bill measurement
between<00:02:11.540> other<00:02:11.900> subspecies<00:02:12.440> and<00:02:12.740> that's<00:02:12.890> why

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
between other subspecies and that's why

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.800 
between other subspecies and that's why
we<00:02:13.190> don't<00:02:13.310> just<00:02:13.430> rely<00:02:13.819> upon<00:02:13.940> that<00:02:14.330> we<00:02:14.540> look<00:02:14.720> at

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
we don't just rely upon that we look at

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:15.250 
we don't just rely upon that we look at
the<00:02:14.930> color

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
the color

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.870 
the color
we'll<00:02:15.740> look<00:02:15.830> at<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.100> length<00:02:16.280> of<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.520> leg<00:02:16.700> bone

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
we'll look at the length of the leg bone

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.980 
we'll look at the length of the leg bone
and<00:02:17.180> this<00:02:17.990> one<00:02:18.200> is<00:02:18.350> twenty<00:02:18.650> nine<00:02:18.680> point<00:02:19.160> nine

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
and this one is twenty nine point nine

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.440 
and this one is twenty nine point nine
so<00:02:20.990> by<00:02:21.709> virtue<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.069> the<00:02:22.220> fact<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.550> this<00:02:22.819> beat

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
so by virtue of the fact that this beat

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.490 
so by virtue of the fact that this beat
is<00:02:23.800> 32<00:02:24.800> millimeters<00:02:25.370> or<00:02:25.520> less<00:02:26.200> it's<00:02:27.200> a

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
is 32 millimeters or less it's a

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.870 
is 32 millimeters or less it's a
tackling<00:02:28.250> Canada<00:02:28.790> goose<00:02:29.560> Susilo<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:31.760> we'll

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
tackling Canada goose Susilo and we'll

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:58.760 
tackling Canada goose Susilo and we'll
do<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.060> breast<00:02:32.180> color
