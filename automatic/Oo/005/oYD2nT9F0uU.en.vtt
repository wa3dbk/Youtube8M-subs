00:06:22.179 --> 00:06:22.189 
having my transmission right away will

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:24.920 
having my transmission right away will
let<00:06:23.189> me<00:06:23.370> run<00:06:24.000> this<00:06:24.180> thing<00:06:24.389> for<00:06:24.629> a<00:06:24.659> little<00:06:24.840> bit

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
let me run this thing for a little bit

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:26.360 
let me run this thing for a little bit
and<00:06:25.110> see<00:06:25.319> if<00:06:25.409> it<00:06:25.560> actually<00:06:25.590> leaks

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
and see if it actually leaks

and see if it actually leaks
I<00:06:26.840> know<00:06:27.840> this<00:06:27.960> white<00:06:28.289> seal<00:06:28.740> is<00:06:29.039> kind<00:06:29.310> of<00:06:29.400> a

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
I know this white seal is kind of a

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.860 
I know this white seal is kind of a
little<00:06:30.110> goofy<00:06:31.110> a<00:06:31.139> little<00:06:31.379> bit<00:06:32.449> so<00:06:33.449> I'm<00:06:33.509> hoping

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:33.870 
little goofy a little bit so I'm hoping

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:43.010 
little goofy a little bit so I'm hoping
that<00:06:34.080> just<00:06:34.520> works<00:06:35.520> itself<00:06:36.030> overtime<00:06:36.840> I<00:06:42.020> can't

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
that just works itself overtime I can't

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.589 
that just works itself overtime I can't
go<00:06:43.199> to<00:06:43.229> a<00:06:43.800> certain<00:06:44.550> feel<00:06:47.150> gonna<00:06:48.150> feel<00:06:48.389> where

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:48.599 
go to a certain feel gonna feel where

00:06:48.599 --> 00:07:03.150 
go to a certain feel gonna feel where
it's<00:06:48.780> gonna<00:06:48.930> get<00:06:49.139> a<00:06:49.199> little<00:06:50.300> scary<00:06:51.300> you<00:06:51.690> know

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:03.160 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.820 

okay<00:07:04.420> don't<00:07:05.420> go<00:07:05.600> too<00:07:05.840> hard<00:07:06.110> there<00:07:06.590> are<00:07:06.650> tiny

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:06.830 
okay don't go too hard there are tiny

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.710 
okay don't go too hard there are tiny
threads<00:07:07.250> you<00:07:07.430> might<00:07:07.580> strip<00:07:07.910> them<00:07:08.060> so<00:07:08.570> I<00:07:08.600> think

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 
threads you might strip them so I think

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:09.880 
threads you might strip them so I think
that's<00:07:08.960> about<00:07:09.110> as<00:07:09.260> tight<00:07:09.410> as<00:07:09.560> that<00:07:09.590> will<00:07:09.770> go<00:07:09.860> on

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:09.890 
that's about as tight as that will go on

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:14.050 
that's about as tight as that will go on
that<00:07:10.990> and<00:07:11.990> then<00:07:12.280> these<00:07:13.280> I'm<00:07:13.700> not<00:07:13.730> going<00:07:14.000> to

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.060 
that and then these I'm not going to

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.350 
that and then these I'm not going to
tighten<00:07:14.420> down<00:07:14.710> right<00:07:15.710> away<00:07:15.860> cuz<00:07:16.400> I'm<00:07:17.060> doing

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 
tighten down right away cuz I'm doing

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.760 
tighten down right away cuz I'm doing

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:50.660 
whereas if you did it like an arranger

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:52.780 
whereas if you did it like an arranger
Explorer<00:07:51.320> an<00:07:51.560> s10<00:07:51.980> it's<00:07:52.190> a<00:07:52.220> bit<00:07:52.370> more<00:07:52.580> of<00:07:52.700> a

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:52.790 
Explorer an s10 it's a bit more of a

pain<00:07:53.300> in<00:07:53.390> the<00:07:53.420> butt<00:07:53.660> and<00:07:54.230> plus<00:07:54.560> my<00:07:54.770> trucks<00:07:55.040> a

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:55.130 
pain in the butt and plus my trucks a

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.950 
pain in the butt and plus my trucks a
two-wheel<00:07:55.430> drive<00:07:55.670> so<00:07:56.770> not<00:07:57.770> too<00:07:57.980> bad<00:07:58.010> of<00:07:58.190> a<00:07:58.370> deal

00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 
two-wheel drive so not too bad of a deal

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.970 
two-wheel drive so not too bad of a deal
but<00:07:59.960> yeah<00:08:00.470> there<00:08:00.680> we<00:08:00.800> go

00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:00.980 
but yeah there we go

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:06.690 
but yeah there we go
that<00:08:01.310> was<00:08:01.460> a<00:08:01.870> $48<00:08:02.870> gasket<00:08:03.470> from<00:08:04.370> autozone<00:08:05.470> so

00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:06.700 
that was a $48 gasket from autozone so

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.450 
that was a $48 gasket from autozone so
hopefully<00:08:07.700> it<00:08:08.060> lasts
