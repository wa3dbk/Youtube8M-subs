it's the EcoBoost 6-speed male trans for
the<00:00:27.270> Premium<00:00:27.539> Package<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:28.340> it<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.400> not<00:00:29.580> a

the Premium Package and it is not a
performance<00:00:30.000> package<00:00:30.360> so<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:30.840> have<00:00:31.110> the<00:00:31.440> 18

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
performance package so I have the 18

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.840 
performance package so I have the 18
inch<00:00:32.129> all<00:00:32.489> season<00:00:32.820> tires<00:00:34.550> one<00:00:35.550> thing<00:00:35.700> about

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
inch all season tires one thing about

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.620 
inch all season tires one thing about
the<00:00:35.970> form<00:00:36.239> spec<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.870> as<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.470> for<00:00:37.680> drive<00:00:37.860> modes

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:38.630 
the form spec is as the for drive modes

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.610 
the form spec is as the for drive modes
so<00:00:39.630> I<00:00:39.660> can<00:00:39.899> cycle<00:00:40.170> through<00:00:40.200> them<00:00:40.350> here<00:00:40.530> and

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
so I can cycle through them here and

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.950 
so I can cycle through them here and
shows<00:00:40.890> up<00:00:41.040> here<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:42.149> always<00:00:42.300> starts<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:42.630> normal

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
shows up here it always starts in normal

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.630 
shows up here it always starts in normal
and<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.320> pick<00:00:43.500> sport<00:00:44.899> track<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.640> we're

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
and you can pick sport track and we're

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.069 
and you can pick sport track and we're
gonna<00:00:47.760> start<00:00:48.059> into<00:00:48.270> snow<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.510> wet<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.960> see

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
gonna start into snow and wet and see

00:00:49.079 --> 00:01:06.260 
gonna start into snow and wet and see
how<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.290> does<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:50.960> let's<00:00:51.960> see<00:00:52.290> how<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.590> does

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.880 

so<00:01:07.270> a<00:01:07.570> little<00:01:08.350> bit<00:01:08.500> more<00:01:08.560> about<00:01:08.830> the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
so a little bit more about the

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.460 
so a little bit more about the

little<00:01:50.229> bit<00:01:50.350> of<00:01:50.410> a<00:01:50.500> squiggle<00:01:50.979> into<00:01:51.160> her<00:01:51.250> end

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
little bit of a squiggle into her end

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.719 
little bit of a squiggle into her end
and<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:53.289> traction<00:01:53.500> control<00:01:53.649> I<00:01:54.070> came<00:01:54.369> on<00:01:54.490> and

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
and the traction control I came on and

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.880 
and the traction control I came on and
getting<00:01:54.970> there<00:01:55.119> was<00:01:55.240> slip<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:56.619> other<00:01:56.800> than

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
getting there was slip but other than

that<00:01:56.979> not<00:01:57.369> much<00:01:57.610> happened<00:02:00.450> quick<00:02:02.160> brakes<00:02:03.160> tad

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
that not much happened quick brakes tad

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.480 
that not much happened quick brakes tad
there<00:02:03.670> so<00:02:04.149> the<00:02:04.300> ABS<00:02:04.600> kicks<00:02:04.810> in<00:02:05.080> I<00:02:05.320> mean<00:02:06.310> at<00:02:06.399> this

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
there so the ABS kicks in I mean at this

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.280 
there so the ABS kicks in I mean at this
point<00:02:06.580> it<00:02:06.850> drives<00:02:07.090> like<00:02:07.300> any<00:02:07.630> normal<00:02:07.900> car

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:08.290 
point it drives like any normal car

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.400 
point it drives like any normal car
would

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
would

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.570 
would
we're<00:02:11.130> gonna<00:02:11.250> take<00:02:11.460> some<00:02:11.600> twisted<00:02:12.600> turns<00:02:12.870> here

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
we're gonna take some twisted turns here

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.050 
we're gonna take some twisted turns here
see<00:02:14.580> how<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.730> does

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:28.260 

Oh<00:02:23.680> God<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:24.860> goose<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.069> little<00:02:25.400> bit<00:02:25.520> here

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.720 

so<00:02:29.770> it's<00:02:30.770> cutting<00:02:31.100> traction

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
so it's cutting traction

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.580 
so it's cutting traction
sorry<00:02:32.060> it's<00:02:32.210> cutting<00:02:32.450> power<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.930> little<00:02:33.170> bit<00:02:33.290> so

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
sorry it's cutting power a little bit so

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.770 
sorry it's cutting power a little bit so
that<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.950> Ren<00:02:34.160> doesn't<00:02:34.310> slide<00:02:34.610> out<00:02:34.640> I<00:02:35.150> did<00:02:35.750> a

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
that the Ren doesn't slide out I did a

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.880 
that the Ren doesn't slide out I did a
little<00:02:35.930> bit<00:02:36.080> there<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.320> I<00:02:36.350> backed<00:02:36.560> off<00:02:36.740> the

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
little bit there and I backed off the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.300 
little bit there and I backed off the
throttle<00:02:37.130> so<00:02:37.550> it's<00:02:37.700> not<00:02:37.880> to<00:02:38.030> be<00:02:38.120> too<00:02:38.330> crazy<00:02:39.310> but

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
throttle so it's not to be too crazy but

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.710 
throttle so it's not to be too crazy but
it's<00:02:40.610> doing<00:02:40.880> alright<00:02:41.150> let's<00:02:41.390> see<00:02:41.480> how<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.630> is

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
it's doing alright let's see how it is

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:53.760 
it's doing alright let's see how it is
the<00:02:41.900> turns

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.530 

so<00:02:54.310> obviously<00:02:54.670> this<00:02:54.850> is<00:02:54.910> going<00:02:55.150> to<00:02:55.240> be<00:02:55.300> mostly

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
so obviously this is going to be mostly

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.850 
so obviously this is going to be mostly
a<00:02:55.660> function<00:02:55.870> of<00:02:56.110> the<00:02:56.200> condition<00:02:56.500> of<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.620> tires

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
a function of the condition of the tires

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.200 
a function of the condition of the tires
now<00:02:57.070> so<00:02:57.220> much<00:02:57.340> of<00:02:57.400> the<00:02:57.580> drive<00:02:57.760> layout<00:02:58.710> but

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
now so much of the drive layout but

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:03.120 
now so much of the drive layout but
these<00:03:01.210> are<00:03:01.450> new<00:03:01.900> all<00:03:02.050> seasons<00:03:02.500> so<00:03:02.740> they're

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
these are new all seasons so they're

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.460 
these are new all seasons so they're
doing<00:03:03.340> just<00:03:03.520> fine<00:03:03.880> here<00:03:05.310> I'm<00:03:06.310> going<00:03:07.470> let's

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
doing just fine here I'm going let's

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.570 
doing just fine here I'm going let's
pretend<00:03:08.770> about<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.220> speed<00:03:09.400> limit<00:03:09.670> and<00:03:11.580> there

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
pretend about the speed limit and there

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.970 
pretend about the speed limit and there
might<00:03:12.760> be<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:12.910> little<00:03:13.450> bit<00:03:13.690> of<00:03:13.810> understeer<00:03:15.120> but

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
might be a little bit of understeer but

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:26.150 
might be a little bit of understeer but
it's<00:03:17.980> sticking<00:03:18.310> really<00:03:18.670> really<00:03:19.120> well<00:03:19.300> so

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.350 

we'll<00:03:27.160> compare<00:03:27.400> this<00:03:27.520> to<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.760> car<00:03:27.940> that<00:03:27.970> I<00:03:28.210> had

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
we'll compare this to the car that I had

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.800 
we'll compare this to the car that I had
mitla<00:03:28.690> prior<00:03:29.260> which<00:03:29.560> was<00:03:29.800> Saab<00:03:30.520> 92<00:03:30.850> X<00:03:31.090> is

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
mitla prior which was Saab 92 X is

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.610 
mitla prior which was Saab 92 X is
basically<00:03:32.020> a<00:03:32.320> Subaru<00:03:32.620> WRX<00:03:32.740> and

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.009 

I<00:03:35.680> would<00:03:36.310> say<00:03:36.519> good<00:03:36.940> all<00:03:37.120> season<00:03:37.480> tires<00:03:37.720> are

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
I would say good all season tires are

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.460 
I would say good all season tires are
doing<00:03:38.409> butter<00:03:39.250> in<00:03:39.640> this<00:03:40.569> car<00:03:40.840> then<00:03:41.290> they<00:03:41.409> were

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
doing butter in this car then they were

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.800 
doing butter in this car then they were
the<00:03:41.920> worn-out<00:03:42.310> all<00:03:43.000> seasons<00:03:43.480> would<00:03:43.599> Allah

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
the worn-out all seasons would Allah

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:47.910 
the worn-out all seasons would Allah
drive<00:03:44.110> in<00:03:44.290> that<00:03:44.440> car<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:46.140> with<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.349> drive

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
drive in that car and with the drive

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.220 
drive in that car and with the drive
modes<00:03:48.220> to<00:03:48.489> take<00:03:48.670> things<00:03:48.909> down<00:03:49.150> there's<00:03:49.900> really

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
modes to take things down there's really

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.770 
modes to take things down there's really
nothing<00:03:50.830> to<00:03:50.860> worry<00:03:51.129> about

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
nothing to worry about

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.250 
nothing to worry about
so<00:03:52.780> I<00:03:53.909> guess<00:03:54.909> my<00:03:55.120> immediate<00:03:55.569> conclusion<00:03:55.750> is

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
so I guess my immediate conclusion is

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.910 
so I guess my immediate conclusion is
the<00:03:56.890> 2015<00:03:57.790> Mustang<00:03:58.269> would<00:03:58.690> drive<00:03:59.290> modes<00:03:59.590> all

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
the 2015 Mustang would drive modes all

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.960 
the 2015 Mustang would drive modes all
seasons<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:01.420> snow<00:04:02.260> what<00:04:02.440> mode<00:04:02.650> it<00:04:03.400> does<00:04:03.700> just

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
seasons and snow what mode it does just

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.229 
seasons and snow what mode it does just
as<00:04:04.120> well<00:04:04.329> as<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.569> Debbie<00:04:04.720> Reich's<00:04:04.989> did<00:04:06.239> the

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
as well as the Debbie Reich's did the

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:08.910 
as well as the Debbie Reich's did the
only<00:04:07.390> difference<00:04:07.720> being<00:04:07.930> that<00:04:08.109> of<00:04:08.410> course<00:04:08.650> if

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
only difference being that of course if

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.740 
only difference being that of course if
I'm<00:04:09.069> on<00:04:09.190> ice<00:04:09.370> I<00:04:09.730> only<00:04:10.000> have<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.299> traction<00:04:10.540> with

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
I'm on ice I only have the traction with

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.530 
I'm on ice I only have the traction with
rear<00:04:10.930> tires<00:04:11.140> and<00:04:11.290> it's<00:04:11.500> not<00:04:11.650> gonna<00:04:12.540> accelerate

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
rear tires and it's not gonna accelerate

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.490 
rear tires and it's not gonna accelerate
as<00:04:13.780> well<00:04:15.449> but<00:04:16.449> in<00:04:16.570> terms<00:04:16.780> of<00:04:16.930> just<00:04:16.989> overall

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
as well but in terms of just overall

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.690 
as well but in terms of just overall
vehicle<00:04:17.709> safety<00:04:18.130> and<00:04:18.910> no<00:04:19.239> problems
