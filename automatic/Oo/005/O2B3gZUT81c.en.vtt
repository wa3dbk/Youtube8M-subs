00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880 

kay<00:00:00.240> let's<00:00:00.420> do<00:00:00.510> a<00:00:00.539> few<00:00:00.750> examples<00:00:00.810> on<00:00:01.469> rounding

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
kay let's do a few examples on rounding

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.100 
kay let's do a few examples on rounding
numbers<00:00:01.920> and<00:00:02.669> our<00:00:02.850> first<00:00:03.179> question<00:00:03.689> is<00:00:03.720> asking

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
numbers and our first question is asking

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.030 
numbers and our first question is asking
us<00:00:04.259> round<00:00:04.770> to<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.069> nearest<00:00:05.100> thousand<00:00:06.980> okay<00:00:07.980> so

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
us round to the nearest thousand okay so

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.390 
us round to the nearest thousand okay so
we<00:00:08.490> have<00:00:08.870> this<00:00:09.870> huge<00:00:10.260> number<00:00:10.410> right<00:00:11.040> here<00:00:12.290> so

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
we have this huge number right here so

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.090 
we have this huge number right here so
we<00:00:14.400> look<00:00:14.580> at<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:14.790> place<00:00:15.030> value<00:00:15.420> chart<00:00:15.450> and<00:00:16.100> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
we look at the place value chart and the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.279 
we look at the place value chart and the
two<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.640> in<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.600> ones<00:00:18.750> place<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.970> zero<00:00:20.970> is<00:00:21.480> in

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
two is in the ones place the zero is in

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.220 
two is in the ones place the zero is in
the<00:00:22.410> tenths<00:00:22.769> place<00:00:23.150> the<00:00:24.150> three<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.779> in<00:00:25.080> the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
the tenths place the three is in the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.960 
the tenths place the three is in the
hundreds<00:00:26.220> place<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:28.609> four<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
hundreds place and four is in the

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.870 
hundreds place and four is in the
thousand<00:00:30.570> plays<00:00:31.669> so<00:00:32.989> the<00:00:33.989> four<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.760> what<00:00:35.760> we

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
thousand plays so the four is what we

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.229 
thousand plays so the four is what we
try<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.149> round<00:00:36.480> two<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.160> we<00:00:38.160> look<00:00:38.399> at<00:00:38.489> four<00:00:38.850> we

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
try to round two so we look at four we

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.790 
try to round two so we look at four we
look<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.660> right<00:00:39.840> hand<00:00:40.050> side<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.410> four<00:00:40.649> is

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
look to the right hand side of four is

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.260 
look to the right hand side of four is
it<00:00:40.950> greater<00:00:41.190> than<00:00:41.340> five

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
it greater than five

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.160 
it greater than five
no<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.649> we<00:00:43.800> just<00:00:43.980> leave<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.809> we<00:00:45.809> will<00:00:45.930> make

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
no so we just leave it and we will make

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.670 
no so we just leave it and we will make
it<00:00:46.520> two<00:00:47.520> hundred<00:00:47.910> seventy<00:00:48.390> four<00:00:49.280> thousand<00:00:50.280> as

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
it two hundred seventy four thousand as

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.900 
it two hundred seventy four thousand as
our<00:00:52.680> final<00:00:53.100> answer<00:00:55.160> our<00:00:56.160> next<00:00:56.520> question<00:00:56.879> is

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
our final answer our next question is

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.250 
our final answer our next question is
asking<00:00:57.270> us<00:00:57.449> round<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> nearest<00:00:58.190> 10,000

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
asking us round to the nearest 10,000

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.340 
asking us round to the nearest 10,000
three<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:02.239> 1/5<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.270> tends<00:01:04.280> to<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.549> hundreds

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
three is 1/5 is tends to is hundreds

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.920 
three is 1/5 is tends to is hundreds
sixes<00:01:07.350> thousand<00:01:08.720> nine<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:10.760> 10,000<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.600> nine

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
sixes thousand nine is 10,000 so nine

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.530 
sixes thousand nine is 10,000 so nine
would<00:01:13.290> be<00:01:13.470> our<00:01:13.920> 10,000<00:01:14.790> place<00:01:15.979> and<00:01:17.390> then<00:01:18.390> once

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
would be our 10,000 place and then once

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.990 
would be our 10,000 place and then once
the<00:01:18.780> round<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.200> nearest<00:01:19.259> 10,000<00:01:20.220> we<00:01:20.820> look

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the round to the nearest 10,000 we look

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.929 
the round to the nearest 10,000 we look
to<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.240> right<00:01:21.360> hand<00:01:21.630> side<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:22.049> nine<00:01:22.549> and<00:01:24.470> is<00:01:25.939> it

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
to the right hand side of nine and is it

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.450 
to the right hand side of nine and is it
greater<00:01:27.150> than<00:01:27.390> five<00:01:27.689> yes<00:01:28.200> because<00:01:28.950> six<00:01:29.310> is

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
greater than five yes because six is

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.140 
greater than five yes because six is
greater<00:01:29.700> than<00:01:30.000> five<00:01:30.650> so<00:01:31.729> we<00:01:32.729> would<00:01:32.909> write<00:01:33.090> it

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
greater than five so we would write it

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:44.310 
greater than five so we would write it
out<00:01:34.310> 12<00:01:35.310> million<00:01:37.790> six<00:01:38.790> hundred<00:01:39.920> thousand

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.200 

as<00:01:44.380> our<00:01:45.190> answer<00:01:45.610> so<00:01:46.950> be<00:01:47.950> twelve<00:01:48.310> million<00:01:48.760> six

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
as our answer so be twelve million six

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.140 
as our answer so be twelve million six
hundred<00:01:49.300> thousand<00:01:50.050> as<00:01:50.229> a<00:01:50.260> final<00:01:50.770> answer<00:01:54.150> okay

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
hundred thousand as a final answer okay

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.740 
hundred thousand as a final answer okay
our<00:01:55.300> next<00:01:56.670> question<00:01:57.670> is<00:01:57.700> asking<00:01:58.090> us<00:01:58.270> out<00:01:58.570> to

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
our next question is asking us out to

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.380 
our next question is asking us out to
the<00:01:58.840> nearest<00:01:59.080> million

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
the nearest million

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.540 
the nearest million
okay<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.570> two<00:02:01.780> is<00:02:01.990> in<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.170> ones<00:02:02.530> three<00:02:03.490> is

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
okay the two is in the ones three is

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.550 
okay the two is in the ones three is
tens<00:02:04.110> nine<00:02:05.110> is<00:02:05.320> hundreds<00:02:05.830> nine<00:02:06.520> is<00:02:06.700> thousand

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
tens nine is hundreds nine is thousand

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.760 
tens nine is hundreds nine is thousand
eight<00:02:08.560> is<00:02:09.030> 10,003<00:02:11.130> is<00:02:12.130> hundred<00:02:12.550> thousand<00:02:13.770> the

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
eight is 10,003 is hundred thousand the

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.750 
eight is 10,003 is hundred thousand the
nine<00:02:15.070> is<00:02:15.430> in<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.060> millions<00:02:16.510> place<00:02:17.550> so<00:02:18.550> this

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
nine is in the millions place so this

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.960 
nine is in the millions place so this
nine<00:02:19.890> we<00:02:20.890> have<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.370> round<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:21.880> nearest

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
nine we have to round to the nearest

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.510 
nine we have to round to the nearest
million<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.680> we<00:02:23.770> look<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.070> right<00:02:24.160> hand

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
million and we look to the right hand

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.060 
million and we look to the right hand
side<00:02:24.790> is<00:02:25.209> it<00:02:25.900> greater<00:02:26.170> than<00:02:27.570> then<00:02:28.570> five<00:02:29.070> no

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
side is it greater than then five no

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.770 
side is it greater than then five no
three<00:02:30.580> is<00:02:30.700> not<00:02:30.910> greater<00:02:31.209> than<00:02:31.330> five<00:02:31.750> so<00:02:33.780> we

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
three is not greater than five so we

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:43.860 
three is not greater than five so we
would<00:02:34.930> just<00:02:34.959> make<00:02:35.350> it<00:02:37.230> 299<00:02:38.230> million<00:02:41.430> as<00:02:42.870> our

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
would just make it 299 million as our

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.620 
would just make it 299 million as our
final<00:02:44.320> answer<00:02:47.700> 299<00:02:48.700> million<00:02:48.970> is<00:02:49.120> our<00:02:49.180> final

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
final answer 299 million is our final

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:50.270 
final answer 299 million is our final
answer

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
answer

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.979 
answer
so<00:02:51.280> now<00:02:51.489> let's<00:02:51.730> move<00:02:51.880> on<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.180> a<00:02:52.209> few<00:02:52.450> exercise

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
so now let's move on to a few exercise

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.630 
so now let's move on to a few exercise
problems<00:02:53.410> we<00:02:53.560> understand<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.070> concept<00:02:54.519> what

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
problems we understand the concept what

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.450 
problems we understand the concept what
are<00:02:54.730> we<00:02:54.820> doing<00:02:55.150> here
