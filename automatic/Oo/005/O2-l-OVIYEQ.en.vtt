00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
then I slept on it while my hair was

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.679 
then I slept on it while my hair was
still<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.189> little<00:01:26.549> bit<00:01:26.759> damp<00:01:26.939> just<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.450> would

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
still a little bit damp just so I would

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.810 
still a little bit damp just so I would
get<00:01:27.810> some<00:01:28.049> texture<00:01:28.590> into<00:01:28.890> my<00:01:29.310> hair<00:01:29.520> because<00:01:29.759> my

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
get some texture into my hair because my

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.480 
get some texture into my hair because my
hair<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.210> very<00:01:30.240> straight<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.500> as<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.310> can<00:01:32.430> see

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
hair is very straight and as you can see

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.580 
hair is very straight and as you can see
sleeping<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.600> while<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.020> still<00:01:34.110> slightly

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
sleeping on it while it's still slightly

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.560 
sleeping on it while it's still slightly
damp<00:01:34.799> doesn't<00:01:35.549> really<00:01:35.670> do<00:01:35.880> much<00:01:36.000> for<00:01:36.060> my<00:01:36.329> hair

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
damp doesn't really do much for my hair

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.969 
damp doesn't really do much for my hair
because<00:01:36.750> my<00:01:36.780> hair<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.079> very<00:01:37.439> very<00:01:37.680> straight

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
because my hair is very very straight

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.910 
because my hair is very very straight
but<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.520> does<00:01:38.700> help<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.060> little<00:01:39.180> bit<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:40.110> now<00:01:40.890> I

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
but it does help a little bit so now I

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.940 
but it does help a little bit so now I
just<00:01:41.400> have<00:01:41.520> my<00:01:41.700> hair<00:01:41.909> parted<00:01:42.360> on<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:43.380> side<00:01:43.680> it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
just have my hair parted on this side it

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.950 
just have my hair parted on this side it
doesn't<00:01:44.250> matter<00:01:44.399> whichever<00:01:45.210> side<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:45.750> prefer

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
doesn't matter whichever side you prefer

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.050 
doesn't matter whichever side you prefer
your<00:01:46.380> part<00:01:46.649> on<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.189> completely<00:01:47.579> fine<00:01:47.880> it

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
your part on that is completely fine it

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.370 
your part on that is completely fine it
really<00:01:48.090> doesn't<00:01:48.570> make<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.689> difference<00:01:48.780> at<00:01:49.350> all

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
really doesn't make a difference at all

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.280 
really doesn't make a difference at all
so<00:01:50.040> now<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.340> am<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.090> going<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.360> take<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.869> hair

really simple so you're just gonna

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.560 
really simple so you're just gonna
separate<00:03:35.200> your<00:03:35.350> hair<00:03:35.650> into<00:03:35.980> two<00:03:36.610> sections<00:03:36.640> and

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760
