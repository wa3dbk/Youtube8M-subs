00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:12.190 
hi I'm Regina with Eugene SC design

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:14.790 
hi I'm Regina with Eugene SC design
today<00:00:13.190> I'd<00:00:13.490> like<00:00:13.520> to<00:00:13.639> talk<00:00:13.969> about

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:14.800 
today I'd like to talk about

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.180 
today I'd like to talk about
that<00:00:14.950> I<00:00:14.980> designed<00:00:15.550> for<00:00:15.610> enameling<00:00:16.299> this<00:00:17.190> too

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:18.190 
that I designed for enameling this too

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.910 
that I designed for enameling this too
is<00:00:18.460> made<00:00:18.790> of<00:00:19.030> stainless<00:00:19.420> steel<00:00:19.630> and<00:00:20.200> it<00:00:20.740> come

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
is made of stainless steel and it come

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.990 
is made of stainless steel and it come
in<00:00:21.070> a<00:00:21.100> set<00:00:21.400> of<00:00:21.610> three<00:00:21.910> the<00:00:22.900> basket<00:00:23.500> the<00:00:24.460> handle

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
in a set of three the basket the handle

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.470 
in a set of three the basket the handle
and<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:26.230> fork<00:00:27.420> now<00:00:28.420> be<00:00:28.689> a<00:00:29.020> skater<00:00:29.770> designed<00:00:30.480> to

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
and the fork now be a skater designed to

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.229 
and the fork now be a skater designed to
hold<00:00:31.840> and<00:00:32.200> secure<00:00:32.770> the<00:00:33.010> piece<00:00:33.280> in<00:00:33.550> place<00:00:33.850> while

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
hold and secure the piece in place while

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.670 
hold and secure the piece in place while
you<00:00:34.420> do<00:00:34.600> the<00:00:36.150> enameling<00:00:37.150> so<00:00:38.110> there's<00:00:38.470> no

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
you do the enameling so there's no

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:44.670 
you do the enameling so there's no
frustration<00:00:39.640> of<00:00:40.560> moving<00:00:42.960> also<00:00:43.960> if<00:00:44.200> you<00:00:44.470> prefer

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
frustration of moving also if you prefer

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.410 
frustration of moving also if you prefer
to<00:00:45.130> do<00:00:45.310> the<00:00:46.140> counting<00:00:47.140> ammo<00:00:47.519> it's<00:00:48.519> very<00:00:49.030> easy

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
to do the counting ammo it's very easy

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.650 
to do the counting ammo it's very easy
and<00:00:49.840> simple<00:00:50.410> because<00:00:50.649> the<00:00:51.640> way<00:00:51.879> they<00:00:52.120> designed

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:52.660 
and simple because the way they designed

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.040 
and simple because the way they designed
it<00:00:52.870> touching<00:00:53.410> between<00:00:54.340> the<00:00:54.489> piece<00:00:54.789> and<00:00:55.090> the

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
it touching between the piece and the

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.240 
it touching between the piece and the
basket<00:00:56.949> itself<00:00:57.280> is<00:00:57.550> very<00:00:57.910> little<00:00:58.359> so<00:00:58.809> will<00:00:59.250> so

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
basket itself is very little so will so

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.009 
basket itself is very little so will so
it<00:01:00.489> won't<00:01:00.730> mock<00:01:01.059> up<00:01:01.269> your<00:01:01.539> piece<00:01:03.720> now<00:01:04.720> with

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
it won't mock up your piece now with

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.020 
it won't mock up your piece now with
this<00:01:05.170> too<00:01:05.470> you<00:01:05.680> can<00:01:05.830> do<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.220> enameling<00:01:06.760> in

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
this too you can do the enameling in

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.300 
this too you can do the enameling in
three<00:01:07.600> different<00:01:07.870> ways

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
three different ways

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.899 
three different ways
the<00:01:09.310> first<00:01:09.640> one<00:01:09.880> is<00:01:10.060> just<00:01:10.090> use<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:10.750> basket<00:01:11.500> and

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
the first one is just use the basket and

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.240 
the first one is just use the basket and
handle<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:14.140> you<00:01:14.200> attach<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.430> handle<00:01:15.880> to<00:01:16.120> the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
handle so you attach the handle to the

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.880 
handle so you attach the handle to the
basket<00:01:18.250> by<00:01:18.460> screwing<00:01:18.970> it<00:01:19.210> on<00:01:19.360> to<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.500> nuts

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
basket by screwing it on to the the nuts

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.020 
basket by screwing it on to the the nuts
and<00:01:21.130> me<00:01:21.720> basket<00:01:22.860> now<00:01:23.860> then<00:01:24.190> you<00:01:24.340> prepare<00:01:24.580> the

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
and me basket now then you prepare the

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.890 
and me basket now then you prepare the
piece<00:01:25.270> on<00:01:25.510> this<00:01:25.780> side<00:01:26.310> not<00:01:27.310> right<00:01:27.730> on<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.780> the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
piece on this side not right on to the

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.220 
piece on this side not right on to the
basket<00:01:29.440> otherwise<00:01:30.010> the<00:01:30.510> the<00:01:31.510> powder<00:01:31.810> will<00:01:32.050> get

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:32.230 
basket otherwise the the powder will get

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.500 
basket otherwise the the powder will get
melted<00:01:32.830> and<00:01:33.130> then<00:01:33.370> it's<00:01:33.580> stuck<00:01:33.880> in<00:01:34.060> your<00:01:34.210> piece

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
melted and then it's stuck in your piece

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.880 
melted and then it's stuck in your piece
so<00:01:34.870> you<00:01:35.620> do<00:01:36.040> it<00:01:36.190> at<00:01:36.370> the<00:01:36.610> side<00:01:36.880> and<00:01:37.680> then<00:01:38.680> one

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
so you do it at the side and then one

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.470 
so you do it at the side and then one
and<00:01:39.100> then<00:01:39.520> you<00:01:39.670> put<00:01:39.880> it<00:01:40.030> inside<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:42.130> basket

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:42.480 
and then you put it inside the basket

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.190 
and then you put it inside the basket
like<00:01:43.480> that<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:44.050> then<00:01:44.950> now<00:01:45.250> you<00:01:45.580> can<00:01:46.020> turn<00:01:47.020> on

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
like that and then now you can turn on

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.889 
like that and then now you can turn on
your<00:01:47.380> foot<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:48.030> then<00:01:49.030> fire<00:01:49.360> from<00:01:50.170> underneath

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.489 

so<00:01:53.899> when<00:01:54.109> it's<00:01:54.319> ready<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:56.630> put<00:01:56.899> it<00:01:57.020> down<00:01:57.229> and

00:01:57.489 --> 00:01:57.499 
so when it's ready you put it down and

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:01.569 
so when it's ready you put it down and
let<00:01:57.710> it<00:01:57.890> cool<00:01:59.319> the<00:02:00.319> second<00:02:00.740> way<00:02:00.920> of<00:02:00.950> doing<00:02:01.130> that

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
let it cool the second way of doing that

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.830 
let it cool the second way of doing that
is<00:02:01.640> with<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.390> tripod<00:02:03.880> now<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:04.939> tripod<00:02:05.600> come

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
is with the tripod now the tripod come

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.380 
is with the tripod now the tripod come
in<00:02:05.990> two<00:02:06.229> different<00:02:06.259> height<00:02:06.859> the<00:02:07.640> six<00:02:07.969> inches

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
in two different height the six inches

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.890 
in two different height the six inches
and<00:02:08.629> in<00:02:08.899> my<00:02:09.110> inches<00:02:09.759> this<00:02:10.759> one<00:02:11.060> is<00:02:11.239> nine<00:02:11.450> inches

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
and in my inches this one is nine inches

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.199 
and in my inches this one is nine inches
so<00:02:12.170> we<00:02:12.200> give<00:02:12.530> you<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.739> little<00:02:13.040> bit<00:02:13.129> more<00:02:13.459> height

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
now you prepare the piece in the same

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.160 
now you prepare the piece in the same
way<00:02:25.480> on<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:27.019> side<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:28.239> then<00:02:29.239> put<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.629> inside

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
way on the side and then put it inside

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.449 
way on the side and then put it inside
there<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:30.709> drop<00:02:31.280> it<00:02:31.489> gently<00:02:32.000> onto<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.890> the

whatever you want it that crate in there
while<00:03:09.740> you're<00:03:09.920> doing<00:03:10.190> it<00:03:10.310> firing<00:03:10.610> at<00:03:10.940> the<00:03:11.120> same

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
while you're doing it firing at the same

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.560 
while you're doing it firing at the same
time<00:03:11.890> so<00:03:12.890> it's<00:03:13.100> very<00:03:13.340> handy<00:03:13.730> and<00:03:14.090> very

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
time so it's very handy and very

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.170 
time so it's very handy and very
efficient<00:03:17.410> so<00:03:18.410> when<00:03:18.800> it's<00:03:18.980> done<00:03:19.070> you<00:03:19.760> remove

that with a fire and set it down to let

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.020 
that with a fire and set it down to let
it<00:03:24.170> cool<00:03:24.440> now<00:03:26.710> while<00:03:27.710> you're<00:03:27.920> waiting<00:03:28.400> if<00:03:28.550> you

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
it cool now while you're waiting if you

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.650 
it cool now while you're waiting if you
have<00:03:29.240> another<00:03:29.780> a<00:03:30.200> basket<00:03:31.100> then<00:03:32.000> you<00:03:32.240> can<00:03:32.450> do

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
have another a basket then you can do

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.800 
have another a basket then you can do
the<00:03:32.900> other<00:03:32.930> one<00:03:33.440> and<00:03:33.650> then<00:03:34.340> skip<00:03:34.640> doing<00:03:35.330> it<00:03:35.630> and

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
the other one and then skip doing it and

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.650 
the other one and then skip doing it and
rotate<00:03:36.350> it<00:03:36.530> between<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.190> two<00:03:37.510> instead<00:03:38.510> of

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
rotate it between the two instead of

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.910 
rotate it between the two instead of
wasting<00:03:38.870> time<00:03:40.810> for<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:41.960> piece<00:03:42.200> to<00:03:42.410> get<00:03:42.640> cold

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
wasting time for the piece to get cold

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.080 
wasting time for the piece to get cold
the<00:03:45.920> third<00:03:46.190> way<00:03:46.400> of<00:03:46.550> doing<00:03:46.880> that<00:03:47.030> is<00:03:47.330> with<00:03:49.090> with

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
the third way of doing that is with with

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.050 
the third way of doing that is with with
a<00:03:50.120> basket<00:03:50.950> there<00:03:51.950> Fork<00:03:54.130> now<00:03:55.130> you<00:03:55.190> prepare<00:03:55.880> the

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
a basket there Fork now you prepare the

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.470 
a basket there Fork now you prepare the
piece<00:03:56.300> of<00:03:56.540> the<00:03:56.600> same<00:03:56.870> way<00:03:57.110> and<00:03:57.820> then<00:03:58.820> you<00:03:59.090> drop

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
piece of the same way and then you drop

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.850 
piece of the same way and then you drop
it<00:03:59.690> inside<00:03:59.900> the<00:04:00.760> basket<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:02.350> then<00:04:03.350> you<00:04:03.470> attach

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
it inside the basket and then you attach

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.330 
it inside the basket and then you attach
the<00:04:04.100> fork<00:04:04.430> on<00:04:04.700> to<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.690> handle<00:04:09.040> now<00:04:10.040> making

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
the fork on to the handle now making

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.430 
the fork on to the handle now making
sure<00:04:10.520> that<00:04:11.000> you<00:04:11.120> have<00:04:11.360> the<00:04:11.510> ends<00:04:11.900> tilted

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
sure that you have the ends tilted

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.810 
sure that you have the ends tilted
upwards<00:04:12.980> so<00:04:13.940> that<00:04:14.420> will<00:04:14.630> prevent<00:04:15.050> the<00:04:15.820> basket

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
upwards so that will prevent the basket

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.370 
upwards so that will prevent the basket
from<00:04:17.209> sliding<00:04:17.630> off<00:04:18.940> now<00:04:19.940> you<00:04:20.380> slide

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
from sliding off now you slide

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.920 
from sliding off now you slide
underneath<00:04:21.859> the<00:04:22.190> basket<00:04:22.370> lift<00:04:23.360> it<00:04:23.510> up<00:04:23.690> and

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
underneath the basket lift it up and

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.480 
underneath the basket lift it up and
then<00:04:24.400> put<00:04:25.400> it<00:04:25.520> inside<00:04:26.000> the<00:04:26.180> kill<00:04:26.450> and<00:04:27.490> then

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
then put it inside the kill and then

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.230 
then put it inside the kill and then
removed<00:04:28.970> it<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:30.370> when<00:04:31.370> it's<00:04:31.550> ready<00:04:31.820> you<00:04:31.970> go

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
removed it and when it's ready you go

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.300 
removed it and when it's ready you go
and<00:04:32.540> do<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:32.840> kill<00:04:33.080> and<00:04:33.320> then<00:04:33.830> remove<00:04:34.280> that

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
and do the kill and then remove that

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:41.650 
and do the kill and then remove that
same<00:04:34.880> way<00:04:35.120> have<00:04:35.690> it<00:04:35.840> lift<00:04:36.080> it<00:04:36.290> and<00:04:37.030> then<00:04:40.480> let<00:04:41.480> it

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
same way have it lift it and then let it
