00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.789
 maybe a staple or roast for many 

00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:07.720
 Schnitzel come almost every day on the table but at the Bremer it should 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.110
 In the cooking pots soon more and more often look less meat on the 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.280
 Teller to a goal of the community foundation that with Julia Roger last already 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.520
 Reality is eleven years, the student renounced all meat 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.010
 perfect because otherwise he would have a real cracker in Denmark 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.259
 small 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.329
 and there I saw the collective bargaining parties on television 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.570
 I find it here 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.610
 betrayed 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.240
 completely should not pass the Bremen's appetite for meat 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.790
 but at least once a week on Thursdays she should also become a vegetarian 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.310
 because farming is one of the biggest air polluters in 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.980
 Germany 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.670
 say the initiators of the action will be especially in animal husbandry 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.030
 large quantities of co2 and methane release the number one climate killer 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.840
 also the Bremer Umweltsenator supports the action and that is 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.740
 always making sure that diet is a very important issue 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.850
 Health reasons but also for reasons of climate protection was the newcomer 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.030
 observe certain rules and also from time to time 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.229
 to renounce with 12 6 percent because that is a contribution to climate protection and wants 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.630
 if the people of Bremen join in, they will also contribute 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.710
 contribution to 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.390
 Achievement of climate protection goals 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.189
 the state of Bremen wants to reduce its co2 emissions by 40 percent by 2020 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.659
 if all 550000 Bremer participated in the action that would be the exhaust fumes of 40 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.590
 00 to save 15 years 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.120
 Nevertheless, the Hanseaten are 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.480
 who is skeptical 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.610
 You could do it and not make a goal instead of using it with your driver 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.080
 Driver can still be sold out 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.790
 I am a Catholic said Seibert 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.170
 Fridays a fixed price of one 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.110
 for premature 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.900
 for language support on weekdays 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.470
 the Bremer Fleischerinnung whom world 's little wonder 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.080
 action 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.750
 Instead of meat renouncement, the people of Bremen should change their habits, you will find 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.760
 Obermeister rather on the sustainability of the whole food 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.210
 respect their products 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.570
 namely from the region for the region for the region in the region 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.120
 so that we can cover our needs in the surrounding area percent as well 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.410
 the UIAG vegetarian out of conviction and does not believe people like that 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.940
 be transformed into a meatless diet 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.429
 I think it is generally hard for people to be arrested 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:22.119
 some say you must now who rescues Steffen on Thursday a flyer 

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:26.650
 The politicians want to impose on the Bremeners that vegetarianism is not 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.330
 But to point out that on this way everyone has a small contribution 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.250
 can contribute to climate protection
