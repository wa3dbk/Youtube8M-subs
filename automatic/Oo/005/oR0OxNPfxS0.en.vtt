00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:13.420
 the campanelli or more here in time the 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.969
 Benvenuto family were the representation 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.160
 in broad strokes of the family model in 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:21.130
 that most of us grew up but the 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:24.130
 society changed and with it the album 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.380
 family are increasingly frequent 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.570
 families assembled those that are 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.849
 charge of single women the unions 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.040
 consensuals without papers and 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.130
 marriages composed of two people 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.960
 of the same gender but what they mean 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:41.500
 these changes that bring us the new 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.700
 family models for adults the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.700
 new families work better 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.350
 i 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.059
 in fact it is better to divorce three times 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.309
 to live a lifetime with someone 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.960
 that one hates it is better to live 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.530
 homosexuality freely living a 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.049
 double life is better to keep looking and 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.280
 be genuine with one's own loves or 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.340
 own discussions or the new ones 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.920
 agreements that we can adopt children with 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.740
 greater ease that we can have access 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.330
 to assisted fertilization that we can 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.430
 marry between gay people and 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.890
 adopt children that we can assemble 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.619
 families that we can take care of 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.780
 alien children all this to adults in 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.000
 principle gives us more freedom and we 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.940
 let's be more honest with us 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.310
 same with the advancement of women in the 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.350
 labor market divorce law 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.600
 linking was a tool that 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.780
 allowed to modify the institution 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.420
 family according to the 2010 census in the 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.940
 The last decade saw more than 500 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.460
 thousand divorces exceeding the rates of 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.759
 the 80s when the sanction was 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.759
 law 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.310
 let's think that marriage is a 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:10.060
 economic society and also that responds 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.270
 to patriarchy marriage and 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.250
 heritage are economic agreements that 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.100
 they have nothing to do with love 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.800
 truly divorce at this time what 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.930
 which it highlights the possibility 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.350
 that some individual at a time of 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.510
 life have freedom their love 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.700
 and your choice at that time that you can 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.380
 not have to do with what decided a 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.320
 year ago thirty years ago twenty years 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.450
 back and decide again every time 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.970
 difference from those who see in this 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.460
 diversification the supposed sample of 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.810
 a lower commitment to link on the part 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.420
 of the inhabitants of the world 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.120
 contemporary others understand that it is 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.790
 evidence that society faces 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.370
 greater honesty your relationships what 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.770
 can lead for example to a 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.280
 marriage assume the cost of a 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.780
 separation before a coexistence 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.090
 unsatisfactory maintained only by 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.960
 commitment the commitment issue when 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.740
 the relationships 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.600
 very prolonged can be deceptive like this 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:13.020
 that there are people who have lived all the 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.210
 life 50 years with another person totally 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.310
 engaged in love and other 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.020
 people have lived 50 60 years no 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.270
 engaged in love and yet 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.040
 have endured there in the same way today 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.830
 in day we can be with multiple 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.720
 partenaires or changing or looking for another 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.530
 thing for our life and every time we enter 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.540
 in very committed situations or not and 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.290
 what I want to say is not in the 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.830
 duration of a couple relationship what 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.110
 that will give us the level of commitment 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:46.330
 or not emotional commitment but the 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.400
 capacity that each individual has of 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:51.520
 live especially committed to the yes 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.220
 very deep there are many types of 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.770
 family and it's not about finding a 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.260
 perfect model but to recognize the 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:02.560
 family as the place of respect the 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:05.560
 affection and solidarity this week in 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:08.080
 early to late we will set the table and 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.050
 we will gather all types of family 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.680
 to understand how we went from family 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.900
 model 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.900
 to the new family models
