00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.210
 This result from Brazil 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.710
 I think that you can get a summer vacation from the title 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.829
 Contains a lot of this submission 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:17.739
 And there are so many reverse rhythms. 

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:20.900
 Those are typical ones. 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.029
 Eh, especially 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.300
 I would like you to pay attention to the suspension question 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.859
 I think after, but by stepping on the public Noto 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.379
 As the whole music changes very strongly fc 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.379
 Fixed asset accent 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.360
 I would like to ask you to follow me, but a bit 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.639
 Because there is an opinion with the part of the street side 

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:50.810
 Standing for the procedure to take time 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:52.100
 Be careful 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.910
 I would like you to follow through 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.550
 That first place 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.160
 Second Life 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.160
 Especially come out 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.399
 At first it was this organization 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.399
 Did you become a good body? 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.690
 I become a prime minister 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.350
 ha03-Latin music will not come out 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.970
 Because 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.370
 Eh, especially syncopation 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.080
 It is very light that I can not submit the report of the main village 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.310
 Combed 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.310
 I feel like this now 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.100
 End 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.690
 It looks cool 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.600
 Yeah 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.340
 We emphasize sports promotion succession 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.359
 There is no particular accent here 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:45.720
 5 delivery rights 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.429
 Please let me know 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.290
 I want you to make the rest 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.930
 Emergency 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.790
 Direct bus service with another junior listening to the same sound 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.540
 It is cute, but it is the same as now 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.159
 I will manage 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.490
 This was the first time I added an accent 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:09.059
 You 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:10.789
 Preliminary value 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.220
 To me and 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.930
 I used to play much lighter 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.470
 It was not my head that was in the class a 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:24.529
 Again this is possible 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:26.830
 About 1000 ruins 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.640
 In this case if it will go through the moon in this case 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.570
 On the other hand 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.860
 Even if you don't say Ebetsu, it's rather in the music 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.390
 I am always looking for the most sophisticated 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.449
 Just a bit 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:42.669
 These two 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:45.730
 As you can see how you go up this morning 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:49.329
 Decided 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.789
 I would like you to ask about the merger basically 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:54.969
 I took the receipt
