like Lee sin I have great catching
mechanics<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:15.360> Q<00:01:15.920> you<00:01:16.920> should<00:01:17.070> always<00:01:17.220> look

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
mechanics with Q you should always look

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.880 
mechanics with Q you should always look
to<00:01:17.820> turn<00:01:18.150> ganks<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.930> right<00:01:19.080> here<00:01:19.290> I<00:01:19.320> see<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.650> can

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
to turn ganks so right here I see I can

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.039 
to turn ganks so right here I see I can
turn<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.280> kink<00:01:20.580> into<00:01:20.850> our<00:01:21.240> advantage<00:01:21.659> if<00:01:21.900> I

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
turn this kink into our advantage if I

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.399 
turn this kink into our advantage if I
just<00:01:22.290> hit<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.500> cue<00:01:22.920> through<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.850> minion<00:01:24.090> wave

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
just hit the cue through the minion wave

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.380 
just hit the cue through the minion wave
so<00:01:25.409> let's<00:01:25.619> see<00:01:25.740> if<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.890> get<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.310> got<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.759> get

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
so let's see if I get it I got it get

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.810 
so let's see if I get it I got it get
the<00:01:27.479> kill<00:01:27.659> easy<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.320> now<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.189> have<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.610> do<00:01:29.729> is

the kill easy and now I have to do is

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.249 
the kill easy and now I have to do is
cut<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.090> vine<00:01:30.420> make<00:01:30.659> sure<00:01:30.780> she<00:01:30.960> doesn't<00:01:31.049> get

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
morgana I'm coming in and right here

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.540 
morgana I'm coming in and right here
she<00:02:14.670> hits<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:14.910> perfect<00:02:15.300> find<00:02:15.780> now<00:02:16.590> while<00:02:17.370> he's

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
she hits a perfect find now while he's

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.110 
she hits a perfect find now while he's
bound<00:02:18.209> right<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.750> hit<00:02:18.959> my<00:02:19.110> first<00:02:19.440> part<00:02:20.040> of<00:02:20.190> Q<00:02:20.430> now

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
bound right I hit my first part of Q now

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.480 
bound right I hit my first part of Q now
here<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.330> could<00:02:21.630> just<00:02:21.840> hit<00:02:22.380> QQ<00:02:22.920> try<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.310> kill

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
here I could just hit QQ try and kill

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.580 
here I could just hit QQ try and kill
him<00:02:23.700> but<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.540> wouldn't<00:02:24.840> do<00:02:24.930> enough<00:02:25.140> damage<00:02:25.170> he's

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
him but I wouldn't do enough damage he's

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.940 
him but I wouldn't do enough damage he's
not<00:02:25.740> low<00:02:25.950> enough<00:02:25.980> so<00:02:26.430> what<00:02:26.850> I<00:02:26.940> do<00:02:27.000> is<00:02:27.950> whenever

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
not low enough so what I do is whenever

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.120 
not low enough so what I do is whenever
you<00:02:29.130> get<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.280> queue<00:02:29.640> on<00:02:29.790> someone<00:02:30.209> with<00:02:30.360> lee<00:02:30.510> sin

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
you get a queue on someone with lee sin

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.190 
you get a queue on someone with lee sin
you<00:02:32.130> have<00:02:32.340> three<00:02:32.760> seconds<00:02:33.300> to<00:02:33.390> activate<00:02:34.020> it

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
you have three seconds to activate it

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.220 
you have three seconds to activate it
again<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.560> fly<00:02:35.130> at<00:02:35.280> them<00:02:35.489> so<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.540> I<00:02:36.780> have<00:02:37.200> a

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
again and fly at them so I I have a

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.870 
again and fly at them so I I have a
mental<00:02:37.530> timer<00:02:37.920> in<00:02:38.069> my<00:02:38.160> head<00:02:38.310> I'm<00:02:38.459> counting

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
mental timer in my head I'm counting

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.949 
mental timer in my head I'm counting
down<00:02:39.000> he<00:02:39.870> flashes<00:02:40.440> and<00:02:40.650> uses<00:02:41.190> his<00:02:41.370> satchel<00:02:42.030> but

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
down he flashes and uses his satchel but

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.290 
down he flashes and uses his satchel but
after<00:02:43.200> he<00:02:43.590> does<00:02:43.770> that<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.160> use<00:02:44.430> my<00:02:44.730> second<00:02:45.120> part

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
after he does that I use my second part

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.690 
after he does that I use my second part
of<00:02:45.390> Q<00:02:45.600> I<00:02:45.810> chase<00:02:46.380> him<00:02:46.410> down<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.070> I<00:02:47.280> get<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.519> kill

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
of Q I chase him down and I get the kill

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.690 
of Q I chase him down and I get the kill
without<00:02:48.360> having<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.989> burn<00:02:49.110> my<00:02:49.440> flash<00:02:49.769> my<00:02:50.489> flash

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
without having to burn my flash my flash

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.880
