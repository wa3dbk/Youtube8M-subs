00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
newcomer the Galaxy Nexus LTE this is a

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.040 
newcomer the Galaxy Nexus LTE this is a
lot<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.220> for<00:00:20.400> verizon<00:00:20.660> there<00:00:21.660> are<00:00:21.779> some

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
lot this is for verizon there are some

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.429 
lot this is for verizon there are some
some<00:00:22.859> issues<00:00:23.220> here<00:00:23.250> about<00:00:24.240> whether<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:25.410> is

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
some issues here about whether one is

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.070 
some issues here about whether one is
faster<00:00:26.010> than<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.220> other<00:00:26.400> with<00:00:27.180> respects<00:00:28.080> to

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
faster than the other with respects to

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.880 
faster than the other with respects to
radios<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.519> obviously<00:00:30.480> we<00:00:30.750> know<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.080> hspa+

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
radios so obviously we know that hspa+

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.639 
radios so obviously we know that hspa+
is<00:00:32.099> slower<00:00:32.369> than<00:00:32.489> LTE<00:00:33.140> but<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.260> course<00:00:34.350> you

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
is slower than LTE but of course you

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.310 
is slower than LTE but of course you
also<00:00:34.800> know<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.309> hds<00:00:35.809> hspa+<00:00:36.809> version

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
also know that the hds hspa+ version

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.220 
also know that the hds hspa+ version
features<00:00:38.239> international<00:00:39.239> support<00:00:39.780> meaning

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
features international support meaning

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.410 
features international support meaning
you<00:00:40.350> can<00:00:40.530> take<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.460> phone<00:00:41.730> with<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:41.969> to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
you can take this phone with you to

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.290 
you can take this phone with you to
Europe<00:00:42.750> and<00:00:42.989> use<00:00:43.170> any<00:00:43.350> sim<00:00:43.620> on<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.890> so<00:00:44.300> what's

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
Europe and use any sim on it so what's

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.690 
Europe and use any sim on it so what's
the<00:00:45.450> trade-off<00:00:45.719> here<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.260> US<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:47.010> get<00:00:47.430> speed

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the trade-off here in the US I get speed

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.840 
the trade-off here in the US I get speed

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
here very good performance in this

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.959 
here very good performance in this
location<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:57.000> four<00:00:57.960> bars<00:00:58.170> here<00:00:58.559> of

location and I have four bars here of

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:06.560 
location and I have four bars here of
LTE<00:00:59.969> on<00:01:00.359> verizon<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.289> let's<00:01:02.070> go<00:01:04.250> and<00:01:05.250> let's<00:01:06.240> see

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
LTE on verizon so let's go and let's see

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.590 
LTE on verizon so let's go and let's see
what<00:01:06.720> happens<00:01:09.439> so<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.619> can<00:01:10.860> see<00:01:11.600> hspa+

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
what happens so as you can see hspa+

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.999 
what happens so as you can see hspa+
isn't<00:01:12.960> doing<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.170> badly<00:01:14.030> 4,600<00:01:15.890> megabits<00:01:16.890> per

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
isn't doing so badly 4,600 megabits per

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.200 
isn't doing so badly 4,600 megabits per
second<00:01:17.549> sorry<00:01:18.090> 4.6<00:01:19.759> megabits<00:01:20.759> per<00:01:20.820> second

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.899 
second sorry 4.6 megabits per second
versus<00:01:22.520> 1014<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:25.009> there<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.130> go<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.549> results

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
versus 1014 and there we go the results

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.950 
versus 1014 and there we go the results
are<00:01:27.000> almost<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.540> for<00:01:27.810> both<00:01:29.240> obviously<00:01:30.240> LT<00:01:30.570> wins

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
are almost in for both obviously LT wins

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.280 
are almost in for both obviously LT wins
by<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> wide<00:01:31.799> margin<00:01:31.829> but<00:01:32.460> look<00:01:32.670> at<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:33.290> 14

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
by a wide margin but look at this 14

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.249 
by a wide margin but look at this 14
megabits<00:01:35.189> per<00:01:35.280> second<00:01:35.759> versus<00:01:36.150> 5.2<00:01:36.900> megabits

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
megabits per second versus 5.2 megabits

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.800 
megabits per second versus 5.2 megabits
per<00:01:37.320> second<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.920> 1.7<00:01:38.880> megabits<00:01:39.270> per<00:01:39.329> second

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
per second and 1.7 megabits per second

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.780 
per second and 1.7 megabits per second
versus<00:01:40.140> 10<00:01:40.350> megabits<00:01:40.710> per<00:01:40.740> second<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.640> that's

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
versus 10 megabits per second so that's

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.340 
versus 10 megabits per second so that's
pretty<00:01:42.030> much<00:01:42.180> what<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.450> can<00:01:42.570> expect<00:01:43.049> as<00:01:43.290> far

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
pretty much what you can expect as far

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.160 
pretty much what you can expect as far
as<00:01:43.920> performance<00:01:44.250> difference<00:01:44.970> now<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.899> I

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
as performance difference now I have I

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.200 
as performance difference now I have I
could<00:01:46.619> be<00:01:46.740> having<00:01:47.009> slightly<00:01:47.490> better<00:01:47.759> signal

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
could be having slightly better signal

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.380 
could be having slightly better signal
this<00:01:48.329> easily<00:01:48.899> reaches<00:01:49.350> 8<00:01:49.530> megabits<00:01:50.180> I've<00:01:51.180> got

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
this easily reaches 8 megabits I've got

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.899 
this easily reaches 8 megabits I've got
one<00:01:51.570> bar<00:01:51.750> missing<00:01:52.140> here<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.670> trade-off

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
one bar missing here but the trade-off

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.120 
one bar missing here but the trade-off
all<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.329> see<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.630> yes<00:01:55.049> it's<00:01:55.259> faster<00:01:55.710> but<00:01:55.890> what

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
all you see is yes it's faster but what

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.190 
all you see is yes it's faster but what
does<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.520> battery<00:01:56.939> life<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.329> clearly

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
does it do to battery life and clearly

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.679 
does it do to battery life and clearly
you<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:59.399> take<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.700> as<00:01:59.759> phone<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.180> Europe<00:02:00.479> put

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
you can take it as phone to Europe put

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.480 
you can take it as phone to Europe put
an<00:02:00.840> unlock<00:02:01.170> sim<00:02:01.439> in<00:02:01.590> there<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:01.920> off<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.219> go<00:02:02.280> on

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
an unlock sim in there and off you go on

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.190 
an unlock sim in there and off you go on
your<00:02:02.640> Europe<00:02:03.299> Asia<00:02:03.479> anywhere<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.079> world

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
your Europe Asia anywhere in the world

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.780 
your Europe Asia anywhere in the world
really<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.649> works<00:02:04.829> on<00:02:05.009> both<00:02:05.040> AT&amp;T<00:02:05.579> and

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
really it works on both AT&amp;T and

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.969 
really it works on both AT&amp;T and
t-mobile<00:02:06.060> this<00:02:06.750> will<00:02:06.899> only<00:02:07.079> work<00:02:07.229> on<00:02:07.500> verizon

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
t-mobile this will only work on verizon

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.650 
t-mobile this will only work on verizon
wireless<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.879> that's<00:02:09.060> basically<00:02:09.300> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
wireless so that's basically the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.309 
wireless so that's basically the
trade-off<00:02:10.140> let<00:02:11.099> me

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
trade-off let me

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.229 
trade-off let me
give<00:02:11.379> you<00:02:11.499> some<00:02:11.769> size<00:02:11.950> comparisons<00:02:12.670> while<00:02:13.060> I'm

raises display is a little flawed in so

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.369 
raises display is a little flawed in so
far<00:02:57.099> that<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:58.090> has<00:02:58.269> some<00:02:58.510> weird<00:02:58.689> jagged<00:02:59.169> edged

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
far that it has some weird jagged edged

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.860 
far that it has some weird jagged edged
issues<00:02:59.919> and<00:03:00.250> some<00:03:00.579> yellow<00:03:00.849> tinting<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.719> the

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
issues and some yellow tinting to the

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.030 
issues and some yellow tinting to the
OLED<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:03.400> really<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.900> know<00:03:05.049> it's<00:03:05.620> your<00:03:05.769> call

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040

OLED so really you know it's your call
but<00:03:06.069> we<00:03:06.489> think<00:03:06.730> this<00:03:06.969> is<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.359> best<00:03:07.480> right<00:03:07.780> here

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
but we think this is the best right here

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.629 
but we think this is the best right here
the<00:03:08.260> Galaxy<00:03:08.709> Nexus<00:03:08.829> even<00:03:09.310> though<00:03:09.400> it's<00:03:09.549> a

the Galaxy Nexus even though it's a

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.959 
the Galaxy Nexus even though it's a
pentile<00:03:10.000> display<00:03:10.510> it<00:03:10.840> really<00:03:11.650> does<00:03:11.969> look

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:12.969

LT in the middle now let's see a
thickness<00:05:02.050> comparison<00:05:02.909> the<00:05:03.909> winner<00:05:04.180> here<00:05:04.539> is

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
thickness comparison the winner here is

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.770 
thickness comparison the winner here is
going<00:05:04.960> to<00:05:05.080> be<00:05:05.259> the<00:05:05.440> Nitro<00:05:05.860> probably<00:05:06.389> the<00:05:07.389> Nitro

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:07.780 
going to be the Nitro probably the Nitro

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.839 
going to be the Nitro probably the Nitro
is<00:05:07.930> quite<00:05:08.259> thin<00:05:08.590> although<00:05:09.069> it's<00:05:09.430> like<00:05:09.639> kind<00:05:09.819> of

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:09.849 
is quite thin although it's like kind of

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:12.749 
is quite thin although it's like kind of
a<00:05:09.969> toss<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.479> the<00:05:11.169> galaxy<00:05:11.860> s2<00:05:11.979> year<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.520> sky

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:12.759 
a toss the the galaxy s2 year the sky

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:15.360 
a toss the the galaxy s2 year the sky
rocket<00:05:13.180> is<00:05:13.300> pretty<00:05:13.569> thin<00:05:13.810> as<00:05:13.960> well<00:05:14.139> so<00:05:14.949> i<00:05:14.979> guess

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
rocket is pretty thin as well so i guess

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.369 
rocket is pretty thin as well so i guess
the<00:05:15.729> nexus<00:05:16.090> isn't<00:05:16.419> the<00:05:16.509> finish<00:05:16.840> again<00:05:17.169> this<00:05:17.319> is

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:17.379 
the nexus isn't the finish again this is

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:21.059 
the nexus isn't the finish again this is
thicker<00:05:17.800> than<00:05:17.919> the<00:05:18.690> hspa+<00:05:19.690> version<00:05:20.139> alright

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:21.069 
thicker than the hspa+ version alright

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:23.100 
thicker than the hspa+ version alright
so<00:05:21.400> now<00:05:21.580> there's<00:05:21.849> a<00:05:21.909> couple<00:05:22.240> more<00:05:22.599> phones<00:05:22.900> i

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
so now there's a couple more phones i

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.839 
so now there's a couple more phones i
want<00:05:23.319> to<00:05:23.379> compare<00:05:23.740> actually<00:05:24.219> one<00:05:24.370> more<00:05:24.400> want

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
want to compare actually one more want

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:26.850 
want to compare actually one more want
to<00:05:24.940> compare<00:05:25.240> to<00:05:25.389> and<00:05:25.569> that's<00:05:25.690> the<00:05:25.780> iphone<00:05:26.199> just
