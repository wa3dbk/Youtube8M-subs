this not so long and then have this on
it<00:00:41.750> just<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.050> inside<00:00:43.760> chassis<00:00:44.760> there<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
it just so it's inside chassis there and

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.420 
it just so it's inside chassis there and
it<00:00:45.120> can't<00:00:45.360> break<00:00:45.570> if<00:00:45.870> i<00:00:46.020> happen<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.010> flip<00:00:47.250> over

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
it can't break if i happen to flip over

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.060 
it can't break if i happen to flip over
and<00:00:48.950> i<00:00:49.950> did<00:00:50.160> this<00:00:50.309> for<00:00:50.370> like<00:00:51.440> it's<00:00:52.440> an<00:00:52.620> exhaust

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
and i did this for like it's an exhaust

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.819 
and i did this for like it's an exhaust
norco<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.879> if<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.750> engine<00:00:55.079> happens<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.559> die<00:00:55.800> a

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
norco so if the engine happens to die a

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.349 
norco so if the engine happens to die a
while<00:00:56.190> i'ma<00:00:56.719> underwater<00:00:57.719> something<00:00:58.469> then<00:00:59.359> it

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
while i'ma underwater something then it

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.100 
while i'ma underwater something then it
shouldn't<00:01:00.840> break<00:01:01.640> like<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.820> chef<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.270> shouldn't

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
shouldn't break like it chef I shouldn't

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.530 
shouldn't break like it chef I shouldn't
get<00:01:04.439> water<00:01:04.769> in<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.430> valves<00:01:06.060> or<00:01:06.210> something

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
get water in the valves or something

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.000 
get water in the valves or something
hopefully<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.930> won't<00:01:07.080> stall<00:01:07.439> but<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.830> never

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
hopefully it won't stall but you never

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.130 
hopefully it won't stall but you never
know<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.460> with<00:01:09.180> this<00:01:09.299> setup<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.810> sounds

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
know and with this setup it sounds

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.039 
know and with this setup it sounds
absolutely<00:01:10.439> sick<00:01:11.130> way<00:01:11.640> better<00:01:11.939> than<00:01:12.750> with

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
absolutely sick way better than with

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.390 
absolutely sick way better than with
just<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.770> pipe<00:01:14.490> coming<00:01:14.760> out<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.030> back<00:01:15.210> I

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
just the pipe coming out the back I

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.830 
just the pipe coming out the back I
still<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.490> my<00:01:17.670> minibike<00:01:18.060> clutch<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.750> will

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
still on my minibike clutch and it will

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.480 
still on my minibike clutch and it will
fit<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.229> engine<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:19.920> I'm<00:01:20.009> thinking<00:01:20.400> of

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
fit this engine so I'm thinking of

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.359 
fit this engine so I'm thinking of
putting<00:01:20.640> out<00:01:20.850> on<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.060> bottom<00:01:21.920> maybe<00:01:22.920> tearing

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
putting out on the bottom maybe tearing

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.270 
putting out on the bottom maybe tearing
apart<00:01:23.460> my<00:01:23.729> craftsman<00:01:24.390> arms<00:01:24.689> for<00:01:25.320> for<00:01:25.950> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
mixed and with the clutch on it put a

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.060 
mixed and with the clutch on it put a
hand<00:01:44.369> throttle<00:01:44.729> on<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.530> this<00:01:46.530> thing<00:01:46.680> smokes

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
hand throttle on it this thing smokes

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.499 
hand throttle on it this thing smokes
quite<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> bit<00:01:47.579> but<00:01:47.759> when<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:48.119> running<00:01:48.270> it

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
quite a bit but when it's running it

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.819 
quite a bit but when it's running it
doesn't<00:01:48.750> smell<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:48.960> oil<00:01:49.229> burning<00:01:49.500> smoke

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
doesn't smell like oil burning smoke

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.920 
doesn't smell like oil burning smoke
would<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.399> think<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.420> running<00:01:51.720> really

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
would just I think it's running really

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.109 
would just I think it's running really
rich<00:01:52.259> but<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.710> never<00:01:52.950> mess<00:01:53.250> with<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> carb<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.090> I

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
rich but I never mess with the carb so I

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.359 
rich but I never mess with the carb so I
might<00:01:54.360> lean<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.750> out<00:01:54.869> turn<00:01:55.649> out<00:01:55.860> this<00:01:56.070> grew<00:01:56.340> a

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
might lean it out turn out this grew a

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.840 
might lean it out turn out this grew a
bit<00:01:56.610> see<00:01:57.509> what<00:01:57.540> happens<00:01:58.280> well<00:01:59.280> adjust<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
bit see what happens well adjust the

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.280 
bit see what happens well adjust the
card<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.649> hopefully<00:02:01.649> bigger<00:02:02.399> rear<00:02:02.700> wheels

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
card and hopefully bigger rear wheels

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.560 
card and hopefully bigger rear wheels
the<00:02:04.290> mt<00:02:04.619> ds1<00:02:05.040> would<00:02:05.460> work<00:02:05.640> perfectly<00:02:06.240> back

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
the mt ds1 would work perfectly back

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.190 
the mt ds1 would work perfectly back
there<00:02:06.860> but<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.099> kind<00:02:08.429> of<00:02:08.509> try<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.569> sell<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.050> so

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
there but I kind of try and sell that so

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.520 
there but I kind of try and sell that so
hopefully<00:02:10.530> if<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.739> find<00:02:11.039> a

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
hopefully if I find a

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.370 
hopefully if I find a
I<00:02:11.760> used<00:02:13.530> parts<00:02:14.530> long<00:02:15.190> tractor<00:02:15.819> then<00:02:16.200> can<00:02:17.200> use

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
I used parts long tractor then can use

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.350 
I used parts long tractor then can use
the<00:02:17.590> rear<00:02:17.770> wheels<00:02:17.980> off<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.280> that<00:02:18.520> and<00:02:21.360> figure

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
the rear wheels off of that and figure

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.010 
the rear wheels off of that and figure
front<00:02:22.780> spindles<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:24.240> stuff<00:02:25.240> befall<00:02:25.870> the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
front spindles and stuff befall the

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.449 
front spindles and stuff befall the
front<00:02:26.290> end<00:02:26.470> up<00:02:26.620> because<00:02:26.800> it's<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:27.040> really<00:02:27.220> weak

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
front end up because it's a really weak

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.670 
front end up because it's a really weak
front<00:02:27.760> well<00:02:27.910> not<00:02:28.090> weak<00:02:28.360> but<00:02:28.630> for<00:02:29.260> what<00:02:29.380> I<00:02:29.410> want

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
front well not weak but for what I want

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.740 
front well not weak but for what I want
to<00:02:29.739> do<00:02:29.860> it's<00:02:30.040> pretty<00:02:30.190> weak<00:02:30.520> so<00:02:31.150> hopefully<00:02:31.420> I'd

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
to do it's pretty weak so hopefully I'd

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.650 
to do it's pretty weak so hopefully I'd
have<00:02:32.020> a<00:02:32.380> good<00:02:33.370> low<00:02:33.670> gear<00:02:34.000> for<00:02:34.270> mudding<00:02:34.569> with

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
have a good low gear for mudding with

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.210 
have a good low gear for mudding with
the<00:02:34.840> three<00:02:35.110> speed<00:02:35.410> rear<00:02:35.560> end<00:02:35.739> because<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:36.040> don't

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
the three speed rear end because I don't

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.559 
the three speed rear end because I don't
really<00:02:36.340> want<00:02:36.550> to<00:02:36.580> chop<00:02:36.790> up<00:02:36.940> across<00:02:37.150> room<00:02:37.450> but

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
really want to chop up across room but

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.460 
really want to chop up across room but
if<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:37.750> have<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:38.110> I<00:02:38.140> might<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:40.200> because<00:02:41.200> i<00:02:41.290> don't

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
if I have to I might and because i don't

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.870 
if I have to I might and because i don't
think<00:02:41.530> i'll<00:02:41.800> be<00:02:41.830> able<00:02:41.950> to<00:02:42.160> find<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.550> parts

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
think i'll be able to find a parts

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.990 
think i'll be able to find a parts
