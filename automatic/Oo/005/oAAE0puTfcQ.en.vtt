 thing 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.929

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.010
 the previous activity 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.799
 the only difference 

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:56.870
 that exists 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.810

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.830
 how can I cite for example an audio or a song 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.160
 You come here and add resources. 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.110
 on the link 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.380
 to file 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.310
 another site 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.100
 click here 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.100
 the file name you are let's say music 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.510
 I know 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.170
 in that same way 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.519
 chose to send a file 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.570
 and you will search here 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.989
 the file you want to send 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.969
 submit 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:15.749
 in the file 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:16.760
 demand 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.989
 here are the songs 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.159
 see that I will not complete this activity but I will tell you how 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:22.949
 accomplish 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:25.109
 Let's say this song 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:26.639
 what I want 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:30.139
 which was for my student or an evil of whatever I have in my 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:31.049
 computer 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.809
 I click on it 

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:35.120
 I have here 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.039
 wait 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:38.659
 it can be you 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.879
 that he found the bike 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.630
 I'ts right 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.269
 not fully populated 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:46.069
 you 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.209
 does not have the file 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.080
 product 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.729
 for you send 

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:52.659
 this takes 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.210
 This can come 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.290
 at the same time 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.220
 3 to 4 minutes why 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.350
 I will not do this, I will not wait 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.370
 This moment I already saved 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.879
 a song there 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:09.430
 and because they were music that is saved because of the time it takes 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.560
 if it spends here then you do not worry that 

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:16.819
 you will only bet an audio especially if the audio is big it 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.629
 it will be too late 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.499
 How would I live here? 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:23.919
 but when it loads it will load 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:24.869
 it's him 

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:27.289
 will appear to you 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:29.099
 exactly 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:30.519
 this here 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:34.549
 in this case here is the music that is you 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.249
 I chose this song 

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:41.369
 I chose her as always 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:44.049
 in a new window 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.879
 saves 

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.349
 Do you have the audio? 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.679
 the music sent to me watching 

00:03:51.679 --> 00:03:54.709
 when your student clicks on it 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.639
 she will carry all of it 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:57.489
 on here 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.809
 you click here 

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:03.159
