00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.560
 I think many of us send 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:08.069
 those kitchens that are full of powders 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.960
 with oils vinegars salt seasonings 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.410
 power-ups et cetera et cetera etcetera 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.780
 They look super professional provocative 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.580
 for these kitchens is generally 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:23.160
 managed by many professionals 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.860
 amateurs who devote time and go 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.410
 acquiring all this little by little good 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.270
 I think that if we dedicate an afternoon to 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.000
 make these preparations we can have 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.720
 a kitchen super stocked and that seems 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.720
 professional 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.110
 very well let's do some agile with 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.230
 fermented files then first thing 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.850
 that I have are some more mature reads 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.039
 aromatic 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.649
 let's grab the mature ones we're going to 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:06.380
 save two ok and we're going to split them in 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.040
 ok small pieces can do it with 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.740
 lemon too or it can be lemon 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.610
 Rugged Amazon can be an orange 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.250
 china because not after we're going to grab 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.930
 here is only red bar 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.610
 I have some books we are going to take the 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:24.610
 stems and stems 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.700
 there are super rustic about five teeth 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.740
 Garlic 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.360
 and we take it out more the need to 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.760
 chop them 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.330
 We were going to put all 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.770
 to the knob as now to give just 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.770
 ay ay ay this will apply 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.170
 as they would say to the law 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.100
 these here is that 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.170
 I want you to have a little 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.320
 of that smoky touch that these 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.130
 agile why I put you can not put 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.860
 also these agile smoked or burned 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:08.160
 in the pan but this gives you 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:13.120
 an aroma different from fermented chilli 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:16.290
 Then how much is 10%? 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.290
 until you hear this 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.180
 so 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.920
 let's throw it as if it were the taste 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.500
 and salt 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.570
 sugar 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.570
 ready three consumption of two sugar 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.890
 not many like this is going to exhaust a 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.880
 little water you can remove a little 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:49.020
 of water but that's what you're going to leave 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.070
 a week in the cupboard to turn the 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.570
 month 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.780
 your here is fermented they will be 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.150
 spectacular they are going to have undone 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.720
 will form a mass and you will be able to 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.720
 consume
