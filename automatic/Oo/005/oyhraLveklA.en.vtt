upcoming astropack sets now one of the
things<00:00:45.309> I<00:00:45.640> really<00:00:45.820> do<00:00:45.999> like<00:00:46.179> a<00:00:46.210> lot<00:00:46.329> about<00:00:46.660> this

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:49.250 
things I really do like a lot about this
set<00:00:47.079> is<00:00:47.199> they<00:00:47.379> didn't<00:00:47.649> just<00:00:47.859> go<00:00:48.339> after<00:00:48.730> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
set is they didn't just go after the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.619 
set is they didn't just go after the
obvious<00:00:50.260> choices<00:00:50.589> the<00:00:51.010> obvious<00:00:51.460> cards<00:00:51.999> that

obvious choices the obvious cards that

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.419 
obvious choices the obvious cards that
everyone<00:00:53.050> would<00:00:53.170> like<00:00:53.320> to<00:00:53.499> see<00:00:53.649> reprinted<00:00:54.219> as

everyone would like to see reprinted as
supers<00:00:55.120> or<00:00:55.300> something<00:00:55.570> like<00:00:55.629> that<00:00:55.749> I<00:00:56.140> really

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679 
supers or something like that I really

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:57.930 
supers or something like that I really
just<00:00:56.859> helped<00:00:57.010> a<00:00:57.100> lot<00:00:57.190> of<00:00:57.280> the<00:00:57.339> casual<00:00:57.730> players

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
just helped a lot of the casual players

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.459 
just helped a lot of the casual players
that<00:00:58.210> are<00:00:58.300> looking<00:00:58.449> to<00:00:58.569> bling<00:00:58.929> out<00:00:59.019> their<00:00:59.260> deck

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.139 
that are looking to bling out their deck
I<00:00:59.739> mean<00:01:00.129> when<00:01:00.370> else<00:01:00.550> would<00:01:00.670> we<00:01:00.879> have<00:01:00.999> ever

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
I mean when else would we have ever

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.360 
I mean when else would we have ever
gotten<00:01:01.449> a<00:01:01.870> holographic<00:01:02.289> version<00:01:02.800> of<00:01:02.980> mass

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
gotten a holographic version of mass

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.310 
gotten a holographic version of mass
change<00:01:03.789> one<00:01:04.479> of<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.629> cards<00:01:04.930> that<00:01:05.050> I<00:01:05.199> was

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
change one of the cards that I was

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.850 
change one of the cards that I was
really<00:01:05.530> sad<00:01:05.800> not<00:01:06.070> to<00:01:06.100> see<00:01:06.280> super<00:01:07.000> rare<00:01:07.210> form<00:01:07.540> in

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
really sad not to see super rare form in

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.530 
really sad not to see super rare form in
legendary<00:01:08.860> collection<00:01:09.070> 3<00:01:09.520> was<00:01:09.700> terraforming

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
legendary collection 3 was terraforming

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.650 
legendary collection 3 was terraforming
but<00:01:11.200> you<00:01:11.560> know<00:01:11.710> I<00:01:12.010> guess<00:01:12.580> Konami<00:01:13.090> had<00:01:13.330> a<00:01:13.360> plan

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
but you know I guess Konami had a plan

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.780 
but you know I guess Konami had a plan
and<00:01:14.080> one<00:01:14.860> of<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.010> reasons<00:01:15.040> we<00:01:15.340> didn't<00:01:15.550> see<00:01:15.700> it

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
and one of the reasons we didn't see it

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.190 
and one of the reasons we didn't see it
in<00:01:15.910> that<00:01:16.090> set<00:01:16.360> was<00:01:16.390> of<00:01:16.660> course<00:01:16.810> because<00:01:17.050> it's

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
in that set was of course because it's

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.350 
in that set was of course because it's
coming<00:01:17.470> out<00:01:17.560> of<00:01:17.710> super<00:01:18.010> rare<00:01:18.130> form<00:01:18.430> here<00:01:18.880> which

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
coming out of super rare form here which

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:20.880 
coming out of super rare form here which
is<00:01:19.540> really<00:01:19.750> neat<00:01:19.960> that<00:01:20.200> pretty<00:01:20.560> much<00:01:20.710> means

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
is really neat that pretty much means

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
been you know a super rare when they

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
dark world being probably a little bit

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.190 
dark world being probably a little bit
harder<00:01:51.430> since<00:01:51.640> it<00:01:51.850> was<00:01:52.030> in<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.600> structure<00:01:53.050> deck

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200

harder since it was in a structure deck
to<00:01:53.350> begin<00:01:53.560> with<00:01:53.740> because<00:01:53.980> easily<00:01:54.340> been<00:01:54.640> that

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
to begin with because easily been that

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.490 
to begin with because easily been that
second<00:01:55.150> super<00:01:55.390> rare<00:01:55.510> in<00:01:55.690> that<00:01:55.870> structure<00:01:56.230> deck

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
second super rare in that structure deck

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.470 
second super rare in that structure deck

rare and one of the turbo packs but was

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.590 
rare and one of the turbo packs but was
extremely<00:02:31.860> hard<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.100> get<00:02:32.220> there<00:02:32.430> as<00:02:32.610> well<00:02:32.820> so

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
extremely hard to get there as well so

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.540 
extremely hard to get there as well so
it<00:02:33.660> gets<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.870> little<00:02:34.020> bit<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.470> rarity<00:02:34.980> upgrade

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
it gets a little bit of a rarity upgrade

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.010 
it gets a little bit of a rarity upgrade
if<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:35.760> will<00:02:35.910> by<00:02:36.090> going<00:02:36.390> up<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.569> hold<00:02:36.840> on<00:02:36.959> a

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
if you will by going up to hold on a

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.020 
if you will by going up to hold on a
rare<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.500> looks<00:02:37.920> pretty<00:02:38.250> fantastic<00:02:38.489> i<00:02:39.000> really

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
rare and looks pretty fantastic i really

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.060 
rare and looks pretty fantastic i really
like<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.870> way<00:02:39.900> ultimate<00:02:40.350> rares<00:02:40.530> look<00:02:40.860> for

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
like the way ultimate rares look for

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.560 
like the way ultimate rares look for
those<00:02:41.160> you<00:02:41.310> guys<00:02:41.430> who've<00:02:41.640> watched<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.420> lot<00:02:42.510> of

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
those you guys who've watched a lot of

those you guys who've watched a lot of
my<00:02:42.690> pack<00:02:42.900> openings<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.530> kind<00:02:43.890> of<00:02:43.920> tell<00:02:44.100> that<00:02:44.310> i

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
my pack openings you kind of tell that i

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.310 
my pack openings you kind of tell that i
collect<00:02:45.090> ultimate<00:02:45.480> rare<00:02:45.630> so<00:02:45.840> eventually<00:02:46.110> I'd

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
collect ultimate rare so eventually I'd

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.770 
collect ultimate rare so eventually I'd
like<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.590> get<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.950> play<00:02:47.550> set<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:47.940> all<00:02:48.480> these

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
like to get a play set of all these

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.060 
like to get a play set of all these
actually<00:02:49.260> I'd<00:02:49.320> like<00:02:49.440> to<00:02:49.530> get<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.680> place<00:02:49.800> that

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
actually I'd like to get a place that

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.590 
actually I'd like to get a place that
are<00:02:50.160> probably<00:02:50.370> every<00:02:50.730> card<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.120> set<00:02:51.300> even

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
are probably every card in the set even

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.020 
are probably every card in the set even
