each one of them also focuses on one of

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.770 
each one of them also focuses on one of
the<00:00:34.860> specific<00:00:35.070> areas<00:00:35.430> so<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.000> upper<00:00:36.450> abs<00:00:36.600> your

three<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.799> best<00:01:29.100> app<00:01:29.420> exercises<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:31.140> next

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
three of the best app exercises the next

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.230 
three of the best app exercises the next
exercise<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:31.860> made<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.280> into<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.640> top<00:01:32.850> three

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
exercise that made it into the top three

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.380 
exercise that made it into the top three
best<00:01:33.659> ab<00:01:33.990> exercises<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.640> captain's<00:01:36.090> chair

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
best ab exercises is the captain's chair

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.149 
best ab exercises is the captain's chair
now<00:01:36.960> if<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.170> don't<00:01:37.350> know<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.040> what

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
now if you don't know that this is what

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.130 
now if you don't know that this is what
it<00:01:38.250> looks<00:01:38.460> like<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.880> really<00:01:39.450> it's<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.750> hanging

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
it looks like and really it's a hanging

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.840 
it looks like and really it's a hanging
leg<00:01:40.290> raise<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.950> think<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> reason<00:01:41.670> this

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
leg raise but I think the reason this

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.580 
leg raise but I think the reason this
one<00:01:42.060> maybe<00:01:42.210> made<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.630> into<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.079> top<00:01:43.320> three<00:01:43.350> is

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
one maybe made it into the top three is

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.260 
one maybe made it into the top three is
because<00:01:43.950> we're<00:01:44.159> for<00:01:44.310> hanging<00:01:44.549> leg<00:01:44.700> raise<00:01:44.970> if

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
because we're for hanging leg raise if

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.819 
because we're for hanging leg raise if
you<00:01:45.540> don't<00:01:45.750> control<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.320> you<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.530> actually

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
you don't control it you can actually

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.350 
you don't control it you can actually
swing<00:01:47.159> and<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.790> means<00:01:48.000> you're<00:01:48.180> going<00:01:48.270> to

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
swing and that means you're going to

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.359 
swing and that means you're going to
stimulate<00:01:48.540> less<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.500> your<00:01:49.560> terminal<00:01:50.009> muscles

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
stimulate less of your terminal muscles

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.429 
stimulate less of your terminal muscles
with<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.670> one<00:01:50.850> almost<00:01:51.210> forces<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.990> to

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
with this one almost forces you to

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.139 
with this one almost forces you to
stimulate<00:01:52.920> and<00:01:53.130> work<00:01:53.490> your<00:01:53.640> abdominal<00:01:54.119> wall

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
stimulate and work your abdominal wall

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.060 
stimulate and work your abdominal wall
and<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.899> one<00:01:55.049> focuses<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.530> little<00:01:55.740> bit<00:01:55.860> more

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
and this one focuses a little bit more

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.010 
and this one focuses a little bit more
on<00:01:56.250> your<00:01:56.399> lower<00:01:56.640> abs<00:01:56.909> where<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.420> first<00:01:57.659> one<00:01:57.869> is

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
on your lower abs where the first one is

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.630 
on your lower abs where the first one is
morn<00:01:58.350> you're<00:01:58.530> Bleek's<00:01:58.829> but<00:01:59.009> also<00:01:59.189> your<00:01:59.430> full

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
morn you're Bleek's but also your full

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.999 
morn you're Bleek's but also your full
abdominal<00:02:00.090> wall<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.509> then<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.469> third<00:02:01.799> one

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
abdominal wall and then the third one

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.280 
abdominal wall and then the third one
that<00:02:02.070> made<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.430> into<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.909> top<00:02:03.149> three<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.659> in

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
that made it into the top three is in

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.039 
that made it into the top three is in
fact<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:05.009> stability<00:02:05.640> ball<00:02:05.670> crunch<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.780> this

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
fact the stability ball crunch and this

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.719 
fact the stability ball crunch and this
is<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.200> great<00:02:07.439> exercise<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.220> reason<00:02:08.580> it's

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
is a great exercise and the reason it's

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.660 
is a great exercise and the reason it's
so<00:02:08.819> great<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.690> range<00:02:10.080> of<00:02:10.379> movement<00:02:10.979> as<00:02:11.400> you

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
so great is the range of movement as you

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.460 
so great is the range of movement as you
can<00:02:11.819> see<00:02:12.000> with<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:12.300> video<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:13.080> goes

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
can see with this video it goes

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.230 
can see with this video it goes
all<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.740> way<00:02:13.860> back<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.520> can<00:02:14.790> come<00:02:14.970> up<00:02:15.000> as

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
all the way back and you can come up as

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.120 
all the way back and you can come up as
high<00:02:15.510> as<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.780> want<00:02:15.990> when<00:02:16.440> you<00:02:16.560> do<00:02:16.710> your<00:02:16.830> actual

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
high as you want when you do your actual

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.850 
high as you want when you do your actual
crunch<00:02:17.460> so<00:02:18.120> this<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:19.020> without<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.590> doubt<00:02:19.680> a

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
crunch so this is without a doubt a

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.160 
crunch so this is without a doubt a
great<00:02:20.220> exercise<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:21.030> this<00:02:21.390> one<00:02:21.630> focuses<00:02:22.140> a

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
great exercise and this one focuses a

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.780 
great exercise and this one focuses a
little<00:02:22.500> bit<00:02:22.620> more<00:02:22.800> on<00:02:22.890> your<00:02:23.010> upper<00:02:23.370> abs<00:02:23.550> and

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
little bit more on your upper abs and

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.120 
little bit more on your upper abs and
like<00:02:24.180> I've<00:02:24.360> mentioned<00:02:24.780> although<00:02:25.410> these<00:02:25.830> were

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
like I've mentioned although these were

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.850 
like I've mentioned although these were
the<00:02:26.220> best<00:02:26.550> three<00:02:26.880> ab<00:02:27.030> exercises<00:02:27.720> each<00:02:28.440> one<00:02:28.770> of

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
the best three ab exercises each one of

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.530 
the best three ab exercises each one of
them<00:02:28.980> focus<00:02:29.400> in<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.580> different<00:02:29.940> area<00:02:30.150> which

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
them focus in a different area which

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.480 
them focus in a different area which
means<00:02:30.780> we<00:02:31.320> can<00:02:31.500> actually<00:02:31.650> create<00:02:31.890> a<00:02:32.070> powerful

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
means we can actually create a powerful

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.040 
means we can actually create a powerful
workout<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:33.480> let's<00:02:33.660> have<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.810> look<00:02:33.930> at

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
workout so let's have a look at

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.780 
workout so let's have a look at
instruction<00:02:34.620> how<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:34.890> combine<00:02:35.190> these<00:02:35.550> three

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
instruction how to combine these three

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.000 
instruction how to combine these three
exercises<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.870> create<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.170> powerful<00:02:37.530> workout

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
exercises to create a powerful workout

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.950 
exercises to create a powerful workout
that<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.190> can<00:02:38.220> do<00:02:38.520> so<00:02:39.180> in<00:02:39.330> theory<00:02:39.720> you<00:02:39.840> can

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
that you can do so in theory you can

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.770 
that you can do so in theory you can
call<00:02:40.200> this<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.650> most<00:02:41.280> powerful<00:02:41.910> app<00:02:42.090> workout

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
call this the most powerful app workout

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.540
