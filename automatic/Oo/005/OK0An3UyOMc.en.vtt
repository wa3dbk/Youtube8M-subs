one<00:00:59.190> of<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.340> first<00:00:59.550> things<00:00:59.790> I'm<00:00:59.970> going<00:01:00.000> to

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
one of the first things I'm going to

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.330 
one of the first things I'm going to
look<00:01:00.330> at<00:01:00.540> is<00:01:00.809> its<00:01:01.290> lock<00:01:01.470> up<00:01:01.650> system<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.130> it<00:01:02.220> has

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
look at is its lock up system and it has

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.880 
look at is its lock up system and it has
the<00:01:02.489> access<00:01:02.700> lock<00:01:03.120> up<00:01:03.329> system<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.710> is

the access lock up system and this is

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.620 
the access lock up system and this is
very<00:01:05.070> similar<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.520> my<00:01:05.670> spider<00:01:05.970> comb<00:01:06.210> annex

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
give it contrast and texture but it also

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.120 
give it contrast and texture but it also
makes<00:02:15.959> it<00:02:16.050> really<00:02:16.230> good<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.590> grip<00:02:16.800> into<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.640 
good reasons to have this is the
thickness<00:02:39.000> of<00:02:39.300> this<00:02:39.420> blade<00:02:39.750> I<00:02:40.050> want<00:02:40.470> you<00:02:40.560> to

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
thickness of this blade I want you to

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.280 
thickness of this blade I want you to
look<00:02:40.800> at<00:02:40.950> the<00:02:41.040> thickness<00:02:41.460> it's<00:02:42.300> about<00:02:42.600> a<00:02:42.630> 8

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
look at the thickness it's about a 8

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.800 
look at the thickness it's about a 8
an<00:02:43.349> inch<00:02:43.560> in<00:02:43.769> thickness<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.700> then<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.569> starts

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
an inch in thickness and then it starts

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.130 
an inch in thickness and then it starts
to<00:02:45.959> taper<00:02:46.170> down<00:02:46.530> to<00:02:47.370> a<00:02:47.400> really<00:02:47.760> nice<00:02:47.939> point<00:02:48.299> it

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
to taper down to a really nice point it

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.470 
to taper down to a really nice point it
is<00:02:49.319> a<00:02:49.349> drop-point<00:02:49.769> blade<00:02:50.069> and<00:02:50.579> then<00:02:51.329> right

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
is a drop-point blade and then right

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.660 
is a drop-point blade and then right
here<00:02:51.689> you<00:02:51.750> can<00:02:51.989> see<00:02:52.019> where<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.650> ground<00:02:52.890> starts

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
here you can see where the ground starts

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.119 
here you can see where the ground starts
all<00:02:53.879> the<00:02:53.939> way<00:02:54.299> down<00:02:54.629> and<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.590> weight<00:02:55.769> on<00:02:55.950> this

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
all the way down and the weight on this

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.699 
all the way down and the weight on this
is<00:02:56.400> 4.8<00:02:56.670> ounces<00:02:57.599> which<00:02:57.810> is<00:02:57.989> a<00:02:58.019> pretty<00:02:58.409> hefty

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
is 4.8 ounces which is a pretty hefty

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.220 
is 4.8 ounces which is a pretty hefty
little<00:02:59.129> knife<00:02:59.310> for<00:02:59.579> its<00:02:59.700> size<00:02:59.879> but<00:03:00.659> again<00:03:01.019> this

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
little knife for its size but again this

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.890 
little knife for its size but again this
really<00:03:01.439> gives<00:03:01.799> you<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.220> small<00:03:02.730> package<00:03:03.150> with<00:03:03.390> a

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
really gives you a small package with a

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.720 
really gives you a small package with a
good<00:03:04.400> solid<00:03:05.400> feel<00:03:05.609> to<00:03:05.849> it<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:08.220> liners<00:03:08.609> are

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
good solid feel to it the liners are

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.300 
good solid feel to it the liners are
stainless<00:03:09.030> steel

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
stainless steel

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.599 
stainless steel
very<00:03:11.310> nice<00:03:11.579> pretty<00:03:12.450> thick<00:03:12.750> liners<00:03:13.370> you<00:03:14.370> look

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
very nice pretty thick liners you look

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.899 
very nice pretty thick liners you look
down<00:03:14.849> inside<00:03:15.209> you<00:03:15.689> can<00:03:15.840> see<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.200> relief<00:03:16.500> holes

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:16.909 
down inside you can see the relief holes

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:19.550 
down inside you can see the relief holes
the<00:03:17.909> circular<00:03:18.389> relief<00:03:18.689> holes<00:03:18.930> in<00:03:19.109> each<00:03:19.230> place

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
the circular relief holes in each place

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.460 
the circular relief holes in each place
so<00:03:19.950> that<00:03:20.159> just<00:03:20.670> cuts<00:03:20.909> down<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.329> weight<00:03:21.540> but<00:03:22.349> it

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
so that just cuts down the weight but it

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.170 
so that just cuts down the weight but it
doesn't<00:03:22.799> lessen<00:03:22.980> the<00:03:23.189> strength<00:03:23.519> of<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.790> liner

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
doesn't lessen the strength of the liner

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.809 
doesn't lessen the strength of the liner
itself<00:03:24.599> now<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.560> pocket<00:03:26.099> clip<00:03:26.220> is<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.549> deep

little<00:04:09.030> texturing<00:04:09.690> almost<00:04:10.049> a<00:04:10.169> weave<00:04:10.470> very

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
little texturing almost a weave very

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.000 
little texturing almost a weave very
similar<00:04:11.729> to<00:04:11.879> micarta<00:04:12.560> but<00:04:13.560> then<00:04:13.739> when<00:04:13.859> it's

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
similar to micarta but then when it's

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.559 
similar to micarta but then when it's
cut<00:04:14.280> through<00:04:14.609> it<00:04:14.819> brings<00:04:15.060> out<00:04:15.209> a<00:04:15.239> lighter

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
cut through it brings out a lighter

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:17.870 
cut through it brings out a lighter
color<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:16.169> then<00:04:16.799> you<00:04:16.919> have<00:04:17.039> these<00:04:17.220> bands<00:04:17.579> of

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
color and then you have these bands of

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.589 
color and then you have these bands of
darker<00:04:18.239> color<00:04:18.479> that<00:04:18.690> come<00:04:18.900> through<00:04:20.479> with<00:04:21.479> the

darker color that come through with the
stainless<00:04:21.840> steel<00:04:22.019> it<00:04:22.470> really<00:04:23.010> makes<00:04:23.250> it<00:04:23.400> a

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
stainless steel it really makes it a

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.510 
stainless steel it really makes it a
nice<00:04:23.699> contrast<00:04:24.860> now<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:25.919> one<00:04:26.099> cool<00:04:26.280> thing

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
nice contrast now the one cool thing

nice contrast now the one cool thing
about<00:04:26.639> this<00:04:26.909> knife<00:04:27.120> is<00:04:27.300> there<00:04:27.449> five<00:04:27.720> ways<00:04:27.960> to

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
about this knife is there five ways to

about this knife is there five ways to
open<00:04:28.440> it<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:29.550> knife<00:04:29.699> just<00:04:29.729> glides<00:04:30.270> out<00:04:30.570> now

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
open it the knife just glides out now

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.649 
open it the knife just glides out now
whether<00:04:31.440> using<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:31.860> flipper<00:04:32.159> design<00:04:32.490> you<00:04:33.449> can

00:04:33.649 --> 00:04:33.659 
whether using the flipper design you can

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:35.300 
whether using the flipper design you can
use<00:04:33.870> these<00:04:34.050> thumb<00:04:34.349> studs<00:04:34.650> and<00:04:34.889> you<00:04:34.979> can<00:04:35.099> see

comes out really nice that way one of
the<00:04:40.650> other<00:04:40.770> ways<00:04:40.949> to<00:04:41.159> grab<00:04:41.310> the<00:04:41.430> locking

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
the other ways to grab the locking

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:44.060 
the other ways to grab the locking
system<00:04:41.970> and<00:04:42.330> just<00:04:42.570> flip<00:04:42.960> it<00:04:43.080> out<00:04:43.259> and<00:04:43.590> you<00:04:43.919> can

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
system and just flip it out and you can

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.610 
system and just flip it out and you can
also<00:04:44.190> open<00:04:44.490> this<00:04:44.550> blade<00:04:44.759> through<00:04:44.909> gravity

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
also open this blade through gravity

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.499 
also open this blade through gravity
takes<00:04:46.620> a<00:04:46.680> little<00:04:46.830> practice<00:04:47.310> but<00:04:48.030> it<00:04:48.150> comes<00:04:48.330> out

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:48.509 
takes a little practice but it comes out

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:50.480 
takes a little practice but it comes out
really<00:04:48.840> smooth<00:04:49.139> and<00:04:49.409> then<00:04:49.979> last<00:04:50.190> but<00:04:50.370> not

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
really smooth and then last but not

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.659 
really smooth and then last but not
least<00:04:50.759> just<00:04:51.270> open<00:04:51.570> it<00:04:51.659> the<00:04:51.779> traditional<00:04:51.930> way

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
least just open it the traditional way

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:56.120 
least just open it the traditional way
number<00:04:53.669> five<00:04:54.440> one<00:04:55.440> of<00:04:55.529> the<00:04:55.590> things<00:04:55.740> about<00:04:55.860> this

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
number five one of the things about this

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.200 
number five one of the things about this
knife<00:04:56.370> is<00:04:56.729> that<00:04:56.760> it

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
knife is that it

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:58.999 
knife is that it
very<00:04:57.479> rugged<00:04:57.810> looking<00:04:58.289> knife<00:04:58.500> and<00:04:58.770> I<00:04:58.800> think

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
very rugged looking knife and I think

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:00.379 
very rugged looking knife and I think
that<00:04:59.130> has<00:04:59.250> to<00:04:59.370> do<00:04:59.460> with<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.669> scales<00:05:00.000> and<00:05:00.330> the

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
that has to do with the scales and the

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.510 
that has to do with the scales and the
color<00:05:00.660> and<00:05:00.780> the<00:05:00.930> texturing<00:05:01.500> but<00:05:02.250> the<00:05:02.340> knife

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
color and the texturing but the knife

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.850 
color and the texturing but the knife
itself<00:05:02.940> has<00:05:03.120> a<00:05:03.150> really<00:05:03.270> refined<00:05:03.930> feel<00:05:04.319> to<00:05:04.530> it

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
itself has a really refined feel to it

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.439 
itself has a really refined feel to it
so<00:05:05.250> I<00:05:05.280> think<00:05:05.370> this<00:05:05.550> would<00:05:05.699> make<00:05:05.849> an<00:05:06.000> excellent

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
so I think this would make an excellent

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.529 
so I think this would make an excellent
useful<00:05:07.199> EDC<00:05:08.039> knife<00:05:08.069> and<00:05:08.550> with<00:05:09.150> the<00:05:09.270> thickness

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
useful EDC knife and with the thickness

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:12.140 
useful EDC knife and with the thickness
of<00:05:09.750> this<00:05:09.870> blade<00:05:10.259> you<00:05:11.130> really<00:05:11.580> have<00:05:11.699> a<00:05:11.729> lot<00:05:11.970> of
