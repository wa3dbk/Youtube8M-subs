00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello friends with you day of ken 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.520
 we continue to discuss in this blog 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.529
 nutrition issues for 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.990
 achieve and maintain excellent 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.700
 physical fitness and today we will 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.670
 decide with you probably one of the most 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.240
 important issues of the most applied 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.789
 nutrition issues is 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:23.730
 last meal before bed or 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.590
 in the evening more precisely the last not a meal I 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.599
 would even say so that the question is which 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.179
 I constantly have when I 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.769
 find myself at home how to eat something when 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.920
 this is not eating anything extra 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.739
 so today I will be showing you 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.579
 two ways that one can 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.920
 create the amount of food while creating 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.450
 just almost zero amount 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.610
 calories 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.260
 in short, what's on my desk today on 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.670
 The table today is a wild plate with vegetables 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.260
 here a lot of calories is very small but 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.960
 here naturally there is not an ounce 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.750
 in order for this huge 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.800
 amount of water with vitamins minerals 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.049
 and fiber 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.180
 add a little protein here i have 4 egg 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.850
 squirrel I will use but now still 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.049
 not separated and 100 grams of turkey in 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.700
 wet weight 100 grams 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.520
 accordingly, we have here about 20 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.280
 gram of protein and so i offer you two 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.439
 option two scenarios and so first 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.799
 We will deal with squirrels a little him 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.090
 then I do not want to understand 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.369
 bother for a year squirrels 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.829
 the game of cartilage can be drunk raw but 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.509
 raw egg whites 8000 return to 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.880
 light can i can do diode i can 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.159
 drink raw egg whites but worth them 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.590
 cook or fry they give volume 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.530
 kinda when eating 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.060
 that is, you chew especially if with vegetables with 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.850
 tomatoes resources by the way pretty 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:49.689
 tomatoes there and eating ass 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:53.290
 yes where are they all running away the tomatoes are shorter 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:57.630
 fried or boiled egg whites with 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:02.170
 tomatoes and salt a little bit already before 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:05.080
 then because the girl is ready to help about 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.039
 smell and she's just just four of them 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:11.010
 protein care well of course you can more 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.080
 lobe like tomatoes and cucumbers 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.860
 music come off new year here i 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.110
 I'll point you in the evening to salt it well 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.850
 mood that hold the anger for your 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.360
 health the first script went mean 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.360
 first script 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.200
 personal protein with tomato is great that 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.850
 we have here 20 grams of protein 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.910
 honestly tendulkar let's say so by calories 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:41.110
 no funny up to 16 grams of protein how many 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:44.049
 us 47,464 calories are clearly energy deficient 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.450
 that in the evening and now need a second 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.190
 scenario the second scenario is more creative 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.680
 will of course from that very mountain 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.239
 vegetables which he boasted 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.890
 first set the average temperature 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.569
 because they need to be extinguished 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:02.849
 The first scenario came to our senses but 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:05.579
 went a big chopping boil all clearly 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.629
 the number is shorter then defended 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.609
 show off looked 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:11.870
 I already started pontovatsya in the kitchen 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.870
 as if nothing to doubt turn 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.349
 squares as pretty butt 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:21.829
 short and so people advised us 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.419
 lest the bow and eyes I forgot now 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.889
 I will say I forgot to cut tomatoes too 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.540
 or not or so literally four parts 

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:31.319
 yes , there is no place on the board 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:34.469
 so all this oh you will be right now 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:38.609
 smell the feast don't have to fall into everything 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:44.159
 hand so do not pick up podsobrat 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:48.719
 from collect now what carrots weight so 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:51.090
 still such an effect shu climbed some forest to 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:52.860
 than I do not see at all why broccoli 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:58.230
 I began to cut you 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:04:00.960
 okay give you a gorilla burden on 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:05.390
 everything will cut it looks certainly not 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:08.700

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:21.269
 I will say already generally good such smells 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.580
 season with salt and season with salt and here I will 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:25.440

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.770
 100 grams I will unscrew why 100 grams 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:35.280
