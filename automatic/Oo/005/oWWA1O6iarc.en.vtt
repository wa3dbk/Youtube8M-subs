00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
but we're just going to go into how to

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:01.630 
but we're just going to go into how to
change<00:00:55.030> from<00:00:56.030> a<00:00:58.329> lipo<00:00:59.329> battery<00:00:59.809> to<00:01:00.680> life

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
change from a lipo battery to life

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.090 
change from a lipo battery to life
battery<00:01:02.210> because<00:01:02.690> a<00:01:02.930> lot<00:01:03.350> of<00:01:03.379> guys<00:01:03.710> are<00:01:03.739> using

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
battery because a lot of guys are using

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.029 
battery because a lot of guys are using
and<00:01:04.550> girls<00:01:04.759> using<00:01:05.630> these<00:01:05.960> batteries<00:01:06.410> here<00:01:06.710> for

00:01:07.029 --> 00:01:07.039 
and girls using these batteries here for

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:09.910 
and girls using these batteries here for
what<00:01:08.000> type<00:01:08.450> type<00:01:08.750> of<00:01:08.899> battery<00:01:09.080> life<00:01:09.410> battery

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
what type type of battery life battery

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.850 
what type type of battery life battery
for<00:01:10.720> putting<00:01:11.720> in<00:01:11.840> their<00:01:11.990> transmitters

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
for putting in their transmitters

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.600 
for putting in their transmitters
because<00:01:13.729> they<00:01:13.850> last<00:01:14.060> a<00:01:14.210> lot<00:01:14.330> longer<00:01:14.390> and<00:01:15.399> a<00:01:16.399> lot

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
because they last a lot longer and a lot

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.330 
because they last a lot longer and a lot
easier<00:01:16.820> to<00:01:17.060> manage<00:01:17.690> then<00:01:18.350> having<00:01:18.920> multiple

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
easier to manage then having multiple

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.450 
easier to manage then having multiple
delays<00:01:19.900> ok<00:01:20.900> because<00:01:21.680> difference<00:01:22.159> between

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
delays ok because difference between

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.120 
delays ok because difference between
life<00:01:22.670> batteries<00:01:23.210> apart<00:01:23.840> from<00:01:24.049> this<00:01:24.770> is<00:01:25.070> a

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
life batteries apart from this is a

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.490 
life batteries apart from this is a
different<00:01:25.460> obviously<00:01:26.360> milliamp<00:01:27.140> so<00:01:27.380> it's

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
different obviously milliamp so it's

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.810 
different obviously milliamp so it's
going<00:01:27.590> to<00:01:27.650> be<00:01:27.740> smaller<00:01:28.130> than<00:01:28.250> us<00:01:28.520> there's<00:01:28.760> a

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
going to be smaller than us there's a

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
cell is 3.3 volts if you charged these

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:48.160 
cell is 3.3 volts if you charged these
on<00:01:46.579> a<00:01:46.640> charger<00:01:47.210> that<00:01:47.390> set<00:01:47.659> up<00:01:47.780> for<00:01:47.990> these

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
on a charger that set up for these

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.679 
on a charger that set up for these
you'll<00:01:49.100> cook<00:01:49.369> this<00:01:49.640> and<00:01:49.909> your<00:01:50.060> mazel<00:01:50.360> buffer

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
you'll cook this and your mazel buffer

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:51.940 
you'll cook this and your mazel buffer
won't<00:01:50.990> last<00:01:51.170> very<00:01:51.290> long<00:01:51.439> at<00:01:51.680> all<00:01:51.770> though

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
won't last very long at all though

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.580 
won't last very long at all though
actually<00:01:52.159> overheat<00:01:52.759> because<00:01:53.689> you're<00:01:54.229> pumping

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
actually overheat because you're pumping

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.270 
actually overheat because you're pumping
in<00:01:54.680> way<00:01:54.920> too<00:01:54.979> much<00:01:55.250> voltage<00:01:56.409> okay<00:01:57.409> so<00:01:58.040> here's

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
in way too much voltage okay so here's

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.800 
in way too much voltage okay so here's
how<00:01:58.430> that<00:01:58.490> normally<00:01:59.090> these<00:01:59.240> things<00:01:59.540> come

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
how that normally these things come

you guys out that tune in and give you a

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.240 
you guys out that tune in and give you a
bit<00:02:35.390> of<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.540> heads<00:02:35.750> up<00:02:35.900> on<00:02:36.050> how<00:02:36.200> to<00:02:36.260> do<00:02:36.500> it<00:02:36.590> ok

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
bit of a heads up on how to do it ok

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.120 
bit of a heads up on how to do it ok
let's<00:02:37.430> cut<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.760> chase<00:02:37.959> so<00:02:38.959> remember<00:02:39.170> 3.34

your balance leaders a key indicator how
many<00:03:51.739> leads<00:03:52.010> coming<00:03:52.519> off<00:03:52.700> this<00:03:53.200> tells<00:03:54.200> you<00:03:54.380> how

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
many leads coming off this tells you how

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.140 
many leads coming off this tells you how
many<00:03:54.739> cells<00:03:55.040> so<00:03:55.310> if<00:03:55.370> there's<00:03:55.579> four<00:03:55.850> wires

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
many cells so if there's four wires

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.910 
many cells so if there's four wires
you've<00:03:56.660> got<00:03:56.900> three<00:03:57.200> cells<00:03:57.500> because<00:03:57.769> it's

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
you've got three cells because it's

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.400 
you've got three cells because it's
always<00:03:58.280> an<00:03:58.430> earth<00:03:58.609> which<00:03:58.820> is<00:03:59.000> black<00:03:59.290> so<00:04:00.290> if

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
always an earth which is black so if

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.250 
always an earth which is black so if
you've<00:04:00.560> got<00:04:00.590> five<00:04:01.220> of<00:04:01.430> these<00:04:02.049> you've<00:04:03.049> got<00:04:03.230> a

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
you've got five of these you've got a

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.319 
you've got five of these you've got a
full<00:04:03.530> self<00:04:03.859> you've<00:04:04.579> got<00:04:04.700> seven<00:04:05.120> of<00:04:05.239> these

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
full self you've got seven of these

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.900 
full self you've got seven of these
you've<00:04:05.600> got<00:04:05.750> a<00:04:05.780> six<00:04:06.109> cell<00:04:06.549> okay<00:04:07.549> so<00:04:07.609> hope<00:04:07.880> that

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
you've got a six cell okay so hope that

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.569 
you've got a six cell okay so hope that
makes<00:04:08.239> sense<00:04:08.560> so<00:04:09.560> once<00:04:09.980> you've<00:04:10.130> got<00:04:10.280> it<00:04:10.310> set

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
makes sense so once you've got it set

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:15.280 
makes sense so once you've got it set

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
so let's start to get into the

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.920 
so let's start to get into the
programming<00:04:47.820> out<00:04:47.940> and<00:04:48.120> as<00:04:48.240> you<00:04:48.360> can<00:04:48.510> see<00:04:48.540> it's

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
programming out and as you can see it's

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.340 
programming out and as you can see it's

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.760 
nine point nine volts for three cell set
up<00:04:52.470> for<00:04:52.680> 1.5<00:04:53.580> amps<00:04:54.450> which<00:04:54.630> is<00:04:54.810> a1c<00:04:55.350> rating

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
up for 1.5 amps which is a1c rating

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.860 
up for 1.5 amps which is a1c rating
which<00:04:55.890> is<00:04:56.070> a<00:04:56.100> usual<00:04:56.730> Kavya<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.450> maximum

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
charge that you can put into these

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.360 
charge that you can put into these
batteries<00:04:59.550> or<00:05:00.060> any<00:05:00.240> battery<00:05:00.660> really<00:05:01.100> but<00:05:02.100> good

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
batteries or any battery really but good

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.710 
batteries or any battery really but good
standard<00:05:02.880> practices<00:05:03.330> one<00:05:03.540> see<00:05:03.900> some<00:05:04.200> of<00:05:04.230> the

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
standard practices one see some of the

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.140 
standard practices one see some of the
good<00:05:06.720> bit<00:05:07.680> of<00:05:07.890> the<00:05:08.190> bitter<00:05:08.430> and<00:05:08.730> more

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
good bit of the bitter and more

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.190 
good bit of the bitter and more
expensive<00:05:09.420> batteries<00:05:09.840> you<00:05:10.830> can<00:05:10.860> run<00:05:11.250> up<00:05:11.400> to

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
expensive batteries you can run up to

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:19.190 
expensive batteries you can run up to
four<00:05:13.200> or<00:05:13.320> five<00:05:13.560> see<00:05:13.890> on<00:05:14.070> them<00:05:16.490> so<00:05:17.870> yeah<00:05:18.870> but

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
four or five see on them so yeah but

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.100 
four or five see on them so yeah but
anyway<00:05:19.470> so<00:05:20.130> that<00:05:20.280> shows<00:05:20.460> you<00:05:20.640> how<00:05:20.670> to<00:05:20.850> do<00:05:21.030> it

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
anyway so that shows you how to do it

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.720 
anyway so that shows you how to do it
you<00:05:22.110> can't<00:05:22.770> it<00:05:22.920> up<00:05:23.040> just<00:05:23.250> like<00:05:23.460> you<00:05:23.580> normally

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
you can't it up just like you normally

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.090 
you can't it up just like you normally
do<00:05:24.120> you<00:05:24.750> know<00:05:24.870> put<00:05:25.140> you<00:05:25.260> put<00:05:25.620> your<00:05:25.770> lead<00:05:25.920> on<00:05:26.070> I

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
do you know put you put your lead on I

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.560 
do you know put you put your lead on I
put<00:05:26.340> a<00:05:26.370> little<00:05:26.490> balance<00:05:26.790> lead<00:05:27.120> coming<00:05:27.330> in<00:05:27.480> on

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
put a little balance lead coming in on

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.540 
put a little balance lead coming in on
my<00:05:27.690> three<00:05:27.960> port<00:05:28.260> sensor<00:05:28.800> because<00:05:29.310> I<00:05:29.400> don't

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
my three port sensor because I don't

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.400 
my three port sensor because I don't
like<00:05:29.700> going<00:05:29.910> right<00:05:30.180> up<00:05:30.210> to<00:05:30.450> the<00:05:30.570> thing<00:05:31.200> and
