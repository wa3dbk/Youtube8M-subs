once you have a clean we'll take our

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.210 
once you have a clean we'll take our
three<00:03:47.050> and<00:03:47.140> one<00:03:47.230> of<00:03:47.320> them<00:03:47.410> or<00:03:47.680> lubricate<00:03:48.100> the

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
three and one of them or lubricate the

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.290 
three and one of them or lubricate the
front<00:03:48.400> of<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.520> shaft<00:03:48.760> here<00:03:48.970> on<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.090> gearbox

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
front of the shaft here on the gearbox

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.660 
front of the shaft here on the gearbox
will<00:03:49.660> also<00:03:49.840> be<00:03:49.959> the<00:03:50.080> back<00:03:50.280> then<00:03:51.280> we<00:03:51.340> take<00:03:51.610> that

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
will also be the back then we take that

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.180 
will also be the back then we take that
three<00:03:52.000> 100<00:03:52.270> or<00:03:52.540> lubricate<00:03:52.930> the<00:03:53.050> motor<00:03:53.260> it's<00:03:54.130> a

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
three 100 or lubricate the motor it's a

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.770 
three 100 or lubricate the motor it's a
good<00:03:54.310> idea<00:03:54.520> to<00:03:54.610> try<00:03:54.700> to<00:03:54.790> spin<00:03:55.030> it<00:03:55.060> that<00:03:55.690> way

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
good idea to try to spin it that way

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.479 
good idea to try to spin it that way
it'll<00:03:55.959> spin<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.320> gearbox<00:03:56.709> -<00:03:56.920> it'll<00:03:57.160> let<00:03:57.310> the

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
it'll spin the gearbox - it'll let the

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.449 
it'll spin the gearbox - it'll let the
oil<00:03:57.700> soak<00:03:58.090> in<00:03:58.270> on<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.570> shafts<00:03:58.810> with<00:03:59.709> that<00:03:59.920> that

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
oil soak in on the shafts with that that

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.960 
oil soak in on the shafts with that that
part<00:04:00.670> is<00:04:00.760> doing<00:04:02.489> all<00:04:03.489> right<00:04:03.580> now<00:04:03.760> we're<00:04:03.880> gonna

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
part is doing all right now we're gonna

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.240 
part is doing all right now we're gonna
do<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.209> stove<00:04:04.450> side<00:04:04.720> so<00:04:05.709> first<00:04:05.950> we<00:04:06.070> want<00:04:06.220> to

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
do the stove side so first we want to

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.220 
do the stove side so first we want to
look<00:04:06.310> up<00:04:06.489> in<00:04:06.640> the<00:04:06.730> auger<00:04:07.209> shaft<00:04:07.360> here<00:04:07.870> I<00:04:08.019> want

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
look up in the auger shaft here I want

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.259 
look up in the auger shaft here I want
to<00:04:08.290> make<00:04:08.410> sure<00:04:08.440> there's<00:04:08.860> no<00:04:09.160> stuck<00:04:09.790> pellets<00:04:10.150> in
