00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
inside the floor it is so much of may

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.460 
inside the floor it is so much of may
decrease<00:01:50.300> in<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:50.660> road<00:01:50.990> cool<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:51.320> know<00:01:51.350> where

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
decrease in the road cool you know where

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.190 
decrease in the road cool you know where
you<00:01:51.710> can<00:01:51.860> cut<00:01:52.010> it<00:01:52.040> with<00:01:52.130> a<00:01:52.250> knife<00:01:52.750> so<00:01:53.750> now

you can cut it with a knife so now

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.020 
you can cut it with a knife so now
roller<00:01:54.440> that's<00:01:54.860> your<00:01:54.980> roller<00:01:55.160> roll<00:01:55.790> it<00:01:55.910> on

you're literally just roll into the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.960 
you're literally just roll into the
groove<00:01:59.270> shaping<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.170> come<00:02:00.440> to<00:02:00.650> is<00:02:00.800> you<00:02:01.010> well<00:02:01.820> on

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
groove shaping to come to is you well on

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.160 
groove shaping to come to is you well on
the<00:02:02.060> cars<00:02:02.270> this<00:02:02.420> gutted<00:02:02.780> it's<00:02:02.900> a<00:02:02.990> lot<00:02:03.140> easier

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
the cars this gutted it's a lot easier

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.540 
the cars this gutted it's a lot easier
to<00:02:03.530> run<00:02:03.620> the<00:02:03.740> power<00:02:03.890> cable<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:04.340> we'll<00:02:04.490> be

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
to run the power cable and we'll be

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.450 
to run the power cable and we'll be
changing<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.970> battery<00:02:05.240> as<00:02:05.330> well<00:02:05.540> so<00:02:06.140> Brett

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
changing the battery as well so Brett

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.070 
changing the battery as well so Brett
battery<00:02:07.460> cabling<00:02:08.030> yes<00:02:08.390> tell<00:02:08.750> me<00:02:08.840> about<00:02:08.899> it

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
battery cabling yes tell me about it

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.250 
battery cabling yes tell me about it
well<00:02:09.470> here<00:02:09.679> we've<00:02:09.830> got<00:02:09.860> stingers<00:02:10.519> SPV<00:02:11.420> 44<00:02:12.050> it's

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
well here we've got stingers SPV 44 it's

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.020 
well here we've got stingers SPV 44 it's
the<00:02:12.409> big<00:02:12.800> replacement<00:02:13.370> battery<00:02:13.670> it's

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
the big replacement battery it's

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.460 
the big replacement battery it's
definitely<00:02:14.510> got<00:02:14.629> a<00:02:14.659> lot<00:02:14.720> of<00:02:14.870> power<00:02:15.080> behind<00:02:15.230> it

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
definitely got a lot of power behind it

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.869 
definitely got a lot of power behind it
it's<00:02:15.620> probably<00:02:15.739> got<00:02:16.010> about<00:02:16.099> four<00:02:16.489> times<00:02:16.700> the

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
it's probably got about four times the

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:20.020 
it's probably got about four times the
capacity<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.959> brand<00:02:18.470> new<00:02:18.830> standard<00:02:19.760> battery

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
capacity of a brand new standard battery

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.560 
capacity of a brand new standard battery
they<00:02:20.300> say<00:02:20.540> good<00:02:20.959> things<00:02:20.989> come<00:02:21.290> in<00:02:21.440> small

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
they say good things come in small

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.560 
they say good things come in small
so<00:02:23.570> the<00:02:23.690> cabling<00:02:24.080> as<00:02:24.230> well<00:02:24.410> we'll<00:02:25.220> be<00:02:25.250> running

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
so the cabling as well we'll be running

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.990 
so the cabling as well we'll be running
stingers<00:02:26.570> 0<00:02:27.530> gauge<00:02:27.770> power<00:02:28.100> co<00:02:28.340> mechanical

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
stingers 0 gauge power co mechanical

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.640 
stingers 0 gauge power co mechanical
ability<00:02:29.360> when<00:02:29.510> you<00:02:29.630> test<00:02:29.870> for<00:02:29.960> any<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.530> the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
ability when you test for any of the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.190 
ability when you test for any of the
stereos<00:02:31.010> at<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:32.090> package<00:02:32.420> yeah<00:02:32.630> this<00:02:32.960> this

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
stereos at the package yeah this this

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.290 
stereos at the package yeah this this
cable<00:02:33.590> was<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:33.950> common<00:02:34.460> between<00:02:34.610> all<00:02:35.060> three

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
cable was a common between all three

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.480 
cable was a common between all three
packages<00:02:35.930> yep<00:02:36.230> so<00:02:36.620> we<00:02:36.920> can<00:02:37.070> run<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.310> down

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
packages yep so we can run that down

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:51.020 
packages yep so we can run that down
through<00:02:37.760> the<00:02:37.880> car<00:02:38.060> Walt<00:02:38.300> all<00:02:38.510> apart<00:02:40.840> Steve<00:02:41.840> it

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
saying is quite light yeah it's a

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.120 
saying is quite light yeah it's a
lightweight<00:03:12.690> design<00:03:12.870> for<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.560> sports<00:03:13.860> car

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
lightweight design for the sports car

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.640 
lightweight design for the sports car
besides<00:03:14.819> the<00:03:14.970> weight<00:03:15.239> for<00:03:15.840> power<00:03:16.050> you<00:03:16.380> have

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
besides the weight for power you have

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.729 
besides the weight for power you have
you'll<00:03:17.280> need<00:03:17.489> more<00:03:17.850> break<00:03:18.360> okay<00:03:18.959> well<00:03:19.650> of

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
you'll need more break okay well of

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.320 
you'll need more break okay well of
course<00:03:19.950> of<00:03:20.220> course<00:03:20.370> so<00:03:20.580> normally<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.000> put<00:03:21.090> a

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
course of course so normally you put a

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.090 
course of course so normally you put a
pee-pee<00:03:21.690> break<00:03:21.930> up<00:03:22.290> so<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.530> can<00:03:22.650> see<00:03:22.680> we<00:03:22.890> got<00:03:23.070> a

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
pee-pee break up so you can see we got a

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.060 
pee-pee break up so you can see we got a
very<00:03:23.340> big<00:03:23.580> space<00:03:23.850> mm-hmm<00:03:24.420> for<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.780> caliper<00:03:25.200> so

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
very big space mm-hmm for the caliper so

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.170 
very big space mm-hmm for the caliper so
I<00:03:26.100> know<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.310> guys<00:03:26.459> have<00:03:26.519> been<00:03:26.700> saying<00:03:27.000> on<00:03:27.090> the

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
I know you guys have been saying on the

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.720 
I know you guys have been saying on the
blog<00:03:27.360> we<00:03:27.510> need<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.720> go<00:03:27.810> for<00:03:27.989> a<00:03:28.019> bigger<00:03:28.260> rim<00:03:28.950> but

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
blog we need to go for a bigger rim but

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.759
