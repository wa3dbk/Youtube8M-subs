well no I just you know laughs I assumed
this<00:00:53.059> was<00:00:53.120> free<00:00:53.449> there's<00:00:54.260> no<00:00:54.440> elevator<00:00:54.710> well

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609 
this was free there's no elevator well

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.910 
this was free there's no elevator well
it's<00:00:55.789> so<00:00:55.969> nice<00:00:56.180> it<00:00:56.539> don't<00:00:56.780> you<00:00:56.930> are<00:00:57.050> oh<00:00:57.230> yes<00:00:57.739> of

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
but I think it's more for the tripping

down<00:01:00.579> okay<00:01:01.609> it<00:01:02.120> seems<00:01:02.480> to<00:01:02.690> that<00:01:02.840> the<00:01:03.019> door

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
down okay it seems to that the door

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.170 
down okay it seems to that the door
keeps<00:01:03.649> opening<00:01:04.160> and<00:01:04.339> closing<00:01:04.789> yeah<00:01:04.910> it's<00:01:05.059> an

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
keeps opening and closing yeah it's an

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.510
