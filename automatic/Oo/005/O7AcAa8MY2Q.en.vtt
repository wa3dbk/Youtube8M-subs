is<00:02:02.360> quite<00:02:02.600> long<00:02:02.780> already<00:02:03.110> so<00:02:04.040> let's<00:02:04.189> see<00:02:04.340> how

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
is quite long already so let's see how

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:23.380 
is quite long already so let's see how
we<00:02:04.460> get<00:02:04.670> on

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.090 

and<00:02:24.390> as<00:02:24.480> you<00:02:24.630> can<00:02:24.720> see<00:02:24.780> that<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.530> Theban<00:02:25.950> will

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
and as you can see that the Theban will

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.730 
and as you can see that the Theban will
easily<00:02:26.490> do<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.700> one-hole<00:02:27.300> group<00:02:27.660> at<00:02:27.960> 30<00:02:28.290> yards

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
easily do a one-hole group at 30 yards

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:31.910 
easily do a one-hole group at 30 yards
consistently<00:02:29.430> without<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.180> problem<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:31.530> if<00:02:31.800> I

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
consistently without a problem and if I

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.470 
consistently without a problem and if I
just<00:02:32.220> give<00:02:32.460> you<00:02:32.490> an<00:02:32.640> idea<00:02:32.940> of<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.210> size<00:02:33.450> that

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
just give you an idea of the size that

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.190 
just give you an idea of the size that
hole

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
hole

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.490 
hole
there's<00:02:34.980> my<00:02:35.220> thumbnail<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:37.140> covers<00:02:37.470> the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
there's my thumbnail and it covers the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.940 
there's my thumbnail and it covers the
hole<00:02:37.740> perfectly<00:02:38.450> so<00:02:39.450> about<00:02:40.260> the<00:02:40.350> size<00:02:40.560> of<00:02:40.710> a<00:02:40.770> 5

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
hole perfectly so about the size of a 5

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.370 
hole perfectly so about the size of a 5
pence<00:02:41.250> piece<00:02:41.520> at<00:02:41.730> 30<00:02:41.940> yards<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:44.400> that's<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:45.380> very

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
pence piece at 30 yards so that's a very

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.040 
pence piece at 30 yards so that's a very
accurate<00:02:46.620> rifle<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:48.270> I'd<00:02:48.330> recommend<00:02:48.570> it<00:02:48.960> to

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
accurate rifle and I'd recommend it to

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:56.790 
accurate rifle and I'd recommend it to
anybody

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:29.170 

okay<00:03:26.920> so<00:03:27.920> I've<00:03:28.010> decided<00:03:28.160> for<00:03:28.610> this<00:03:28.730> shot<00:03:29.030> that

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
okay so I've decided for this shot that

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.020 
okay so I've decided for this shot that
