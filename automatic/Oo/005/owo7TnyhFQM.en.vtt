been<00:02:57.840> asking<00:02:58.260> myself<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.830> lot<00:02:58.980> in<00:02:59.190> fact<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.520> was

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
been asking myself a lot in fact I was

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.640 
been asking myself a lot in fact I was
asking<00:03:00.120> myself<00:03:00.330> before<00:03:00.750> anyone<00:03:01.200> else<00:03:01.350> ever

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
asking myself before anyone else ever

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.140 
asking myself before anyone else ever
asked<00:03:02.040> me<00:03:02.160> so<00:03:02.310> it's<00:03:02.430> very<00:03:02.580> good<00:03:02.880> to<00:03:02.970> hear<00:03:03.120> that

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
asked me so it's very good to hear that

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.870 
asked me so it's very good to hear that
question<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:04.680> I<00:03:04.770> personally<00:03:05.340> think<00:03:05.520> dr.

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
question and I personally think dr.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.670 
question and I personally think dr.
Paul's<00:03:06.090> chances<00:03:06.570> are<00:03:06.720> winning<00:03:07.050> of<00:03:07.260> winning

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
Paul's chances are winning of winning

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.770 
Paul's chances are winning of winning
the<00:03:07.770> presidency<00:03:08.190> itself<00:03:08.670> or<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:08.970> reasonable<00:03:09.540> of

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
the presidency itself or a reasonable of

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.220 
the presidency itself or a reasonable of
roughly<00:03:10.080> 1<00:03:10.320> in<00:03:10.470> 10<00:03:10.739> but<00:03:11.520> that<00:03:12.060> leaves<00:03:12.690> up<00:03:12.989> the

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
roughly 1 in 10 but that leaves up the

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.170 
roughly 1 in 10 but that leaves up the
definite<00:03:13.890> possibility<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.489> he<00:03:14.580> could<00:03:14.820> lose

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
definite possibility that he could lose

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.729 
definite possibility that he could lose
so<00:03:15.510> we<00:03:15.630> need<00:03:15.750> to<00:03:15.840> be<00:03:15.930> thinking<00:03:16.110> about<00:03:16.410> that

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
so we need to be thinking about that

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.009 
so we need to be thinking about that
even<00:03:17.040> as<00:03:17.130> we<00:03:17.280> focus<00:03:17.489> on<00:03:17.820> helping<00:03:18.360> him<00:03:18.600> win<00:03:18.840> or

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
even as we focus on helping him win or

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.650 
even as we focus on helping him win or
do<00:03:19.110> as<00:03:19.230> well<00:03:19.380> as<00:03:19.500> possible<00:03:20.360> my<00:03:21.360> plan

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
do as well as possible my plan

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.960 
do as well as possible my plan
personally<00:03:22.560> is<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.799> try<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.220> do<00:03:23.459> something

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
personally is to try and do something

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.870 
personally is to try and do something
