00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
fence but if you're going to use a

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.670 
fence but if you're going to use a
binding<00:01:21.240> Rose<00:01:21.570> do<00:01:21.780> make<00:01:21.960> sure<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.500> take

binding Rose do make sure that you take

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.800 
binding Rose do make sure that you take
the<00:01:22.740> time<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.159> as<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:24.030> vines<00:01:24.240> start<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.659> grow

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
the time that as the vines start to grow

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.230 
the time that as the vines start to grow
out<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.350> do<00:01:25.590> weave<00:01:25.860> them<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.000> out<00:01:27.060> of

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
out that you do weave them in and out of

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.789 
out that you do weave them in and out of
the<00:01:27.299> fence<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.720> they<00:01:27.930> don't<00:01:28.140> drag<00:01:28.380> on<00:01:28.650> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
the fence so that they don't drag on the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.730 
the fence so that they don't drag on the
ground<00:01:29.360> also<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:30.600> roses<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.290> do<00:01:31.470> want<00:01:31.680> to

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
ground also for roses you do want to

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.069 
ground also for roses you do want to
make<00:01:31.890> sure<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:34.759> that<00:01:35.759> they're

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
make sure that you have a that they're

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.330 
make sure that you have a that they're
slightly<00:01:37.079> lower<00:01:37.290> than<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.590> ground<00:01:37.829> level<00:01:38.189> so

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
slightly lower than the ground level so

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.539 
slightly lower than the ground level so
that<00:01:38.520> way<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.700> can<00:01:38.970> soak<00:01:39.299> them<00:01:39.540> really<00:01:39.869> well

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
that way you can soak them really well

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.270 
that way you can soak them really well
roses<00:01:41.579> once<00:01:42.390> they're<00:01:42.630> established<00:01:43.280> like

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
roses once they're established like

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.039 
roses once they're established like
don't<00:01:44.729> need<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> ton<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.270> water<00:01:45.540> but<00:01:45.810> when<00:01:45.930> they

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
don't need a ton of water but when they

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.139 
don't need a ton of water but when they
do<00:01:46.110> are<00:01:46.710> watered<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.340> want<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.670> water<00:01:47.880> them

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
do are watered you want to water them

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.630 
do are watered you want to water them
and<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.570> get<00:01:48.720> them<00:01:48.930> soaked<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.740> then<00:01:50.399> let

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
and really get them soaked and then let

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.270 
and really get them soaked and then let
them<00:01:50.820> be<00:01:51.200> roses<00:01:52.200> can<00:01:52.470> actually<00:01:52.920> deal<00:01:53.250> with

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
them be roses can actually deal with

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.780 
them be roses can actually deal with
humidity<00:01:54.210> as<00:01:54.630> well<00:01:54.869> as<00:01:55.049> some<00:01:55.290> drought<00:01:55.729> as<00:01:56.729> well
