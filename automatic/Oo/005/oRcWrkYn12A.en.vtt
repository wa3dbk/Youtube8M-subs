experienced any problems but this is
almost<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.530> beta<00:02:49.890> jailbreak<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.660> know<00:02:51.750> it

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
almost the beta jailbreak so you know it

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.300 
almost the beta jailbreak so you know it
is<00:02:51.989> stable<00:02:52.560> I<00:02:52.590> have<00:02:52.680> been<00:02:52.799> using<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.130> for<00:02:53.160> a

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
is stable I have been using it for a

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.309 
is stable I have been using it for a
little<00:02:53.430> while<00:02:53.519> but<00:02:53.940> backup<00:02:54.750> everything<00:02:55.110> just

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
little while but backup everything just

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:56.960 
little while but backup everything just
in<00:02:55.650> case<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:56.100> never<00:02:56.280> know<00:02:56.519> what<00:02:56.670> could<00:02:56.760> happen

in case you never know what could happen
but<00:02:57.840> generally<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.380> is<00:02:58.440> pretty<00:02:58.709> safe<00:02:59.040> anyways

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700
