00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
over 75 into KLR I believe 80 is about

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.179 
over 75 into KLR I believe 80 is about
5700<00:05:05.070> rpm

00:05:09.179 --> 00:05:09.189 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:16.760 

we'll<00:05:09.610> take<00:05:09.819> it<00:05:09.969> to<00:05:09.999> a<00:05:10.089> tee

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.260 

now<00:05:17.310> 80<00:05:17.669> is<00:05:17.879> 56<00:05:18.509> and<00:05:18.690> 57<00:05:18.900> on<00:05:19.289> our<00:05:19.440> campus<00:05:19.889> not

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
now 80 is 56 and 57 on our campus not

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.180 
now 80 is 56 and 57 on our campus not
once<00:05:21.270> you<00:05:21.360> get<00:05:21.509> past<00:05:21.780> 75<00:05:22.229> it's<00:05:22.680> not<00:05:22.860> really

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
once you get past 75 it's not really

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.580 
once you get past 75 it's not really
comfortable<00:05:23.460> on<00:05:23.819> the<00:05:23.940> KLR<00:05:24.449> again<00:05:25.199> the

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
comfortable on the KLR again the

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.129 
comfortable on the KLR again the
windscreen<00:05:25.949> would<00:05:26.250> help<00:05:26.460> a<00:05:26.580> lot

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:30.139 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:32.649 

so<00:05:30.650> there<00:05:30.860> you<00:05:30.889> have<00:05:31.159> it<00:05:31.580> a<00:05:31.610> little<00:05:32.240> review<00:05:32.599> on

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:32.659 
so there you have it a little review on

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:34.330 
so there you have it a little review on
rpms<00:05:33.319> at<00:05:33.470> highway<00:05:33.680> speeds

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
rpms at highway speeds

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.060 
rpms at highway speeds
alright<00:05:34.610> later<00:05:34.789> guys
