00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.069 
terms of their values so certainly the
more<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.119> capture<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.869> top

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
more that you can do to capture the top

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.230 
more that you can do to capture the top
end<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.680> can<00:01:59.280> be<00:01:59.430> very<00:01:59.640> rewarding<00:01:59.850> for

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
end of that can be very rewarding for

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.730 
end of that can be very rewarding for
the<00:02:00.329> time<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:00.869> effort<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.229> takes<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.619> make

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
the time and effort it takes to make

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.940 
the time and effort it takes to make
those<00:02:02.070> decisions<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:03.469> you<00:02:04.469> know<00:02:04.530> many<00:02:04.740> of<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
those decisions so you know many of the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.399 
those decisions so you know many of the
pens<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:06.180> cattle<00:02:06.600> just<00:02:06.780> on<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.200> average

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
pens that of cattle just on the average

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.919 
pens that of cattle just on the average
show<00:02:07.979> that<00:02:08.489> we<00:02:08.580> go<00:02:08.729> into<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> grid<00:02:09.270> with<00:02:09.300> we<00:02:09.750> hope

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
show that we go into a grid with we hope

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.470 
show that we go into a grid with we hope
to<00:02:10.110> bring<00:02:10.319> o<00:02:10.730> somewhere<00:02:11.730> in<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.879> fifteen<00:02:12.330> to

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
to bring o somewhere in the fifteen to

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.930 
to bring o somewhere in the fifteen to
thirty<00:02:12.510> dollar<00:02:12.989> per<00:02:13.260> head<00:02:13.440> range

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
thirty dollar per head range

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.510 
thirty dollar per head range
return<00:02:14.870> on<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.260> on<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.650> pen<00:02:15.860> average<00:02:16.280> and

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
return on the on the pen average and

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.220 
return on the on the pen average and
certainly<00:02:16.820> then<00:02:17.030> those<00:02:17.360> individuals<00:02:18.080> in

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
certainly then those individuals in

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.520 
certainly then those individuals in
there<00:02:18.670> can<00:02:19.670> be<00:02:19.700> up<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:20.210> 150<00:02:20.870> or<00:02:20.960> 200<00:02:21.350> dollar

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
there can be up to the 150 or 200 dollar

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.670 
there can be up to the 150 or 200 dollar
a<00:02:21.650> head<00:02:21.740> difference<00:02:22.670> in<00:02:22.820> value<00:02:23.210> so<00:02:23.930> there's

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
a head difference in value so there's

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.920 
a head difference in value so there's
some<00:02:24.980> some<00:02:25.370> great<00:02:25.520> incentive<00:02:26.030> there<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.450> work

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
some some great incentive there to work

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.010 
some some great incentive there to work
on<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.110> sorting<00:02:27.560> program
