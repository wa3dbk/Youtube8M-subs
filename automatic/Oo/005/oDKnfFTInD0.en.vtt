 hello everyone with you andrew andreich my 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:08.910
 site all point dot ru 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:14.240
 1220 first task speed of the ship 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.920
 the course of the river is 37.6 kilometers per hour 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.760
 find your own speed of the ship and 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:26.300
 its speed against the flow of the river if 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.460
 speed of the river 3.9 kilometers per hour 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.759
 let's start by finding 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:37.910
 own speed of the ship speed 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.910
 ship along the river is equal to 37.6 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.420
 37.6 kilometers an hour is speed by 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.440
 downstream 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.309
 speed along the river 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:54.840
 this is the amount of speed 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.660
 own ship and the river flow 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.949
 that is, the speed downstream this 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.050
 sum of speeds 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.719
 own speed of the ship and 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.119
 speed and current of the river 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:11.369
 so if we are from the flow rate by 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:16.200
 river we will deduct the speed by the river itself 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:19.920
 there 39 kilometers per hour we will find 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.380
 own speed of the ship that is 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.640
 if we subtract from the flow rate 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:30.329
 rivers the speed of the river itself we get 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:38.270
 own speed of the ship you read 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:41.340
 will be in column 37, and 6 minus 3, 9 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:46.579
 the most important thing is to make sure that 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:53.880
 always stood comma so subtract 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:58.380
 out of 6 9 we cannot occupy out of 16 9 this is 7, 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:04.969
 comma of seven occupied it 6 6 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.969
 minus 3 is three building demolish 33.7 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:14.500
 thirty three point, 70 kilometers per hour 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.920
 we found it 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.819
 own speed of the ship and us 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.410
 asked to find the speed against the current 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.970
 rivers 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:32.019
 to find it was the first action 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:34.849
 to find 2 action to find 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:40.790
 speed against the river 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:43.510
 you need to subtract from your speed 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.370
 river speed 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.129
 we already know our own speed now 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.470
 to find the speed against the current of the river 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:53.950
 subtract from our speed 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:01.250
 the speed of the river itself 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:03.489
 but again to count 33, 7 minus 3 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.840
 , 9 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.840
 occupy from 17 and 9 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:15.920
 it's eight of the threesomes left 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:18.889
 deuce of deuce deduct three can not 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.829
 take out of 12 3 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:24.260
 it is 9 , a comma is necessary 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:25.930
 must be from the troika occupied remains 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:38.900
 two 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:40.000
 29, and 829, and 8 kilometers per hour so well 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:45.489
 that's all 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:50.380
 the answer to this problem is its own speed 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:58.180
 33.7 km per hour current speed against 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:58.180
 speed of the vessel against the current 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.669
 29.8 kilometers on this all 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.030
 My name is Andrew Andreevich My site
