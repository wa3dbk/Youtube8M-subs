here we're showing our new crank bait
rods<00:00:21.720> as<00:00:22.020> well<00:00:22.320> as<00:00:22.500> flipping<00:00:22.740> stick<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.190> you'll

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
rods as well as flipping stick so you'll

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.590 
rods as well as flipping stick so you'll
see<00:00:23.520> the<00:00:23.610> crank<00:00:23.820> bait<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.119> flippin<00:00:24.420> stick

rod<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.149> our<00:01:27.359> crankbait<00:01:27.750> series<00:01:28.079> so

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
rod this is our crankbait series so

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.200 
rod this is our crankbait series so
obviously<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.520> know<00:01:29.640> it's<00:01:29.789> got<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.969> more

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
obviously you know it's got a more

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.410 
obviously you know it's got a more
limber<00:01:31.130> moderate<00:01:32.130> type<00:01:32.369> action<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.270> it

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
limber moderate type action to it it

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.200 
limber moderate type action to it it
doesn't<00:01:33.630> have<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.049> fast<00:01:34.380> stiff<00:01:35.159> tapers<00:01:35.729> that

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
doesn't have the fast stiff tapers that

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.870 
doesn't have the fast stiff tapers that
you<00:01:36.299> want<00:01:36.539> for<00:01:36.840> kraang<00:01:37.350> clearer<00:01:37.590> for<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.009> know

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
you want for kraang clearer for you know

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.880 
you want for kraang clearer for you know
your<00:01:39.090> worms<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.570> your<00:01:39.719> jigs<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.320> things<00:01:40.770> like

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
your worms and your jigs and things like

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.770 
your worms and your jigs and things like
that<00:01:43.130> another<00:01:44.130> cool<00:01:44.399> little<00:01:45.149> feature<00:01:45.240> that

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
that another cool little feature that

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.989 
that another cool little feature that
we've<00:01:45.899> got<00:01:46.079> on<00:01:46.229> these<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.619> actually<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.700> power

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:47.999 
we've got on these is actually the power

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:49.609 
we've got on these is actually the power
bands<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.689> you'll<00:01:48.869> see<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.200> difference<00:01:49.229> here

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
bands so you'll see the difference here

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.669 
bands so you'll see the difference here
so<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.609> has<00:01:50.789> got<00:01:50.969> one<00:01:51.179> big<00:01:51.600> big<00:01:52.170> fat<00:01:52.409> power

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
so this has got one big big fat power

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.399 
so this has got one big big fat power
band<00:01:52.979> which<00:01:53.159> means<00:01:53.399> five<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.719> guy<00:01:54.929> here

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
band which means five so this guy here

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.039 
band which means five so this guy here
has<00:01:55.560> got<00:01:55.950> three<00:01:56.280> little<00:01:56.640> power<00:01:56.999> bands<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.840> we

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
has got three little power bands so we

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.569 
has got three little power bands so we
