defends fantastically well although that

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.789 
defends fantastically well although that
was<00:01:24.270> probably<00:01:24.600> not<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.840> best<00:01:25.229> time<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.680> say

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
was probably not the best time to say

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.859 
was probably not the best time to say
that<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:26.189> but<00:01:26.850> i<00:01:27.270> don't<00:01:27.420> know<00:01:27.509> what<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.750> i

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
that but but i don't know what it is i

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.350 
that but but i don't know what it is i
can<00:01:28.259> attack<00:01:28.560> really<00:01:28.950> well<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:30.090> they<00:01:30.240> don't

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
can attack really well and they don't

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.780 
can attack really well and they don't
score<00:01:30.630> too<00:01:30.900> many<00:01:31.079> goals<00:01:31.290> against<00:01:31.619> me<00:01:31.799> but<00:01:32.430> i

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
score too many goals against me but i

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.719 
score too many goals against me but i
just<00:01:33.540> find<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.840> difficult<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.320> score<00:01:34.729> more

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
just find it difficult to score more

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.219 
just find it difficult to score more
than<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:36.000> couple<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.360> goals<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.780> game<00:01:36.810> as<00:01:37.140> you

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
than a couple of goals in a game as you

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.660 
than a couple of goals in a game as you
have<00:01:37.320> probably<00:01:37.500> seen<00:01:37.799> for<00:01:38.009> me<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.310> we've<00:01:38.490> not

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
have probably seen for me that we've not

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.109 
have probably seen for me that we've not
had<00:01:38.850> really<00:01:39.450> any<00:01:40.110> 5-nil<00:01:40.890> thumpings<00:01:41.790> anything

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
had really any 5-nil thumpings anything

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.760 
had really any 5-nil thumpings anything
like<00:01:42.240> that<00:01:42.270> but<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.170> pretty<00:01:43.320> much<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.560> game

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
like that but this is pretty much a game

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.940 
like that but this is pretty much a game
of<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:44.100> constant<00:01:44.610> chances<00:01:45.090> constant<00:01:45.509> shots

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
of just constant chances constant shots

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.410 
of just constant chances constant shots
you<00:01:46.950> know<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.220> good<00:01:47.520> good<00:01:47.909> amount<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.119> blocks

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
you know a good good amount of blocks

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.760 
you know a good good amount of blocks
and<00:01:48.600> this<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.780> why<00:01:48.869> i<00:01:48.899> don't<00:01:48.960> really<00:01:49.290> do<00:01:49.470> skill

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
and this is why i don't really do skill

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.230 
and this is why i don't really do skill
round<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.070> know<00:01:50.100> did<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.850> roulette<00:01:51.119> but

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.420 
round you know did the roulette but
didn't<00:01:51.450> really<00:01:51.509> get<00:01:51.780> anywhere<00:01:52.079> with<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.250> i

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
didn't really get anywhere with it and i

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.859 
didn't really get anywhere with it and i
need<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.729> learn<00:01:53.909> a<00:01:53.970> little<00:01:54.210> bit<00:01:54.329> more<00:01:54.600> about

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
very very tough defense to break down

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.640 
very very tough defense to break down
they<00:02:42.120> should<00:02:42.420> have<00:02:42.540> at<00:02:42.660> least<00:02:42.690> hit<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.290> target

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
they should have at least hit the target

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.410 
they should have at least hit the target
without<00:02:43.830> headed<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.220> be<00:02:44.280> honest<00:02:44.520> being<00:02:45.270> that
