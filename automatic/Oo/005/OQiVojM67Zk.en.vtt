this<00:00:29.240> I'll<00:00:30.240> come<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.599> them<00:00:31.369> so<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.460> chassis<00:00:32.820> is

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
this I'll come to them so the chassis is

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.000 
this I'll come to them so the chassis is
all<00:00:33.120> home-brewed<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.020> that's<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.320> full

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
steering dolly at the front so it's very

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.869

maneuverable<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.739> can<00:00:37.860> move<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.160> about<00:00:38.399> and

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
maneuverable you can move it about and

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.729 
maneuverable you can move it about and
no<00:00:39.300> problem<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:39.989> we'll<00:00:40.050> move<00:00:40.200> it<00:00:40.350> from<00:00:40.469> site<00:00:40.710> to

no problem so we'll move it from site to
site<00:00:40.920> obviously<00:00:41.610> can't<00:00:42.059> road<00:00:42.270> tour<00:00:42.570> this<00:00:42.750> one

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960
