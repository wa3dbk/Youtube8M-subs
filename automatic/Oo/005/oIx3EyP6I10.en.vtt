one right this is what it looks like

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.770 
one right this is what it looks like
when<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.710> comes<00:00:58.800> straight<00:00:59.040> out<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> box<00:00:59.430> I<00:01:00.390> was

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
when it comes straight out the box I was

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.420 
when it comes straight out the box I was
really<00:01:01.140> surprised<00:01:01.500> about<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.920> size<00:01:02.130> of<00:01:02.309> this

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.920 
really surprised about the size of this
the<00:01:03.030> weight<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.540> probably<00:01:03.780> back

the weight this is probably back

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.280 
the weight this is probably back
kilogram<00:01:04.519> I<00:01:05.519> guess<00:01:05.969> it<00:01:06.210> as<00:01:06.509> all<00:01:06.750> snow<00:01:07.049> pack

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290

that's<00:03:33.199> made<00:03:33.410> out<00:03:33.440> of<00:03:33.560> a<00:03:33.709> 70<00:03:34.040> D<00:03:34.250> or<00:03:34.519> a<00:03:34.579> 210<00:03:35.389> T

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
that's made out of a 70 D or a 210 T

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.930 
that's made out of a 70 D or a 210 T
nylon<00:03:36.079> which<00:03:36.290> is<00:03:36.440> waterproof<00:03:36.799> I<00:03:37.280> haven't<00:03:37.849> had

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
nylon which is waterproof I haven't had

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:41.229 
nylon which is waterproof I haven't had
a<00:03:37.970> chance<00:03:38.030> to<00:03:38.299> test<00:03:38.599> it<00:03:38.780> so<00:03:39.139> hopefully<00:03:40.239> over

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
a chance to test it so hopefully over

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.520 
a chance to test it so hopefully over
the<00:03:41.269> next<00:03:41.389> couple<00:03:41.780> of<00:03:41.930> weeks<00:03:41.989> I'm<00:03:42.349> going<00:03:42.470> to

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
the next couple of weeks I'm going to

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.319 
the next couple of weeks I'm going to
get<00:03:42.650> our<00:03:42.769> in<00:03:42.919> the<00:03:43.010> field<00:03:43.280> in<00:03:43.579> that<00:03:43.819> see<00:03:44.150> how<00:03:44.269> she

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
get our in the field in that see how she

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.629 
get our in the field in that see how she
goes<00:03:44.690> and<00:03:45.019> absolutely<00:03:45.379> all<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.590> main<00:03:45.859> top

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
goes and absolutely all the main top

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.879 
goes and absolutely all the main top
after<00:03:46.819> this<00:03:47.150> is<00:03:47.359> made<00:03:47.660> out<00:03:47.780> of<00:03:47.810> a<00:03:47.959> 50<00:03:48.319> D<00:03:48.560> or<00:03:48.829> I

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
after this is made out of a 50 D or I

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.599 
after this is made out of a 50 D or I
think<00:03:49.669> it's<00:03:49.910> a<00:03:49.970> to<00:03:50.180> 90<00:03:50.629> nylon<00:03:51.049> waterproof<00:03:51.739> so

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
think it's a to 90 nylon waterproof so

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.420 
think it's a to 90 nylon waterproof so
and<00:03:52.910> it's<00:03:53.449> breathable<00:03:53.840> so<00:03:54.230> long<00:03:54.650> as<00:03:54.799> long<00:03:55.340> as

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
and it's breathable so long as long as

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.420 
and it's breathable so long as long as
it's<00:03:55.549> breathable<00:03:55.910> I'm<00:03:56.269> okay<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:58.220> actual

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
it's breathable I'm okay the actual

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.640 
it's breathable I'm okay the actual
material<00:03:58.699> itself<00:03:58.940> is<00:03:59.090> made<00:03:59.810> out<00:03:59.840> of<00:04:00.019> a<00:04:00.290> rip

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650
