but for now let's just start with a
basic<00:00:54.540> dozer<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.320> let's<00:00:56.040> break<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.460> down

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
basic dozer and let's break this down

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.740

on the dozer blade so that we can get
blade<00:03:00.730> elevation<00:03:01.730> that<00:03:02.420> way<00:03:02.600> if<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.870> dozer<00:03:03.080> is

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
static position of the tracks we can get

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
top of the mast so now I've got my blade

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.260

elevation but in addition to that now I

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.910 
elevation but in addition to that now I
can<00:04:06.750> monitor<00:04:07.260> cross<00:04:07.770> slope<00:04:08.360> because<00:04:09.560> there<00:04:10.560> is

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
can monitor cross slope because there is

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.980 
can monitor cross slope because there is
