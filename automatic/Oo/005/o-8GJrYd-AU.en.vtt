00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.330
 it was a concern to him boy 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.299
 People who also have diabetes are tips 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.220
 to give first hand the answers 

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:57.589
 matthias steiner you read in holding 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.549
 forum for our raffle one wrote 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:02.150
 another autograph 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:03.769
 then our interview started she was 18 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.729
 when diagnosed with diabetes 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.460
 has been 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.830
 remember the moment and 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.979
 what is going through your head 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.770
 yes of course so first of all know 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.840
 I was athlete and has become so 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.509
 the direction of competitive sports has moved and has 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.130
 a special body feeling and me 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.509
 already knew about the summer it is true 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.999
 Something no longer but I knew 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.070
 not what, because of course I do the same 

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:31.310
 Little was clear about diabetes as 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.990
 was most others is diagnosis came 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.719
 That's a real shock because I do not 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.579
 enlightened or because you do not know it 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:40.310
 because there is no role to play in live 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.619
 is there beet that sounds tragic 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.689
 I do not know what it is and it was then 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.359
 quite violent then prayed 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.310
 your life is already changing 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.630
 In principle, therefore, first you have 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.069
 These are one of my worries 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.409
 carefree life 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:55.579
 You choose a performance oriented man 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.710
 his goal of his wishes 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.819
 where you have to say someone has the 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.149
 just did not move 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:03.770
 this wish in the first moment yes or 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.469
 no, first, my dreams burst 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.929
 somehow you sit in it the father times 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:12.730
 shocked tears flow because it is 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.960
 another human and 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.250
 they have actually the 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.590
 do not wish to change but 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.350
 somewhere on the contrary now all the more 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.540
 challenge to achieve something 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.560
 it is a special to the people that too 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.440
 prove as it was then actually 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.240
 quite a good drive and man 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.010
 then she really learns to join me 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.140
 his 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.580
 three young people are on more falls 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.380
 they just wanted to be shocked because 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.910
 you prefer to have the diagnosis similar 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:43.250
 in those days what do you advise young people 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.520
 If you get the diagnosis first 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.990
 Now first know how stable is that 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.850
 man exists a life thats what 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.480
 are something to deal with 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:54.830
 athlete has always generally 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.930
 much easier because he already 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.820
 to have the usual discipline to watch 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.220
 what am I eating how much how much i sleep like 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.020
 I move that is easier if 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.040
 you have less courage so you have to 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.870
 just explain 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.300
 a certain amount of basic discipline is required 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.860
 just laid what I what 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.650
 I guess the people I'll start first 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.560
 so describe and describe it as the healthy 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:18.800
 human worth automatic car and the councils 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.590
 kamps with sonicated that is in 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.150
 end effect the only difference is that it 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.470
 here of course if you look at the 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.180
 manufacturer not properly operated or 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.060
 if you always enter without coupling 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.710
 sometime the gear breaks that 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.130
 You always have to be very careful 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.660
 hold 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.210
 that is actually it then that 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.470
 So this difference I have to because 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.960
 accept diabetes 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.970
 as it could have to submit very very 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.180
 important family the whole family 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.800
 is all friends friends 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.750
 employers direct supervisors and such 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.680
 It is always advantageous if the 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.840
 people know 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.850
 if now a teenager the new 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.820
 has been diagnosed 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.770
 before that has his classmates 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.450
 stupid remark or something like that 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.790
 maybe even north 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.590
 angela philipps could go like that 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.170
 he works best with it to texture the environment 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.240
 saying comes is the key 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.120
 really not to hide myself 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:14.230
 know the topic by many attribution 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.230
 that there are mobile 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.850
 it is always dependent on the 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.959
 School class from school as we are 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.709
 the circle of friends that of course plays 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.750
 a role 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.310
 and maybe not from the beginning 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.860
 heard anything back to comic 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.900
 that children be honest all can 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.600
 should i become a problem if you 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.639
 when mobile opens 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.240
 you had to do that as much as possible against it 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:38.850
 go and handle it openly 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.010
 explain and how my opinion is also 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.050
 always next to it as well as someone like that 

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:45.180
 It is really cheeky to say that one 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.700
 sugar maybe also sugar and so on 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:51.210
 so far try the wind out of the sails 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.500
 to take because of course you can like 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.880
 said you have to change after the 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.169
 white diabetics as well as that 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.490
 works then can ever 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.750
 show what I am at the right moment 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.110
 at all to pixel the finger because then 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.430
 some become true and there can be 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.990
 you have to make it a bit and no 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.190
 if that makes it then maybe 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.660
 colleagues have yet to explain what 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.460
 Actually, what is it? 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.940
 means you less to say I can 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:13.530
 do everything exactly as you and me are 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.820
 actually something special because me 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.940
 has to spend much more effort 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.960
 I have to focus more on myself 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.280
 need more discipline 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.479
 that means I really need more 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:25.410
 have the same things to do 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:27.090
 you're the one now when you 're girl or 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.550
 Meet guys and somehow 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.500
 maybe a first date has why 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.450
 should you put it out with that 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.940
 one for example diabetes've so 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.770
 I had that luck is only 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:38.940
 to get that at 18 is like that 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:42.630
 some time back I had ever 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:44.370
 behind me but can understand all the more 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.720
 if if girl or boys the 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.979
 puberty comes that to problems 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.479
 Of course you will have to 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.640
 Accredit the hormones are changing 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:52.520
 Sometimes things happen in the body 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:56.430
 can not believe 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.410
 and it is not so at matisse 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:59.640
 and you at the dredging girl and said 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.039
 I am the speech going 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.669
 what are you or they go swiftly and 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.570
 You do not do that, I think so 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:07.169
 you can go completely normal 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:08.940
 to let 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:10.680
 i have the diabetic i care that 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.300
 not yet in the first moment 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.909
 remembers because it is measured 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.020
 The loo or else can leave kandhamal 

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:19.159
 So I know that 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.389
 cover up one two three dates 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:24.060
 but only to pretend men 

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:25.020
 really what becomes serious then 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.379
 You should be as fast as possible 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:29.970
 exercise with it so if if guys 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:31.259
 army that you want to have fun then 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:35.400
 i do not think that matters too 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:36.599
 Play the fun should be shown it 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:41.129
 is very important if you are so 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:42.449
 go far but if it's something serious 

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:44.460
 if you realize this could be yours 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:45.810
 relationships are then just do 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:48.150
 no fifth wait, but already 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.949
 in the second one kick say you need you 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.169
 what do politicians say and then too 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:54.120
 no explain what the difference 

00:06:52.169 --> 00:06:54.960
 makes a healthy person that the 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.840
 not so big is the difference 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.009
 that you can do everything normally 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.840
 but maybe just pilot or 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:02.009
 some extreme job because the other one 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.710
 Others may opt for a carrot 

00:07:02.009 --> 00:07:05.849
 walking through the mountains 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:08.780
 diving are all possible 

00:07:05.849 --> 00:07:08.780
 but almost everything possible
