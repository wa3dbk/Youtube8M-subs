00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:13.849
 welcome josé cd player and videos from 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.849
 all following place in hd 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:26.070
 do not wait for the jsb clerk to speak 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.199
 guys that hotels over a video to 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.660
 You're bringing a species in new 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.940
 channel it's a fps released in 2014 so 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.219
 it is in alpha is not yet complete 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.320
 and slowness game still has neither beto fire 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.390
 yet come Tone it does not have everything 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.980
 he should have but left that elite flame 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.070
 force it was developed and published 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.320
 there in the United States by the new order is 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.789
 a game company 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.710
 She's a small company but she 's 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.360
 investing in this game in two others in 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.370
 there is also in it that I have not yet downloaded 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.539
 to test but anyway this game is 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.039
 different from others because it is 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.489
 free and it has a gameplay 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.590
 similar to the call of duty of mw2 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.570
 systems is still in beta so still 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.460
 has some flaws and some bugs 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.810
 but in the future I think it 's new where 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.670
 will improve it 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.439
 it has a weapons mount system that 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.049
 you can upgrade the art you 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.570
 buy an ak-47 you can put a 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.170
 laser sight can put a support 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.930
 the extra ammunition can leave it chrome 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.799
 personalized with camouflage kite 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.420
 etc 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.490
 the other problem of the game here he has 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.650
 very few very few players 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.640
 we play because the game has alpha and it is 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.619
 tiny 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.610
 it has a great optimization for pcs 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.869
 for those who do not know that optimization 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.159
 click here 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.200
 if you put his charts on the 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.570
 the graph actually stays on the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.880
 you put the charts at maximum 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.890
 with very nice graphic at least to 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.110
 I look beautiful in the video case you 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.509
 They are watching a gameplay I recorded is é 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.479
 arrange chrome already customized 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.340
 Bother is not personalized and a game 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.740
 very cool although we still have banks 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.030
 in gameplay but it has alpha then 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.600
 There's not much to complain about. 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.829
 not to mention that the game was free then 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.259
 I can not keep complaining about this 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.200
 because the quality of the game will have 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.970
 by the trailer of the game that took place in 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.039
 decision for you to see the trailer 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.900
 the new wave will put a system 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.210
 You'll be able to ride robots. 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.500
 you 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.820
 able to play with robots with favors and 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.900
 kill a certain amount of player 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.910
 followed 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.500
 you will accumulate type have a game 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.450
 similar end in itself scheme 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.820
 they also have an android mode 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.840
 android module if talking is cyborg mode is 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.830
 more or less this 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.210
 this way of you one of the room's players 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.670
 enemy or the function of your team 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.770
 they saw cyborg he tries to destroy you né 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.990
 And you have to run away more or less. 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.770
 module me game also has a module 1 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.540
 bi 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.100
 besides module b it has a mode that 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.690
 they will still release what is the mode of 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.170
 build robots that say then make a 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.570
 set but it appeared in the trailer and also has 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.190
 an end to the missions of the game has the 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.230
 missions and the missions you play in 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.450
 missions in the issue of entering the 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.070
 two more guys from the team in the 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.620
 It 's your mission to have to play. 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.090
 same type enter the stage more than 300 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.740
 robots more or less this 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.620
 the missions are very cool and you can give it to yourself 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.210
 earn a good money game no no 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.520
 charges many weapons because the weapons 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.500
 game patterns are already very good then 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.910
 You do not have to spend cash at least 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.230
 for now in alpha I think it's 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.760
 always has alpha 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.950
 luckily I think when the game 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.120
 It is complete and then by poet 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.920
 complete 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.470
 they will put some of the most 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.690
 of the standard weapons in alpha tone very fuck 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.310
 They got cut for the fuck I'm playing. 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.830
 I'm practically just here for now. 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.450
 I have not really played in the 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.340
 very few players 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.010
 People know already have some br playing. 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.990
 so there are no hackers for now 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.580
 I think you 'll get yes because the new 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.920
 today it's a small company and they still 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.780
 do not have to hack everything but they 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.010
 to take that little 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.410
 even had difficulty recording 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.450
 because I was trying to record with freight and 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.700
 It turned out that they detected franc as 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.620
 hardware but I discovered it was just me 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.540
 record when you have already started 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.280
 show you a little of inventing and 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.150
 At the beginning of the video I talked a little 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.950
 game 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.600
 Let's give a new strength where guys 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.310
 released the video of their social networks 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.990
 beauty the galera with it begins to 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.210
 know this game and and have more prey 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.700
 for now it only has 20 player playing 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.140
 very few people are counting on me and 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.480
 you can create a good room 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.060
 gameplay is half copied from the 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.200
 other games but he uses 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.940
 pretty thanks right? 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.460
 the country to spend at least one 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.900
 graphic up acceptable is pro my pc clear 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.370
 now when I put a maximum of 1 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.560
 leg more 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.820
 the pretty graphics in my opinion 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.620
 Anyway, this man I told you to 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.180
 You guys I was going to bring but I was not going to 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.639
 bring beauty now and behind him in 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.139
 the end of this series, decided to bring 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.570
 I do not want to play 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.070
 I play with a lot of players at last 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.370
 hard to get used to 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.540
 I will not lie, the game is only a few months old. 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.550
 so I ask that you really 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.710
 disclose this video not for myself is 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.880
 more by the company to give a strength to 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.580
 it seems to continue the development 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.410
 of the game and that it is complete and with all 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.060
 the options and I want to see the robot mode 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.710
 how is it going to be 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.139
 I want to see what they will bring. 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.000
 I already played today, I found a lot 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.720
 fuck this scheme to customize the 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.120
 weapons 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.199
 you earn gp right money to buy 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.580
 new weapons 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.320
 playing well by doing so 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.169
 missions are different from those of the 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.460
 other games and psd are cool to stay 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.590
 and if I come and I hope you have 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.090
 I like beauty and I 'm a little 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:21.160
 understand that it is a little 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.590
 different but I did not record a video 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:25.120
 anyway it was even inside the channel 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.789
 sportv have also approved the new 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.860
 so it was really cool and it was until 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:32.080
 played well and gameplay of political background 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:34.510
 19 minutes but I cut everything there. 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.580
 very new to you, at last, and 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.229
 I played the game is small 1 gig because 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.360
 he has something even more for what I 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:42.010
 I got to know I'm going to go four 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.050
 gigas but finally I hope they 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:45.820
 continue participation of four gigs 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.770
 but the game does not get heavy while on 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.690
 al-Fatah in good faith can read very well 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.889
 thought to release the video if you 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:51.669
 I like it because I did not like it and sign up 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:53.590
 in the channel 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:54.789
 see the lawyer's videos let's see 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.979
 detonated in gameplay 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:58.780
 so this is it , thank you video destination and 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:01.979
 until the next video to be with God that 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.979
 There he spoke and went 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.150
 honey 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:25.710
 in london google
