00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
because I'm recording and it's just

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.559 
because I'm recording and it's just
taking<00:02:08.280> it<00:02:08.340> more<00:02:08.459> processing<00:02:09.090> power

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
taking it more processing power

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:17.270 
taking it more processing power
I<00:02:12.920> did<00:02:13.920> notice<00:02:14.160> with<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.940> mod<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.480> um<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:17.040> makes

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.030 
the game a tiny bit more laggy but it's
it's<00:02:20.730> not<00:02:20.910> really<00:02:20.970> that<00:02:21.450> noticeable<00:02:22.040> unless

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
it's not really that noticeable unless

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.100
