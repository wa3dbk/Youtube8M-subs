00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170

Villa and locale was enormous even more
important<00:01:09.530> than<00:01:09.560> that<00:01:09.740> is<00:01:10.390> compassion<00:01:11.390> I

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
important than that is compassion I

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.770 
important than that is compassion I
think<00:01:11.990> that<00:01:12.050> that's<00:01:12.200> fostered<00:01:13.120> in<00:01:14.120> a<00:01:14.570> villa

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
think that that's fostered in a villa

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.600 
think that that's fostered in a villa
and<00:01:15.080> a<00:01:15.170> no-kill<00:01:15.500> just<00:01:15.979> feeling<00:01:16.370> for<00:01:16.580> others

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
and a no-kill just feeling for others

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.130 
and a no-kill just feeling for others
and<00:01:17.030> trying<00:01:17.240> to<00:01:17.330> do<00:01:17.420> what<00:01:17.570> you<00:01:17.660> can<00:01:17.690> to<00:01:17.870> make

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
and trying to do what you can to make

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.510 
and trying to do what you can to make
their<00:01:18.290> lives<00:01:18.470> easier<00:01:18.590> I<00:01:19.040> think<00:01:19.430> that's

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
their lives easier I think that's

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.140 
their lives easier I think that's
probably<00:01:19.670> certainly<00:01:20.150> best<00:01:20.360> as<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.570> physician

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
probably certainly best as a physician

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.550 
probably certainly best as a physician
