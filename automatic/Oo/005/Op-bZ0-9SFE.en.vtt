 good friends, as I said, is going to have 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.680
 a lot of sugar because it turns out that when 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.900
 I was a little girl I had a lot of chocolate 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.060
 to my mom and she to do it fast and 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.150
 to be practical because it's a woman 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.130
 very practical in life decided to make a 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.630
 Pretty fast chocolate mousse that 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.640
 all of you can do it and for 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.339
 supposedly I steal that recipe and I know the 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.900
 I prepare my son many times a month 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:40.600
 because it is also asked of me by 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.100

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:55.870
 hands to work accompany me first 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.930
 We are going to fill half a glass of milk like this 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.019
 that we are not going to enter we are going to put the 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:05.700
 15 marshmallows that there are because there are 15 no 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:10.030
 more no less 15 so we're going to put it 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.090
 we're going to leave it there for a little while 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.259
 once it's dissolved, we're going to put everything 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.259
 the chocolate kisses 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.230
 this of course of age that touch 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:22.230
 special 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.810
 as you see at least the color is already 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.170
 right so we 're going to let it cool 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.630
 a little bit and meanwhile we're going to do 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.860
 my favorite part that is part of the 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.990
 cream let's mix the cream with a 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.710
 little sugar 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.670
 and my favorite part 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.670
 and the blender 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.480
 very well we realize that there is the 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.910
 cream because look do not fall does not happen 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.400

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.370

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.650
 have a lot of patience because you have to 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:28.409
 leave it a couple of hours in the fridge 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.060
 so that it holds consistency and 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:33.060
 supposed 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.319
