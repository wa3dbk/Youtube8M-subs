something<00:01:17.909> fancy<00:01:18.479> but<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.659> completely<00:01:19.290> fill<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
something fancy but we completely fill a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.530 
something fancy but we completely fill a
rabona<00:01:19.830> shout<00:01:20.159> there<00:01:20.340> with<00:01:20.790> Mike<00:01:21.090> Conley<00:01:21.390> 8<00:01:21.509> a

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
rabona shout there with Mike Conley 8 a

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.390 
rabona shout there with Mike Conley 8 a
but<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> couple<00:01:22.200> minutes<00:01:22.290> later<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.890> 81st

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
but a couple minutes later in the 81st

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.010 
but a couple minutes later in the 81st
minute<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:23.939> do<00:01:24.150> get<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> goal<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.869> make

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
minute we do get the goal that we make

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.080 
minute we do get the goal that we make
it<00:01:25.170> 2-1<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.830> way<00:01:25.920> twice<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.460> once<00:01:26.640> again<00:01:26.790> I

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
it 2-1 and way twice and once again I

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.999 
it 2-1 and way twice and once again I
decided<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.810> go<00:01:27.930> with<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.110> rabona<00:01:28.350> shot<00:01:28.770> but

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
decided to go with a rabona shot but

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.950 
decided to go with a rabona shot but
once<00:01:29.549> again<00:01:29.700> we<00:01:29.939> have<00:01:30.030> we<00:01:30.180> completely<00:01:30.630> failed

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
once again we have we completely failed

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.020 
once again we have we completely failed

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.149 
sanchez and he does make it to two
pretty<00:01:39.600> late<00:01:39.840> into<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.200> game<00:01:40.320> tour<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.950> get

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
pretty late into the game tour to get

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.920 
pretty late into the game tour to get
him<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.400> equalize<00:01:41.909> then<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.270> 90th<00:01:42.659> minute<00:01:42.689> he

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
him to equalize then the 90th minute he

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.330 
him to equalize then the 90th minute he
gets<00:01:43.079> another<00:01:43.350> chance<00:01:43.470> as<00:01:43.740> well<00:01:43.890> what<00:01:44.040> routine

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
gets another chance as well what routine

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.130 
gets another chance as well what routine
you<00:01:44.460> where<00:01:44.610> he<00:01:44.700> gets<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.939> shot<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.479> good<00:01:45.930> safe

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
you where he gets a shot and a good safe

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.929 
you where he gets a shot and a good safe
for<00:01:46.350> my<00:01:46.470> goalkeeper<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.189> then<00:01:47.340> a<00:01:47.369> look<00:01:47.759> at

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
for my goalkeeper and then a look at

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.060 
for my goalkeeper and then a look at
this<00:01:48.030> an<00:01:48.240> absolutely<00:01:48.869> ridiculous<00:01:49.530> goal<00:01:49.860> by<00:01:50.040> a

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
this an absolutely ridiculous goal by a

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.219 
this an absolutely ridiculous goal by a
Javi<00:01:50.490> Martinez<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.299> 90th<00:01:51.720> minute<00:01:51.810> as<00:01:52.079> well

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
Javi Martinez in the 90th minute as well

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.469 
Javi Martinez in the 90th minute as well
I<00:01:52.470> actually<00:01:53.369> thought<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.790> my<00:01:54.030> goal<00:01:54.240> keeper

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
I actually thought that my goal keeper

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.789 
I actually thought that my goal keeper
would<00:01:54.570> have<00:01:54.689> saved<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.049> one<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.439> for<00:01:55.619> some

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
would have saved that one but for some

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.469 
would have saved that one but for some
reason<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.219> went<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.579> in<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.790> near<00:01:56.969> post<00:01:57.210> which

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
reason it went in in the near post which

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.730 
reason it went in in the near post which
isn't<00:01:57.630> really<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.930> surprise<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.409> be<00:01:58.530> fair

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
isn't really a surprise to be fair

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.319 
isn't really a surprise to be fair
because<00:01:58.890> nearest<00:01:59.369> both<00:01:59.520> shots<00:01:59.850> are<00:02:00.090> are<00:02:00.270> just

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
because nearest both shots are are just

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.910 
because nearest both shots are are just
so<00:02:00.840> p<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.350> game<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.590> as<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:01.799> can<00:02:01.860> see

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
so p on this game and as you can see

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.859 
so p on this game and as you can see
from<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.310> stats<00:02:02.549> as<00:02:02.640> well<00:02:02.700> he<00:02:03.509> had<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> couple

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
from the stats as well he had a couple

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.080 
from the stats as well he had a couple
more<00:02:04.110> shots<00:02:04.290> than<00:02:04.590> me<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.399> guess<00:02:05.909> he

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
more shots than me so I guess he

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.730 
more shots than me so I guess he
deserved<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.540> win<00:02:06.600> but<00:02:06.990> they<00:02:07.259> really<00:02:07.500> felt

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
deserved the win but they really felt

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.830 
deserved the win but they really felt
that<00:02:07.799> fair<00:02:08.160> especially<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:09.209> way<00:02:09.300> he<00:02:09.330> scored<00:02:09.750> I

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
that fair especially the way he scored I

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.510 
that fair especially the way he scored I
call<00:02:10.050> but<00:02:10.259> yeah<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.800> is<00:02:10.830> FIFA<00:02:11.190> for<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.489> I

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
call but yeah that is FIFA for you I

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.880 
call but yeah that is FIFA for you I
guess<00:02:11.819> so<00:02:12.030> I'm<00:02:12.239> yeah<00:02:12.390> we<00:02:12.510> move<00:02:12.720> on<00:02:12.840> once<00:02:12.989> again

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
guess so I'm yeah we move on once again

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.470 
guess so I'm yeah we move on once again
into<00:02:14.130> another<00:02:14.430> game<00:02:14.610> into<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:14.970> second<00:02:15.330> game

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
or something but it just end up being a

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.880 
or something but it just end up being a
bit<00:02:30.180> of<00:02:30.270> a<00:02:30.330> way<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.540> ivali<00:02:30.900> but<00:02:31.200> anyway<00:02:31.620> we<00:02:31.770> do

see<00:03:48.750> he<00:03:49.380> wasn't<00:03:49.560> really<00:03:49.709> doing<00:03:49.920> anything<00:03:50.130> I

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
see he wasn't really doing anything I

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.280 
see he wasn't really doing anything I
guess<00:03:50.910> he<00:03:51.030> was<00:03:51.180> containing<00:03:51.870> although<00:03:52.140> it

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:09.080 
get us a ninth goal so we go to extra
time<00:06:07.380> -<00:06:07.860> that's<00:06:08.070> they<00:06:08.280> were<00:06:08.400> pretty<00:06:08.669> even<00:06:09.000> we

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
time - that's they were pretty even we

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.850

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
had a couple more shots but I guess it

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.560 
had a couple more shots but I guess it
was<00:06:10.979> deserved<00:06:11.250> to<00:06:11.400> go<00:06:11.550> into<00:06:11.759> extra<00:06:12.090> time<00:06:12.210> and

seemed getting the first chance there in
extra<00:06:14.219> time<00:06:14.250> a<00:06:14.430> very<00:06:14.759> good<00:06:15.000> sailor<00:06:15.180> from<00:06:15.479> a

we<00:06:21.389> go<00:06:21.570> at<00:06:21.719> a<00:06:21.810> cheap<00:06:22.050> shot<00:06:22.320> we<00:06:22.500> do<00:06:22.710> be<00:06:22.919> the

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
we go at a cheap shot we do be the

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.189 
we go at a cheap shot we do be the
goalkeeper<00:06:23.580> and<00:06:23.789> we<00:06:24.180> do<00:06:24.300> make<00:06:24.449> it<00:06:24.630> free<00:06:24.960> -

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199 
goalkeeper and we do make it free -

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.010 
goalkeeper and we do make it free -
there<00:06:25.469> any<00:06:25.849> 120<00:06:26.849> F<00:06:26.940> minutes<00:06:27.330> so<00:06:27.479> I<00:06:27.509> thought<00:06:27.870> the

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 
there any 120 F minutes so I thought the

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.600 
there any 120 F minutes so I thought the
game<00:06:28.139> was<00:06:28.259> pretty<00:06:28.440> much<00:06:28.650> over<00:06:28.860> but<00:06:29.159> he<00:06:29.310> did<00:06:29.460> get

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
game was pretty much over but he did get

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:31.370 
game was pretty much over but he did get
another<00:06:29.940> chance<00:06:30.150> er<00:06:30.360> as<00:06:30.479> you<00:06:30.599> can<00:06:30.719> see<00:06:30.900> he

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
another chance er as you can see he

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.020 
another chance er as you can see he
plays<00:06:31.560> a<00:06:31.680> free<00:06:31.889> pass<00:06:32.070> to<00:06:32.219> paulinho<00:06:32.699> he<00:06:32.880> was

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
plays a free pass to paulinho he was

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:34.820 
plays a free pass to paulinho he was
completely<00:06:33.479> free<00:06:33.870> he<00:06:34.050> takes<00:06:34.380> his<00:06:34.500> shot<00:06:34.650> from

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:34.830 
completely free he takes his shot from

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.500 
completely free he takes his shot from
quite<00:06:35.339> some<00:06:35.580> distance<00:06:35.729> that<00:06:36.120> he<00:06:36.210> makes<00:06:36.389> it

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
quite some distance that he makes it

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.540 
quite some distance that he makes it
free<00:06:36.719> free<00:06:36.960> pretty<00:06:37.199> nice<00:06:37.440> goal<00:06:37.710> and<00:06:37.889> as<00:06:38.460> you
