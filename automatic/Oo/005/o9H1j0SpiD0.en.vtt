we so there's the four pieces and just
have<00:03:23.500> a<00:03:23.530> look<00:03:23.709> see<00:03:24.070> how<00:03:24.880> you<00:03:25.120> put<00:03:25.420> it<00:03:25.450> together

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:45.270 

so<00:03:32.319> this<00:03:32.590> looks<00:03:32.769> like<00:03:32.980> it's<00:03:33.220> the<00:03:33.370> base<00:03:33.549> piece

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.990 

this<00:03:45.880> is<00:03:46.090> most<00:03:46.300> strange<00:03:47.459> now<00:03:48.459> i'm<00:03:48.610> sorry<00:03:48.880> i

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
this is most strange now i'm sorry i

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.970 
this is most strange now i'm sorry i
can't<00:03:49.330> quite<00:03:49.540> work<00:03:49.750> out<00:03:49.959> what<00:03:50.170> that<00:03:50.319> is<00:03:50.380> and<00:03:50.560> i

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
can't quite work out what that is and i

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.130 
can't quite work out what that is and i
can't<00:03:51.250> tell<00:03:51.610> from<00:03:51.850> the<00:03:52.030> picture<00:03:52.510> either<00:03:55.140> it

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
can't tell from the picture either it

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.910 
can't tell from the picture either it
could<00:03:56.470> it<00:03:56.770> could<00:03:56.830> be<00:03:57.280> a<00:03:57.610> rock<00:03:58.420> and<00:03:58.920> that's

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
could it could be a rock and that's

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.670 
could it could be a rock and that's
supposed<00:04:00.220> to<00:04:00.550> be<00:04:00.610> the<00:04:00.880> bird<00:04:01.120> that's<00:04:02.050> landed<00:04:02.319> on

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
supposed to be the bird that's landed on

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.309 
supposed to be the bird that's landed on
the<00:04:02.800> rock<00:04:02.980> i<00:04:03.160> think<00:04:03.370> that's<00:04:03.520> what<00:04:03.730> it<00:04:03.880> is<00:04:04.319> and

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
the rock i think that's what it is and

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.410 
the rock i think that's what it is and
we'll<00:04:05.470> see<00:04:05.770> we<00:04:06.280> can<00:04:06.489> click<00:04:06.910> this<00:04:07.090> on<00:04:09.300> some<00:04:10.300> of

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
we'll see we can click this on some of

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.030 
we'll see we can click this on some of
these<00:04:10.540> pieces<00:04:10.900> don't<00:04:11.350> fit<00:04:11.500> very<00:04:11.920> well

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
these pieces don't fit very well

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.560 
these pieces don't fit very well
unfortunately<00:04:14.640> no<00:04:15.640> that's<00:04:15.940> not<00:04:16.150> going<00:04:16.329> to<00:04:16.419> fit

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
unfortunately no that's not going to fit

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.680 
unfortunately no that's not going to fit
in<00:04:16.630> there<00:04:17.190> so<00:04:18.190> that<00:04:18.220> that's<00:04:18.850> that's<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.480> toy

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
in there so that that's that's the toy

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.840 
in there so that that's that's the toy
in<00:04:19.750> this<00:04:19.930> particular<00:04:20.140> egg<00:04:20.739> it's<00:04:21.340> not<00:04:21.519> a<00:04:21.579> real

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
in this particular egg it's not a real

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.570 
in this particular egg it's not a real
winner<00:04:22.270> wouldn't<00:04:22.690> a<00:04:22.780> thought<00:04:23.020> but<00:04:23.380> then<00:04:23.580> there

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
winner wouldn't a thought but then there

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.240 
winner wouldn't a thought but then there
we<00:04:24.669> go<00:04:24.850> that<00:04:25.090> that's<00:04:25.360> what<00:04:25.600> that<00:04:25.750> one<00:04:25.990> is<00:04:26.250> and

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
we go that that's what that one is and

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.550 
we go that that's what that one is and
we'll<00:04:28.240> just<00:04:28.419> pop<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:29.050> other<00:04:29.200> one<00:04:29.380> back

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
we'll just pop the other one back

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.490 
we'll just pop the other one back
together<00:04:29.950> again<00:04:30.130> but<00:04:31.060> then<00:04:31.419> these<00:04:32.140> could<00:04:32.410> be

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
together again but then these could be

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.920 
together again but then these could be
played<00:04:32.770> with<00:04:32.980> afterwards<00:04:33.550> so<00:04:33.790> that's<00:04:34.030> that's
