00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.739

 music from Morelia to demand 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:28.519

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.260
 originating from apatzingán even 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.360

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.269
 reason that we have for all 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.180
 boys who are already registered 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:44.670
 weapons and they burned their papers when 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.310
 they arrested them miss they are not 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.500
 asking for copies that we can not grab 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.569
 here we have to leave to trigger 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.489
 men and women carrying their babies 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.890
 and little children came in a hurry 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.720
 until the emerald criminal wife of one 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.970
 of the detainees said they are 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.310
 innocents and the criminals are free 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.720
 to people who are criminal to the loose and 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.150
 because they have here those who are 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.340
 innocent the innocent nothing else the 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.540
 they have there because because they are always 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.790
 what they do is here they have the 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.099
 Mensos and people who are loose 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.019
 and old women have well know what they are 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.450
 the criminals but as we are poor 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.549
 then ignore us not only to 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.049
 rich to them and according to information 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.000
 provided by the relatives of the 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.859

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.530
 peasants cutters of lemon and 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.239
 masons live in apatzingán but at 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.099
 At the time of his arrest they were 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.319
 in Lázaro cárdenas as part of the group 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.540
 of self-defense because that was a picture 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.969
 what they put to these people 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.730
 innocent people people that we walk 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:43.439
 working well and everyone already knows 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.500
 Sunday April 12 were consigning 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:50.159
 130 of 155 detainees whom they 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:52.109
 they seized 165 weapons a rocket launcher and 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:55.739
 a horacio and dalí grenade launcher also 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:58.409
 yesterday the arrest was reported or what 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:02.909
 is the retention or detection rather 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:05.069
 said of a tanker in waters of the 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.409
 port of manzanillo colima was 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.650
 detected with 100,000 tons of 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:12.599
 iron ore that would be sent 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.790
 apparently to china and good this to 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.470
 intercept this tanker also 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.639
 it will be another very important blow to the 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.919
 criminal structure of the knights 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.919
 Templars' which was fundamentally of 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.270
 what they maintained that was more 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:26.280
 there also of the activities 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.080
 criminals who developed this was their 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.330
 main source of income and they have been 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.889
 hit from when they took the 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.560
 puerto el puerto michoacano las 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.630
 federal authorities and little by little already 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.600
 is the second assurance that is that 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.480
 It occurs in the port of Manzanillo, Colima 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.940
 and authorities found that the 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:49.020
 cargo was not legal and that's why 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.580
 should therefore be confiscated until 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.380
