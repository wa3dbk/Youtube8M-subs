 laurie mallory two year old one of 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.910
 the best game maker make up the rig 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:24.460
 world I book for carbon 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:27.609
 carbon fiber masked piece nature there 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.580
 well as synergies with marsaudon 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.080
 composites uses gesture next door 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.680
 hinterland communication synergy end in 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.800
 stage a gate valve the pin valves 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.320
 alldis company 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.559
 will be looking at gaza news release 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.160
 gaza to make earn lower Gbagbo 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.660
 this possible 10 why we choose lorima me 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.920
 I am very proud to be back on 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.809
 this kind of project for a simple and 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.879
 good reason is that have managed to 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.260
 associate the competition part precisely 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.300
 where we have been developing since 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.620
 very very long time on the part 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.500
 multihulls as well a trimaran when 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.699
 catamaran is today the tan 66 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.960
 perfectly represents what we have 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.940
 managed to develop the part 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.229
 competition at the cruise part but 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.909
 this cruising part today we have 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.500
 tried to simplify things so 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.000
 to have a product that is more 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.140
 easily adaptable to just this 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.270
 part cruises and maybe people 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.550
 less experienced but in any case who 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.410
 benefits perfectly from the notion 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.509
 carbon so the weight the performance 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.240
 this being the case we tried to work 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.920
 precisely on a project that remains 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.390
 something very safe 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.300
 we need to have products that they 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.740
 are easily usable secure and 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.060
 with information leaflets that 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.060
 make it easy to use 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:47.909
 carbon fiber material list all of 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:54.159
 very very light very resistant beings 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:56.979
 isync lasting a lady of timing amelie 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.799
 remains so carbon mass at sight of m 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.890
 christine at the studio under style fine 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:05.250
 today 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.539
 you need the superfast catamar and you 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.750
 must have a very light 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:12.900
 Mrs. Ashton on carbon fiber is not only 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.450
 you need is the most but the choice of 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.280
 carbon it is indeed we will say that the 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.390
 mast indeed much lighter that it 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.150
 there is no picture now on the 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.190
 principle is especially power precisely 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.290
 benefit from this weight the weight that we are going 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.599
 to have in the height of the hand it is enough 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.760
 just imagine for example on the 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.830
 height of the rhombus of this evil has by 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.880
 example of having the equivalent versus 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.049
 at its center of gravity we're going 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.819
 consider roughly in the middle of the mas 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.530
 to have a cow just about a cow 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.019
 Breton in this area that 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.720
 today goes into the functioning of the 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.010
 boat allow the boats anyway 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.480
 do not have this mass in this area 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.069
 there to have a boat that is a 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.349
 behavior on the water that is a lot 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.390
 the more it means that the more we lower the 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:55.319
 masses on the height plus the boat a 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.690
 interesting behavior I filed a 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.129
 patent a short time ago for a 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.450
 good color always the same for 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:01.680
 benefit from what is being done in the 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.360
 competition to have a real 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.430
 mainsail reported to the party 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.900
 cruise on the tan 66 is to have 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.639
 a retractable boom on which we have 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.400
 true slats so today the system 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.780
 wants us to be able to wind up 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.609
 mainsail battens and 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.290
 carts turn a tube that makes that the 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.790
 mainsail is exactly the same on 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.560
 a boat moment when the good hour 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.560
 traditional good tradition 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.730
 he 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.730
 and
