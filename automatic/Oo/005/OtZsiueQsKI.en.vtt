00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:34.879 
other side they're a little more clear I

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:37.449 
other side they're a little more clear I

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
they're like the squishy things over all

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.429 
they're like the squishy things over all
these<00:04:06.650> fashions<00:04:07.189> are<00:04:07.430> super<00:04:08.389> cute<00:04:08.629> and<00:04:08.959> they

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439 
these fashions are super cute and they

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:12.249 
these fashions are super cute and they
were<00:04:09.500> around<00:04:09.919> like<00:04:10.189> three<00:04:10.699> dollars<00:04:11.269> ish<00:04:11.509> ish

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:12.259 
were around like three dollars ish ish

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:16.660 
were around like three dollars ish ish
each<00:04:13.099> which<00:04:13.519> I<00:04:13.729> kind<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.120> think<00:04:14.239> is<00:04:14.389> a<00:04:14.479> surprise

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:16.670 
each which I kind of think is a surprise

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.200 
each which I kind of think is a surprise
two<00:04:17.090> dollars<00:04:17.510> or<00:04:17.780> so<00:04:17.990> they're<00:04:19.150> they're<00:04:20.150> not

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:20.210 
two dollars or so they're they're not

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:22.900 
two dollars or so they're they're not
the<00:04:20.510> highest<00:04:20.660> quality<00:04:21.140> and<00:04:21.170> the<00:04:22.160> camping<00:04:22.820> is

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
the highest quality and the camping is

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.970 
the highest quality and the camping is
for<00:04:23.120> a<00:04:23.150> lot<00:04:23.330> so<00:04:23.960> I<00:04:23.990> think<00:04:24.140> three<00:04:24.500> dollars<00:04:24.800> is

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
for a lot so I think three dollars is

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.650 
for a lot so I think three dollars is
maybe<00:04:25.190> a<00:04:25.310> little<00:04:25.700> too<00:04:25.910> much<00:04:26.180> for<00:04:26.360> each<00:04:26.450> one

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
maybe a little too much for each one

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.720 
maybe a little too much for each one
because<00:04:26.900> if<00:04:27.020> you<00:04:27.080> think<00:04:27.110> about<00:04:27.320> it<00:04:27.470> three<00:04:28.040> six

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
because if you think about it three six

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.080 
because if you think about it three six
nine<00:04:29.120> dollars<00:04:29.540> for<00:04:29.780> three<00:04:30.050> of<00:04:30.140> them<00:04:30.290> and<00:04:31.090> each

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
nine dollars for three of them and each

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.050 
nine dollars for three of them and each
little<00:04:32.920> four-inch<00:04:33.920> pony<00:04:34.310> which<00:04:34.580> is<00:04:34.730> way<00:04:34.880> high

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
little four-inch pony which is way high

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.330 
little four-inch pony which is way high
quality<00:04:35.570> is<00:04:35.630> like<00:04:35.840> five<00:04:36.230> dollars<00:04:36.770> so<00:04:37.010> two<00:04:37.070> more

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
quality is like five dollars so two more

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.120 
quality is like five dollars so two more
dollars<00:04:37.610> and<00:04:37.760> you<00:04:37.820> could<00:04:38.000> get<00:04:38.380> something<00:04:39.380> way

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
dollars and you could get something way

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.950 
dollars and you could get something way
nicer<00:04:40.550> but<00:04:40.820> i<00:04:40.850> don't<00:04:41.390> know<00:04:41.450> i<00:04:41.630> don't<00:04:41.690> know

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
nicer but i don't know i don't know

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.510 
nicer but i don't know i don't know
maybe<00:04:42.260> three<00:04:42.740> dollars<00:04:43.010> is<00:04:43.160> a<00:04:43.190> good<00:04:43.370> price

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
maybe three dollars is a good price
