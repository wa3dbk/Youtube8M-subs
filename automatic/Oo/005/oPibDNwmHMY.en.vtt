00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.140 
should probably go ahead and do some

needed to get to 500 gems as you can see
I<00:00:25.080> got<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.590> level<00:00:25.859> two<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.699> some<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.300> them<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.779> I

important to note that you can buy the
the<00:00:37.559> third<00:00:37.770> builder<00:00:38.250> with<00:00:38.640> just<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.180> gems

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
the third builder with just the gems

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.330 
the third builder with just the gems
that<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.690> get<00:00:39.899> an<00:00:40.050> achievement<00:00:40.340> fairly

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
that you get an achievement fairly

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.830 
that you get an achievement fairly
quickly<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.820> didn't<00:00:42.059> take<00:00:42.180> me<00:00:42.300> very<00:00:42.329> long<00:00:42.540> at

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
quickly it didn't take me very long at

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.240 
quickly it didn't take me very long at
all<00:00:42.899> so<00:00:43.110> it's<00:00:43.260> worth<00:00:43.410> it<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:43.710> hold<00:00:44.040> out

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
all so it's worth it to just hold out

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.549 
all so it's worth it to just hold out
wait<00:00:45.000> till<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.270> get<00:00:45.360> those<00:00:45.510> gems<00:00:45.870> make<00:00:46.410> sure

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
wait till you get those gems make sure

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.680 
wait till you get those gems make sure
that<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.800> clear<00:00:47.039> all<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.760> crap<00:00:48.120> all<00:00:48.450> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
that you clear all the crap all the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.990 
that you clear all the crap all the
trees<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.500> stumps<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.190> mushrooms<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.940> all

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
trees and stumps and mushrooms and all

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.700 
trees and stumps and mushrooms and all
that<00:00:51.149> stuff<00:00:51.270> that's<00:00:51.570> bonds<00:00:51.989> around<00:00:52.379> your<00:00:52.559> base

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
that stuff that's bonds around your base

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.170 
that stuff that's bonds around your base
because<00:00:53.039> those<00:00:53.190> are<00:00:53.309> full<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.550> gems<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.059> it's

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
because those are full of gems so it's

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.400 
because those are full of gems so it's
really<00:00:54.300> important<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.750> do<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.050> stuff<00:00:55.289> you

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
here I needed a 25 gem so I could get my

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.579 
here I needed a 25 gem so I could get my
builder<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.570> was<00:01:03.750> important<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.260> me<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
builder so that was important to me and

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.960 
builder so that was important to me and
I<00:01:04.680> went<00:01:04.769> ahead<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.040> did<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.729> I'm<00:01:05.790> sure

I'll<00:01:06.090> get<00:01:06.180> another<00:01:06.299> one<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.869> maybe<00:01:07.020> in<00:01:07.170> a

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
I'll get another one and maybe in a

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.330 
I'll get another one and maybe in a
better<00:01:07.409> place<00:01:07.560> because<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.979> wasn't<00:01:08.250> in<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
better place because it wasn't in the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.980 
better place because it wasn't in the
best<00:01:08.490> location<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:09.060> was<00:01:09.180> over<00:01:09.360> here<00:01:09.510> okay<00:01:09.750> so

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
best location it was over here okay so

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.630 
best location it was over here okay so

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.880 
be very fun for them if they come from
the<00:01:42.299> top<00:01:42.570> that's<00:01:42.869> fine<00:01:43.049> by<00:01:43.229> me<00:01:43.259> they<00:01:43.530> may<00:01:43.710> get

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
the top that's fine by me they may get

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.950 
the top that's fine by me they may get
my<00:01:44.100> town<00:01:44.369> hall<00:01:44.670> I<00:01:44.850> don't<00:01:45.060> care<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.299> much<00:01:45.630> and

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
my town hall I don't care that much and

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.080 
my town hall I don't care that much and
that<00:01:46.649> Town<00:01:47.040> Hall<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.430> going<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.640> take<00:01:47.820> them<00:01:47.909> a

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
that Town Hall is going to take them a

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.090 
that Town Hall is going to take them a
long<00:01:48.119> time<00:01:48.450> to<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:49.110> through<00:01:49.380> while<00:01:49.770> my

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
long time to get through while my

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.819 
long time to get through while my
defenses<00:01:50.640> are<00:01:50.790> hammering<00:01:51.149> on<00:01:51.360> them<00:01:51.600> and

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:51.829 
defenses are hammering on them and

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.139 
defenses are hammering on them and
hopefully<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:53.520> will<00:01:53.700> keep<00:01:53.909> them<00:01:54.090> from

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
hopefully that will keep them from

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.569 
hopefully that will keep them from
getting<00:01:54.540> too<00:01:55.290> much<00:01:55.470> damage<00:01:55.740> on<00:01:56.009> me<00:01:56.189> now<00:01:56.520> you

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
getting too much damage on me now you

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.760 
getting too much damage on me now you
see<00:01:56.939> my<00:01:57.210> defenses<00:01:57.689> don't<00:01:57.930> quite<00:01:58.229> cover<00:01:58.560> all

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
see my defenses don't quite cover all

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.560 
see my defenses don't quite cover all
all<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.340> way<00:01:59.430> over<00:01:59.670> there<00:01:59.700> I<00:01:59.850> wish<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.360> base

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
all the way over there I wish this base

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.270 
all the way over there I wish this base
was<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> little<00:02:01.110> bit<00:02:01.229> more<00:02:01.380> compact<00:02:01.829> but<00:02:02.250> I

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
was a little bit more compact but I

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.060 
was a little bit more compact but I
wanted<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:02.939> two<00:02:03.329> spaces<00:02:03.810> from<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.829> walls

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
wanted to have two spaces from the walls

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.249 
wanted to have two spaces from the walls
so<00:02:05.759> people<00:02:06.030> can't<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.630> use<00:02:06.810> archers<00:02:07.229> and

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
so people can't just use archers and

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.619 
so people can't just use archers and
come<00:02:07.560> over<00:02:07.799> here<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.220> wizards<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.940> just<00:02:09.450> hit

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
come over here and wizards and just hit

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.820 
come over here and wizards and just hit
everything<00:02:09.840> from<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.349> outside<00:02:10.649> they

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
everything from the outside they

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.440 
everything from the outside they
actually<00:02:11.250> have<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.640> bust<00:02:11.849> into<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.300> walls

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
actually have to bust into the walls

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.760 
actually have to bust into the walls
which<00:02:12.750> means<00:02:12.989> they<00:02:13.110> actually<00:02:13.470> have

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
which means they actually have

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.440 
which means they actually have
to<00:02:13.860> deal<00:02:13.980> with<00:02:14.190> all<00:02:14.220> my<00:02:14.370> defenses<00:02:14.970> so<00:02:15.210> that's

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
to deal with all my defenses so that's

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.210 
to deal with all my defenses so that's
the<00:02:15.630> reason<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:16.080> did<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.500> it's<00:02:16.770> a<00:02:16.950> pretty

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
the reason that I did that it's a pretty

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.830 
the reason that I did that it's a pretty
spread<00:02:17.610> out<00:02:17.640> base<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.270> noticed<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:18.660> the

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
spread out base I noticed that the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.170 
spread out base I noticed that the
further<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.200> spread<00:02:19.620> things<00:02:19.890> out<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.820> more

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
further you spread things out the more

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.940 
further you spread things out the more
likely<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.570> you're<00:02:21.810> going<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:22.230> win<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.710> think

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
likely that you're going to win I think

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.950 
likely that you're going to win I think
that<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.220> time<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.670> takes<00:02:23.820> for<00:02:24.120> enemy<00:02:24.690> troops

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
that the time it takes for enemy troops

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.110 
that the time it takes for enemy troops
to<00:02:25.140> walk<00:02:25.380> around<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:26.040> important<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.790> time<00:02:26.970> it

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
to walk around is important the time it

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.270 
to walk around is important the time it
takes<00:02:27.270> to<00:02:27.420> walk<00:02:27.690> from<00:02:27.930> this<00:02:28.350> side<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.980> this

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
takes to walk from this side of this

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.430 
takes to walk from this side of this
building<00:02:29.520> when<00:02:29.970> you're<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.120> barbarian<00:02:30.720> all<00:02:31.020> the

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
building when you're a barbarian all the

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.290 
building when you're a barbarian all the
way<00:02:31.530> over<00:02:31.890> through<00:02:32.280> this<00:02:32.430> empty<00:02:32.820> space<00:02:32.940> right

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
way over through this empty space right

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.420 
way over through this empty space right
here<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.960> this<00:02:34.170> building<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.770> time<00:02:35.100> that<00:02:35.130> my

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
here to this building is time that my

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.040 
here to this building is time that my
cannon<00:02:35.820> is<00:02:35.910> going<00:02:36.060> to<00:02:36.120> be<00:02:36.240> hitting<00:02:36.420> you<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:36.870> the

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
cannon is going to be hitting you so the

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.420 
cannon is going to be hitting you so the
further<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.350> can<00:02:37.440> get<00:02:37.770> these<00:02:37.890> away<00:02:38.100> from<00:02:38.340> each

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
further I can get these away from each

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.740 
further I can get these away from each
other<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.730> better<00:02:38.820> but<00:02:39.210> I<00:02:39.240> don't<00:02:39.480> want<00:02:39.660> them

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
other the better but I don't want them

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.270 
other the better but I don't want them
too<00:02:39.900> far<00:02:40.140> out<00:02:40.350> because<00:02:40.650> like<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:40.980> said<00:02:41.040> they

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
too far out because like I said they

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.790 
too far out because like I said they
need<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.520> be<00:02:41.640> inside<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.840> range<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.350> the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
need to be inside of the range of the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.320 
need to be inside of the range of the
defenses<00:02:44.310> so<00:02:44.490> you<00:02:44.580> notice<00:02:44.790> I've<00:02:44.940> got<00:02:45.120> all

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
defenses so you notice I've got all

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.150 
defenses so you notice I've got all
these<00:02:45.570> inside<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.290> range<00:02:46.470> even<00:02:46.830> if<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.040> is

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
these inside the range even if it is

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.860 
these inside the range even if it is
just<00:02:47.190> barely<00:02:47.610> they<00:02:48.000> are<00:02:48.120> going<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.300> be<00:02:48.450> inside

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
just barely they are going to be inside

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.330 
just barely they are going to be inside
the<00:02:48.990> range<00:02:49.170> so<00:02:49.320> if<00:02:49.440> anybody<00:02:49.740> comes<00:02:49.860> over<00:02:50.190> here

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
the range so if anybody comes over here

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.650 
the range so if anybody comes over here
and<00:02:50.370> they're<00:02:50.550> attacking<00:02:50.880> these<00:02:51.150> buildings

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
and they're attacking these buildings

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.210 
and they're attacking these buildings
they're<00:02:51.930> going<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.140> be<00:02:52.260> getting<00:02:52.470> hit<00:02:52.830> by<00:02:52.860> my

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
they're going to be getting hit by my

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.470 
they're going to be getting hit by my
dudes<00:02:53.430> now<00:02:53.700> both<00:02:53.940> of<00:02:53.970> these<00:02:54.180> are<00:02:54.330> under

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
dudes now both of these are under

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.790 
dudes now both of these are under
construction<00:02:54.720> right<00:02:55.020> now<00:02:55.140> so<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:55.470> can't<00:02:55.650> see

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
construction right now so you can't see

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.170 
construction right now so you can't see
the<00:02:55.890> range<00:02:56.160> but<00:02:56.340> these<00:02:56.610> are<00:02:56.790> kind<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.030> big

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
the range but these are kind of big

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.730 
the range but these are kind of big
buildings<00:02:57.390> right<00:02:57.720> here<00:02:58.020> so<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.530> range

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
buildings right here so the range

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.680 
buildings right here so the range
doesn't<00:02:59.220> quite<00:02:59.490> cover<00:02:59.850> all<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.300> way<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.450> the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
doesn't quite cover all the way to the

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.030 
doesn't quite cover all the way to the
end<00:03:00.840> but<00:03:01.080> then<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.290> got<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.500> mortar<00:03:01.770> here<00:03:01.920> which

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
end but then I got the mortar here which

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.350 
end but then I got the mortar here which
has<00:03:02.190> really<00:03:02.460> big<00:03:02.610> range<00:03:02.850> so<00:03:03.000> that's<00:03:03.180> why<00:03:03.300> this

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
has really big range so that's why this

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.880 
has really big range so that's why this
is<00:03:03.630> all<00:03:03.750> covered<00:03:04.080> also<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.440> reason<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:04.740> I

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
is all covered also the reason that I

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.160 
is all covered also the reason that I
have<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.220> army<00:03:05.550> camps<00:03:05.940> around<00:03:06.090> my<00:03:06.750> mortar

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
have the army camps around my mortar

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.420 
have the army camps around my mortar
here<00:03:07.500> instead<00:03:07.800> of<00:03:07.920> spreading<00:03:08.100> them<00:03:08.370> out

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
here instead of spreading them out

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.610 
here instead of spreading them out
throughout<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.880> base<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.690> mortars<00:03:10.080> my<00:03:10.290> most

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
throughout the base the mortars my most

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.860 
throughout the base the mortars my most
important<00:03:11.250> defensive<00:03:11.760> structure<00:03:12.480> right<00:03:12.690> now

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
important defensive structure right now

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.260 
important defensive structure right now
it<00:03:13.140> does<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:13.740> most<00:03:13.920> damage<00:03:14.040> per<00:03:14.730> second<00:03:15.150> on

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
it does the most damage per second on

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.880 
it does the most damage per second on
the<00:03:15.420> field<00:03:15.660> and<00:03:15.870> it<00:03:15.990> splashed<00:03:16.260> damage<00:03:16.710> which

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
the field and it splashed damage which

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.140 
the field and it splashed damage which
is<00:03:17.010> why<00:03:17.130> it's<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.370> most<00:03:17.400> per<00:03:17.700> second<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.060> got

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
is why it's the most per second you got

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.580 
is why it's the most per second you got
to<00:03:18.270> multiply<00:03:18.600> it<00:03:18.690> out<00:03:18.810> by<00:03:18.990> all<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.230> troops<00:03:19.410> is

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
to multiply it out by all the troops is

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.930 
to multiply it out by all the troops is
hitting<00:03:19.800> at<00:03:19.890> the<00:03:19.980> same<00:03:20.160> time<00:03:20.370> so<00:03:20.730> that's

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
hitting at the same time so that's

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.640 
hitting at the same time so that's
pretty<00:03:21.150> high<00:03:21.300> damage<00:03:21.570> and<00:03:21.930> that's<00:03:22.230> why<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:22.410> want

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
pretty high damage and that's why I want

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.590 
pretty high damage and that's why I want
to<00:03:22.709> protect<00:03:22.890> this<00:03:23.310> if<00:03:23.550> anybody<00:03:24.030> comes<00:03:24.270> from

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
to protect this if anybody comes from

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.600 
to protect this if anybody comes from
any<00:03:24.840> side<00:03:25.230> aside<00:03:25.770> from<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.130> side<00:03:26.280> with<00:03:26.490> the

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
any side aside from the side with the

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.740 
any side aside from the side with the
mortar<00:03:26.940> they're<00:03:27.180> going<00:03:27.330> to<00:03:27.390> be<00:03:27.480> in<00:03:27.570> big

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
mortar they're going to be in big

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.120 
mortar they're going to be in big
trouble<00:03:27.780> because<00:03:28.350> they<00:03:28.530> need<00:03:28.740> to<00:03:28.860> get<00:03:28.980> this

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
trouble because they need to get this

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:30.800 
trouble because they need to get this
mortar<00:03:29.520> out<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.850> here<00:03:30.030> or<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.240> mortars<00:03:30.630> just

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
mortar out of here or the mortars just

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.570 
mortar out of here or the mortars just
going<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.020> be<00:03:31.110> raining<00:03:31.440> down<00:03:31.740> terror<00:03:32.160> on<00:03:32.400> them

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
going to be raining down terror on them

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.040 
going to be raining down terror on them
the<00:03:32.700> whole<00:03:32.880> time<00:03:33.060> which<00:03:33.360> is<00:03:33.390> exactly<00:03:33.660> what<00:03:33.990> I

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
the whole time which is exactly what I

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.690 
the whole time which is exactly what I
want<00:03:34.470> but<00:03:34.620> it's<00:03:34.770> exactly<00:03:35.010> what<00:03:35.310> they<00:03:35.459> don't

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
want but it's exactly what they don't

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.540 
want but it's exactly what they don't
want<00:03:35.820> so<00:03:36.270> hopefully<00:03:36.870> people<00:03:37.170> will<00:03:37.830> you<00:03:38.430> know

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
want so hopefully people will you know

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.940 
want so hopefully people will you know
not<00:03:38.880> come<00:03:39.209> from<00:03:39.450> this<00:03:39.630> side<00:03:39.690> and<00:03:39.959> leave<00:03:40.800> the

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
not come from this side and leave the

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.310 
not come from this side and leave the
mortar<00:03:41.220> alone<00:03:41.520> and<00:03:41.820> then<00:03:42.090> just<00:03:42.690> focus<00:03:43.140> on<00:03:43.230> the

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:43.320 
mortar alone and then just focus on the

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.620 
mortar alone and then just focus on the
other<00:03:43.470> defenses<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.070> they<00:03:44.190> will<00:03:44.430> not<00:03:44.820> win<00:03:45.030> all

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
other defenses and they will not win all

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.720 
other defenses and they will not win all
right<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:45.930> they<00:03:46.020> won't<00:03:46.200> get<00:03:46.290> my<00:03:46.530> loot<00:03:47.459> which

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
right and they won't get my loot which

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.040 
right and they won't get my loot which
is<00:03:47.880> really<00:03:48.030> what<00:03:48.240> I<00:03:48.300> don't<00:03:48.540> want<00:03:48.690> them<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.930> get

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
is really what I don't want them to get

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.900 
is really what I don't want them to get
so<00:03:49.260> like<00:03:49.530> I<00:03:49.620> said<00:03:49.680> this<00:03:49.950> is<00:03:50.160> a<00:03:50.190> hybrid<00:03:50.459> base

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
so like I said this is a hybrid base

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.000 
so like I said this is a hybrid base
it's<00:03:51.209> a<00:03:51.330> trophy<00:03:51.720> base<00:03:51.900> I've<00:03:52.260> got<00:03:52.410> my<00:03:52.560> town<00:03:52.800> hall

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
it's a trophy base I've got my town hall

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.880 
it's a trophy base I've got my town hall
protected<00:03:53.520> it<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.450> resource<00:03:55.080> and<00:03:55.380> farming

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
protected it is a resource and farming

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.370 
protected it is a resource and farming
base<00:03:56.070> I've<00:03:56.430> got<00:03:56.790> my<00:03:57.060> resource<00:03:57.570> storages<00:03:58.200> in

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
base I've got my resource storages in

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.230 
base I've got my resource storages in
the<00:03:58.650> center<00:03:59.010> of<00:03:59.040> my<00:03:59.340> base<00:03:59.520> and<00:03:59.790> protected<00:04:00.209> by

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240 
the center of my base and protected by

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.449 
the center of my base and protected by
walls<00:04:00.600> and<00:04:00.990> defenses<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.830> it's<00:04:02.220> pretty

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
walls and defenses and it's pretty

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.130 
walls and defenses and it's pretty
well-rounded<00:04:02.670> base<00:04:03.209> I've<00:04:03.450> got<00:04:03.630> pretty<00:04:04.080> good
