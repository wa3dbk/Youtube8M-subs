00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.120 
this now but I just take I find that
center<00:03:39.530> line<00:03:39.740> and<00:03:40.100> I<00:03:40.250> just<00:03:40.280> do<00:03:40.940> angle<00:03:41.920> put<00:03:42.920> like

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
center line and I just do angle put like

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.910 
center line and I just do angle put like
I<00:03:43.220> push<00:03:43.430> down<00:03:43.460> on<00:03:43.940> to<00:03:44.120> it<00:03:44.240> on<00:03:44.390> an<00:03:44.540> angle<00:03:44.920> like

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
I push down on to it on an angle like

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.950 
I push down on to it on an angle like
the<00:03:46.130> texture<00:03:46.550> of<00:03:46.670> leaves<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.330> I<00:03:47.570> go<00:03:47.720> around

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
the texture of leaves and I go around

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.900 
the texture of leaves and I go around
the<00:03:48.170> other<00:03:48.290> side<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:48.920> do<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.040> same<00:03:49.340> thing<00:03:49.640> and

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
the other side and do the same thing and

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.790 
the other side and do the same thing and
I<00:03:49.940> kind<00:03:50.090> of<00:03:50.209> angle<00:03:50.510> it<00:03:50.660> up<00:03:50.810> letting<00:03:51.470> you<00:03:51.680> guys

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
I kind of angle it up letting you guys

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.680 
I kind of angle it up letting you guys
can't<00:03:52.070> really<00:03:52.220> see<00:03:52.459> it<00:03:52.550> very<00:03:52.580> well<00:03:52.880> but<00:03:53.120> anyway

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
can't really see it very well but anyway

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.920 
can't really see it very well but anyway
in<00:03:54.110> real<00:03:54.290> life<00:03:54.500> it<00:03:54.709> looks<00:03:54.740> pretty<00:03:55.220> cool<00:03:55.840> so<00:03:56.840> you

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
in real life it looks pretty cool so you

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:05.440 
in real life it looks pretty cool so you
just<00:03:57.170> do<00:03:57.290> that<00:03:57.440> to<00:03:57.620> each<00:03:57.860> leaf<00:03:58.130> and<00:04:04.270> then<00:04:05.270> I

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
just do that to each leaf and then I

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.780 
just do that to each leaf and then I
just<00:04:05.660> kind<00:04:05.870> of<00:04:05.959> roll<00:04:06.890> up<00:04:06.980> then<00:04:07.220> it's<00:04:07.430> just<00:04:07.610> a

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
just kind of roll up then it's just a

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.720 
just kind of roll up then it's just a
little<00:04:08.060> bit<00:04:08.180> more<00:04:08.480> okay<00:04:09.470> so<00:04:10.280> now<00:04:10.430> for<00:04:10.459> the

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
little bit more okay so now for the

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.360 
little bit more okay so now for the

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
assembling part you're just going to

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.120 
assembling part you're just going to
take<00:04:13.610> your<00:04:14.450> five<00:04:14.690> leaves<00:04:14.959> and<00:04:15.530> you<00:04:15.800> could<00:04:15.950> take

and doesn't slow me down on to hold it

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.070 
and doesn't slow me down on to hold it
for<00:05:30.830> like<00:05:30.949> 3040<00:05:31.759> seconds<00:05:32.180> I'm<00:05:32.360> inpatient<00:05:32.900> top

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
for like 3040 seconds I'm inpatient top

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.739 
for like 3040 seconds I'm inpatient top
base<00:05:33.289> so<00:05:33.699> all<00:05:34.699> you<00:05:34.879> have<00:05:34.999> to<00:05:35.120> do<00:05:35.240> is<00:05:35.360> press<00:05:35.599> it

00:05:35.739 --> 00:05:35.749 
base so all you have to do is press it

00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:38.920 
base so all you have to do is press it
into<00:05:35.870> the<00:05:36.050> center<00:05:36.379> there<00:05:36.560> and<00:05:37.659> just<00:05:38.659> sort<00:05:38.840> of

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
into the center there and just sort of

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.700 
into the center there and just sort of
squeeze<00:05:39.349> those<00:05:39.560> pedals<00:05:39.889> together<00:05:40.310> again<00:05:41.710> just

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.710 
squeeze those pedals together again just

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.429 
squeeze those pedals together again just
