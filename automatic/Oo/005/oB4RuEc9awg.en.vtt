00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 here we are my gentlemen with a fast 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:17.580
 tutorial on how to record the screen 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:20.730
 of the phone as you well know on youtube 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.070
 are more and more frequent videos where there 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.900
 they are gameplay even on phones but 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.849
 even video tutorials maybe with the 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.599
 with the side phone screen 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.920
 today I will teach you how to register it 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.969
 screen has a really good quality 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.829
 There are so many superstores 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.570
 applications to record the screen 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.160
 I've already tried them, don't try 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.200
 a lot of selected for you what 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.489
 I think it's the best 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.920
 then of course you can try it e 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.320
 obviously they are all paid then 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.989
 if you want a decent registration 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.660
 release them of ghini and otherwise 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.600
 will be limited below the point there is from 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.059
 resolution or by minutization of 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.190
 video but let's start this app right away yes 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.110
 call scr pro 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.130
 obviously because it is paid 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.450
 all cost over 2 euros then 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.590
 really keep in mind 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.530
 we know that anyway we can 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.210
 find elsewhere now let's go 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.770
 we turn on the application as you see 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.500
 there is no screen but 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.450
 simply this little finger 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.520
 what is this little bar this 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.110
 finger film is practically a 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.920
 Quick application menu really 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.890
 comfortable 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.479
 as you can see an icon also appeared 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.299
 here if we drag down 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.079
 we will see that having skin agrees pro is 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.460
 in rea says ready to register if we 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:38.850
 we want to record let's try this 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.320
 key 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.369
 but before starting to record is 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.000
 better take a look at 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.630
 settings 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.310
 so let's create the stations there 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.960
 there are several things to set there 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.829
 the encoder that I recommend you leave 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.830
 the h 264 the resolution that this emma 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.090
 maximum 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.410
 says unstable practically use the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.720
 maximum establishment of the phone if 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.360
 you can set what you want 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.490
 here is the match transformation there is with 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.110
 the video card core processor with 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.820
 video card plus I leave that 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.040
 because it seems to be better 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:15.030
 the bitrate you can change it up to 30 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:18.720
 but according to the framerate I put 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.910
 at 30 fps if they didn't want more than 40 more 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.200
 of fifty maximum that are 60 own 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.030
 so record the screen go 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.160
 very good 30 going forward we have 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.220
 the audio that you can set from where it can 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.230
 so be silent so no audio 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.330
 microphone from the telephone microphone 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.560
 internal ie record audio from 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.840
 applications practically what goes 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.060
 indoors without the microphone on 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.770
 notification iphone which should disappear 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.780
 this when we record show touch 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.490
 practically as you see I am not yes 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.990
 he sees more than the first ball he can 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.730
 see top I delude site to leave it 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.200
 per second registered yes you understand yes 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.780
 understands well where you go to click 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.690
 output direkt and where you want that 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.760
 Finish the video stop on screen of 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.980
 practically when you turn it off 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.690
 the screen turns off the records 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.380
 registration we try immediately do the 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.640
 registration 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.760
 here if you want to exit the application 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.830
 as you can see the icon has disappeared 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.180
 if we want to make it reappear it's better 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.350
 that he left because it tells me what 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.090
 is happening 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.820
 let's stop here it started as you see ha 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.680
 done starting and then recording in 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.540
 this moment is recording you will notice 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.600
 maybe a performance drop obviously 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.410
 not on the former 5 maybe even on less devices 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.380
 powerful 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.030
 will be a decline in performance and suffered sta 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.010
 recording if we want to stop 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.890
 we press here stopped and lights says 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.019
 fitting in save to be tells us everything here 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.700
 let's try to exit so it remains the 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.950
 notification to go see the video 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.739
 directly as you see at high 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.769
 resolution seems to seem real 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.150
 screen and you see that enough fluid 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.590
 we can record the games in 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.390
 this way and will register without 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.100
 problems any implication to priest 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:54.180
 here as you can see if they are not 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:57.030
 also went to record games in 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.840
 this case were were with the calculation 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.019
 here there are two 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.970
 as you can see the quality is absolutely 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.260
 excellent but having said that they were guides 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.030
 fast on how 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.909
 record the screen that could 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.920
 come in handy to many of you and thanks 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:12.920
 remembering me and see you next time
