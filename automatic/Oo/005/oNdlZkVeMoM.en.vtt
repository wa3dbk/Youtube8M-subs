00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.389
 mind all the boys are david or luthi 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.129
 in this new video we are today with a 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.260
 brand new career episode of 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.080
 hacking mastour first match we are against 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.630
 the z alkmaar one of the strongest teams 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.289
 of the Dutch championship therefore immediately a 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.300
 big match 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.150
 we play at our opponents' house 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.580
 that our kim is always in the center 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.980
 of the attack immediately dangerous the 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.930
 home team after a mistake here in the 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.120
 my defender that really sweeps 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.730
 very badly the ball arrives national 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.480
 which brings the number 9 johansson to the goal 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.670
 of the advantage 10 on the chronometer indeed 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.590
 great action of the latter 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.809
 player who scored the goal of one 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.079
 the z alkamar is still dangerous 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.390
 here with a cross from the left arrives 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.309
 but the conclusion that is printed on 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.109
 pole and we risk going below two 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.260
 goal here in kim is very good in his 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.340
 action falls the ball really comes out of 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.310
 very little 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.290
 incredulous our bomber fades so 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.720
 the chance of a draw per second 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.240
 time, however, the conclusion still comes 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.740
 by the z alkmaar that you carry 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.620
 on 2 to 0 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.770
 no game has played 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.940
 great a great game 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.990
 the home team then to the test 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.820
 worry the goalkeeper with this one 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.530
 conclusion can not do anything serves three 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.750
 years evaluation we succeeded for it 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.110
 less to do something than ours 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.700
 mates but we could not bring 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.440
 at home at least one point 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.140
 thus ends 2 to 0 at the match and before 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.210
 Today's game that is not really part 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.030
 well according to me turned on this time 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.830
 we are at home our opponent lvm 2 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.710
 this time, however, we are playing 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.600
 to the Amsterdam arena and this is one 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.550
 fundamental game because we are not 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.070
 I'm doing a great championship 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.990
 however we also have the commitment of the 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.120
 champions league 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.330
 so let's see today's second match 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.030
 we are immediately going to attack with 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.590
 our second minute game hakim 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.050
 conclusion which is however rejected 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.830
 from the extreme defender then this time 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.150
 in second 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.060
 the second action binds by the 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.720
 villain 2 that sees the double miracle from 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:27.489
 part of my extreme defender 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.730
 the first one was very big, the first one was rejected 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.050
 but then the goal ends 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.550
 then with the opposing advantage then 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.570
 still who in this conclusion from 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.459
 out of area 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.910
 is likely to bring the tie on 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.880
 result to 45 the ball of the 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.250
 our bomber prints on the crossbar 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.930
 which thus denies the goal of the draw again 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.820
 kim at the second time it was home to 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.150
 a stopwatch half defense defense 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.350
 in conclusion, however, it must be forgotten 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.370
 very easy for the goalkeeper 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:59.320
 willem ii then with the passage of time 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.230
 look again at those who go to the eightieth 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.850
 minute the conclusion however still the 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.920
 miracle from the goalkeeper does not want 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.350
 absolutely enter this balloon 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.590
 so will end up merchandise unfortunately we went 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.950
 to lose by 1 to 0 at home against one 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.450
 team coming from the series b 0 to 1 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.190
 yet another defeat but also look at the 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.260
 statistics absolutely dominated by 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.520
 Our third match is against us 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:27.790
 lech poznan for the third and last 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.450
 appointment with the first leg of the round of 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.160
 champions 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.500
 I remind you that we played both with 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.380
 the juventus going to lose that with the 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.060
 port that gave us the three points so 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.100
 we are at 3 third game 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.220
 fundamental because lech poznan is 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.570
 really put very well in the standings 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.150
 and he is immediately kim to serve his own 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:49.150
 test companion the walled conclusion 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.830
 by the lech poznan goalkeeper then again 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.190
 who this time with this 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:56.950
 conclusion but still the goalkeeper 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.020
 he is therefore committed to the 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.000
 end of the first time the conclusion 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.090
 arrives in the feet of our bomber that 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.750
 you see it still walling with this shot a 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.730
 round 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.200
 in the second half we cannot do anything 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.210
 see look at him made a caterva of 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.910
 tyria still a wonderful game who is there 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:15.910
 free the goalkeeper, however, para 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.620
 in a very secure grip at 73rd, look 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.489
 a little thing the defender combines with the 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.540
 goalkeeper and the goal comes from a 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.160
 200 had even given him the 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.440
 role that he has crossed and unfortunately 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.180
 we went to lose three pilots of 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.440
 defeats with matches absolutely 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.860
 deserved look you didn't do either 

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.760
 a shot on goal lech poznan and unfortunately 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.020
 let's compromise ours a bit 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.820
 round of champions 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.320
 it was a game absolutely to go to 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.660
 also wins because at home you can't 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.820
 absolutely to end last part of 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:45.820
 today this time it's a big match against 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:49.610
 the fire north to the amsterdam arena to whom 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:52.430
 puts the turbo dribla all e 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.289
 then sacrifice himself with this shot 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.419
 absolutely not center the mirror 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:59.240
 however the initiative of the door is good 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:01.819
 our kim at 29 there is a minute instead 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.639
 he arrives at the fantastic action he brings 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:06.439
 to the goal of 1 to 0 to the 29th on the 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:08.750
 stopwatch this is a masterpiece later 

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:11.090
 having unmarked twice the 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.129
 left to cross leads to advantage 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.900
 our hakim again at the second half 

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:17.840
 this time you need a companion who 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:20.539
 but the very weak conclusion is easy 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.360
 for the goalkeeper then again ours 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:26.120
 very dangerous at 81 82 minutes arrives 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.210
 the penalty kick parried though by zip 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.319
 code here the miracle by 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.909
 file keeper will not end like this 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:33.800
 finally we manage to win with a 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:35.300
 goal also of our fundamental hakim 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.919
