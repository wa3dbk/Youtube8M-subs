these<00:00:47.610> put<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.600> out<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> little<00:00:48.960> bit<00:00:49.140> for

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
protection from shot so i guess the

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.380 
protection from shot so i guess the
design<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.230> special<00:00:52.739> but<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.940> works<00:00:54.180> in

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
design is special but it works in

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.029 
design is special but it works in
protecting<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.050> actually<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.680> know<00:00:55.800> there's
