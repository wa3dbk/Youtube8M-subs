you<00:00:53.489> can<00:00:53.670> see<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.239> revolver<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.559> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
you can see the revolver this is the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.340 
you can see the revolver this is the
nikah<00:00:56.070> 6<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.730> if<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.570> watch<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.960> game<00:00:58.140> play

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
nikah 6 and if you watch the game play

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.900 
nikah 6 and if you watch the game play
you<00:00:58.559> can<00:00:58.710> actually<00:00:58.829> see<00:00:59.039> him<00:00:59.280> fire<00:00:59.670> this

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
you can actually see him fire this

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.240 
you can actually see him fire this
really<00:01:00.449> really<00:01:00.899> quickly<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.949> almost

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
really really quickly it is almost

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.450 
really really quickly it is almost
compared<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.660> Rex<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.199> would<00:01:04.350> say<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.769> I

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
compared to the Rex I would say and I

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.399 
compared to the Rex I would say and I
think<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.030> damage<00:01:06.420> model<00:01:06.780> would<00:01:06.900> be<00:01:07.110> pretty

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
think the damage model would be pretty

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.130 
think the damage model would be pretty
similar<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.070> magnum<00:01:08.580> so<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.090> think<00:01:09.450> with<00:01:10.020> this

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
similar to a magnum so I think with this

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.560 
similar to a magnum so I think with this
revolver<00:01:10.799> if<00:01:10.979> they<00:01:11.340> did<00:01:11.580> not<00:01:11.850> balance<00:01:12.420> it

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
revolver if they did not balance it

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.810 
revolver if they did not balance it
properly<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.170> think<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.770> will<00:01:14.010> probably<00:01:14.400> stand

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
properly I think it will probably stand

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.359 
properly I think it will probably stand
out<00:01:14.970> as<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.180> best<00:01:15.689> revolver<00:01:16.290> out<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.710> all<00:01:16.920> of

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
out as the best revolver out of all of

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.420 
out as the best revolver out of all of
the<00:01:17.759> three<00:01:18.210> other<00:01:18.420> ones<00:01:18.780> next<00:01:19.680> moving<00:01:20.130> on<00:01:20.280> we

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
the three other ones next moving on we

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.330 
the three other ones next moving on we
have<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.970> desert<00:01:21.360> eagle<00:01:21.540> now<00:01:22.290> i<00:01:22.680> believe<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
have the desert eagle now i believe the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.420 
have the desert eagle now i believe the
desert<00:01:23.640> eagle<00:01:23.790> does<00:01:24.240> have<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.750> 9round<00:01:25.619> magazine

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
desert eagle does have a 9round magazine

desert eagle does have a 9round magazine
ended<00:01:27.150> video<00:01:27.450> he<00:01:27.780> actually<00:01:28.020> does<00:01:28.530> not<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:29.070> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
ended video he actually does not do the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.100 
ended video he actually does not do the
tactical<00:01:29.790> reload<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.299> he<00:01:30.479> actually<00:01:30.600> does<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
tactical reload and he actually does the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.499 
tactical reload and he actually does the
full<00:01:31.350> reload<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:31.920> you'll<00:01:32.400> see<00:01:32.700> aight<00:01:32.939> rounded

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
full reload and you'll see aight rounded

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.380 
full reload and you'll see aight rounded
magazine<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.619> meeting<00:01:35.159> that<00:01:35.520> one<00:01:35.820> bullet<00:01:36.180> is

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
magazine so meeting that one bullet is

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.870 
magazine so meeting that one bullet is
already<00:01:36.810> in<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.140> chamber<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.799> if<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.549> did<00:01:38.850> a

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
already in the chamber and if you did a

already in the chamber and if you did a
tactical<00:01:39.479> reload<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:40.020> normally<00:01:40.710> get<00:01:40.920> nine

tactical reload you normally get nine

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.240 
tactical reload you normally get nine
bullets<00:01:41.579> for<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.240> extra<00:01:42.570> bullet<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.770> can

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
bullets for the extra bullet and you can

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.429 
bullets for the extra bullet and you can
see<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.850> video<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.990> desert<00:01:46.320> eagle

see in the video the desert eagle

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.679 
see in the video the desert eagle
actually<00:01:47.040> fires<00:01:47.310> relatively<00:01:48.090> pretty<00:01:48.420> quickly

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
actually fires relatively pretty quickly

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.580 
actually fires relatively pretty quickly
so<00:01:49.049> i<00:01:49.770> don't<00:01:50.310> know<00:01:50.520> why<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.479> how<00:01:52.229> they're

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
so i don't know why and how they're

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.950 
so i don't know why and how they're
going<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.770> bounce<00:01:52.979> d<00:01:53.399> for<00:01:53.670> revolvers<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.479> with

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
going to bounce d for revolvers and with

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
lot of time trying to perfect that then

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.580 
lot of time trying to perfect that then

action sniper rifle at first glance it
almost<00:02:55.410> looks<00:02:55.680> like<00:02:55.770> an<00:02:56.010> assault<00:02:56.340> rifle<00:02:56.400> or

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
almost looks like an assault rifle or

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.570 
almost looks like an assault rifle or
carbine<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:58.380> has<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.590> pretty<00:02:59.100> high<00:02:59.190> rate<00:02:59.370> of

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
carbine and it has a pretty high rate of

carbine and it has a pretty high rate of
fire<00:02:59.700> just<00:03:00.270> from<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.600> clips<00:03:00.900> which<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.320> saw<00:03:01.680> but

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
fire just from the clips which I saw but

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.190 
fire just from the clips which I saw but
we<00:03:02.610> do<00:03:02.790> not<00:03:02.970> know<00:03:03.210> how<00:03:03.450> it<00:03:03.780> will<00:03:03.990> actually

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
we do not know how it will actually

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.400 
we do not know how it will actually
perform<00:03:04.590> until<00:03:05.160> we<00:03:05.850> actually<00:03:06.150> try<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.810> out<00:03:07.080> in

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
perform until we actually try it out in

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.180 
perform until we actually try it out in
game<00:03:07.770> then<00:03:08.670> we<00:03:09.030> have<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.600> Bulldog<00:03:10.190> 762

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190

game then we have the Bulldog 762
assault<00:03:11.790> rifle<00:03:12.150> now<00:03:12.660> just<00:03:13.140> by<00:03:13.260> looking<00:03:13.590> at<00:03:13.680> the

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
assault rifle now just by looking at the

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.740 
assault rifle now just by looking at the
gun<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.370> actually<00:03:14.880> take<00:03:15.180> back<00:03:15.390> what<00:03:15.630> I<00:03:15.660> said

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
gun I actually take back what I said

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.630 
gun I actually take back what I said
yesterday<00:03:16.140> how<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.890> looks<00:03:17.040> like<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.220> bit<00:03:17.430> like<00:03:17.610> a

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
yesterday how it looks like a bit like a

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.270 
yesterday how it looks like a bit like a
star<00:03:18.090> 21<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:18.900> actually<00:03:19.530> right<00:03:19.740> now<00:03:19.890> looks<00:03:20.160> a

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
star 21 and actually right now looks a

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.350 
star 21 and actually right now looks a
lot<00:03:20.700> like<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.420> UTS<00:03:21.930> 15<00:03:22.140> shotgun<00:03:22.920> to<00:03:23.160> me<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.580> we

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
lot like the UTS 15 shotgun to me and we

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.240 
lot like the UTS 15 shotgun to me and we
know<00:03:24.570> this<00:03:24.720> assault<00:03:25.080> rifle<00:03:25.500> will<00:03:26.010> be<00:03:26.220> a

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
know this assault rifle will be a

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.330 
know this assault rifle will be a
competitor<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.360> the<00:03:27.720> scar-h<00:03:28.230> because<00:03:28.920> it<00:03:29.160> does

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
competitor to the scar-h because it does

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.690 
competitor to the scar-h because it does
fire<00:03:29.550> this<00:03:29.700> m62<00:03:30.270> round<00:03:30.600> same<00:03:31.200> as<00:03:31.470> d<00:03:31.740> scar-h<00:03:32.250> and

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
fire this m62 round same as d scar-h and

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.620 
fire this m62 round same as d scar-h and
it'll<00:03:33.360> probably<00:03:33.630> do<00:03:33.990> the<00:03:34.260> 30<00:03:34.560> for<00:03:34.950> 225<00:03:35.880> damage

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
it'll probably do the 30 for 225 damage

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.870 
it'll probably do the 30 for 225 damage
and<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:37.530> might<00:03:37.890> be<00:03:38.040> very<00:03:38.280> different<00:03:38.400> because

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
and it might be very different because

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.870 
and it might be very different because
it<00:03:39.390> is<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.840> bulb<00:03:40.260> up<00:03:40.440> it'll<00:03:40.830> probably<00:03:41.130> have<00:03:41.550> a

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
it is a bulb up it'll probably have a

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.570 
it is a bulb up it'll probably have a
pretty<00:03:41.910> slow<00:03:42.630> reload<00:03:43.140> time<00:03:43.410> but<00:03:43.950> a<00:03:44.190> better

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
pretty slow reload time but a better

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.330 
pretty slow reload time but a better
ability<00:03:44.880> to<00:03:45.330> actually<00:03:45.570> hit<00:03:45.900> far<00:03:46.200> and<00:03:46.440> with<00:03:47.190> the

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
ability to actually hit far and with the

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.610 
ability to actually hit far and with the
scar-h<00:03:47.790> it<00:03:48.060> has<00:03:48.270> a<00:03:48.540> much<00:03:48.780> quicker<00:03:48.959> reload<00:03:49.440> time

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
scar-h it has a much quicker reload time

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.070 
scar-h it has a much quicker reload time
and<00:03:49.890> it<00:03:50.160> is<00:03:50.310> not<00:03:50.489> a<00:03:50.550> bullpup<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:51.239> as<00:03:51.690> i<00:03:51.840> would

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
and it is not a bullpup and as i would

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.160 
and it is not a bullpup and as i would
say<00:03:52.260> probably<00:03:52.709> will<00:03:53.459> become<00:03:53.970> more<00:03:54.450> accurate

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
say probably will become more accurate

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.250 
say probably will become more accurate
compared<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:55.860> the<00:03:56.010> bulldog<00:03:56.870> next<00:03:57.870> we<00:03:58.050> have<00:03:58.200> the

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
compared to the bulldog next we have the

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.610 
compared to the bulldog next we have the
SI<00:03:58.770> GMP<00:03:59.489> X<00:03:59.700> now<00:04:00.209> this<00:04:00.239> is<00:04:00.630> the<00:04:00.660> PDW<00:04:01.290> which<00:04:01.470> I

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
SI GMP X now this is the PDW which I

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.430 
SI GMP X now this is the PDW which I
said<00:04:01.680> looked<00:04:02.100> a<00:04:02.220> lot<00:04:02.459> like<00:04:02.520> the<00:04:02.850> mp5k<00:04:03.330> and<00:04:03.900> I

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
said looked a lot like the mp5k and I

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.440 
said looked a lot like the mp5k and I
thought<00:04:04.800> it<00:04:05.010> will<00:04:05.100> perform<00:04:05.520> like<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.850> m5<00:04:06.180> k

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
thought it will perform like the m5 k

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.350 
thought it will perform like the m5 k
from<00:04:06.720> battlefield<00:04:07.170> 3<00:04:07.410> well<00:04:07.920> I<00:04:08.070> was<00:04:08.400> wrong<00:04:08.430> so<00:04:09.090> I

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
from battlefield 3 well I was wrong so I

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.060 
from battlefield 3 well I was wrong so I
don't<00:04:09.720> know<00:04:09.900> how<00:04:10.110> this<00:04:10.320> gun<00:04:10.530> will<00:04:10.739> actually

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
don't know how this gun will actually

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.340 
don't know how this gun will actually
perform<00:04:11.310> until<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:12.239> stats<00:04:12.480> out<00:04:12.720> but<00:04:12.959> for<00:04:13.170> now

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
perform until the stats out but for now

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.310 
perform until the stats out but for now
we<00:04:13.830> do<00:04:14.040> know<00:04:14.280> it<00:04:14.550> is<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.360> lower<00:04:15.780> rate<00:04:16.020> of<00:04:16.140> fire

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
we do know it is a lower rate of fire

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.159 
we do know it is a lower rate of fire
compared<00:04:16.830> to<00:04:17.100> the<00:04:17.310> m5<00:04:17.700> k<00:04:17.940> from<00:04:18.330> battlefield<00:04:18.870> 3

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
compared to the m5 k from battlefield 3

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.880 
compared to the m5 k from battlefield 3
and<00:04:19.609> finally<00:04:20.609> we<00:04:20.970> have<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.510> EOD<00:04:22.140> bot<00:04:22.169> with<00:04:22.680> a

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
and finally we have the EOD bot with a

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.950 
and finally we have the EOD bot with a
machine<00:04:23.490> gun<00:04:23.550> mounted<00:04:23.880> on<00:04:24.240> it<00:04:24.419> with<00:04:24.660> some

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
machine gun mounted on it with some

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.450 
machine gun mounted on it with some
grenade<00:04:25.289> launchers<00:04:25.740> now

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
grenade launchers now

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.990 
grenade launchers now
out<00:04:26.550> I<00:04:26.789> do<00:04:27.300> like<00:04:28.199> the<00:04:28.590> design<00:04:28.949> and<00:04:29.370> the<00:04:29.430> way

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
out I do like the design and the way

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.719 
out I do like the design and the way
that<00:04:30.300> dice<00:04:30.630> thought<00:04:30.960> how<00:04:31.259> this<00:04:31.740> might<00:04:32.039> work<00:04:32.280> in

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
that dice thought how this might work in

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.390 
that dice thought how this might work in
the<00:04:32.850> game<00:04:33.060> but<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:33.930> problem<00:04:34.350> right<00:04:34.560> now<00:04:34.620> I<00:04:34.830> can

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
the game but the problem right now I can

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.520 
the game but the problem right now I can
already<00:04:35.550> see<00:04:35.970> it<00:04:36.120> is<00:04:36.419> that<00:04:36.449> this<00:04:37.020> thing<00:04:37.319> might

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
already see it is that this thing might

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.749 
already see it is that this thing might
be<00:04:38.250> overpowered<00:04:39.240> or<00:04:39.419> maybe<00:04:39.900> very<00:04:40.530> annoying<00:04:41.069> it

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:41.759 
be overpowered or maybe very annoying it

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:43.370 
be overpowered or maybe very annoying it
actually<00:04:42.030> has<00:04:42.360> the<00:04:42.389> 40-millimeter<00:04:43.080> grenade

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
actually has the 40-millimeter grenade

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.760 
actually has the 40-millimeter grenade
launcher<00:04:44.039> along<00:04:44.550> with<00:04:45.090> a<00:04:45.360> machine<00:04:45.990> gun<00:04:46.050> which

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
launcher along with a machine gun which

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.659 
launcher along with a machine gun which
doesn't<00:04:47.310> seem<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.880> have<00:04:48.180> a<00:04:48.449> reload<00:04:49.229> now<00:04:49.830> just

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:50.669 
doesn't seem to have a reload now just

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:52.909 
doesn't seem to have a reload now just
by<00:04:50.819> judging<00:04:51.210> this<00:04:51.330> I<00:04:51.539> would<00:04:51.810> say<00:04:52.020> it<00:04:52.229> is<00:04:52.259> very

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
by judging this I would say it is very

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.670 
by judging this I would say it is very
easily<00:04:53.400> spammable<00:04:54.240> unless<00:04:54.990> they<00:04:55.349> do<00:04:55.410> not

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
easily spammable unless they do not

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.279 
easily spammable unless they do not
allow<00:04:55.889> players<00:04:56.460> to<00:04:56.639> replenish<00:04:57.270> these<00:04:57.690> Zod

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
allow players to replenish these Zod

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.159 
allow players to replenish these Zod
bots<00:04:58.560> and<00:04:58.800> you<00:04:59.460> can<00:04:59.580> only<00:04:59.729> get<00:05:00.000> one<00:05:00.270> every<00:05:00.539> time

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
bots and you can only get one every time

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.379 
bots and you can only get one every time
you<00:05:01.440> spawn<00:05:01.770> and<00:05:02.039> just<00:05:02.729> by<00:05:02.880> looking<00:05:03.180> at<00:05:03.240> the

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:03.389 
you spawn and just by looking at the

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:07.580 
you spawn and just by looking at the
video<00:05:03.630> i<00:05:03.840> believe<00:05:04.380> it<00:05:04.680> has<00:05:05.160> the<00:05:05.840> m240<00:05:06.840> Bravo<00:05:07.229> on

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
video i believe it has the m240 Bravo on

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.820 
video i believe it has the m240 Bravo on
top<00:05:08.310> of<00:05:08.520> it<00:05:08.639> as<00:05:08.820> the<00:05:09.120> lmg<00:05:09.720> and<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.530> grenade

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
top of it as the lmg and the grenade

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.070 
top of it as the lmg and the grenade
launchers<00:05:11.190> are<00:05:11.490> semi-automatic<00:05:11.970> and<00:05:12.750> it

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
launchers are semi-automatic and it

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.980 
launchers are semi-automatic and it
could<00:05:13.380> get<00:05:13.590> very<00:05:13.650> annoying<00:05:14.370> at<00:05:14.759> times<00:05:14.789> and<00:05:15.449> I

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:15.990 
could get very annoying at times and I

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.110 
could get very annoying at times and I
just<00:05:16.169> really<00:05:16.470> hope<00:05:16.800> dies<00:05:17.099> will<00:05:17.550> properly

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
just really hope dies will properly

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.080 
just really hope dies will properly
bounce<00:05:18.539> this<00:05:18.780> or<00:05:18.990> else<00:05:19.229> it<00:05:19.590> will<00:05:20.130> become<00:05:20.580> a<00:05:20.759> big

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
bounce this or else it will become a big

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.020 
bounce this or else it will become a big

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.529 
check out the video yourself and see how
these<00:05:33.900> guns<00:05:34.409> will<00:05:34.919> perform<00:05:35.400> yourself<00:05:35.820> these

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
these guns will perform yourself these

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:38.570 
these guns will perform yourself these
sounds<00:05:37.020> are<00:05:37.199> actually<00:05:37.740> placeholders<00:05:38.340> right

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
sounds are actually placeholders right

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.610 
sounds are actually placeholders right
now<00:05:38.759> so<00:05:39.090> if<00:05:39.360> you're<00:05:39.570> in<00:05:39.780> watching<00:05:40.259> the<00:05:40.349> video

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
now so if you're in watching the video

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.339 
now so if you're in watching the video
and<00:05:40.830> they<00:05:41.550> kind<00:05:41.849> of<00:05:41.940> sound<00:05:42.210> like<00:05:42.389> old<00:05:42.810> guns

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
and they kind of sound like old guns

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:46.040 
and they kind of sound like old guns
which<00:05:43.830> are<00:05:44.039> in<00:05:44.340> the<00:05:44.430> game<00:05:44.610> already<00:05:44.820> so<00:05:45.630> I'm

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
which are in the game already so I'm

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.800 
which are in the game already so I'm
sure<00:05:46.440> when<00:05:46.770> the<00:05:46.889> DLC<00:05:47.280> actually<00:05:47.699> releases<00:05:48.300> they

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810
