00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.080
 young people who went out for two 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.449
 hours 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.480
 little voice about two o'clock in a 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.650
 well supplied wood so there i'm just at 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.940
 side of a small asphalt road and I 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.380
 am not very far from the house of my 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.420
 parents 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.010
 and then after a big half-hour 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.340
 Well here are two finds 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:47.010
 we have a group find and it's more 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.079
 we're going to say a purse and so I do not 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.950
 do not know what like as a piece 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.920
 worn but it does not matter 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.640
 so the first there and then all of 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.079
 following there behind 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:02.129
 like what is always insisted a 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.660
 second here are two currencies we will see 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.070
 if there is no other beside 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.590
 I'm just bordering 1 got a little 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.400
 polluted but good I will gently thou 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.000
 meaning you can not do otherwise and 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.689
 let's clear it up 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.250
 So here two currencies hit on 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.180
 stroke 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.049
 these are small grants and at least 2 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.799
 will see if there is something else 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.799
 right away 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:34.189
 new find good 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:37.020
 not much for now but good 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.460
 strewn with small rubbish here and there 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.659
 then trying a new find 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.020

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.250
 I'm still typing it and then 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:02.640
 no actually it's a piece of 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:06.240
 oak so it's a piece of oak from 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.890
 montrabe where so it was there he was hanging 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.209
 the watch so having only one you still 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.670
 maybe who on one side I have to 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:19.890

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.110
 peep-toe I clearly it was a 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.150
 key we may be so-called 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.620
 army bartering where I doubt anyway or 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:53.580

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.580
 to pierce the leather I do not know 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.510

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.270
 road in pollution 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.040
 why do we have to attend and then 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.180
 the more it is one that I have done enough 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.100
 unique is not common 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:42.730

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:48.160
 little crs 50 cents crs I do not know 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:51.640
 if they would seal clean if she 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.090
 is merlier fund last well worn but 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.140

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:05.080
 a beautiful picture here is a small 50 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.430

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.670

 so and then again they are there so 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.250
