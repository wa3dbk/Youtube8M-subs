00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:15.219
 That 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.279
 we are back with earth sun to show another example of alternatives 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.140
 energy you've already 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.140
 reports showing for example the sister in the city 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.919
 which is the provision of rainwater 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:29.670
 will you follow 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.210
 another alternative to power generation that energy 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.060
 wind 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.280
 our team was in the municipality of osório 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.280
 accompanying a wind power generation system 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.109
 the energy of the winds 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:49.109
 is a constant source of renewable energy 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.640
 available everywhere 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.620
 the use of this energy source 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.450
 for electricity generation on a commercial scale began a little bit 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.220
 more than 30 years 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.160
 in the early 70's 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.240
 with the world oil crisis 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.210
 there was great interest from European countries and the United States 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.520
 to develop equipment for the production of electricity that would help 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.520
 to reduce dependence on coal oil 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.050
 in Brazil 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.660
 although the exploitation of wind resources 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.850
 has traditionally been done with the use of motivational windsurfing 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.600
 for pumping water 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.930
 some precise event measurements 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.990
 recently held in various parts of the national territory 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.080
 indicate the existence of a huge untapped wind potential 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.970
 the states of ceará and pernambuco 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.970
 initiated data collection programs 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.620
 given the importance of characterizing the region's wind resources 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.520
 northeast 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.939
 the Brazilian wind energy center 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.030
 cbf with the support of the national electric energy agency the real 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.440
 and the Ministry of Science and Technology launched in 1998 the first 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.059
 version of itunes I there with the brazil 

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:14.249
 with the main objective of developing atmospheric models to analyze the 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:15.129
 events 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.789
 and develop reliable wind maps 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:20.609
 for the rest of the regions of Brazil 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:21.770
 the great river of the south 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.539
 is inside the project 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:27.249
 in the municipality of osório about 95 kilometers from porto alegre 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:32.260
 there are located the osorio wind farms which will 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.309
 quintuple the wind energy currently produced in Brazil 

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:38.329
 then we complex 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.030
 owner of the osório wind farm is composed of three parts 

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:45.249
 of 25 generators each 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:49.759
 in the current stage is that in the other two parks in operation with 50 minors 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.489
 installed power 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.409
 the generation is roasting 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:57.159
 as expected 

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.379
 the excellent ibge performance 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.689
 energy 

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:03.909
 using cutting-edge technology 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.749
 this venture will be able to generate 150 megawatts of energy 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.040
 sufficient quantity 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.920
 to supply about two-thirds of the residential consumption of porto alegre 

00:03:14.779 --> 00:03:18.599
 according to the manager are being built to last 50 years 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:23.149
 and are bringing to the state and country what is most advanced in 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:25.229
 wind energy 

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:28.839
 relations and wind power in the country and the United 

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:33.339
 to 6% of energy 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:35.129
 consumed from the rio grande do sul 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:36.829
 the power 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.829
 of each machine is 2 megawatts 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:42.439
 and I was currently sleepy 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:45.669
 they brought 2070 2050 

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:49.859
 with 1 91m and maldini 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.489
 two urns that the insurance 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.839
 plantation was the ninth 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:57.579
 executed in the schedule we expect until the end of this year 

00:03:58.309 --> 00:04:00.959
 is to have completed third park 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.339
 which is the theoretical playground of the Indians totaling 170 megawatts of 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:08.149
 energy 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:10.269
 the osorio city parks 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.469
 which are watering the crying and Indians generated it a clean energy and 

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:17.079
 renewable 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.190
 these parks 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.509
 are in compliance with Brazilian environmental legislation 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:25.930
 valuing preserving the socio-cultural aspects of the osorio region 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:31.219
 because they are installed in rural properties the coexistence with the 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:34.219
 owners is quiet 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.460
 ten villages sometimes wind is the course works of implantation in the 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.690
 this wind farm we are not only with 18 months of implantation 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.979
 we already have a power of 100 better says that if it were compared with the year 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.849
 medid the deployment time would be higher 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:56.180
 and at the same time or if there would have been 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.589
 the water reservoir and here you can see here 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:05.339
 was the environmental impact is rather small henrique 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:08.409
 the properties 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:10.819
 would be yours 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:15.379
 normal life who plants plant is who has cattle trainer 

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:18.379
 this environmental impact and interface with the 

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:21.439
 is greatly reduced 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:22.319
 proof of that 

00:05:22.319 --> 00:05:23.870
 He is the barcelos producer. 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.110
 and has some towers within the property where livestock is kept and 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.250
 partnership with the climatic climate embrapa in the project chameleons 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:38.840
 the installation of the wind farm is that she did not think the mind did not include 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.969
 nothing in raising cattle or 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.360
 in the plantation too 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:48.479
 livestock is going to be registered last year returned to the 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.120
 laboratory is done 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.259
 inside 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:52.860
 normal standards do not 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.150
 did not interfere 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:55.520
 absolutely nothing 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.520
 I do not think it's accompanied by the father. 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:00.250
 let's see now 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.250
 some technical data on wind energy 

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:10.579
 the parks will have 75 towers 98 meters high each 

00:06:11.099 --> 00:06:14.960
 I feel that with propellers that can reach 140 meters in height 

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:18.839
 each of these towers that 810 tons 

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.529
 will be the first park and latin america 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:25.180
 Concrete kings tightening 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.180
 which will produce 2 megawatts of energy each 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:33.079
 the wind turbines are 40 tons 

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:38.830
 the foundations meets 20-30 feet deep 

00:06:41.499 --> 00:06:43.220
 the troops of the aerogenerator 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.220
 measure up to about 35 meters in radius 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:52.849
 a substation is being built within the parks of a line of 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:58.419
 transmission of approximately 230 kilowatts with approximately 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:06:59.620
 send the energy 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.759
 the osório substation 2 of the sierra 

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:04.090
 wind power 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:07.190
 contributes to the diversification of the Brazilian energy matrix 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:11.469
 with a source of renewable resources without hydrological risk 

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:13.990
 and is a clean energy 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.460
 which reduces the emission of pollutants 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.879
 which cause the greenhouse effect 

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:22.770
 showing the wind potential 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.120
 of the southern river of the south we will have for sure 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.229
 more wind farms rs 

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:31.949
 speak with pity sursis function 

00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:34.949
 to be a pioneer party in this way said 

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:41.830
 the mine owner 

00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:47.659
 this is a proof that the alternatives exist the artist 

00:07:47.659 --> 00:07:52.009
 and the population itself to take and do their part in this 

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:53.649
 story the next block 

00:07:53.649 --> 00:07:56.439
 whether it will accompany the hydroponic production system 

00:07:56.439 --> 00:08:00.059
 and also accompanied the grape jelly recipe is a liar
