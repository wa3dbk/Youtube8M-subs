00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.250
 hello this is gamegame.ru Vasily Karerov 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:23.029
 and I just left the presentation 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.640
 anno 2205 in its new round series 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.779
 went further the future regarding anno 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.019
 2070 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:33.470
 well and in wider and very much swelled to us 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:37.940
 on e3 showed only one zone on earth 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:41.120
 it was such typical forest zones and 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.370
 fields here and one zone on the moon 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.739
 here at games the fireplace showed the third 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.239
 zone this zone in the arctic where the eternal 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.199
 frost and snow 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:54.800
 and in general it was very cold 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.230
 quite scale in terms of development on 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.699
 your settlement or state before 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.320
 it was just one card now it 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.390
 several regions connected between 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.269
 by yourself and by trade routes that is you 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.630
 you can jump between them 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.600
 there on the moon to land there in the arctic and so 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.580
 further it is very similar to the last 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.380
 simcity where there were several cities like 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:21.799
 agglomeration such and on each zone 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:25.280
 some their own task structure their 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:27.170
 complexity that is if on earth for example 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.060
 well, the usual we just need to 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.759
 develop your city and try so 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.820
 so that all residents are satisfied then 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:37.130
 Arctic areas need to extract heat and 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.960
 to build a residential area just in front 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.899
 such normal power plants to 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.549
 the scientists did not freeze us on the moon 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.520
 need to reflect 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.610
 meteor fall some rain well 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.369
 generally protect their settlers very 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.590
 such an aggressive zone plus separately 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.020
 there were combat missions that is to 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.570
 urban planning locations we have no battles 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.240
 happens there are separate missions where we are 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.409
 manage only combat units and we 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.780
 there is some definite task 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:08.630
 which must be done for it give 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.789
 very many good and unique 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.400
 resources so do them all the same 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.989
 well, and in general the game looks very 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.440
 beautiful every ozone is really 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:21.680
 looks different from there 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.810
 these are all working in their little factory 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.670
 here and cars walking people over there 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.040
 then somehow moves moves in general 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.170
 a lot of details are very beautiful and i 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.290
 I think that all lovers of such here 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.150
 anno 2205 peace strategies worth the wait 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.680
 because the settlers and whom in the past 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.480
 year we were shown this time not 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.959
 brought and generally it is not clear what happened to them 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.549
 happens in general on this it was all 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.549
 specifically for stopgame.ru
