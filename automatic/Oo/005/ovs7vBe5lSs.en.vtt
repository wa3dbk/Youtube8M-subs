00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
last year because I have another year

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.580 
last year because I have another year
ago<00:00:36.800> and<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.730> focusing<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.469> staying<00:00:40.469> as

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
ago and I just focusing on staying as

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.049 
ago and I just focusing on staying as
close<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.890> four<00:00:41.070> flat<00:00:41.280> pays<00:00:41.460> as<00:00:41.579> I<00:00:41.670> could

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
close to four flat pays as I could

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.970 
close to four flat pays as I could
I<00:00:42.090> noticed<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.020> third<00:00:43.260> lap<00:00:43.469> when<00:00:43.860> then

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
I noticed in the third lap when then

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.639 
I noticed in the third lap when then
rabbit<00:00:44.430> left<00:00:44.750> just<00:00:45.750> explode<00:00:46.079> up<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.289> little<00:00:46.440> bit

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
rabbit left just explode up a little bit

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.830 
rabbit left just explode up a little bit
and<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.010> think<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.399> screwed<00:00:48.390> up<00:00:48.480> our<00:00:48.629> pace<00:00:48.809> a

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
and I think that screwed up our pace a

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.479 
and I think that screwed up our pace a
little<00:00:48.960> bit<00:00:49.170> cuz<00:00:49.379> no<00:00:49.469> one<00:00:49.500> reacted<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.100> it

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
little bit cuz no one reacted to it

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.950 
little bit cuz no one reacted to it
and<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:50.969> was<00:00:51.090> paying<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.449> inside<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:51.930> I

and I was paying on the inside so I

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.510 
and I was paying on the inside so I
didn't<00:00:52.140> really<00:00:52.230> have<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.410> chance<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.920> yeah

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
didn't really have a chance to yeah

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.670 
didn't really have a chance to yeah
second<00:00:53.969> suit<00:00:54.120> second<00:00:54.870> lap<00:00:54.989> was<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> little<00:00:55.440> slow

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
second suit second lap was a little slow

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.029 
second suit second lap was a little slow

little<00:01:03.840> while<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.110> react<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.650> couldn't<00:01:05.070> really

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
little while to react I couldn't really

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.260 
little while to react I couldn't really
do<00:01:05.280> anything<00:01:05.460> about<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.790> because<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.150> was

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
do anything about it because I was

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.940 
do anything about it because I was
pinned<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.600> inside<00:01:06.900> rail<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:07.409> mean<00:01:07.860> I

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
pinned on the inside rail I mean I

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.500 
pinned on the inside rail I mean I
wanted<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.310> go<00:01:08.430> around<00:01:08.640> but<00:01:08.880> I<00:01:09.150> could<00:01:09.360> just

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
wanted to go around but I could just

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.330 
wanted to go around but I could just
push<00:01:09.630> everybody<00:01:09.869> all<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.049> way<00:01:10.140> so<00:01:10.260> I<00:01:10.500> had<00:01:11.189> to

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
push everybody all the way so I had to

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.520 
push everybody all the way so I had to
just<00:01:11.460> wait<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.820> let<00:01:12.180> everybody<00:01:12.360> else<00:01:12.530> react

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
just wait and let everybody else react

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.330 
just wait and let everybody else react
to<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:14.689> think<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.840> might<00:01:16.080> have

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
to it and I think that might have

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.870 
to it and I think that might have
hindered<00:01:17.340> our<00:01:17.520> time<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> little<00:01:18.150> bit<00:01:18.920> and<00:01:19.920> maybe

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
hindered our time a little bit and maybe

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.760 
hindered our time a little bit and maybe
that<00:01:21.090> two<00:01:21.240> or<00:01:21.390> three<00:01:22.140> three<00:01:22.290> seconds<00:01:22.619> maybe

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
that two or three three seconds maybe

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.420 
that two or three three seconds maybe
even<00:01:23.729> before<00:01:23.850> my<00:01:24.750> goal<00:01:24.900> coming<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.290> was<00:01:25.470> around

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
even before my goal coming in was around

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.230 
even before my goal coming in was around
four<00:01:26.670> five<00:01:26.850> days<00:01:27.000> as<00:01:27.150> long<00:01:27.270> as<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.479> could<00:01:28.070> but

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
I'm doing a pretty good job of that and

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.060 
I'm doing a pretty good job of that and
then<00:01:55.640> some<00:01:56.640> other<00:01:56.790> guy<00:01:56.820> came<00:01:57.210> up<00:01:57.799> in<00:01:58.799> front<00:01:59.009> of

about<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.259> last<00:02:01.680> turn<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.189> saw<00:02:02.729> him<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:02.939> Toya

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
about the last turn I saw him on Toya

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.820 
about the last turn I saw him on Toya
passing<00:02:04.320> on<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.439> outside<00:02:04.740> and

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
passing on the outside and

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.620 
passing on the outside and
I<00:02:05.920> just<00:02:06.460> went<00:02:06.640> with<00:02:06.700> him<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.240> looked<00:02:07.480> like<00:02:07.570> I

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
I just went with him and looked like I

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.840 
I just went with him and looked like I
got<00:02:07.750> around<00:02:07.930> Brandon<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:08.650> the<00:02:08.710> other<00:02:08.830> guy<00:02:08.950> you

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
got around Brandon and the other guy you

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.940 
got around Brandon and the other guy you
got<00:02:09.970> the<00:02:10.060> second<00:02:10.390> I<00:02:10.570> think<00:02:11.530> if<00:02:11.590> I<00:02:11.650> could<00:02:11.710> do<00:02:11.860> it

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
got the second I think if I could do it

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.340 
got the second I think if I could do it
all<00:02:12.040> over<00:02:12.070> again<00:02:12.340> I'd<00:02:12.640> probably<00:02:13.140> start<00:02:14.140> out<00:02:14.290> a

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
all over again I'd probably start out a

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.560 
all over again I'd probably start out a
little<00:02:14.530> bit<00:02:14.710> more<00:02:15.160> aggressively<00:02:15.580> and<00:02:15.700> getting

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
little bit more aggressively and getting

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.540 
little bit more aggressively and getting
the<00:02:16.630> front<00:02:16.840> so<00:02:17.020> I<00:02:17.050> wouldn't<00:02:17.380> get<00:02:18.040> split<00:02:18.310> up<00:02:18.430> in

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
the front so I wouldn't get split up in

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.430 
the front so I wouldn't get split up in
the<00:02:18.580> first<00:02:18.790> part<00:02:18.940> of<00:02:19.000> the<00:02:19.090> race<00:02:19.180> yeah<00:02:19.570> it<00:02:20.110> was<00:02:20.410> a

the first part of the race yeah it was a

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.810 
the first part of the race yeah it was a
good<00:02:20.530> race<00:02:20.710> and<00:02:20.770> yeah<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.520> there's<00:02:21.670> new
