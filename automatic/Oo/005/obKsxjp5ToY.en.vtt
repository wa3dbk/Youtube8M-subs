00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello friends and youtube subscribers in 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.910
 this tutorial we will learn to elaborate a 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.960
 bat 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.809
 in this way well let's see how it 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.260
 made to elaborate this bat what 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.520
 What we need is a square of paper 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.520
 first we will turn on the diagonal 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.939
 and then we will take this tip 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.939
 with this tip 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.250
 but we will double only 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:36.010
 we will mark pressing this corner as 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.540
 we can see we have the brand and what 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.540
 we will do is take this tip 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.220
 more or less 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.370
 taking out this piece 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.010
 we push 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.910
 and again we go back 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.910
 tip 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.460
 approximately half of this 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.460
 space 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:06.070
 well and finally we will double again 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.060
 the tip inwards flush 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.060
 of this doubles 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.780
 this way well below 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.630
 we will double where our 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.630
 triangle to our half mark 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:39.750
 thus 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:43.130
 and we'll take this fold to this doubles 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.130
 folding in half 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.790
 and we press this fold with this double 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.790
 A) Yes 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.820
 getting this figure below 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.270
 we will double this point taking it to 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.270
 center 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.250
 in this way and again we will double it 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.250
 in half 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:27.380
 A) Yes 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.380
 finally we will fold it back 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.550
 thus 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.550
 and we unfolded 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:44.120
 we will perform the same procedures 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:47.480
 on the other side once the other one has been folded 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.599
 we will get a figure like this 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.810
 and then what we will do 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:55.739
 bend one of the corners 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.739
 above 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:05.460
 well and we will double it again 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:08.760
 down and we unfolded a little to 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.800
 to pretend their teeth and by the 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.570
 part of bottom we bend a bit the tip 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.000
 in and we unfold well and we 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.590
 finished 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.569
 our bat 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.129
 good friends this has been everything I hope
