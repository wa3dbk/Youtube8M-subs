00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.500 
are have kind of a low flow design the
architects<00:01:07.740> designed<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.820> building<00:01:08.880> and

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
architects designed this building and

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.640 
architects designed this building and
they<00:01:09.780> utilize<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.590> rooftop<00:01:11.100> real<00:01:11.850> estate<00:01:12.240> and

they utilize the rooftop real estate and

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.249 
they utilize the rooftop real estate and
created<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.799> beautiful<00:01:14.840> angled<00:01:15.840> wing

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
created this beautiful angled wing

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.620 
created this beautiful angled wing
feature<00:01:16.860> on<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.310> top<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.180> structure

Finney's of the building the building is

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.840 
Finney's of the building the building is
so<00:01:33.869> gives<00:01:34.200> us<00:01:34.380> an<00:01:34.619> opportunity<00:01:34.850> from

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
so gives us an opportunity from

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.080 
so gives us an opportunity from
engineering<00:01:36.360> point<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.840> view<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:38.729> study

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
engineering point of view that to study

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.170 
engineering point of view that to study
how<00:01:39.509> we<00:01:39.570> can<00:01:39.869> improve<00:01:40.250> future<00:01:41.250> buildings<00:01:41.939> is

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
how we can improve future buildings is

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.149 
how we can improve future buildings is
there<00:01:42.810> anything<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.259> we<00:01:43.560> could<00:01:43.710> do<00:01:43.920> to

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
there anything that we could do to

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.020 
there anything that we could do to
reduce<00:01:45.060> energy<00:01:45.540> consumption<00:01:46.250> so<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:47.610> kind

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
reduce energy consumption so it's kind

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.460 
reduce energy consumption so it's kind
of<00:01:48.119> really<00:01:48.390> important<00:01:48.960> especially<00:01:49.079> for

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
of really important especially for

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.460 
of really important especially for
California<00:01:50.250> water<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> way<00:01:52.439> of

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
California water it is a way of

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.980 
California water it is a way of
improving<00:01:52.829> what

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
improving what

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.319 
improving what
consumption<00:01:54.890> so<00:01:55.640> that's<00:01:55.939> the<00:01:56.000> other<00:01:56.180> thing

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
consumption so that's the other thing

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.230 
consumption so that's the other thing
maybe<00:01:56.750> we'll<00:01:57.049> be<00:01:57.200> studying<00:01:57.470> a<00:01:57.740> little<00:01:58.040> bit

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
maybe we'll be studying a little bit

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.819 
maybe we'll be studying a little bit
sustainability<00:01:59.240> just<00:01:59.659> isn't<00:02:00.020> about<00:02:00.259> building

systems and the form of the building

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.460 
systems and the form of the building
it's<00:02:04.070> about<00:02:04.430> the<00:02:04.970> comfort<00:02:05.479> of<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.780> users<00:02:06.200> in
