quite glossing its textured because of

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.450 
quite glossing its textured because of
the<00:04:27.599> printing<00:04:28.169> it<00:04:28.380> actually<00:04:28.830> reminds<00:04:29.280> me<00:04:29.370> of

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
the printing it actually reminds me of

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.029 
the printing it actually reminds me of
the<00:04:29.580> feel<00:04:30.060> of<00:04:30.090> a<00:04:30.449> coat<00:04:30.720> of<00:04:30.960> thick<00:04:31.289> paint<00:04:31.680> on<00:04:31.979> a

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
the feel of a coat of thick paint on a

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.610 
the feel of a coat of thick paint on a
smooth<00:04:32.729> surface<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.780> shuffle<00:04:34.199> feel<00:04:34.440> is

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
smooth surface the shuffle feel is

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.710 
smooth surface the shuffle feel is
better<00:04:34.830> than<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:35.220> vast<00:04:35.490> majority<00:04:35.789> of<00:04:36.180> sleeves

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
better than the vast majority of sleeves

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.899 
better than the vast majority of sleeves
I've<00:04:37.080> reviewed<00:04:37.560> they<00:04:37.919> hold<00:04:38.159> up<00:04:38.340> fairly<00:04:38.729> well

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:38.909 
I've reviewed they hold up fairly well

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:41.689 
I've reviewed they hold up fairly well
too<00:04:39.389> I<00:04:39.659> did<00:04:39.990> rather<00:04:40.229> strenuous<00:04:40.979> testing<00:04:41.550> on

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
too I did rather strenuous testing on

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.210 
too I did rather strenuous testing on
these<00:04:41.849> uncovered<00:04:42.840> and<00:04:42.990> I<00:04:43.260> never<00:04:43.650> had<00:04:43.949> one

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
these uncovered and I never had one

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.640 
these uncovered and I never had one
split<00:04:44.729> on<00:04:44.909> me<00:04:45.090> with<00:04:45.389> the<00:04:45.570> stretch<00:04:45.900> test<00:04:46.349> it

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
split on me with the stretch test it

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.589 
split on me with the stretch test it
takes<00:04:46.889> a<00:04:47.039> fair<00:04:47.250> amount<00:04:47.280> of<00:04:47.669> force<00:04:47.970> to<00:04:48.270> get<00:04:48.449> it

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
takes a fair amount of force to get it

00:04:48.599 --> 00:05:10.790 
takes a fair amount of force to get it
to<00:04:48.750> split

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.620 

look<00:05:11.800> you<00:05:12.040> can<00:05:12.220> see<00:05:12.400> how<00:05:12.550> hard<00:05:12.850> I<00:05:13.060> had<00:05:13.210> to<00:05:13.240> pull

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
look you can see how hard I had to pull

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.990 
look you can see how hard I had to pull
based<00:05:13.900> on<00:05:14.140> how<00:05:14.320> much<00:05:14.530> I<00:05:14.740> warped<00:05:15.220> the<00:05:15.490> plastic

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
based on how much I warped the plastic

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.440 
based on how much I warped the plastic
with<00:05:16.150> my<00:05:16.360> finger

the problem with uncovered inked play

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.200 
the problem with uncovered inked play
mats<00:05:25.240> custom<00:05:25.930> sleeves<00:05:26.440> lies<00:05:27.250> in<00:05:27.700> the<00:05:27.820> way<00:05:27.970> they

break off without the covers but again
not<00:05:33.910> severely<00:05:34.630> so<00:05:35.110> I<00:05:35.350> did<00:05:35.650> rather<00:05:35.890> strenuous

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
not severely so I did rather strenuous

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.090 
not severely so I did rather strenuous
testing<00:05:37.360> with<00:05:37.540> these<00:05:37.750> uncovered<00:05:38.590> and<00:05:38.800> here's

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
testing with these uncovered and here's

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.700 
testing with these uncovered and here's
some<00:05:39.400> of<00:05:39.520> the<00:05:39.670> results<00:05:40.180> scratches<00:05:41.110> and<00:05:41.290> scuffs

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
some of the results scratches and scuffs

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.890 
some of the results scratches and scuffs
don't<00:05:42.130> always<00:05:42.280> get<00:05:42.610> captured<00:05:42.910> on<00:05:43.300> camera<00:05:43.750> as

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
don't always get captured on camera as

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.170 
don't always get captured on camera as
easily<00:05:44.260> but<00:05:44.710> you<00:05:44.860> can<00:05:45.040> definitely<00:05:45.250> see<00:05:45.970> where

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
easily but you can definitely see where

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.390 
easily but you can definitely see where
the<00:05:46.270> printing<00:05:46.810> has<00:05:46.960> literally<00:05:47.380> just<00:05:47.620> flaked

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
the printing has literally just flaked

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.760 
the printing has literally just flaked
off<00:05:48.730> here's<00:05:49.630> how<00:05:49.810> long<00:05:50.050> it<00:05:50.260> takes<00:05:50.500> me<00:05:50.620> to

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
off here's how long it takes me to

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.740 
off here's how long it takes me to
scratch<00:05:51.220> off<00:05:51.520> some<00:05:51.820> of<00:05:51.850> the<00:05:52.090> art<00:05:52.330> with<00:05:52.570> my

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
scratch off some of the art with my

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.900 
scratch off some of the art with my
fingernail<00:05:53.410> so<00:05:53.800> I<00:05:54.100> hope<00:05:54.340> this<00:05:54.520> gives<00:05:54.700> you<00:05:54.850> a

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
fingernail so I hope this gives you a

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.550 
fingernail so I hope this gives you a
good<00:05:55.180> idea<00:05:55.210> about<00:05:55.570> what's<00:05:55.900> going<00:05:56.140> to<00:05:56.200> happen

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
good idea about what's going to happen

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.800 
good idea about what's going to happen
to<00:05:56.650> your<00:05:56.740> sleeves<00:05:57.190> if<00:05:57.640> you<00:05:57.700> use<00:05:58.210> them<00:05:58.510> without

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:06.730 
get scuffed and some of the artwork will

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.570 
get scuffed and some of the artwork will
definitely<00:06:07.600> scratch<00:06:07.960> off<00:06:08.260> over<00:06:08.620> time<00:06:08.860> and<00:06:09.250> not

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:09.580 
definitely scratch off over time and not

definitely scratch off over time and not

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:11.860 
too much time given how expensive these

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.910 
too much time given how expensive these
are<00:06:12.160> I<00:06:12.400> wouldn't<00:06:13.150> play<00:06:13.510> with<00:06:13.750> them<00:06:13.930> uncovered

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:14.920 
are I wouldn't play with them uncovered

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.490 
are I wouldn't play with them uncovered
but<00:06:15.130> that's<00:06:15.370> me<00:06:15.790> you<00:06:16.330> might<00:06:16.540> not<00:06:16.690> mind<00:06:17.050> as<00:06:17.290> much

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
but that's me you might not mind as much

but that's me you might not mind as much
final<00:06:18.370> grades<00:06:18.730> I<00:06:19.150> feel<00:06:19.510> that<00:06:19.690> I<00:06:19.720> need<00:06:19.990> to<00:06:20.140> give

covers<00:06:43.120> I<00:06:43.330> just<00:06:43.660> can't<00:06:43.900> give<00:06:44.110> this<00:06:44.320> a<00:06:44.380> grade

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:44.770 
covers I just can't give this a grade

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.130 
covers I just can't give this a grade
higher<00:06:44.800> than<00:06:45.370> a<00:06:45.400> b-plus<00:06:46.000> but<00:06:46.390> again<00:06:46.720> if<00:06:46.990> your

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:47.140 
higher than a b-plus but again if your

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.740 
higher than a b-plus but again if your
personal<00:06:47.710> needs<00:06:48.040> are<00:06:48.370> for<00:06:48.550> artwork<00:06:48.940> and<00:06:49.360> you

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
personal needs are for artwork and you

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.840 
personal needs are for artwork and you
don't<00:06:49.990> care<00:06:50.410> about<00:06:50.620> the<00:06:50.920> shuffle<00:06:51.340> feel<00:06:51.610> of

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:51.850 
don't care about the shuffle feel of

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:54.320 
don't care about the shuffle feel of
sleeve<00:06:52.180> covers<00:06:52.750> then<00:06:53.200> this<00:06:53.530> grade<00:06:53.980> increases

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.330 
sleeve covers then this grade increases

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:57.210 
sleeve covers then this grade increases
for<00:06:55.330> you<00:06:55.510> for<00:06:55.930> the<00:06:56.050> uncovered<00:06:56.590> sleeves<00:06:56.980> I

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 
for you for the uncovered sleeves I

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.190 
for you for the uncovered sleeves I
think<00:06:57.460> the<00:06:57.550> shuffle<00:06:57.940> feel<00:06:58.180> and<00:06:58.390> durability<00:06:58.780> is

00:06:59.190 --> 00:06:59.200 
think the shuffle feel and durability is

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.920 
think the shuffle feel and durability is
still<00:06:59.800> impressive<00:07:00.160> well<00:07:00.970> above<00:07:01.330> average<00:07:01.510> at

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:01.930 
still impressive well above average at

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.350 
still impressive well above average at
