however<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:25.000> alone<00:02:25.480> makes<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.900> game<00:02:26.080> too

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
however that alone makes a game too

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.220 
however that alone makes a game too
simple<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.000> keeps<00:02:28.000> it<00:02:28.180> at<00:02:28.300> a<00:02:28.360> standstill<00:02:28.629> go
