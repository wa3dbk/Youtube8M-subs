time<00:02:13.540> of<00:02:13.690> day<00:02:13.840> passing<00:02:14.320> but<00:02:14.500> also<00:02:14.620> going<00:02:15.310> in

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
time of day passing but also going in

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.130 
time of day passing but also going in
and<00:02:15.670> seeing<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.210> same<00:02:16.360> environments<00:02:16.990> not

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
and seeing the same environments not

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.660 
and seeing the same environments not
just<00:02:17.320> in<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.560> summer<00:02:17.800> but<00:02:18.040> in<00:02:18.070> the<00:02:18.160> winter<00:02:18.250> as

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
just in the summer but in the winter as

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.460 
just in the summer but in the winter as
well

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
well

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.730 
well
even<00:02:21.190> though<00:02:21.370> it's<00:02:21.760> a<00:02:22.030> much<00:02:22.870> more<00:02:23.140> condensed

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740

more<00:02:25.720> careful<00:02:25.960> there<00:02:26.620> will<00:02:26.740> be<00:02:26.770> carts<00:02:27.220> moving

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
more careful there will be carts moving

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.520 
more careful there will be carts moving
past<00:02:27.880> so<00:02:28.300> as<00:02:28.510> you're<00:02:28.960> running<00:02:29.110> along<00:02:29.500> the

building's escaping some snipers you'll
be<00:02:31.480> able<00:02:31.540> to<00:02:31.690> just<00:02:31.780> dive<00:02:32.080> off<00:02:32.320> into<00:02:32.350> a<00:02:33.310> cart

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
be able to just dive off into a cart

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.400 
be able to just dive off into a cart
that's<00:02:33.760> driving<00:02:34.450> past<00:02:34.630> you'd<00:02:35.050> be<00:02:35.140> able<00:02:35.230> to

that's driving past you'd be able to

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.230 
that's driving past you'd be able to

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
jump out of that free run quickly

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.390 
jump out of that free run quickly
through<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.810> streets<00:02:38.170> through<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:38.890> building

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
and jump out the other side see people

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.720

inside<00:02:41.200> freaking<00:02:41.740> out<00:02:41.860> as<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.160> run<00:02:42.460> past

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
inside freaking out as you run past

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
living on the frontier was extremely

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.940 
living on the frontier was extremely
difficult<00:02:51.970> not<00:02:52.750> only<00:02:52.780> did<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.350> have<00:02:53.530> harsh

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
difficult not only did you have harsh

winters cold freezing temperatures in
the<00:02:57.130> summer<00:02:57.400> you<00:02:57.730> had<00:02:58.030> heat<00:02:58.510> humidity<00:02:59.020> so<00:02:59.890> it

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
the summer you had heat humidity so it

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.040 
the summer you had heat humidity so it
was<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.610> gamble<00:03:01.090> every<00:03:01.420> year<00:03:01.690> that<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:02.020> were

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
was a gamble every year that you were

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.360 
was a gamble every year that you were
out<00:03:02.260> on<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.500> frontier<00:03:02.860> whether<00:03:03.160> you're<00:03:03.280> going

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
out on the frontier whether you're going

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.420 
out on the frontier whether you're going
to<00:03:03.460> make<00:03:03.820> it<00:03:04.000> or<00:03:04.090> not<00:03:04.950> Gracie<00:03:05.950> through<00:03:06.310> the

to make it or not Gracie through the
biggest<00:03:06.640> difference<00:03:06.910> just<00:03:07.330> having<00:03:07.570> access<00:03:07.960> to

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
biggest difference just having access to

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.010 
biggest difference just having access to
the<00:03:09.190> frontier<00:03:09.550> so<00:03:09.820> this<00:03:10.030> huge<00:03:10.450> wilderness

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
the frontier so this huge wilderness

you'll<00:03:19.810> be<00:03:19.930> able<00:03:20.020> to<00:03:20.170> navigate<00:03:20.320> through<00:03:20.890> deep

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.880 
you'll be able to navigate through deep
snow<00:03:21.370> but<00:03:22.030> also<00:03:22.360> snow<00:03:22.870> does<00:03:23.170> impact<00:03:23.650> your

gameplay<00:03:24.340> it<00:03:24.610> will<00:03:24.880> slow<00:03:25.150> down<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.660> as<00:03:25.900> well

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
gameplay it will slow down you as well

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.080 
gameplay it will slow down you as well
as<00:03:26.440> your<00:03:26.590> enemies<00:03:26.950> once<00:03:27.370> we<00:03:27.490> decided<00:03:27.820> that<00:03:27.910> we

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
as your enemies once we decided that we

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.670 
as your enemies once we decided that we
were<00:03:28.180> going<00:03:28.360> to<00:03:28.570> build<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:29.020> frontier<00:03:29.410> we

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
were going to build the frontier we

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.720 
were going to build the frontier we
realize<00:03:29.920> obviously<00:03:30.250> we<00:03:30.310> need<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.490> populate

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
realize obviously we need to populate

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.880 
realize obviously we need to populate
that<00:03:31.030> area<00:03:31.480> so<00:03:31.630> animals<00:03:32.080> became<00:03:32.350> a<00:03:32.410> very<00:03:32.650> big

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
that area so animals became a very big

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.770 
that area so animals became a very big
deal<00:03:33.100> we<00:03:33.880> have<00:03:33.970> over<00:03:34.180> two<00:03:34.360> dozen<00:03:34.540> different

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:36.850 
species of animals in the game there's

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.250

an<00:03:36.940> entire<00:03:37.180> hunting<00:03:37.690> loop<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:38.020> you<00:03:38.110> can

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
an entire hunting loop that you can

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.520 
an entire hunting loop that you can
engage<00:03:38.530> in<00:03:40.080> whenever<00:03:41.080> you're<00:03:41.230> building

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
engage in whenever you're building

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
naval engagement of that period was all

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.450 
naval engagement of that period was all
about<00:04:25.150> closing<00:04:26.050> the<00:04:26.230> distance<00:04:26.470> warning<00:04:27.370> is

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
about closing the distance warning is

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.100 
about closing the distance warning is
the<00:04:27.610> endgame<00:04:27.880> you've<00:04:28.570> got<00:04:28.750> to<00:04:28.840> be<00:04:28.870> able<00:04:28.930> to

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
the endgame you've got to be able to

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.230

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
and build for the game that was a huge

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.150 
and build for the game that was a huge
challenge<00:05:40.780> that<00:05:41.260> we<00:05:41.410> set<00:05:41.620> ourselves<00:05:41.740> and

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
challenge that we set ourselves and

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:53.860 
challenge that we set ourselves and
actually<00:05:42.760> turned<00:05:43.000> out<00:05:43.060> pretty<00:05:43.120> good
