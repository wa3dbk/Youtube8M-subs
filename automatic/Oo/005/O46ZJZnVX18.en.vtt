00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.790
 the fiat will launch a road with three 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.450
 doors right 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:11.599
 the current dual caba strada access to the 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.370
 rear seats through the front and rear 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.670
 now fiat will put a third 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.220
 door on the passenger side of a door 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.859
 suicide style she opens back to 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.919
 have easy access to the bank 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.989
 double cab road rear 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.300
 then it will have three doors one side 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:32.689
 from the driver and two from the 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.379
 passenger being a pretty cool suicide bomber 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.989
 huh 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:37.670
 It is the road she wants to attract more 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.670
 fiat road she wants to attract more 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.789
 customers for this type of car when 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.559
 the fiat launched the strada double cabin era 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.660
 a question will be to sell well 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:51.789
 because its price is very expensive right? 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:55.629
 It's very expensive and even so it made a success. 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:59.059
 great until now the fia of either 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:02.480
 continue to offer an attractive model 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.100
 consumers and even looking for new 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.009
 consumers of this type of car 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.540
 placing this third door 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.210
 of course the space behind is well 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.790
 tight is more for children than 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.030
 small people but there is an option 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.670
 for those who want to carry a load and 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.770
 people who have easy access 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.689
 here is the backseat right 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.939
 the stad double cabin bet on which 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.750
 rebated white front can access there 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.600
 behind 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.340
 it will continue the same way the 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.460
 strada cabin nowadays having 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.240
 that sunroof as an option 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.950
 things 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.159
 jack locke is the differential lock 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.979
 front as optional 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.630
 these higher adventurous versions 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.520
 with these plastic around 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.520
 and detail that she will already get the new 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.380
 identity of the 2014 road that will be 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.439
 these new headlights at the front are 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.929
 patterned and clear panel graphics 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.810
 things will already arrive with the identity 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:02.030
 look for next year's model 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.670
 I think this is the last cover that the 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.950
 fiat will give the current road change her 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.090
 for a new 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:11.470
 anyway that's all I had to talk about 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.470
 staff until the next
