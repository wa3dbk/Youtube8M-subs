so it's got a fluffy feeling to it and

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.529 
so it's got a fluffy feeling to it and
it's<00:01:40.259> just<00:01:40.500> slanted<00:01:41.219> from<00:01:41.399> the<00:01:41.520> side<00:01:41.759> so<00:01:42.149> it's

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
it's just slanted from the side so it's

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.569 
it's just slanted from the side so it's
just<00:01:42.840> for<00:01:43.049> perfect<00:01:43.469> application<00:01:43.890> and

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
just for perfect application and

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.580 
just for perfect application and
actually<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.270> like<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.869> way<00:01:46.229> its<00:01:46.380> shape

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
actually I like the way its shape

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.440 
actually I like the way its shape
because<00:01:46.859> the<00:01:46.979> top<00:01:47.219> for<00:01:47.820> me<00:01:47.969> I<00:01:48.000> don't<00:01:48.299> have<00:01:48.420> a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
because the top for me I don't have a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.139 
because the top for me I don't have a
very<00:01:48.659> defined<00:01:49.140> lip<00:01:49.500> line<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.789> would<00:01:50.939> usually

lips look decent so and also because

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.790 
lips look decent so and also because
these<00:03:29.850> colors<00:03:30.300> are<00:03:30.450> so<00:03:30.660> beautiful<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.440> limit

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
they could seep into the cracks of your

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.060 
they could seep into the cracks of your

it<00:03:35.430> can<00:03:35.580> also<00:03:35.730> stain<00:03:36.239> so<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.810> primer<00:03:37.080> just

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
it can also stain so the primer just

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.350 
it can also stain so the primer just
protects<00:03:37.709> my<00:03:37.890> lips<00:03:38.070> against<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.670> so<00:03:39.239> what

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
because it's such a vivid color again

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.880

don't<00:04:23.490> be<00:04:23.610> too<00:04:23.820> liberal<00:04:24.230> because<00:04:25.230> it<00:04:25.470> needs<00:04:25.680> to

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
don't be too liberal because it needs to

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.920 
don't be too liberal because it needs to
dry<00:04:26.070> and<00:04:26.720> once<00:04:27.720> it<00:04:27.900> does<00:04:28.050> dry<00:04:29.390> you<00:04:30.390> know<00:04:30.540> the

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
dry and once it does dry you know the

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.810 
dry and once it does dry you know the
least<00:04:31.140> you<00:04:31.290> the<00:04:31.500> less<00:04:31.680> you<00:04:31.830> put<00:04:32.040> on<00:04:32.220> the

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
least you the less you put on the

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.000 
least you the less you put on the
quicker<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.210> actually<00:04:33.660> dries<00:04:33.900> so<00:04:34.710> if<00:04:34.770> you<00:04:34.830> put

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
quicker it actually dries so if you put

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.650 
quicker it actually dries so if you put
too<00:04:35.040> much<00:04:35.310> on<00:04:35.580> it's<00:04:35.820> going<00:04:35.970> to<00:04:36.030> take<00:04:36.180> longer<00:04:36.390> to

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
too much on it's going to take longer to

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.540 
too much on it's going to take longer to
dry<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:37.050> it's<00:04:37.200> going<00:04:37.380> to<00:04:37.470> transfer<00:04:37.950> onto<00:04:38.160> your

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
like that so it needs to be just a

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.430 
like that so it needs to be just a
little<00:04:43.919> dollop<00:04:44.789> literally<00:04:45.509> and<00:04:45.750> it<00:04:46.319> will

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:54.259 
too much that and that is rd 301 I

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.629 
too much that and that is rd 301 I
really<00:04:55.259> enjoy<00:04:55.560> these<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:56.400> I<00:04:56.460> was<00:04:56.580> very

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
really enjoy these and I was very

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.640 
really enjoy these and I was very
excited<00:04:56.880> about<00:04:57.360> wearing<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:58.020> purple<00:04:58.229> on<00:04:58.500> out

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
excited about wearing the purple on out

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.430 
excited about wearing the purple on out
last<00:04:58.949> night<00:04:59.250> and<00:04:59.460> at<00:05:00.120> war<00:05:00.419> for<00:05:00.780> a<00:05:01.020> good<00:05:01.169> three

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
last night and at war for a good three

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.809 
last night and at war for a good three
hours<00:05:01.470> so<00:05:01.949> i<00:05:01.979> would<00:05:02.220> say<00:05:02.370> they<00:05:02.490> are<00:05:02.610> very

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
hours so i would say they are very

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:04.850 
hours so i would say they are very
comparable<00:05:03.210> to<00:05:03.569> occ<00:05:04.020> lip<00:05:04.050> tars<00:05:04.440> but<00:05:04.710> the

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
comparable to occ lip tars but the

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.360 
comparable to occ lip tars but the
prices<00:05:05.130> you<00:05:05.639> pay<00:05:06.030> about<00:05:06.360> 9,500<00:05:07.229> one<00:05:08.039> which<00:05:08.340> is

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
prices you pay about 9,500 one which is

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.879 
prices you pay about 9,500 one which is
it's<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.539> equivalent<00:05:09.720> of<00:05:10.139> nine<00:05:10.530> dollars

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 
it's the equivalent of nine dollars

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:13.430 
it's the equivalent of nine dollars
fifty<00:05:11.280> in<00:05:11.400> America<00:05:11.940> so<00:05:12.569> I<00:05:12.599> would<00:05:12.960> say<00:05:13.139> they<00:05:13.319> are

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
fifty in America so I would say they are

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.430 
fifty in America so I would say they are
quality<00:05:13.889> and<00:05:14.130> I<00:05:14.520> am<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:15.479> type<00:05:15.960> of<00:05:15.990> person<00:05:16.139> who

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
quality and I am the type of person who

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.379 
quality and I am the type of person who
will<00:05:16.650> get<00:05:16.800> a<00:05:16.860> throat<00:05:17.280> ache<00:05:17.490> if<00:05:17.820> something<00:05:18.210> has

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
will get a throat ache if something has

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.210 
will get a throat ache if something has
like<00:05:18.780> a<00:05:18.810> preservative<00:05:19.380> him<00:05:19.620> that's<00:05:19.800> not<00:05:19.889> good

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
like a preservative him that's not good

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.159 
like a preservative him that's not good

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
but this hasn't given me any rash or

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:23.779 
but this hasn't given me any rash or
when<00:05:22.259> you<00:05:22.349> throw<00:05:22.530> it<00:05:22.620> take<00:05:22.800> so<00:05:22.949> I<00:05:23.009> know<00:05:23.099> as<00:05:23.490> well
