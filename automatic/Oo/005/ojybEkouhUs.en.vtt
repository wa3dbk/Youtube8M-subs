00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.739
 more affected by the swells then 

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:10.930
 what is being done is to persuade 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:14.140

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.600
 tide or something on its own 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.370
 according to experts the phenomenon mars 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.920
 background is the movement of the waves 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.990

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.660
 that spreads outside the area where 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.250
 it has been generated being able to reach places 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:31.200
 very far away
