Hi, my name is Justin Lauria, and today I'm
going to teach you how to do a mini ramp skateboarding

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.950
trick called a fakie tail stall.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.580
A tail stall is a lip trick that involves
balancing on just the tail of your board on

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.860
the coping of a quarter pipe. The easiest
way to learn them is when you're riding fakie,

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.840
because you don't have to worry about turning the board to be in the tail stall position.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.980
The tail stall is probably the first fakie maneuver you'll want to learn on a mini ramp

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.080
because it sets you up perfectly to drop in and ride forward again.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.540
Before learning it, make sure you're already
comfortable dropping in and just riding fakie

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.809
in a mini ramp. If you already know how to
do rock to fakies, it'll make it a lot easier

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.469
for you to approach the opposite side of the mini ramp with the right amount

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.929
of speed to do a fakie tail stall.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.220
The first thing I want you to do is to take
your board down to the flat part at the bottom

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:53.249
of the ramp, and practice the motion of setting
your tail down on the ground.

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:57.269
While you're doing this, think about what's happening with your legs and upper body.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.300
You'll notice that you don't have to lean
back with your upper body very much at all,

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.689
and if you do, you'll end up falling off the
back of the board.

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:09.000
Instead, you accomplish this by bending your
front knee and letting your back foot fall

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.530
to the ground. This is exactly the motion
you'll want to use when you do a fakie tail stall.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.880
Next, you should practice them on a flat ramp.
Ride fakie part way up the ramp, and as you

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.880
come to a stop at your highest point, bend
at your knee again to tip the board onto the

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.820
tail, and then drop back in.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.659
On a quarter pipe, you're going to do the
stall at the very top of the ramp, but on

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.590
a bank, it's very easy for your back wheels
to roll over the top, so practice your stalls

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.899
about halfway up the ramp for now.

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.239
OK, so once you've got those dialed in, it's
time to take it to a quarter pipe.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.700
Ride fakie up the quarter pipe like you did
on the flat ramp, making sure you have enough

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.859
speed to get your board all the way up to the coping this time. Just before your wheels get to the top,

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.740
bend your front knee again and set the tail
down on the deck. Make sure to keep your body

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.259
weight on the inside of the ramp; you don't
need to stand all the way up on your back

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.920
foot. When you set the tail down, try to avoid
letting the heel of your back foot touch the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.890
deck. Now you can just reverse that whole motion
to drop back in and continue on to your next

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:09.730
trick.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.240
If you're having trouble with the board shooting
out on you as you tilt the board back, focus

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.120
on keeping your body weight farther inside
the ramp and instead, bend your front knee

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.820
more to rotate the board around the back wheels.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.900
If you can't keep your front foot on once
you get into the stall, you just need to approach

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.320
with less speed.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.340
Once you get them all figured out, you can start practicing some of these tail stall variations.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.080
