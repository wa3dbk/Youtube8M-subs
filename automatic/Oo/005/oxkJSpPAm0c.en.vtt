show you guys the types of varnishes
that<00:00:07.109> I<00:00:07.259> use<00:00:07.620> when<00:00:08.010> I<00:00:08.040> finish<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.460> project<00:00:08.719> I've

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
that I use when I finish a project I've

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.789 
that I use when I finish a project I've
been<00:00:09.870> getting<00:00:10.139> this<00:00:10.230> question<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.830> lot<00:00:11.190> and

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 
been getting this question a lot and

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.079 
been getting this question a lot and
it's<00:00:13.799> really<00:00:14.070> important<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.580> know<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.059> type

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
it's really important to know the type

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.150 
it's really important to know the type
of<00:00:15.299> varnish<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.870> use<00:00:16.080> before<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.529> spray<00:00:16.980> them

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
of varnish to use before you spray them

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.849 
of varnish to use before you spray them
on<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.400> pasta<00:00:17.789> pans<00:00:18.260> and<00:00:19.260> that's<00:00:19.529> because

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
on the pasta pans and that's because

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.650 
on the pasta pans and that's because
these<00:00:19.980> pasta<00:00:20.400> pens<00:00:20.580> are<00:00:20.730> their<00:00:21.180> water<00:00:21.420> base

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
these pasta pens are their water base

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.929 
these pasta pens are their water base
and<00:00:21.990> if<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.920> spray<00:00:23.160> any<00:00:23.310> kind<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.640> really

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
and if you spray any kind of a really

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.269 
and if you spray any kind of a really
harsh<00:00:24.150> chemical<00:00:24.630> on<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.109> will<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:26.130> will

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
harsh chemical on it it will it will

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.400 
harsh chemical on it it will it will
either<00:00:26.640> bubble<00:00:27.150> up<00:00:27.300> or<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:28.019> paint<00:00:28.260> will

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
either bubble up or the paint will

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.189 
either bubble up or the paint will
dissolve<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.330> it<00:00:30.330> can<00:00:30.599> be<00:00:30.720> really

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
dissolve and it can be really

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.510 
dissolve and it can be really
disappointing<00:00:31.920> when<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.099> spend<00:00:32.369> all<00:00:32.460> this

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
disappointing when you spend all this

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.069 
disappointing when you spend all this
time<00:00:32.669> on<00:00:32.880> something<00:00:33.450> and<00:00:33.630> then<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.930> go<00:00:34.050> to

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
time on something and then you go to

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.010 
time on something and then you go to
varnish<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.649> and<00:00:35.090> your<00:00:36.090> whole<00:00:36.270> paint<00:00:36.660> job<00:00:36.719> is

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
varnish it and your whole paint job is

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.670 
varnish it and your whole paint job is
completely<00:00:37.800> ruined<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.700> what<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.719> have<00:00:39.989> here<00:00:40.020> is

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
completely ruined so what I have here is

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.619 
completely ruined so what I have here is
an<00:00:41.280> array<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:41.969> varnishes<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:42.930> use<00:00:44.600> when<00:00:45.600> I

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
an array of varnishes that I use when I

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.690 
an array of varnishes that I use when I
do<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.840> project<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.860> main<00:00:47.070> one<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.460> really

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
do a project the main one that I really

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.569 
do a project the main one that I really
use<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.000> most<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.510> right<00:00:48.870> here<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> Krylon

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579

acrylic this is these are acrylic base
and<00:00:53.809> they<00:00:54.809> work<00:00:55.050> great<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.739> use<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.520> flat<00:00:56.989> satin

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
and gloss and I primarily use the gloss

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.689 
and gloss and I primarily use the gloss
finish<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.440> most<00:01:01.680> just<00:01:02.070> because<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.370> really

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
finish the most just because I really

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.870 
finish the most just because I really
like<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.030> shine<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:04.339> being<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.460> it's<00:01:05.580> gloss

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
like the shine and being that it's gloss

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.380 
like the shine and being that it's gloss
it's<00:01:06.390> more<00:01:06.659> durable<00:01:06.950> so<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.360> a

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
it's more durable so this is this is a

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.789 
it's more durable so this is this is a
really<00:01:09.689> good<00:01:09.780> product<00:01:10.200> it's<00:01:10.350> non-yellowing

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
it has a clear finish it dries in 10

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.280 
it has a clear finish it dries in 10
minutes<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.299> that's<00:01:15.299> majority<00:01:16.110> of<00:01:16.200> the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
minutes and that's majority of the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.940 
minutes and that's majority of the
skateboards<00:01:16.770> that<00:01:16.890> I<00:01:16.950> do<00:01:17.009> or<00:01:18.950> actually

know<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> nicer<00:01:27.390> finish<00:01:27.689> then<00:01:28.500> I'll<00:01:28.619> go<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.979> and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
know a nicer finish then I'll go in and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.749 
know a nicer finish then I'll go in and
use<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.720> polyurethane<00:01:30.720> or<00:01:31.340> even<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.549> don't

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759

have a lacquer with me but same brand
Minwax<00:01:35.520> I'll<00:01:35.939> use<00:01:36.240> either<00:01:36.630> polyurethane<00:01:37.439> or<00:01:37.650> a

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
Minwax I'll use either polyurethane or a

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.190 
Minwax I'll use either polyurethane or a
lacquer<00:01:38.310> base<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:39.360> thing<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.689> keep<00:01:39.810> in<00:01:39.960> mind

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
lacquer base the thing to keep in mind

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.450 
lacquer base the thing to keep in mind
is<00:01:40.530> if<00:01:41.250> you're<00:01:41.520> using<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:42.090> polyurethane

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
is if you're using a polyurethane

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.069 
is if you're using a polyurethane
especially<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> water-based<00:01:44.939> one<00:01:45.149> it's<00:01:45.750> really

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
especially a water-based one it's really

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.310 
especially a water-based one it's really
watery<00:01:46.619> so<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.250> need<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.090> spray<00:01:48.630> really

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
watery so you need to spray really

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.710 
watery so you need to spray really
really<00:01:50.250> light<00:01:50.460> coats<00:01:52.009> so<00:01:53.009> these<00:01:53.880> these<00:01:54.390> four

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
really light coats so these these four

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.170 
really light coats so these these four
right<00:01:54.930> here<00:01:55.290> are<00:01:55.470> great<00:01:55.770> for<00:01:56.189> anything<00:01:56.820> that's

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.160 
surfboards even I guess even glass I
guess<00:02:07.440> you<00:02:07.560> could<00:02:07.740> plastic<00:02:09.020> pretty<00:02:10.020> much

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
guess you could plastic pretty much

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.550 
guess you could plastic pretty much
anything<00:02:10.440> now<00:02:10.880> what<00:02:11.880> I<00:02:11.910> have<00:02:12.090> here<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.660> these

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
anything now what I have here is these

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.720 
anything now what I have here is these
are<00:02:13.620> canvas<00:02:14.100> varnishes<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:16.250> like<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.280> had<00:02:17.520> in

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
are canvas varnishes and like I had in

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.699 
are canvas varnishes and like I had in
the<00:02:18.830> part<00:02:19.830> five<00:02:20.070> video<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.750> getting<00:02:22.500> start

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
the part five video of the getting start

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.310 
the part five video of the getting start
with<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.890> paint<00:02:23.100> pens<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:24.240> use<00:02:24.780> this<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.260> I

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
with the paint pens I use this and I

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.370 
with the paint pens I use this and I
actually<00:02:25.440> recommend<00:02:25.740> this<00:02:26.190> one<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.610> most

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
actually recommend this one the most

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.920 
actually recommend this one the most
maybe<00:02:28.380> not<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:28.770> particular<00:02:29.070> brand<00:02:29.610> but<00:02:30.270> even

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
maybe not this particular brand but even

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.330 
maybe not this particular brand but even
even<00:02:31.440> just<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.830> spray-on<00:02:32.450> acrylic<00:02:33.450> varnish

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
even just a spray-on acrylic varnish

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.620 
even just a spray-on acrylic varnish
when<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:35.400> do<00:02:35.550> canvas<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.180> makes<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.510> lot

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
when you do canvas it makes it a lot

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:37.430 
when you do canvas it makes it a lot
easier

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
easier

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.949 
easier
it<00:02:37.680> dries<00:02:38.070> fairly<00:02:38.430> fast<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:39.209> he<00:02:39.300> has<00:02:39.450> an<00:02:39.570> even

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
it dries fairly fast and he has an even

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.100 
it dries fairly fast and he has an even
code<00:02:40.230> and<00:02:41.480> you<00:02:42.480> know<00:02:42.600> it<00:02:42.750> had<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:42.959> advantage

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
code and you know it had the advantage

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.860 
code and you know it had the advantage
over<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:44.190> you<00:02:44.910> know<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.239> advantages<00:02:45.810> of

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
over this is you know the advantages of

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.600 
over this is you know the advantages of
this<00:02:46.230> over<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.310> paint<00:02:48.120> on<00:02:48.300> varnish<00:02:48.810> is<00:02:49.580> it's<00:02:50.580> a

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
this over a paint on varnish is it's a

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.479 
this over a paint on varnish is it's a
lot<00:02:50.820> quicker<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.860> with<00:02:52.860> the<00:02:53.070> paint<00:02:53.370> on

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
lot quicker and with the paint on

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.729 
lot quicker and with the paint on
varnish<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:54.180> know<00:02:54.810> it<00:02:55.019> can<00:02:55.140> have<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.290> you<00:02:55.590> can

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
varnish you know it can have a you can

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.130 
varnish you know it can have a you can
lather<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.220> on<00:02:56.310> too<00:02:56.610> thick<00:02:56.640> sometimes

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
lather it on too thick sometimes

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.090 
lather it on too thick sometimes
especially<00:02:58.140> on<00:02:58.230> your<00:02:58.350> first<00:02:58.590> coat<00:02:58.860> and<00:02:59.040> you

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
especially on your first coat and you

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.490 
especially on your first coat and you
could<00:02:59.220> actually<00:02:59.340> smear<00:02:59.850> your<00:03:00.000> paint<00:03:00.269> so<00:03:00.930> and

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
could actually smear your paint so and

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.590 
could actually smear your paint so and
that's<00:03:01.769> primarily<00:03:02.580> with<00:03:02.880> the<00:03:02.910> pasta<00:03:03.390> pens

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
that's primarily with the pasta pens

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.240 
that's primarily with the pasta pens
because<00:03:03.989> they<00:03:04.110> are<00:03:04.230> water-based<00:03:04.590> once<00:03:05.070> they

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
because they are water-based once they

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.710 
because they are water-based once they
water<00:03:05.489> evaporates<00:03:06.030> you're<00:03:06.239> just<00:03:06.420> left<00:03:06.600> with

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
water evaporates you're just left with

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.620 
water evaporates you're just left with
the<00:03:06.810> paint<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.350> as<00:03:08.250> soon<00:03:08.489> as<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:09.360> know<00:03:09.480> they

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
the paint and as soon as you know they

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.449 
the paint and as soon as you know they
wash<00:03:09.870> off<00:03:10.140> simply<00:03:10.680> with<00:03:10.830> water

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
wash off simply with water

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:15.140 
wash off simply with water
so<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.360> tried<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.230> avoid<00:03:13.350> this<00:03:13.850> until<00:03:14.850> like

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
so I tried to avoid this until like

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.960 
so I tried to avoid this until like
after<00:03:15.329> I've<00:03:15.690> done<00:03:15.840> maybe<00:03:16.049> you<00:03:16.709> know<00:03:16.860> two<00:03:17.670> coats

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
after I've done maybe you know two coats

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.220 
after I've done maybe you know two coats
of<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.959> varnish<00:03:19.549> so<00:03:20.750> this<00:03:21.750> is<00:03:21.959> pretty<00:03:22.170> much

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
of the varnish so this is pretty much

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.130 
of the varnish so this is pretty much
the<00:03:22.650> types<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.549> varnishes<00:03:23.910> that<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.060> use

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
the types of varnishes that I use

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.240 
the types of varnishes that I use
krylon<00:03:25.829> is<00:03:26.239> definitely<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:28.170> best<00:03:28.380> one<00:03:28.799> to<00:03:28.860> use

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
krylon is definitely the best one to use

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.000 
krylon is definitely the best one to use
on<00:03:29.549> any<00:03:30.390> kind<00:03:30.900> of<00:03:30.930> surface<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:31.829> know<00:03:31.950> you

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
on any kind of surface you know you

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.729 
on any kind of surface you know you
could<00:03:32.190> even<00:03:32.310> use<00:03:32.489> it<00:03:32.519> on<00:03:32.670> canvas<00:03:33.150> but<00:03:33.560> this<00:03:34.560> is

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
could even use it on canvas but this is

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.800 
could even use it on canvas but this is
the<00:03:34.829> one<00:03:34.950> for<00:03:35.100> canvas<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.670> best<00:03:35.880> one<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.780> I

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
the one for canvas the best one that I

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.949 
the one for canvas the best one that I
like<00:03:37.110> to<00:03:37.140> spray<00:03:37.470> on<00:03:37.620> varnish<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:39.180> hope<00:03:39.780> this
