00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hallmann against more beautiful we can see 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.420
 I've always said that gift 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.540
 i like this year sous us candy 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.040
 wanted to shoot videos and not from you 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.540
 many had asked 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.460
 I thought about certain things 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.320
 I watch this video again today and 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.690
 i look so pale because i light up 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.420
 boxing movie wearing the t-shirt again 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.730
 and extreme currently have in the face and 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.300
 That's why I'm eating today, you know 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.949
 with red cheeks and so but found that 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.019
 I 've got this few tiny questions 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.600
 rust is so I have to you the 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.670
 question and then the first question 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.680
 is they have a lot of me 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.300
 asked if that's for a cell phone 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.070
 provider i use something here and that 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.090
 Somehow this is his mobile phone 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.670
 to switch providers 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.860
 but i am at blau.de so i have 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.480
 a prepaid card that I always stop 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.460
 get on once a month 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.649
 and I find that somehow easier 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.149
 and clearer but yes now know 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.910
 her where the phone with me I can 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.920
 my infobox write if you are 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.050
 no idea what you have and everyone 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.760
 buys his contract or whatever 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.589
 there are, however, I find these prepaid 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.630
 also always better if you find it 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.400
 I can not cover that much though 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.340
 you can stop on one has to his 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.630
 limit with the operated and yes then 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.729
 ask love is your stuff if your life 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.670
 my book was going to start no 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.159
 because i dont because i live in here and 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.780
 now and I'm just so what comes 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.299
 happens just like that and I believe too 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.430
 camera therefore i would like that i would 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.110
 I do not want to live convinced if it is 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.960
 others do not read though I am now 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.640
 then you would know how to read 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.619
 his life is lost and that is 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.390
 just the exciting thing about it 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.770
 does not know that it just things 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.350
 Now maybe someone does not like that 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.210
 would have expected then asks what wood 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.970
 are your favorite last time which 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.930
 Most are using moody's 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:53.460
 most used the fashionable at the moment 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:57.360
 definitely the ones here 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.670
 the girl yes cicek i love the and 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.780
 the monkeys the roma was for a good one 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.550
 Girl I use her always and 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.560
 Insight like that at the moment 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.330
 I do not think we have here 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.610
 But many individual songs so check 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.620
 my spotify if everyone in the expired 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.319
 I actually see staying current 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.370
 if you write as a team 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.260
 would which approx 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.510
 that was easy i want a wombat 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.400
 Firstly liebig of two non kilowatt 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.140
 I will tell you a picture here 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:29.220
 Agents cut the sweetest animals 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.320
 on earth and compass and formation at 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.700
 life no but format are small 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.370
 are written all day long 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.780
 nocturnal and they just eat and run 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.820
 a little bit around and that's easy 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.480
 my life as it already is and 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.519
 That's why I love norbert live 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.610
 So I mean what we like 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:50.780
 if you like to continue the clock 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.780
 or nature 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.519
 it depends on who you are now 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.709
 Looking for life because I tend to be 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:03.450
 not say when metadesign understood to 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:04.890
 but this one of minecraft best in the forest 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.140
 chess boards always suit and man 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.670
 We can take a moment to dress 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.549
 what am I doing here was there for you behind 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.459
 but men really don and point 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.799
 and so look and eat 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:23.519
 but impression otherwise produces for the rest 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:24.600
 of life not if one applies 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.250
 can also talk to you then 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.690
 entertain oh my god i love it 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.610
 when I see you, and they just completely 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.680
 quiet with me so talk to some 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.239
 I avoided excited, I'm the same 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.829
 excited the marriage you can me 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.800
 believe and you can do it all 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.270
 come to me normally 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.580
 then we can do that a bit and that 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.490
 I just love to see something else 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.740
 who is sitting behind the screen and 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.720
 So that's how wiesmann alien but 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.400
 You can still somehow 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.680
 through the comments and now through e 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.810
 mail or instagram and if I then 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.190
 see our weight of dancefloor and 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.960
 my god is actually a person instead 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.120
 stranger man hugged himself anyway 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.130
 I just love it that's why it comes with pleasure 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.770
 to me with talk me at the 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.840
 Bahai and the ring with her and me 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.710
 So please always please 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.540
 I like to see it live 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.340
 I really like to talk to her 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.380
 does not bother me either, we are still mine 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.910
 god i am no really not me 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.610
 like to take the time for you if it is 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.709
 is just such a great thing missing 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.180
 is simply indescribable of one 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:24.040
 scale from 1-10 how much suzuki lies 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.080
 2500 and Regions meeting was for one 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.620
 long time alone abroad if so 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.270
 where 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.920
 I've set myself when I mean mine 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.450
 graduated from high school did what you have one more 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.490
 but it is a bit if I did that 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.640
 I definitely want that first 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.380
 taking a year break from and easy 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.050
 first see the world before me 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.730
 start working before I study 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.680
 or so I just want the world first 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.810
 I think it's incredibly important 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.700
 maybe I will see the whole world though 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.200
 has partly see where to stop the child 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.390
 for example , in gold or for a long time 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:54.220
 the part is just too far or 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.690
 just never made it in time 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.370
 just had to come around 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.960
 self-development and around yourself 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.870
 even if we still mean it 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.130
 you 're often done with school 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.540
 haphazard and that's why I want that too 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.280
 just a year is transformed here 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.410
 Take a break and just see the world 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.940
 maybe new places might cover 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.890
 I stay even in my place then 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.660
 but I'm just the guilty grad 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:15.850
 see world and me easily 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.410
 but keep on developing 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.310
 Personally, I just referred to the 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.170
 impressions 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.370
 but what have we got in this moment 

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:26.640
 Most of all I believe summer sun 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:30.850
 holiday just so beach and sea 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:32.710
 little summer and so divorced if you only 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.150
 In addition, one day you would have done 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.140
 us not so i think today i have time 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:40.270
 with my family and my friends 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:43.090
 spend and go starbucks and all over 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:44.440
 get a lot of coffee and yes I want but 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.970
 in any case as a feature in mine 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.110
 family then rest the rest 

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.610
 hours 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.260
 We will definitely stay with families 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.750
 and people you love you do 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:54.700
 im mondeo smi I was so happy 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.440
 make than simply more a day 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:57.940
 with me raffle that we go shopping 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.660
 still the food and easy day 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.700
 together 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.440
 But that's just because of school and one 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.360
 very heavy and now I get 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.640
 So try to summer vacation areas 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.930
 to get that maybe so 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.720
 but I can not do it 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.700
 but partly promise again 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.220
 Let's get a day off with me now 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.410
 from the top that was really mega cult that would be 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.940
 really then the last question is from 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.220
 Countries ask what in your teacher 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.810
 Most importantly there are more things 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:24.340
 family are very important to my family 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.690
 my friends but i will 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.730
 most important is the most important 

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:29.560
 just that one is happy to be positive 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.770
 is and the good things in life 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:36.250
 believes and has positive thoughts 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:38.470
 and a positive thing about it, that's it 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.390
 has not seen the negative immediately 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.250
 take care that good and that you always 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.930
 no matter how bad a thing is 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:46.540
 always believe in the good and 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.160
 does not heat up the belief in the good 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.810
 I think that's how I lose it 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.760
 the most important thing in life is you 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:55.210
 simply positive is that you can not 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:57.280
 Common is that you can do so without reason 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:59.920
 offended or so to say where I am right now 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.610
 but now only he will 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.980
 I think so 

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.450
 But you never have to go for february 

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.040
 relatively quickly given because my battery 

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.260
 all is ours flashing all the time i 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.740
 was afraid that he would go out so much lust 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.509
 Has 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:13.479
 Now I'm talking fast 

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:15.099
 I've just got you guys nonetheless 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:16.750
 like this video you can me 

00:07:15.099 --> 00:07:18.610
 like to send your questions again and again 

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.500
 when did you wore the social 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:24.099
 media that I have or where you are 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.599
