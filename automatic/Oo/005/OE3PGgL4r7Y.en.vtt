zero six zero two and the first thing I

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.720 
zero six zero two and the first thing I
like<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.389> do<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:13.070> make<00:00:14.070> sure<00:00:14.099> that<00:00:14.490> your

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
like to do is make sure that your

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.660 
like to do is make sure that your
carriage<00:00:15.529> lock<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.859> in<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.550> unlocked

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
carriage lock is in the unlocked

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.689 
carriage lock is in the unlocked
position<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.660> then<00:00:19.320> back<00:00:19.830> your<00:00:20.010> compound<00:00:20.460> out

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
position and then back your compound out

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.580 
position and then back your compound out
a<00:00:21.119> couple<00:00:21.600> of<00:00:21.810> inches<00:00:21.960> to<00:00:22.109> give<00:00:22.320> yourself

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
a couple of inches to give yourself

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.109 
a couple of inches to give yourself
enough<00:00:22.650> room<00:00:22.920> to<00:00:22.980> work<00:00:23.220> into<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.699> material

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
enough room to work into the material

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.560 
enough room to work into the material
and<00:00:24.240> then<00:00:24.869> what<00:00:25.109> I<00:00:25.140> like<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.350> do<00:00:25.560> is<00:00:26.090> zero<00:00:27.090> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
and then what I like to do is zero the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.630 
and then what I like to do is zero the
tool<00:00:27.779> by<00:00:28.170> touching<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.710> metal<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.130> then<00:00:29.340> zero

cut by advancing the cross slide and

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.130 
cut by advancing the cross slide and
we'll<00:00:45.149> speed<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:45.510> up<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.780> make<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:45.930> go<00:00:46.110> a

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
we'll speed this up to make it go a

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.700 
we'll speed this up to make it go a
little<00:00:46.230> bit<00:00:46.440> quicker<00:00:46.559> I'm<00:00:47.399> gonna<00:00:47.730> be<00:00:47.850> cutting

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
little bit quicker I'm gonna be cutting

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.750 
little bit quicker I'm gonna be cutting
20,000th<00:00:49.710> per<00:00:49.920> pass<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:51.530> this<00:00:52.530> first<00:00:53.039> cut<00:00:53.550> is

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
20,000th per pass and this first cut is

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.819 
20,000th per pass and this first cut is
a<00:00:53.789> 15<00:00:54.360> degree<00:00:54.629> angle<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:55.350> can<00:00:55.500> see<00:00:55.649> right

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
a 15 degree angle you can see right

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.479 
a 15 degree angle you can see right
below<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.480> compound<00:00:57.480> there<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> that

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
below the compound there is a that

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.760 
below the compound there is a that
little<00:00:59.640> black<00:00:59.969> plate<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.750> inside<00:01:01.320> of<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.500> is

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
little black plate and inside of that is

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.080 
little black plate and inside of that is
where<00:01:01.890> your<00:01:02.039> compass<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.489> witness<00:01:02.730> mark<00:01:02.940> are

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
where your compass and witness mark are

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.789 
where your compass and witness mark are
so<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.570> set<00:01:03.780> your<00:01:03.930> angle<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.350> then<00:01:04.680> you

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
so you can set your angle and then you

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.950 
so you can set your angle and then you
saw<00:01:05.010> me<00:01:05.129> loosening<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.670> two<00:01:05.880> lockdown<00:01:06.600> screws

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
saw me loosening the two lockdown screws

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.240 
saw me loosening the two lockdown screws
underneath<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.470> compound<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:08.010> allow<00:01:08.189> you

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
underneath the compound that allow you

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.920 
underneath the compound that allow you
to<00:01:08.369> lock<00:01:08.580> down<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.880> angle<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.540> your<00:01:09.570> choice

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
to lock down the angle of your choice

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.260 
to lock down the angle of your choice
for<00:01:10.830> my<00:01:10.920> first<00:01:11.159> cut<00:01:11.400> I<00:01:11.520> wanted<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.909> take<00:01:12.060> half

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
for my first cut I wanted to take half

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.080 
for my first cut I wanted to take half
the<00:01:12.390> diameter<00:01:12.570> off<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.110> material<00:01:13.640> so<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.670> feed

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
the diameter off the material so I feed

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.320 
the diameter off the material so I feed
in<00:01:15.830> 250<00:01:16.830> thousands<00:01:17.310> which<00:01:17.850> takes<00:01:18.119> five

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
in 250 thousands which takes five

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.700 
in 250 thousands which takes five
hundred<00:01:18.570> thousandths<00:01:18.990> off<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.290> diameter

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
hundred thousandths off the diameter

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.560 
hundred thousandths off the diameter
this<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.040> 1<00:01:20.250> inch<00:01:20.280> piece<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:20.909> hot<00:01:21.060> rolled<00:01:21.330> and

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
this is a 1 inch piece of hot rolled and

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.560 
this is a 1 inch piece of hot rolled and
then<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:23.189> unlocked<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.909> carriage<00:01:24.330> and

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
then I unlocked the carriage and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.620 
then I unlocked the carriage and
repositioned<00:01:25.409> for<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:26.250> thirty<00:01:26.909> thousand<00:01:27.360> cut

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
repositioned for a thirty thousand cut

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.149 
repositioned for a thirty thousand cut

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
spur cut on the cross slide once I get

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.100 
spur cut on the cross slide once I get
the<00:01:37.259> second<00:01:37.680> cut<00:01:37.860> finished<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.430> go<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.240> my
