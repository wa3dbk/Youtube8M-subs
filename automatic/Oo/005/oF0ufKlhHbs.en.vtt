00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.539
 to do 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.020
 home of all this 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.239
 that is the new name for it 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.520
 archaeological center that we feel 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.130
 province of north holland in in castricum 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.610
 still building that is actually one 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.710
 result of the treaty of malta 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.900
 the treaty of malta says that's one 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.489
 European legislation that says 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.230
 everywhere in the round in the group in the 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:51.640
 soil being stirred must first 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.670
 archaeological research 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.830
 so always where it renewed 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.910
 is going to be looked at or there 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.280
 are traces of the past 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.100
 therefore every province must also have one 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.470
 depot and that this paul 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.840
 that grows and grows and grows and malta 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.760
 says on you must also show it 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.860
 population of what is found and 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.540
 so there is that smaller museum 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.990
 that comes with it so that's it 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.250
 schedule of requirements for the home of 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.380
 hilde 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.299
 that stuff that comes out of the ground that has 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.810
 safely seated in the ground and when we get there 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.420
 get it out 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.740
 yes then it can break it can it 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.200
 it will rot and so on 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.700
 they must panels that way carefully 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.500
 saved for the next generation 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.030
 means that in the depot 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.439
 must have come with 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.299
 without light where the temperature 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.310
 the same temperature holds where none 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.859
 fluctuation is the best conditions 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.409
 and the sustainable solution is the throw 

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:47.560
 actually a meter of sand on that building 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.210
 because of that meter of sand it is obvious 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.009
 actually need a stable climate 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.329
 not much more to add we have 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.759
 dunes actually just go there again 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:57.070
 throw over but the performance true 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.109
 also busy restaurant and shop 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.009
 and the offices with the people at it 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:02.380
 be work 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.499
 we made it above ground and 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.659
 there had to be one and yes a building and 

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:09.580
 shape to be given to, and eventually 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.670
 we have on the basis of a lot 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:16.000
 we have seen archaeological pictures 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.010
 that in the early Middle Ages on the spot 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.140
 that there are many farms where and 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.180
 that of which you have long farms where the 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.700
 people live in with their cattle and who has 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.770
 such a very characteristic shape 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.960
 farm that shape we caught that 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.420
 have caught that roof 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.310
 we have that 70 meters long about that 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.110
 that dune landscape what we redo 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.459
 made 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.080
 but we have a translation to 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.090
 given modern times 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.280
 but because great doctor over it too 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.170
 we have large overhangs 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.120
 and ensures that that never happens 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.710
 direct sunlight enters and therefore 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.620
 you can afford to have a lot of glass 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.450
 make it such that it does the same as 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.200
 what a shop window and a teaser 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.250
 boys hey 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.260
 here I have to go here I want to go 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.600
 what we are happy with is 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.310
 is the chosen place and you are sitting by 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.050
 the station 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.850
 intercity station from the station 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.620
 that just very visibly right along with 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.400
 that background of the van that high dune 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.800
 from 30 meters 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.420
 that means and that is very important 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.920
 a double or one for you 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.250
 visitor center with a museum function 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.470
 was already you see that people know 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.090
 also those people who train the fighters 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.100
 actually walk over that building 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.290
 First to take to the coffee and dunes 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.970
 go in and back that run along the 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.130
 shop window that made 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.650
 and that building that interesting building and 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.150
 who are tempted to look hey but 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.310
 this is interesting that is exactly 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.540
 what what what the treaty of malta says 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.550
 before you have to tell that 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.350
 you must therefore also tempt people to 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.150
 to come that she is told 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.190
 and with that I am happy with that with that 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.140
 place and that combination with with 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.090
 tourist functions as they indicate 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.769
 where one and a half million people come 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.120
 the construction has started so we are done 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:53.620
 your the end of the 2013 foundation 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.209
 the distribution that you see it is not yet 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.400
 the foundations rise 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.320
 laid out 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.980
 the construction takes about a year so me 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:07.360
 suspect the opening will be in 2014 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:10.590
 late December 2014 and yes and that 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.590
 must be festive
