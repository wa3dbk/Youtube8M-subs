 hello everyone and welcome to couple kits 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:13.650
 how to do it today we will do a dyeing 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.650
 knots for shirts with markers 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:23.140
 for this you need alcohol 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.460
 newspaper sponge bookmarks 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.080
 colors 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.080
 and a white shirt 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.610
 what we are going to do is simulate the 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.560
 dyeing knots then we first put 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.560
 newspaper inside the shirt 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.050
 between the two fabrics then we make the 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.970
 T-shirt designs using the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.010
 markers 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.680
 this is the time to be creative 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.160
 you can make any drawing that 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.160
 want 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.870
 once you finish the design done 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.270
 with the sponge a little alcohol in the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.920
 designs and see how the ink runs like 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.920
 if it were a dyeing of new 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.290
 can be super creative and make a 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.700
 lots of designs this is great for 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.650
 that the little ones in the house are 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.460
 creative and the best thing is that they can 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.460
 use it later 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.960
