 so customize your weapon with the 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.090
 camouflage the red skull inspired by a 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.370
 regime more to the ray the cyborg so the 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.799
 favorite camouflage of the majority of the 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.570
 community and the black ops 3 pack that 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.880
 understands so it's three packs of 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.549
 customization so here it was for 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.110
 the jack locke edition does not hesitate to 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.850
 say in the comments what you 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.190
 think about it then we have this picture 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.869
 we have some kind of code that is very 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.700
 difficult to decipher we do not know 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.830
 really what it's all about 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.299
 appears in multiple images so for 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.030
 the moment there are only hypotheses 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.490
 as for example that these are the logos 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.990
 prestige but it remains treacherous 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.120
 difficult to decipher so do not hesitate 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.130
 not to say if you have an idea in 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.720
 the commentary space we continue 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.300
 with this image there we can see in fact 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.160
 a city not rather buildings and we 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.380
 was saying that it was 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.660
 chicago here's the proof thanks and 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.760
 an image of the city plus that of 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.460
 zombie of bo3 that it is indeed 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.890
 of chicago now another image on 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.650
 can see a zombie who has a hat 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.110
 according to precisely this hat he could 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.320
 in fact they are chicago gangsters 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.480
 who wore this kind of hat in 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.610
 the 40s and we think that these 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.010
 zombies are actually gangsters of 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.180
 40's of chicago so here it was 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.980
 all for this video hoping 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.920
 that you liked it I also remember 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.630
 that the beta will be released on the 19th 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.340
 August on ps4 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.990

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.790
 ideas in comment and do not forget to 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.340
 to put a like it is always a pleasure 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.460
