course I already had one so that one
doesn't<00:03:41.650> count<00:03:41.770> and<00:03:42.190> I<00:03:42.460> got<00:03:42.640> a<00:03:42.670> lot<00:03:42.850> of<00:03:42.960> uncles

with<00:03:47.170> my<00:03:47.610> chuckle<00:03:48.610> yet<00:03:48.820> because<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.150> just

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
with my chuckle yet because I just

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.180 
with my chuckle yet because I just
thought<00:03:49.600> like<00:03:49.930> it<00:03:50.170> takes<00:03:50.440> too<00:03:50.710> long<00:03:50.740> to<00:03:51.100> do

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
thought like it takes too long to do

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.400 
thought like it takes too long to do
that<00:03:51.400> so<00:03:52.000> if<00:03:52.210> I<00:03:52.300> just<00:03:52.510> price<00:03:52.750> check<00:03:52.960> everything

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
that so if I just price check everything

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.280 
that so if I just price check everything
then<00:03:53.530> you<00:03:53.560> can<00:03:53.710> see<00:03:53.830> I<00:03:53.980> got<00:03:54.160> 1.5<00:03:54.940> mil<00:03:55.210> and<00:03:55.450> 50k<00:03:56.050> I

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
then you can see I got 1.5 mil and 50k I

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.480 
then you can see I got 1.5 mil and 50k I
think<00:03:56.710> that's<00:03:56.860> not<00:03:57.040> bad

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
think that's not bad

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.450 
think that's not bad
however<00:03:57.880> I<00:03:58.180> am<00:03:58.390> below<00:03:58.930> average<00:03:59.170> because<00:03:59.770> on

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:00.460 
however I am below average because on

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.490 
however I am below average because on
average<00:04:00.760> you<00:04:01.060> should<00:04:01.270> get<00:04:01.420> a<00:04:01.450> drop<00:04:01.750> like<00:04:02.110> once

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
average you should get a drop like once

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.850 
average you should get a drop like once
in<00:04:02.710> every<00:04:03.450> 110<00:04:04.450> kills<00:04:04.720> or<00:04:04.930> so<00:04:05.110> and<00:04:05.350> I<00:04:05.620> got<00:04:05.830> a

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
in every 110 kills or so and I got a

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.170 
in every 110 kills or so and I got a
drop<00:04:06.160> in<00:04:06.370> once<00:04:06.850> in<00:04:07.800> 160<00:04:08.800> kills<00:04:09.070> but<00:04:09.730> still<00:04:09.970> in

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
drop in once in 160 kills but still in

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.970 
drop in once in 160 kills but still in
