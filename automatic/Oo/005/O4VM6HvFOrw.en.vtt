00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 very good friends of youtube of friends 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:06.450
 of android trend or new state 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:10.530
 a video and this time I received a 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.030
 new product it's about the group x 550 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.950
 if I remember correctly that it has arrived 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.599
 now he did not want to share with 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.960
 you these first impressions of 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.509
 device keep coming let's go there 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.890
 Well, let's go there with this boxing and 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:28.590
 first first magazine of this blue boe 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.859
 550 say that there was a cover for the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.250
 550 balloon device as you want 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.600
 call him 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.630
 I found it on the page col and cab where 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.300
 I have bought many models from the group 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.070
 x 3 that the truth that a phone came out 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.460
 a very good brand and a very telephone 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:50.199
 good were sold me a lot 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.730
 they commissioned a lot of people and that's why 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:55.390
 trust this brand and I decided to try 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.629
 this blog x 150 let's see it a little bit 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.280
 what the packaging brings us and neither 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.710
 I have laughed a lot is going to be or unboxing 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.809
 a quick booty a quick look and 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.149
 then we are going to go testing it in 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.830
 these days to check that there is 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.140
 performance of this device and about 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.940
 all the stuff that incorporates good 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.030
 first to say that a protector comes 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.690
 screen come to a place more 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.460
 little things over here 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.890
 well another little thing that impresses me 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.250
 quite is this that comes with two 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:30.720
 chargers there are two chargers of 5 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.970
 volts and 2 amps plus tidbits this is 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.920
 A cable or knit can use to 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.890
 many things to be current or 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.960
 connect a usb port all you know 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.870
 that is not the first time I use it 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.270
 cable or tg and a cable the cable meat 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.300
 of data connection that good does not seem 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.800
 it is very bad to know it well is not 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.920
 well the truth is that the cable the cable 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:55.200
 it's fine of those hard the long not very 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.490
 long but the cable is not bad and 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.740
 well now let's see such a look 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.360
 fast the device 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.659
 and I have to say that the device 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.720
 weighs a lot are about 180 grams and it's 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.289
 chubby the truth that is pretty rough 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.360
 It is not ugly at all because good has 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:15.120
 a small metal line here that 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.940
 It looks quite interesting here 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.310
 they have the typical lollipop keypad 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.140
 35.1 brings the same if I remember correctly 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.239
 you're in the typical buttonhole that happens 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.569
 it's like metal and a negative point 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.250
 because you will not illuminate us not 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.840
 illuminates let's see at a quick glance 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.450
 the battery that is about 5,300 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.390
 milliamps so that you throw them a 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.569
 look I think you can appreciate 5 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.760
 thousand 300 milliamps we see that the 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.209
 battery is not removable and we can see 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.459
 also the micro sim module sim model and 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.530
 module for sd and good cards 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.799
 we will have a little bit the terminal we see 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.390
 a small bar blocking the brand 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.610
 with the types 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.319
 and we see that it really is android 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.660
 Pretty pure does not have many 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:06.250
 modifications we lower the bar 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.760
 notifications because we're going to go down to 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:14.170
 quick shortcuts we can see that between 5.1 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.090
 by the settings in the shortcut bar 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.940
 Quick bluetooth settings and settings 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.090
 wifi without having to leave is a sign 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:25.620
 of identity that is android 5.1 what 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.700
 let's see we go from here to the option is 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.430
 device information and there it is 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.730
 android 5.1 the truth that is 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:37.060
 pretty good on model x 150 as I said 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.560
 is the new x 150 and well let's see 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.180
 how to manage storage as well in 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.140
 quick glance what is it that could be 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.390
 more more interesting comes with hot nose 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.180
 what is the nfc of Chinese 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.030
 let's see the storage we 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.500
 we find with memory fairy partition 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.780
 I do not like them very much but good 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.200
 inside the house are almost 4 GB of 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.870
 internal memory and the other 8 with 48 of 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.750
 partition I like more that come united 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.700
 but good is 4 gigas of internal that 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.530
 good is not bad 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.840
 you have to fill it 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.790
 many applications battery applications 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.950
 let's see the theme of the camera too 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:19.260
 a quick glance follows to see what 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.530
 such is the camera is we are going to 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.750
 give you that auto focus there is arbitration 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.990
 shoot until you shoot enough 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:30.479
 fast and the truth is that pretty well 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.600
 with insurance that I'm seeing let's see 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.580
 the quality that such 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.970
 we do not put on camera with a lot of 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:40.400
 anti face detection options 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:44.840
 good vibration up to four thirds 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:47.060
 to 3 megapixels and we change it to 16 no 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.550
 see us we also find 3 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.930
 megapixels that's pretty good and what 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.020
 I've seen right now taking the picture 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:57.170
 has shown enough I think that what I've 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:59.270
 seen is not bad is this camera like this 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.920
 that's good, this is a little bit all 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.770
 I'm not going to roll up a lot because then 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.570
 we will do a complete review with everything 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.330
 detail of everything that the 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.760
 device the truth that good comes 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.440
 really very very pure and I like me 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:14.420
 I like it a lot because there are brands that 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.070
 they have a layer that is pretty bad 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.290
 as I told you in layers that I did not 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.300
 they like nothing but I liked it a lot 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:24.140
 so good little more to add to 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:27.290
 this blog x 550 in a few days in the 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.080
 full review already said I prefer to give me 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:32.390
 my time and test all the battery well 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.580
 performance as yields and others in a 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.380
 mark that I trust her the truth 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.439
 I bought a few devices from this 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:41.840
 brand and the truth had a catch 

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:43.129
 the devices very very well so 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.169
 well that's all friends I hope that 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:49.009
 you liked this first shot of 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:51.490
 group contact x 550 that's all to 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:51.490
 take care
