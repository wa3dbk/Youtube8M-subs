level of game design that's just light
years<00:01:20.810> ahead<00:01:20.960> of<00:01:21.110> virtually<00:01:21.620> everyone<00:01:22.130> else

years ahead of virtually everyone else
and<00:01:22.610> then<00:01:22.880> there's<00:01:23.030> the<00:01:23.180> execution<00:01:23.870> which<00:01:24.140> is

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
and then there's the execution which is

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.740 
and then there's the execution which is
even<00:01:24.530> more<00:01:24.560> incredible<00:01:24.920> every<00:01:25.760> coin<00:01:26.210> every

care<00:01:31.970> in<00:01:32.510> fact<00:01:32.720> this<00:01:33.140> is<00:01:33.260> a<00:01:33.290> game<00:01:33.560> that<00:01:33.590> makes

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
care in fact this is a game that makes

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.520 
care in fact this is a game that makes
other<00:01:34.160> games<00:01:34.460> even<00:01:34.940> other<00:01:35.240> good<00:01:35.600> games<00:01:35.870> almost

seem<00:01:37.250> kind<00:01:37.790> of<00:01:37.880> amateur<00:01:38.390> Mario<00:01:39.320> is<00:01:39.410> just

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
seem kind of amateur Mario is just

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.290 
seem kind of amateur Mario is just
playing<00:01:40.009> in<00:01:40.130> a<00:01:40.190> different<00:01:40.220> league<00:01:40.700> these<00:01:41.030> days

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
playing in a different league these days

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.870 
playing in a different league these days
and<00:01:41.540> it's<00:01:41.840> stunning<00:01:42.229> that<00:01:42.380> after<00:01:42.830> 30<00:01:43.220> years<00:01:43.340> he

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
and it's stunning that after 30 years he

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.740 
and it's stunning that after 30 years he
somehow<00:01:44.450> getting<00:01:44.869> better

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.480 

and<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:52.350> think<00:01:52.560> part<00:01:52.830> of<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:52.980> is<00:01:53.280> that

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
and I think part of that is that

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.150 
and I think part of that is that
Nintendo's<00:01:54.450> totally<00:01:55.110> rethinking<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.860> Super

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
Nintendo's totally rethinking the Super

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.130 
Nintendo's totally rethinking the Super
Mario<00:01:56.370> series<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:57.270> used<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.570> be<00:01:57.660> easy<00:01:57.900> right

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
Mario series it used to be easy right

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.380 
Mario series it used to be easy right
you<00:01:58.440> had<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.680> 2d<00:01:58.980> games<00:01:59.220> and<00:01:59.670> he<00:01:59.790> had<00:01:59.910> the<00:02:00.030> 3d

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
you had the 2d games and he had the 3d

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.910 
you had the 2d games and he had the 3d
games<00:02:00.630> they<00:02:01.080> were<00:02:01.140> two<00:02:01.380> different<00:02:01.680> things

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
games they were two different things

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.040 
games they were two different things
they<00:02:02.730> actually<00:02:02.850> started<00:02:03.360> moving<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:03.900> two

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
they actually started moving in two

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.440 
they actually started moving in two
different<00:02:04.260> directions<00:02:04.770> 3d<00:02:05.700> world<00:02:05.910> pulls<00:02:06.270> them

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
different directions 3d world pulls them

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.139 
different directions 3d world pulls them
back<00:02:06.480> together<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:07.380> takes<00:02:07.560> 2d<00:02:08.070> and<00:02:08.369> 3d<00:02:08.399> Mario

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
back together it takes 2d and 3d Mario

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.450 
back together it takes 2d and 3d Mario
and<00:02:09.420> reworks<00:02:10.200> them<00:02:10.470> into<00:02:10.649> something<00:02:10.860> that's<00:02:11.190> a

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
and reworks them into something that's a

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.520 
and reworks them into something that's a
little<00:02:12.090> bit<00:02:12.210> of<00:02:12.300> both<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.870> it's<00:02:13.170> never<00:02:13.350> as

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
little bit of both and it's never as

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.220 
little bit of both and it's never as
artificial<00:02:13.890> as<00:02:14.160> just<00:02:14.490> mixing<00:02:15.300> some<00:02:15.510> 3d<00:02:15.870> levels
