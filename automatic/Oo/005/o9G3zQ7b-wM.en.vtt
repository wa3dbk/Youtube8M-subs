so<00:00:10.469> let's<00:00:10.740> do<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:13.429> figured<00:00:14.429> for<00:00:14.460> this

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
so let's do this I figured for this

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.790 
so let's do this I figured for this
international<00:00:15.330> team<00:00:15.809> why<00:00:16.020> not<00:00:16.260> use<00:00:16.500> these

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
international team why not use these

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.029 
international team why not use these
jerseys<00:00:17.960> because<00:00:18.960> they<00:00:19.260> have<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> team<00:00:19.740> name

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
jerseys because they have a team name

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.609 
jerseys because they have a team name
that<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.369> not<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.699> existence<00:00:21.140> so<00:00:22.140> they<00:00:22.320> can<00:00:22.500> be

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
that is not in existence so they can be

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.779 
that is not in existence so they can be
the<00:00:22.740> international<00:00:23.430> team<00:00:23.640> oh<00:00:25.250> there<00:00:26.250> we<00:00:26.369> go
