that differs from the box of the one
that<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.240> have<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:20.009> does<00:01:20.220> full<00:01:20.490> 1080p

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
that I have is that it does full 1080p

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.929 
that I have is that it does full 1080p
of<00:01:21.570> video<00:01:21.900> calling<00:01:22.200> on<00:01:22.409> skype<00:01:22.710> mine<00:01:23.460> does

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
of video calling on skype mine does

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.140 
of video calling on skype mine does
1080p<00:01:24.930> video<00:01:25.200> recording<00:01:25.259> but<00:01:25.920> when<00:01:26.759> you're<00:01:27.030> in

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
1080p video recording but when you're in

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.510 
1080p video recording but when you're in
a<00:01:27.240> conference<00:01:27.750> or<00:01:27.990> call<00:01:28.470> or<00:01:28.500> whatever<00:01:28.770> it's

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
a conference or call or whatever it's

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.300 
a conference or call or whatever it's
720p<00:01:30.329> which<00:01:30.600> makes<00:01:30.869> no<00:01:30.930> sense<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.350> me<00:01:31.380> but<00:01:32.070> this

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
720p which makes no sense to me but this

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.010 
720p which makes no sense to me but this
one<00:01:32.549> right<00:01:32.850> now<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.240> about<00:01:33.360> ten<00:01:33.600> dollars<00:01:33.689> ten

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
one right now is about ten dollars ten

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.679 
one right now is about ten dollars ten
dollars<00:01:34.500> more<00:01:34.770> expensive<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.610> it's<00:01:36.360> nine<00:01:36.540> to

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
dollars more expensive so it's nine to

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.719 
dollars more expensive so it's nine to
nine<00:01:36.840> dollars<00:01:36.990> so<00:01:37.170> I'm<00:01:37.619> assuming<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.159> this

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
nine dollars so I'm assuming that this

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.910 
nine dollars so I'm assuming that this
one<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.180> somehow<00:01:39.509> better<00:01:39.869> especially<00:01:40.409> since

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
one is somehow better especially since

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.560 
one is somehow better especially since
everyone<00:01:41.340> always<00:01:41.549> brags<00:01:42.030> about<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.450> being

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
everyone always brags about it being

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.830 
everyone always brags about it being
better<00:01:43.880> I'm<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:44.970> gonna<00:01:45.180> go<00:01:45.390> ahead<00:01:45.600> and

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
better I'm just gonna go ahead and

the software as well so a lot they are

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.370 
the software as well so a lot they are
back<00:02:53.360> okay<00:02:54.360> so<00:02:54.480> both<00:02:54.690> of<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.900> webcams<00:02:55.230> are

plugged in as you can see right here

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.250 
plugged in as you can see right here
this<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.239> difference<00:02:57.540> on<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.780> right<00:02:58.110> we

the Logitech one and I worked on it for
like<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.100> half<00:03:08.340> hour<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:08.670> didn't<00:03:09.060> actually<00:03:09.239> get

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
like a half hour and didn't actually get

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.289 
like a half hour and didn't actually get
something<00:03:09.630> that<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:09.870> liked<00:03:10.140> but<00:03:10.829> um<00:03:11.100> I<00:03:11.549> enjoy

something that I liked but um I enjoy

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.150 
something that I liked but um I enjoy
the<00:03:12.750> stability<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.410> as<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.650> can<00:03:13.680> see<00:03:13.920> my

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
the stability of it as you can see my

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.350 
the stability of it as you can see my
roommates<00:03:14.400> playing<00:03:14.700> Starcraft<00:03:15.030> over<00:03:15.239> here

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
roommates playing Starcraft over here

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.690 
roommates playing Starcraft over here
and<00:03:15.450> bang<00:03:15.570> on<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.780> table<00:03:16.079> and<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.980> one<00:03:17.519> that<00:03:17.640> I

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
and bang on the table and the one that I

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.240 
and bang on the table and the one that I
usually<00:03:17.880> use<00:03:18.269> is<00:03:19.140> bouncing<00:03:19.620> around<00:03:19.709> also<00:03:20.160> the

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
usually use is bouncing around also the

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.920 
usually use is bouncing around also the
one<00:03:20.370> that<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.519> usually<00:03:20.640> use<00:03:20.820> does<00:03:21.329> seem<00:03:21.630> to<00:03:21.780> be

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
one that I usually use does seem to be

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.990 
one that I usually use does seem to be
lower<00:03:22.650> quality<00:03:23.190> and<00:03:23.220> that<00:03:23.489> it<00:03:23.640> has<00:03:23.760> some<00:03:23.970> kind

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
lower quality and that it has some kind

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.880 
lower quality and that it has some kind
of<00:03:24.239> gain<00:03:24.540> or<00:03:25.110> like<00:03:25.530> graininess<00:03:26.459> to<00:03:26.880> it<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.890> I

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890 
of gain or like graininess to it and I

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.650 
of gain or like graininess to it and I
think<00:03:29.700> actually<00:03:29.880> kind<00:03:30.150> of<00:03:30.180> makes<00:03:30.329> me<00:03:30.420> look

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
think actually kind of makes me look

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.810 
think actually kind of makes me look
worse<00:03:30.900> because<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:32.010> other<00:03:32.130> one<00:03:32.340> kind<00:03:32.640> of<00:03:32.730> has

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
worse because the other one kind of has

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.729 
worse because the other one kind of has
like<00:03:32.850> a<00:03:33.030> skin<00:03:33.420> softening<00:03:34.170> effect<00:03:34.290> or

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
like a skin softening effect or

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.080 
like a skin softening effect or
something<00:03:35.100> going<00:03:35.250> on<00:03:35.430> here<00:03:35.640> I'm<00:03:35.760> not<00:03:35.910> quite

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090

sure<00:03:36.120> but<00:03:36.480> um<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.769> feel<00:03:38.280> like<00:03:38.400> it's<00:03:38.549> okay<00:03:39.140> it

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
sure but um I feel like it's okay it

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.199 
sure but um I feel like it's okay it
seems<00:03:40.380> like<00:03:40.530> an<00:03:40.620> OK<00:03:40.890> webcam<00:03:41.250> I'm<00:03:41.519> just<00:03:41.970> not

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
seems like an OK webcam I'm just not

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.759 
seems like an OK webcam I'm just not
used<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.570> it<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:42.900> I<00:03:43.230> also<00:03:43.380> got<00:03:43.500> this<00:03:43.620> new

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
used to it and I also got this new

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.140 
used to it and I also got this new
monitor<00:03:44.070> so<00:03:44.280> everything<00:03:44.519> seems<00:03:44.760> really<00:03:44.970> weird

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
monitor so everything seems really weird

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.460 
monitor so everything seems really weird
but<00:03:45.359> I<00:03:45.420> guess<00:03:45.750> I'll<00:03:45.870> just<00:03:45.959> leave<00:03:46.109> it<00:03:46.230> to<00:03:46.350> you

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.960 
but I guess I'll just leave it to you
guys<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.620> decide<00:03:47.010> whether<00:03:47.190> or<00:03:47.310> not<00:03:47.459> you<00:03:47.700> like
