of it the only bummer here is that when

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.990 
of it the only bummer here is that when
you<00:03:06.080> continue<00:03:06.620> it<00:03:06.830> decreases<00:03:07.490> all<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.910> way

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
you continue it decreases all the way

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.470 
you continue it decreases all the way
back<00:03:08.240> down<00:03:08.300> to<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.810> standard<00:03:09.470> position<00:03:12.460> and

really only two settings to choose from

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.080

about the difficulty in valise for is

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.720 
about the difficulty in valise for is
that<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.200> game<00:03:27.380> is<00:03:27.560> pretty<00:03:27.830> reasonable<00:03:28.520> and

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
that the game is pretty reasonable and

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.230 

and<00:03:43.230> that's<00:03:44.130> not<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.460> say<00:03:44.640> that<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.910> entire

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
game up to that point is really really

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.760 
game up to that point is really really
easy<00:03:47.550> it<00:03:47.880> definitely<00:03:48.330> has<00:03:48.630> its<00:03:49.350> share<00:03:49.710> of

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
easy it definitely has its share of

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.010 
easy it definitely has its share of
overly<00:03:50.610> frustrating<00:03:51.300> moments<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:51.810> cheap

overly frustrating moments and cheap

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.380 
overly frustrating moments and cheap
deaths<00:03:52.410> it's<00:03:53.280> just<00:03:53.550> that<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.790> contrast

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
deaths it's just that the contrast

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.300 
deaths it's just that the contrast
between<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.870> actual<00:03:55.260> stages<00:03:56.010> you're<00:03:56.160> going

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:05.270 
to go through and the final boss fight
is<00:03:58.170> immense<00:04:03.170> the<00:04:04.170> difficulty<00:04:04.770> really<00:04:05.070> just

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
is immense the difficulty really just

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.340 
is immense the difficulty really just
boils<00:04:05.460> down<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:06.000> knowing<00:04:06.300> which<00:04:06.510> items<00:04:06.960> to<00:04:07.140> use

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
boils down to knowing which items to use

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.860 
boils down to knowing which items to use
and<00:04:07.680> where<00:04:08.070> to<00:04:08.130> use<00:04:08.310> them<00:04:08.790> especially<00:04:09.570> on<00:04:09.720> the

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
and where to use them especially on the

and where to use them especially on the
bosses<00:04:10.320> and<00:04:10.560> figuring<00:04:11.430> out<00:04:11.580> the<00:04:11.730> patterns<00:04:12.150> of

those bosses in order to progress once

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.599 
those bosses in order to progress once
you<00:04:15.660> get<00:04:15.840> those<00:04:15.990> the<00:04:16.200> first<00:04:16.440> time<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:17.220> rest<00:04:17.430> of

you get those the first time the rest of
the<00:04:17.700> game<00:04:17.880> is<00:04:18.090> fairly<00:04:18.900> simple<00:04:19.350> but<00:04:20.280> it<00:04:20.459> does

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
the game is fairly simple but it does

the game is fairly simple but it does

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
standard hack and slash action kind of a

bear funny thing about valles for I did
not<00:04:40.440> know<00:04:40.740> that<00:04:41.040> you<00:04:41.310> could<00:04:41.520> run<00:04:41.760> by

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
not know that you could run by

not know that you could run by
double-tapping<00:04:42.270> forward<00:04:42.960> to<00:04:43.140> extend<00:04:43.680> your

double-tapping forward to extend your
jump<00:04:43.860> until<00:04:44.220> probably<00:04:44.610> about<00:04:44.940> an<00:04:45.210> hour<00:04:45.420> into

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
the game up until then I kind of just

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.230 
the game up until then I kind of just
thought<00:04:49.800> that<00:04:50.010> all<00:04:50.220> of<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.580> jumps<00:04:51.060> in<00:04:51.210> the

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
thought that all of the jumps in the

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:58.690 
thought that all of the jumps in the
game<00:04:51.510> were<00:04:51.750> terribly<00:04:52.880> unforgiving<00:04:53.880> oops<00:04:54.840> I

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
Valles for I do think that the main

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.190 
Valles for I do think that the main
character<00:05:05.100> animates<00:05:06.000> really<00:05:06.510> well<00:05:06.690> and<00:05:06.990> I

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
character animates really well and I

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.440 
character animates really well and I
like<00:05:07.350> the<00:05:07.500> size<00:05:07.770> of<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.070> sprites<00:05:08.460> even<00:05:09.360> though

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
like the size of the sprites even though

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.360 
like the size of the sprites even though
there<00:05:09.600> aren't<00:05:09.780> that<00:05:10.080> many<00:05:10.160> enemies<00:05:11.160> to<00:05:11.340> choose

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
there aren't that many enemies to choose

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.040 
there aren't that many enemies to choose
from<00:05:11.790> you<00:05:11.880> really<00:05:12.120> don't<00:05:12.360> see<00:05:12.600> that<00:05:12.810> many

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050
