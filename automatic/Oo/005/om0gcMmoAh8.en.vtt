on is word of mouth and the quality of
it<00:06:24.940> rather<00:06:25.150> than<00:06:25.300> dumping<00:06:25.950> millions<00:06:26.950> of

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:27.310 
it rather than dumping millions of

it rather than dumping millions of
dollars<00:06:27.669> into<00:06:27.910> a<00:06:28.150> possible<00:06:28.930> fail<00:06:29.229> the<00:06:29.530> way

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
dollars into a possible fail the way

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.200 
dollars into a possible fail the way
that<00:06:29.830> Microsoft<00:06:30.610> pretty<00:06:30.850> much<00:06:30.970> does

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
that Microsoft pretty much does

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.279 
that Microsoft pretty much does
everything<00:06:31.570> they<00:06:31.870> own<00:06:32.160> so<00:06:33.160> I<00:06:33.930> want<00:06:34.930> to<00:06:35.050> try<00:06:35.260> it

00:06:35.279 --> 00:06:35.289 
everything they own so I want to try it

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:36.140 
everything they own so I want to try it
out

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
out

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.380 
out
now<00:06:36.830> like<00:06:37.830> I<00:06:37.950> said<00:06:37.980> the<00:06:38.280> kinect<00:06:38.610> it's<00:06:39.060> just<00:06:39.300> a

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.390 
now like I said the kinect it's just a

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.980 
now like I said the kinect it's just a
camera<00:06:39.660> that's<00:06:40.290> all<00:06:40.590> this<00:06:40.830> and<00:06:41.160> it<00:06:41.400> can<00:06:41.580> as

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:41.990 
camera that's all this and it can as

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.810 
camera that's all this and it can as
maybe<00:06:42.990> I<00:06:43.110> think<00:06:43.470> two<00:06:43.770> cameras<00:06:44.250> or<00:06:44.430> something<00:06:44.730> I

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
maybe I think two cameras or something I

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.050 
maybe I think two cameras or something I
don't<00:06:44.880> know<00:06:45.060> all<00:06:45.120> the<00:06:45.300> goofy<00:06:45.690> shit<00:06:45.870> in<00:06:46.020> it<00:06:46.110> I

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.060 
don't know all the goofy shit in it I

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.150 
don't know all the goofy shit in it I
don't<00:06:48.060> see<00:06:48.450> a<00:06:48.480> reason<00:06:48.750> why<00:06:49.170> the<00:06:49.440> Kinect<00:06:50.040> is

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 
don't see a reason why the Kinect is

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.590 
don't see a reason why the Kinect is
anything<00:06:50.520> more<00:06:50.700> special<00:06:51.180> than<00:06:51.210> the<00:06:51.390> regular

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600 
anything more special than the regular

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.990 
anything more special than the regular
PlayStation<00:06:52.500> Eye<00:06:52.620> camera<00:06:52.680> and<00:06:53.310> I<00:06:53.520> think<00:06:53.790> just

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 
PlayStation Eye camera and I think just

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.450 
PlayStation Eye camera and I think just
as<00:06:54.120> a<00:06:54.150> slight<00:06:54.540> to<00:06:54.720> Mike<00:06:54.900> to<00:06:55.530> Microsoft<00:06:56.310> you're

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:56.460 
as a slight to Mike to Microsoft you're

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.740 
as a slight to Mike to Microsoft you're
going<00:06:56.580> to<00:06:56.670> see<00:06:56.760> Sony<00:06:57.000> have<00:06:57.180> games<00:06:57.390> come<00:06:57.600> out
