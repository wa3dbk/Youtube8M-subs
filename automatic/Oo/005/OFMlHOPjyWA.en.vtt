00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:05.680 
when working in Maya it is always best

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.800 
when working in Maya it is always best
practice<00:00:05.770> to<00:00:06.279> keep<00:00:06.430> your<00:00:06.490> scene<00:00:06.880> organized<00:00:07.450> so

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:07.810 
practice to keep your scene organized so

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:10.080 
practice to keep your scene organized so
you<00:00:07.870> can<00:00:08.109> locate<00:00:08.260> your<00:00:08.620> objects<00:00:09.070> faster<00:00:09.520> and

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.090 
you can locate your objects faster and

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.100 
you can locate your objects faster and
manipulate<00:00:10.720> them<00:00:10.900> more<00:00:11.110> efficiently<00:00:11.590> a

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
manipulate them more efficiently a

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.480 
manipulate them more efficiently a
simple<00:00:14.110> way<00:00:14.200> to<00:00:14.230> do<00:00:14.500> this<00:00:14.679> is<00:00:14.950> by<00:00:15.130> linking

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
simple way to do this is by linking

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.609 
simple way to do this is by linking
objects<00:00:15.910> together<00:00:16.209> either<00:00:16.689> as<00:00:17.020> parents<00:00:17.470> or

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
objects together either as parents or

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.200 
objects together either as parents or
groups<00:00:19.710> here<00:00:20.710> we<00:00:21.100> have<00:00:21.250> a<00:00:21.279> messy<00:00:21.550> study<00:00:21.939> room

with lots of books that need to be put
away<00:00:25.109> let's<00:00:26.109> start<00:00:26.470> with<00:00:26.619> the<00:00:26.710> closed<00:00:26.980> book<00:00:27.220> on

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:27.460 
away let's start with the closed book on

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.080 
away let's start with the closed book on
the<00:00:27.640> Ottoman<00:00:29.250> although<00:00:30.250> it<00:00:30.400> may<00:00:30.580> appear<00:00:30.609> as

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:31.090 
the Ottoman although it may appear as

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.250 
the Ottoman although it may appear as
one<00:00:31.269> solid<00:00:31.480> object

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:32.260 
one solid object

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.110 
one solid object
the<00:00:32.559> outliner<00:00:32.980> shows<00:00:33.370> it<00:00:33.610> is<00:00:33.699> actually

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
the outliner shows it is actually

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.840 
the outliner shows it is actually
comprised<00:00:34.540> of<00:00:34.719> multiple<00:00:34.899> parts<00:00:35.670> such<00:00:36.670> as<00:00:36.820> a

corners to move this book around the way
it<00:00:43.090> is<00:00:43.239> right<00:00:43.390> now<00:00:43.450> we<00:00:44.170> would<00:00:44.320> have<00:00:44.500> to<00:00:44.649> select

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
it is right now we would have to select

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.100 
it is right now we would have to select
all<00:00:45.250> these<00:00:45.489> individual<00:00:46.030> parts<00:00:46.329> first<00:00:46.600> which

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
all these individual parts first which

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.450 
all these individual parts first which
is<00:00:47.260> a<00:00:47.289> bit<00:00:47.469> cumbersome<00:00:49.230> also<00:00:50.230> if<00:00:50.559> each<00:00:50.950> object

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
is a bit cumbersome also if each object

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.860 
is a bit cumbersome also if each object
has<00:00:51.520> its<00:00:51.820> pivot<00:00:52.239> at<00:00:52.360> a<00:00:52.390> different<00:00:52.780> location

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.170 

to<00:01:01.470> get<00:01:01.620> around<00:01:01.830> these<00:01:02.040> two<00:01:02.220> problems<00:01:02.730> will

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
to get around these two problems will

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.939 
to get around these two problems will
create<00:01:03.450> parent-child<00:01:04.200> relationships

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949

these elements together as we've done so
far<00:02:16.040> but<00:02:16.940> this<00:02:17.120> would<00:02:17.300> make<00:02:17.480> it<00:02:17.510> hard<00:02:17.900> to
