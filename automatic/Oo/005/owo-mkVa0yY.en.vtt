00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.869 
way
once<00:02:39.450> you<00:02:39.599> have<00:02:39.750> your<00:02:39.840> intersecting<00:02:40.500> lines

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
once you have your intersecting lines

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.940 
once you have your intersecting lines
we're<00:02:41.879> going<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.060> tie<00:02:42.329> these<00:02:42.409> threads<00:02:43.409> into<00:02:43.739> a

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
we're going to tie these threads into a

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:52.699 
we're going to tie these threads into a
loop<00:02:44.250> at<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.519> top<00:02:47.120> just<00:02:48.120> like<00:02:48.299> this<00:02:51.709> and

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
loop at the top just like this and

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.459 
loop at the top just like this and
that's<00:02:52.889> how<00:02:53.040> we'll<00:02:53.099> hang<00:02:53.400> our<00:02:53.549> mobile<00:02:54.469> once

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:55.469 
that's how we'll hang our mobile once

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:57.530 
that's how we'll hang our mobile once
your<00:02:55.620> frame<00:02:55.859> is<00:02:56.099> ready<00:02:56.340> it's<00:02:57.000> time<00:02:57.269> to

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
your frame is ready it's time to

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.140 
your frame is ready it's time to
assemble<00:02:58.019> the<00:02:58.319> mobile<00:02:58.650> I<00:02:58.859> like<00:02:59.549> to<00:02:59.730> start<00:02:59.970> by

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
assemble the mobile I like to start by

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.240 
assemble the mobile I like to start by
hanging<00:03:00.420> one<00:03:00.689> of<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.930> clouds<00:03:01.200> from<00:03:02.189> the

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
hanging one of the clouds from the

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:10.149 
hanging one of the clouds from the
center<00:03:07.400> once<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.519> have<00:03:08.609> the<00:03:08.730> central<00:03:09.060> cloud

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
center once you have the central cloud

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:16.210 
center once you have the central cloud
attached<00:03:12.079> trim<00:03:13.079> the<00:03:13.230> excess<00:03:13.530> fishing<00:03:13.919> wire

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:23.000 

and<00:03:17.220> now<00:03:17.459> you<00:03:17.519> just<00:03:17.879> start<00:03:18.780> tying<00:03:19.019> them<00:03:19.319> on

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.649 

well<00:03:23.519> I<00:03:23.550> don't<00:03:23.640> know<00:03:23.819> about<00:03:23.909> you<00:03:24.120> guys<00:03:24.269> but<00:03:24.330> for

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:24.659 
well I don't know about you guys but for

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.270 
well I don't know about you guys but for
under<00:03:24.900> $5<00:03:25.470> I<00:03:25.650> think<00:03:25.830> that<00:03:25.980> would<00:03:26.099> make<00:03:26.220> a

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
under $5 I think that would make a

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.430 
under $5 I think that would make a
pretty<00:03:26.610> cute<00:03:26.940> addition<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.629> just<00:03:27.840> about<00:03:28.140> any

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
pretty cute addition to just about any

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.750 
pretty cute addition to just about any
room<00:03:30.950> that's<00:03:31.950> it<00:03:32.099> for<00:03:32.280> this<00:03:32.370> week's<00:03:32.610> episode
