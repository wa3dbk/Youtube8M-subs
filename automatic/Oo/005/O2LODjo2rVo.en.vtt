00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
flora not as long as the spices maybe

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.050 
flora not as long as the spices maybe
only<00:02:54.239> about<00:02:54.450> 30<00:02:54.840> seconds<00:02:55.290> for<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.530> flower

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
only about 30 seconds for the flower

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.229 
only about 30 seconds for the flower
because<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.239> really<00:02:57.660> will<00:02:57.900> catch<00:02:58.650> very<00:02:59.609> very<00:02:59.880> ok

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
because I really will catch very very ok

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.240 
because I really will catch very very ok
now<00:03:00.630> if<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.810> look<00:03:00.989> at<00:03:01.109> the<00:03:01.200> bottom<00:03:01.799> of<00:03:01.859> a<00:03:01.980> pan

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
now if you look at the bottom of a pan

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.940 
now if you look at the bottom of a pan
you<00:03:02.850> can<00:03:02.880> see<00:03:03.299> that<00:03:03.660> nothing<00:03:04.019> has<00:03:04.380> stuck<00:03:04.709> there

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950
