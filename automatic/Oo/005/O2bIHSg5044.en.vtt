00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.929

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.670
 readers mail number I am 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.010
 celine your coach in seduction and this 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.070
 week i answer to williams who told us 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.599
 asked how to break class with the 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.009
 first thing to know william this is 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.410
 that there is never a good time for 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.240
 go back there is always a death of a 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.369
 close still has a review there is 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.230
 always one I'm not fine this is 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.990
 never the right moment to break up and you 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.699
 shalt thy sad girlfriend anyway 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.949
 come on unless she knows it's okay 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.060
 end unless it feels even 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.830
 more very well in this relationship 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.350
 for a while so it does not take 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.989
 not hesitate we talk about breaking it 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.059
 must it be net we do not break through 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.710
 texto one does not break by email will have 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.550
 not by a change of status facebook 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.430
 we do not break in a few ways that 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.010
 this is except opposite landes a real 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.710
 conversation with the girl concerned 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.440
 obviously an ad to anyone 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.120
 the break before it is effective 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.039
 you are not going to put all your friends 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.539
 current and then break them with the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.250
 girl that's when he goes there 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.170
 to have leaks and it will drop you 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.299
 it's really not classy 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.310
 absolutely avoid that kind of 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.229
 behavior so a real 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.659
 conversation how are we doing to have 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.880
 correctly a real conversation either 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.060
 in a neutral place 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.670
 a bar a restaurant a park no matter 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.170
 but when not at home not at home not 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.030
 in an environment that will remind him 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.240
 a little bit your story is on the contrary 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.479
 at home or at home if you need 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.100
 then to go do that at home if 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.380
 you 'd rather it be she who go 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.909
 call here at home if you live 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.979
 together it will be a bit more complicated 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.350
 in this case it is better to privilege 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.600
 a neutral place 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.149
 usually we summarize this phase of 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.710
 break with a single sentence do not do 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.720
 not to others what you would not like 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.790
 let him make you try to do that 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.829
 with as many classes as possible with 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.630
 more delicacy possible do not lie 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.869
 if you have someone else in your life 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.240
 tell him do not try to protect her 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.680
 do not try to hide things 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.969
 will inevitably find on it but it is 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.350
 where she will feel betrayed 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.729
 you can tell him you do more 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.320
 feelings for her I can confess to her 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.390
 that you will meet someone but the 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.300
 famous more honest possible 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.319
 with her the last important point to 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.270
 take into account 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:17.400
 it's a reputation why it's worth 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.890
 the better you break with class is because 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.709
 that your reputation she will follow you and 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.590
 if you ditched by text located broke 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.690
 by simply stakeholders endorsing who 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.940
 tried girlfriends without any explanation 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.830
 it's not that he has more class and that 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.780
 risk to follow you ah well yes it's 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.060
 williams and the guy he's used to 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.640
 break up by sending a simple letter and 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.890
 giving never again news 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.320
 think of your reputation that will help 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.030
 move from one social circle to another 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.489
 will maybe go out with a 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.150
 girl of the same group without having a dirty 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.430
 reputation 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.110
