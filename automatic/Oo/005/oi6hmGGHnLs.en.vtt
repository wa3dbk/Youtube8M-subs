00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
amber I'm going to compare only the

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.619 
amber I'm going to compare only the
cameras<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.730> reason<00:00:39.000> why<00:00:39.120> I'm<00:00:39.270> comparing

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
cameras the reason why I'm comparing

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.380 
cameras the reason why I'm comparing
them<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.219> because<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.399> found<00:00:41.670> some<00:00:42.210> people

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
them is because I found some people

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.990 
them is because I found some people
talking<00:00:42.870> about<00:00:43.230> oh<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:44.250> nokia<00:00:44.550> was<00:00:44.579> supposed

supposed to fix the exposure problems oh

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.510 
supposed to fix the exposure problems oh
my<00:00:50.850> god<00:00:51.059> they<00:00:51.329> haven't<00:00:51.539> fixed<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:52.160> so<00:00:53.160> let's

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
my god they haven't fixed that so let's

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.180 
my god they haven't fixed that so let's
see<00:00:53.670> whether<00:00:53.940> any<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.899> have<00:00:55.469> been<00:00:55.739> solved

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
see whether any of this have been solved

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.069 
see whether any of this have been solved
between<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:56.969> two<00:00:57.149> first<00:00:57.660> I'm<00:00:57.809> going<00:00:57.989> to

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
between the two first I'm going to

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.700 
between the two first I'm going to
compare<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.800> 5<00:00:59.609> megapixel<00:00:59.789> pictures<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.960> both

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
compare the 5 megapixel pictures of both

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.520 
compare the 5 megapixel pictures of both
the<00:01:01.920> phones<00:01:02.160> because<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.510> 5<00:01:03.719> megapixel<00:01:03.899> is

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
the phones because the 5 megapixel is

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.780 
the phones because the 5 megapixel is
the<00:01:04.860> most<00:01:05.729> process<00:01:06.180> photos<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.869> let's<00:01:07.470> see

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
the most process photos and let's see

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.370 
the most process photos and let's see
where<00:01:08.790> they<00:01:08.970> stand<00:01:10.700> in<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:12.330> photo<00:01:12.570> 1020<00:01:13.140> is

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
where they stand in this photo 1020 is

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.100 
where they stand in this photo 1020 is
over<00:01:13.860> exposing<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.490> flowers<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.110> whereas

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
over exposing the flowers and whereas

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.179 
over exposing the flowers and whereas
1520<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:17.150> exposing<00:01:18.150> them<00:01:18.330> beautifully<00:01:18.869> and

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
1520 is exposing them beautifully and

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.649 
1520 is exposing them beautifully and
see<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.340> difference<00:01:20.700> between<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.360> sharpness

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
see the difference between the sharpness

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.440 
see the difference between the sharpness
and<00:01:22.049> exposure<00:01:22.880> some<00:01:23.880> people<00:01:24.180> might<00:01:24.420> be

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
and exposure some people might be

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.749 
and exposure some people might be
thinking<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:25.110> probably<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.680> 1020<00:01:26.189> photo<00:01:26.400> is

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
thinking that probably the 1020 photo is

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.289 
thinking that probably the 1020 photo is
not<00:01:27.270> properly<00:01:28.259> focused<00:01:29.130> that's<00:01:29.549> why<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:30.090> is

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
not properly focused that's why it is

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.719 
not properly focused that's why it is
like<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:31.290> but<00:01:31.799> let<00:01:31.979> me<00:01:32.100> show<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.549> full

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
like that but let me show you the full

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.090 
like that but let me show you the full
resolution<00:01:32.909> picture<00:01:33.630> where<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.799> picture

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
resolution picture where the picture

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.969 
resolution picture where the picture
looks<00:01:35.369> pretty<00:01:35.850> much<00:01:36.030> similar<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.979> however

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
looks pretty much similar and however

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:41.990 
looks pretty much similar and however
the<00:01:38.189> most<00:01:38.970> process<00:01:39.930> 5<00:01:40.590> megapixel<00:01:41.220> looks<00:01:41.549> much

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
the most process 5 megapixel looks much

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.950 
the most process 5 megapixel looks much
much<00:01:42.210> better<00:01:42.450> on<00:01:42.750> 1520<00:01:43.740> that's<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:45.090> that's

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
much better on 1520 that's the that's

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.859 
much better on 1520 that's the that's
only<00:01:46.140> because<00:01:46.340> thanks<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.610> GTA<00:01:48.060> 3<00:01:48.420> update

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
and better full resolution 1024 is also

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.510 
and better full resolution 1024 is also
sharp

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
sharp

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.690 
sharp

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
notice how the full resolution photos

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.150 
notice how the full resolution photos
are<00:02:58.520> very<00:02:58.550> sharp<00:02:59.030> on<00:02:59.240> both<00:02:59.830> same<00:03:00.830> is<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.130> case

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
are very sharp on both same is the case

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.150

with this photo as well which means that

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.760 
with this photo as well which means that
five<00:03:04.730> megapixel<00:03:05.330> shot<00:03:05.570> is<00:03:05.810> much<00:03:06.200> much<00:03:06.500> better

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770
