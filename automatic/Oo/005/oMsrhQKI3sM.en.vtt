offensive playbook and the Seahawks a

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.640 
offensive playbook and the Seahawks a
defensive<00:00:09.870> playbook<00:00:10.170> it<00:00:10.290> should<00:00:10.440> be<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.559> very

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
defensive playbook it should be a very

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.950 
defensive playbook it should be a very
good<00:00:11.330> combination<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.450> still<00:00:12.630> got<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.809> figure

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
good combination I still got to figure

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.240 
good combination I still got to figure
out<00:00:13.080> exactly<00:00:13.500> what<00:00:13.650> I'm<00:00:13.740> going<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.889> run<00:00:14.040> in<00:00:14.190> the

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
out exactly what I'm going to run in the

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:15.499 
out exactly what I'm going to run in the
sea<00:00:14.400> I'll<00:00:14.490> explain<00:00:14.730> but<00:00:14.849> hopefully<00:00:15.269> we<00:00:15.360> can

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
sea I'll explain but hopefully we can

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.880 
sea I'll explain but hopefully we can
you<00:00:15.719> know<00:00:16.049> figure<00:00:16.350> it<00:00:16.410> out<00:00:16.500> throughout<00:00:16.770> the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
you know figure it out throughout the

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.740 
you know figure it out throughout the
season<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.910> get<00:00:18.119> very<00:00:18.270> very<00:00:18.480> good<00:00:18.660> with

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
season and I get very very good with

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.150 
season and I get very very good with
that<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:18.960> 49ers<00:00:19.380> offense<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.770> something<00:00:20.039> I'm

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
that the 49ers offense is something I'm

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.769 
that the 49ers offense is something I'm
very<00:00:20.189> familiar<00:00:20.640> with<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.480> think<00:00:21.570> I'm<00:00:21.689> gonna

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
very familiar with so I think I'm gonna

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.300 
very familiar with so I think I'm gonna
have<00:00:21.869> a<00:00:21.960> good<00:00:22.109> time<00:00:22.170> with<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.710> playbook<00:00:23.160> but

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
have a good time with that playbook but

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.009 
have a good time with that playbook but
let's<00:00:23.490> hop<00:00:23.670> right<00:00:23.699> into<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.150> first<00:00:24.300> game<00:00:24.600> this

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
let's hop right into the first game this

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.330 
let's hop right into the first game this
is<00:00:25.170> our<00:00:25.320> second<00:00:25.650> season<00:00:25.890> with<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.099> bun<00:00:26.250> too

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
is our second season with the bun too

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.790 
is our second season with the bun too
much<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.580> think<00:00:26.609> we're<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:26.910> rookie<00:00:27.840> sucky<00:00:28.560> first

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
much I think we're in rookie sucky first

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.410 
much I think we're in rookie sucky first
string<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.039> should<00:00:29.189> say<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:29.550> hopefully<00:00:30.210> we<00:00:30.300> can

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
string I should say so hopefully we can

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.749 
string I should say so hopefully we can
steamroll<00:00:30.990> through<00:00:31.199> some<00:00:32.040> people<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.550> get

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
steamroll through some people and get

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.670 
steamroll through some people and get
some<00:00:32.940> good<00:00:33.329> wins<00:00:33.540> here<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.020> need<00:00:34.170> six<00:00:34.469> wins

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
some good wins here so we need six wins

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.110 
some good wins here so we need six wins
to<00:00:34.829> get<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:34.980> playoff<00:00:35.250> berth<00:00:35.280> eight<00:00:35.670> wins<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.000> get

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
to get a playoff berth eight wins to get

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.330 
to get a playoff berth eight wins to get
a<00:00:36.149> first-round<00:00:36.480> bye<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:37.620> each<00:00:37.739> when<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.190> get

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
a first-round bye in each when we get

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.280 
a first-round bye in each when we get
one<00:00:38.550> pro<00:00:38.790> pack<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.329> if<00:00:39.510> obviously<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.110> get<00:00:40.260> a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
one pro pack and if obviously we get a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.139 
one pro pack and if obviously we get a
win<00:00:40.469> streak<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:41.129> could<00:00:41.160> increase<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.910> amount

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
win streak we could increase the amount

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.060 
win streak we could increase the amount
of<00:00:42.180> packs<00:00:42.390> we<00:00:42.540> get<00:00:42.690> for<00:00:42.899> those<00:00:42.989> wins<00:00:43.290> so

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
of packs we get for those wins so

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.260 
of packs we get for those wins so
hopefully<00:00:44.219> we<00:00:44.399> can<00:00:44.520> get<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.760> win<00:00:44.910> streak<00:00:44.940> but

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
hopefully we can get on a win streak but

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.580 
hopefully we can get on a win streak but
let's<00:00:45.450> hop<00:00:45.629> right<00:00:45.750> into<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.079> first<00:00:46.260> game<00:00:46.440> it

counter play to Franco right here

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.690 
counter play to Franco right here
hopefully<00:02:42.560> this<00:02:42.680> works<00:02:42.830> now<00:02:42.980> for<00:02:43.250> us<00:02:43.340> Franco

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700

00:06:07.769 --> 00:06:07.779 
don't know what that was all about he

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:08.670 
don't know what that was all about he
was<00:06:07.900> playing<00:06:08.080> a<00:06:08.169> pretty<00:06:08.349> good<00:06:08.500> game<00:06:08.620> i

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
was playing a pretty good game i

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.079 
was playing a pretty good game i
actually<00:06:09.370> thought<00:06:09.520> he<00:06:09.580> was<00:06:09.819> doing<00:06:09.940> better

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:10.089 
actually thought he was doing better

00:06:10.089 --> 00:06:13.110 
actually thought he was doing better
than<00:06:10.449> I<00:06:10.599> was<00:06:10.839> but<00:06:11.650> that<00:06:11.710> pic<00:06:12.129> I<00:06:12.339> guess<00:06:12.759> he

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 
than I was but that pic I guess he

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.420 
than I was but that pic I guess he
couldn't<00:06:13.750> handle<00:06:13.990> it<00:06:14.080> so<00:06:14.139> he<00:06:14.889> disconnected

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
couldn't handle it so he disconnected

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.010 
couldn't handle it so he disconnected
his<00:06:15.550> ethernet<00:06:15.699> cord<00:06:16.150> and<00:06:16.270> I'll<00:06:16.360> take<00:06:16.599> the<00:06:16.810> win

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
his ethernet cord and I'll take the win

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.320 
his ethernet cord and I'll take the win
I<00:06:17.050> guess<00:06:17.349> that's<00:06:17.620> kind<00:06:17.830> of<00:06:17.889> odd<00:06:18.069> I<00:06:18.370> was<00:06:19.150> in<00:06:19.240> a

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
I guess that's kind of odd I was in a

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.999 
I guess that's kind of odd I was in a
good<00:06:19.479> position<00:06:19.629> of<00:06:19.990> course<00:06:20.139> because<00:06:20.680> of<00:06:20.710> the

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:21.009 
good position of course because of the

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:22.860 
good position of course because of the
interception<00:06:21.520> but<00:06:21.699> he<00:06:22.300> was<00:06:22.419> getting<00:06:22.629> ball<00:06:22.779> at

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
interception but he was getting ball at

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:24.089 
interception but he was getting ball at
half<00:06:23.050> time<00:06:23.080> he<00:06:23.440> was<00:06:23.560> probably<00:06:23.740> in<00:06:23.889> a<00:06:23.949> better

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:24.099 
half time he was probably in a better

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:26.490 
half time he was probably in a better
position<00:06:24.279> overall<00:06:24.909> then<00:06:25.240> I<00:06:25.330> was<00:06:25.539> but<00:06:25.779> like<00:06:26.349> I

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
position overall then I was but like I

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.600 
position overall then I was but like I
said<00:06:26.560> I'm<00:06:26.740> going<00:06:26.889> to<00:06:26.979> take<00:06:27.190> it<00:06:27.250> i'm<00:06:27.430> going<00:06:27.550> to
