00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.650
 greetings guardians today I bring you one 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:13.530
 Osiris maps guide are already going 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.690
 to try to be weekly if you are going 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.090
 I like to bring it weekly every time 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.970
 that they put the restart 2 go and change 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.740
 the maps and that I'm going to show you in this 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.310
 guide I will recommend the weapons that I 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.130
 I usually put the best ones that can go 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.420
 and I hope that with fairness you give him 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.890
 many that you leave in the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:37.200
 comments for the three ranges good yo 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.270
 the souls that I recommend would be weapons of 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.220
 medium distance since this map is not very 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.760
 long nor does it have very many spaces 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.950
 closed but they do have some pairs 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.809
 we disappear right here where we 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.860
 yes it's better to take a 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.510
 shotgun and weapons like that from medium distance 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.370
 what I usually recommend and those that 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.620
 I always carry the red death or the 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.360
 messenger I like more the red death already 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.430
 that has a little bit more decay than 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.960
 it looks good here you see that the organism 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.390
 my partner must be very careful 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.130
 if killing him a fran cube that does not 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.950
 they are pointing he tells us if to be 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.020
 pointing or not and we encourage them because that 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.299
 give you a free leave and we do not want 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.549
 that they remember the super faster 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.280
 enemies and not well good 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.039
 whenever we see that there are two or three 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.869
 together we have to go the whole team to 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:27.960
 for them to sack because if you do not give them 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.560
 time to cheer up everyone and not no 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.780
 it can be 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.189
 good for the heavy one if you show up here I 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:39.130
 I recommend it is to distribute one that goes 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:41.560
 in or two out or one or two that 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.180
 go inside and one out here with a 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.899
 with luck I had the super gave me 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.030
 time to load it fast and as you can see if 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.060
 you have the super me that I recommend the 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.950
 class for coffee the knives 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.289
 with the third grenade the grenade 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.649
 suitable projectiles that is the best without 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:02.080
 doubt later you will see how well 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:06.520
 bushes is grenade because it's a check 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.590
 and a lot and also the fleeting blow 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.269
 that kills with a blow if you give in the 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.709
 back the one that does more damage if you give him 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.060
 an enemy in the back 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.280
 that blow has a problem and that is 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.470
 it was very broken has a little and it is that 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.620
 whenever you give someone 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.180
 many times you look for others not and 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.250
 it counts as having turned his back 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.349
 as you see here that he took 300 and 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.790
 come on we thought it almost gave you a 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.799
 skirt 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:34.810
 good and you see what I'm eating 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.489
 rosso this is also one thing that the 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.319
 people are doing a lot and that is if you see 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.659
 that has more grimoire than they have 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.790
 better weapons that they leave in the middle 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.220
 of the game when it is loading the 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.890
 map that yes the accesses go if they are 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.739
 harming people do not go temporarily 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.620
 but you can way 24 hours a day 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.389
 without playing the crucible and is a bitch like that 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.920
 you have the only day to play and it's 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:03:01.310
 you better not do it 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.170
 here you see what I recommend is to go if 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.180
 appears is there is to go through here by the 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.450
 alley where he put me and he caught me 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.940
 Unsuspecting titan and bad for hair 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:13.220
 thank goodness my teammates are good 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.730
 they have been we have been 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.550
 disassemble 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.470
 good here beige but anima shook the 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.569
 flirty flirtatious and that tonight 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.090
 is on this map and can carry a 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.930
 good shotgun with you can inflate 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.930
 very much 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:35.040
 and if you usually appear to you too 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.120
 Well, if you carry sniper or shotgun 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.170
 yes yes you can click 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.080
 very much 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.690
 well here you see I come here 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.820
 tried to hook to see if they come but 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.980
 I 'm not telling you, I'm going to get your back 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:50.680
 since my colleagues told me 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.740
 that were there back I went with the 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.319
 super already I loaded them there to this and this 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.689
 they take it from me 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.329
 also try to leave the companions 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:02.519
 if they have super patios generate the orbs 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.139
 good and with the sorcerer I am if I 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.420
 I feel a lot for the titan is that I do not 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.400
 I have titan and I could not have a class 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.920
 the tita I what I usually take pay 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.750
 chicero is this I did it recently and 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.459
 I do not have the vacuum unlocked and 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.250
 you add good to the emptiness 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:20.099
 to be able to carry the vacuum the grenade of 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.000
 soles this one is very tied although not what 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.410
 look like 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.440
 since I'm going to do a demonstration of 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.020
 how he saved the game and my classmates 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.050
 with this grenade so you can see the good 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.120
 it's good they kill us both here 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.370
 they come here have done well and have 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.440
 come to sack for me only that I had 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.389
 the grenades these six saved me 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.370
 let them go how good they are one dies 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.770
 with the pulse rifle was already touched 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.370
 another with the grenade already by the last 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:49.080
 we all go in sack for him 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.620
 to see how good I am, you can 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.389
 throw when there is a light from an enemy 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.490
 so you will not be able to cheer her up 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.319
 there and they will not be able to cheer if 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.000
 try 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:03.069
 surely they will die 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.280
 ammunition ammunition what diego 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:09.639
 you can come here and try to follow 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.639
 to the enemies and give them 3 to the 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:14.110
 activities of the three go for them and 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:16.389
 also what I recommend you take 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.219
 machine gun rocket launchers not because the 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.139
 People always carry rocket launchers 

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:22.030
 and come on if you carry a machine gun 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.189
 they have a rocket is that the truth 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.830
 that you have nothing to do or have very 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:29.409
 bad precision you do not have much luck or 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.139
 it's not worth it to take it to the 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:33.699
 true as also the second the map and 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:36.639
 according to what the enemies carry 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:38.139
 it's also good to examine them before 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.889
 start the game to know each 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.620
 one what it takes 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:44.819
 and well then after this life that 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:49.030
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:50.740
 I will bring you more next week and I will 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.169
 I'm going to leave with a couple of clips that 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.300
 I could record this Friday we have 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.639
 done already the three passes that is subject 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.610
 passion has gone well on this map since 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:02.139
 what a little teeny with shotguns 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.300
 and with the francs, the truth is that 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.580
 very good to look at the projectile grenade 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:09.430
 igneous than just give them a glasses 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.979
 yells or a hand cannon shot and the 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.449
 strips because they die instantly 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:15.400
 so you can see how good this is 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:18.460
 Granada where I most recommend and 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.229
 that has a great damage of good scope 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.449
 I'm going to leave with these clips that I could 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:24.550
 record good and see you in the 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.580
 frontiers guardians but that you have 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.580
 liked
