or<00:02:10.000> unselect<00:02:10.690> those<00:02:11.500> creatures<00:02:11.800> that<00:02:11.980> for<00:02:12.310> the

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
or unselect those creatures that for the

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.910 
or unselect those creatures that for the
time<00:02:12.640> managed<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.450> escape<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:14.050> simply<00:02:14.800> by

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
time managed to escape it simply by

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.700 
time managed to escape it simply by

surviving due to their genes and their

interaction with the current environment

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.980

so<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:21.700> basically<00:02:21.940> have<00:02:22.420> some<00:02:22.690> slightly

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
so you basically have some slightly

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.200 
so you basically have some slightly
different<00:02:23.530> genes<00:02:23.830> in<00:02:24.100> different<00:02:24.670> individuals

different genes in different individuals

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.510 
different genes in different individuals
and<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:26.290> have<00:02:26.440> different<00:02:26.680> environments<00:02:27.430> in

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
and you have different environments in

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.200 
and you have different environments in
different<00:02:27.880> places<00:02:28.620> now<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:30.310> environment<00:02:30.940> can

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
different places now the environment can

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.740 
different places now the environment can
change<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.870> usually<00:02:32.410> does<00:02:32.680> eventually<00:02:33.750> then

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
change and usually does eventually then

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.080 
change and usually does eventually then
you<00:02:34.870> have<00:02:34.990> death<00:02:35.320> that<00:02:36.090> inevitable

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
you have death that inevitable

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.540 
you have death that inevitable
phenomenon<00:02:37.780> in<00:02:37.930> nature<00:02:38.260> that<00:02:38.560> irreversibly

phenomenon in nature that irreversibly

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.610 
phenomenon in nature that irreversibly
effects<00:02:40.420> life<00:02:40.660> in<00:02:40.990> a<00:02:41.080> rather<00:02:41.290> negative

fashion<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.940> ends<00:02:43.360> life<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:44.620> death<00:02:44.800> can<00:02:44.980> be

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130
