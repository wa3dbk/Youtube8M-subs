00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.210
 the bingen wrestler club was in 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.500

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.930

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.309
 successful wrestler how proud makes 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.660
 then personally in your own 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.720
 to have founded a ring association 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.720
 that makes me proud, really proud 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.430
 in no time you can see how many 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:11.020
 Wrestlers are also so many kids that it 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.130
 comes from life when you see one 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.070
 winning a medal that makes me 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.840
 proud because my active time is over 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.060
 for the titles are now others 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.470
 responsible is the wertinger ringer association 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.090
 really multicultural 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.850
 the athletes come from around ten 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.840
 nations iran turkey germany the 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.790
 Mix is ​​colorful 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.830
 That's why the club has that too 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.610
 word integration big on the flag 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.070
 written because many people are here 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.859
 come we are from others 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.909
 countries , however, we can only 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:42.920
 no german speaking 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.180
 we automatically come to us here in 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.330
 the hall because 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.450
 Over time he learned German and we 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.400
 help them too so when you 're in here 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.610
 Germany behaves as one does 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.830
 integrated and how to be in the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.960
 hall behave so that ring requires 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.300
 a lot of discipline and respectful treatment 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.020
 values ​​the club also for everyday life 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.020
 wants to convey 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.600
 The wrestling is one of the 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.880
 most traditional sports ever 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.770
 already at the first olympic games 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.100
 the new age was the sport in the program 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:29.200
 when wrestling there are two styles 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.970
 Greek Roman and freestyle trainer 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.380
 Armati Anna Marie runs the sport 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.090
 for 30 years 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.360
 He explains where exactly the difference 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.130
 was in discipline there are differences 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:44.230
 then it is so funny and free 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:46.750
 that he meant weird from above 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.440
 the hands that you can move and allowed 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.240
 really can not take the foot and 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.160
 freestyle means that ralf 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.880
 cobbler can also move and then 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.709
 It does not matter if freestyle or greek 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.660
 Roman goal is and remains the same 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.430
 opponents on the back then 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.250
 you win the fight to do that 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.440
 the body is required a lot of technology 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.200
 All speed will be there 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.370
 rain trained it is really very 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:18.160
 nice sport that you also force 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.830
 can get and also embodies it 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.500
 health and indeed very good indeed 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.050
 Wrestling strengthens arms and legs and is 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.519
 also healthy for the back muscles 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.180
 but actually the entire body 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.180
 trained 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.650
 so my big goal is of course today 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.150
 wrestling because opponents to shoulders and 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.069
 for I have chosen over the value 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.140
 will not be easy in the first 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.340
 first bundesliga active but I have 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.670
 of course my trainer the armani 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.450
 The mails will show that I am not 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:59.800
 music changeover goes 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:04:18.130

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:22.060
 make and now nice position and 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.550

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.960
 not won because on the shoulders 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.490
 on failed floor then brings 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:38.320
