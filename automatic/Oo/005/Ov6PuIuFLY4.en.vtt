possibly be so nice teenage with HD

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.910 
possibly be so nice teenage with HD
playback<00:01:49.760> and<00:01:50.150> it<00:01:50.750> will<00:01:50.900> handle<00:01:51.200> 24<00:01:51.680> frames

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
playback and it will handle 24 frames

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.640 
playback and it will handle 24 frames
per<00:01:52.010> second<00:01:52.490> yes<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:53.600> can<00:01:53.690> input<00:01:53.840> 24<00:01:54.380> frames

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
per second yes you can input 24 frames

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.640 
per second yes you can input 24 frames
per<00:01:54.770> second<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:55.690> it<00:01:56.690> actually<00:01:56.720> displays<00:01:57.440> it

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
per second and it actually displays it

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.690 
per second and it actually displays it
at<00:01:57.800> 48<00:01:58.869> so<00:01:59.869> it's<00:02:00.380> smooth<00:02:01.190> and<00:02:01.400> true

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
at 48 so it's smooth and true

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.540 
at 48 so it's smooth and true
representation<00:02:02.540> of<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.620> original<00:02:04.070> material

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:04.550 
representation of the original material

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.430 
representation of the original material
obviously<00:02:05.420> some<00:02:05.540> new<00:02:05.660> features<00:02:05.810> on<00:02:06.140> there<00:02:06.320> as

obviously some new features on there as

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.530 
obviously some new features on there as
well<00:02:06.590> as<00:02:06.740> well<00:02:07.190> as<00:02:07.280> a<00:02:07.370> dynamic<00:02:07.700> Buckley<00:02:08.300> which

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
well as well as a dynamic Buckley which

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.419 
well as well as a dynamic Buckley which
is<00:02:08.720> obviously<00:02:09.050> ideal<00:02:09.410> fit<00:02:09.679> for<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:10.010> LCD

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
is obviously ideal fit for the LCD

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:13.990 
is obviously ideal fit for the LCD
technology<00:02:11.140> yes<00:02:12.160> in<00:02:13.160> the<00:02:13.459> past<00:02:13.700> we've<00:02:13.880> being

what's going to attract people why do

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.120 
what's going to attract people why do
you<00:02:32.239> think<00:02:32.420> people<00:02:32.750> that<00:02:33.380> are<00:02:33.560> drawn<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:34.040> the

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
you think people that are drawn to the

you think people that are drawn to the
super<00:02:34.430> slim<00:02:34.670> set<00:02:34.970> I<00:02:35.350> think<00:02:36.350> first<00:02:36.620> of<00:02:36.769> all

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
super slim set I think first of all

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.960 
super slim set I think first of all
people<00:02:38.050> appreciate<00:02:39.050> style<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.739> elegance<00:02:39.970> in

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
people appreciate style and elegance in

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.500 
people appreciate style and elegance in
a<00:02:41.150> TV<00:02:41.570> all<00:02:42.290> other<00:02:42.530> things<00:02:42.799> being<00:02:42.860> equal<00:02:43.510> and

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
a TV all other things being equal and

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.090 
a TV all other things being equal and
particularly<00:02:44.989> if<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.260> TVs<00:02:45.590> mounted<00:02:45.980> on<00:02:46.070> a

particularly if the TVs mounted on a

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.430 
particularly if the TVs mounted on a
wall<00:02:46.209> what<00:02:47.209> they're<00:02:47.390> really<00:02:47.540> looking<00:02:47.780> for<00:02:48.200> is

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
wall what they're really looking for is

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.100 
wall what they're really looking for is
is<00:02:48.650> that<00:02:48.950> frameless<00:02:49.580> picture<00:02:50.360> on<00:02:50.540> hanging<00:02:51.019> on

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
is that frameless picture on hanging on

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.400 
is that frameless picture on hanging on
the<00:02:51.230> wall<00:02:51.380> appearance<00:02:52.160> that's<00:02:53.120> so<00:02:53.410> modern

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
the wall appearance that's so modern

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.460 
the wall appearance that's so modern
than<00:02:54.590> eat<00:02:55.510> we've<00:02:56.510> tried<00:02:56.810> to<00:02:56.989> enhance<00:02:57.350> that

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
than eat we've tried to enhance that

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.500 
than eat we've tried to enhance that
even<00:02:57.799> more<00:02:57.980> nothing<00:02:58.280> sets<00:02:58.700> slim<00:02:59.060> but<00:02:59.390> the

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
even more nothing sets slim but the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.840 
even more nothing sets slim but the
bezel<00:02:59.840> that<00:02:59.870> surrounds<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.769> picture<00:03:01.160> is<00:03:01.549> only

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
bezel that surrounds the picture is only

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.320 
bezel that surrounds the picture is only
23<00:03:02.239> millimeters<00:03:02.630> wide<00:03:03.459> so<00:03:04.459> it<00:03:04.580> almost<00:03:04.970> looks

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
23 millimeters wide so it almost looks

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.759 
23 millimeters wide so it almost looks
like<00:03:05.360> a<00:03:05.450> picture<00:03:05.660> frame<00:03:05.870> minutes<00:03:06.350> on<00:03:06.470> the<00:03:06.620> wall

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
like a picture frame minutes on the wall

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.039 
like a picture frame minutes on the wall
because<00:03:06.980> it's<00:03:07.430> only<00:03:07.670> 23<00:03:08.120> millimeters<00:03:08.720> from

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
because it's only 23 millimeters from

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.020 
because it's only 23 millimeters from
there<00:03:09.440> and

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
there and

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.050 
there and
and<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:11.140> only<00:03:11.560> bit<00:03:11.800> that<00:03:11.920> looks<00:03:12.100> thick<00:03:12.370> is<00:03:12.670> the

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
and the only bit that looks thick is the

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.750 
and the only bit that looks thick is the
bottom<00:03:13.300> player<00:03:13.510> which<00:03:13.720> has<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:13.930> jvc<00:03:14.440> logo<00:03:14.770> yes

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
bottom player which has a jvc logo yes

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.190 
bottom player which has a jvc logo yes
and<00:03:15.970> even<00:03:16.060> that's<00:03:16.420> quite<00:03:16.660> slim<00:03:16.930> when<00:03:17.110> you

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
and even that's quite slim when you

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.600 
and even that's quite slim when you
consider<00:03:17.530> that's<00:03:17.830> where<00:03:18.010> the<00:03:18.069> speakers<00:03:18.459> are

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
consider that's where the speakers are

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.540 
consider that's where the speakers are
as<00:03:18.760> well<00:03:19.290> we've<00:03:20.290> employed<00:03:20.650> max<00:03:20.950> based<00:03:21.220> on<00:03:21.430> this

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
as well we've employed max based on this

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.750 
as well we've employed max based on this
because<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:23.530> speakers<00:03:23.740> are<00:03:24.069> very<00:03:24.459> small

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
because the the speakers are very small

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.030 
because the the speakers are very small
we<00:03:25.600> find<00:03:25.870> that<00:03:25.959> max<00:03:26.200> base<00:03:26.470> has<00:03:26.739> worked<00:03:26.920> very

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
we find that max base has worked very

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.100 
we find that max base has worked very
effectively<00:03:27.220> on<00:03:27.760> our<00:03:27.910> TV<00:03:28.390> reigns<00:03:28.780> over<00:03:28.989> the

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
effectively on our TV reigns over the

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.380 
effectively on our TV reigns over the
past<00:03:29.380> few<00:03:29.590> years<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.190> it's<00:03:30.790> noted<00:03:31.209> for<00:03:31.330> being

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
past few years and it's noted for being

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:34.080 
past few years and it's noted for being
able<00:03:31.660> to<00:03:31.810> produce<00:03:31.930> a<00:03:32.200> very<00:03:32.440> solid<00:03:32.950> sound<00:03:33.430> for

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
able to produce a very solid sound for

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.199 
able to produce a very solid sound for
very<00:03:34.330> small<00:03:34.390> speakers<00:03:35.069> and<00:03:36.069> I<00:03:36.160> guess<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.520> mean

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
very small speakers and I guess the mean

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.910 
very small speakers and I guess the mean
plus<00:03:37.420> point<00:03:37.780> here<00:03:37.989> is<00:03:38.140> that<00:03:38.170> we<00:03:38.560> have<00:03:38.680> seen

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
plus point here is that we have seen

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.600 
plus point here is that we have seen
slim<00:03:39.510> screens<00:03:40.510> from<00:03:40.690> other<00:03:40.900> manufacturers

the format of an existing TV so to make

that that small and the new backlight

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.190 
that that small and the new backlight

system is a very low power consumption

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.500 
system is a very low power consumption
and<00:04:11.200> what<00:04:12.069> is<00:04:12.220> the<00:04:12.340> power<00:04:12.519> consumption<00:04:12.940> on<00:04:13.330> the
