to<00:00:54.520> check<00:00:54.969> the<00:00:55.180> plane<00:00:55.420> soul<00:00:55.840> for<00:00:56.649> flatness<00:00:57.160> the

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
to check the plane soul for flatness the

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.510 
to check the plane soul for flatness the
sole<00:00:58.270> was<00:00:58.539> extremely<00:00:59.140> flat<00:00:59.410> so<00:00:59.859> no<00:01:00.010> additional

sole was extremely flat so no additional
flattening<00:01:01.000> was<00:01:01.180> required<00:01:01.629> then<00:01:02.530> I<00:01:02.770> checked

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
flattening was required then I checked

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:04.979
