give<00:01:24.760> you<00:01:24.850> some<00:01:25.000> good<00:01:25.180> running<00:01:25.480> times<00:01:25.810> and<00:01:26.170> in

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.380 
give you some good running times and in

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.200 
give you some good running times and in
fact<00:01:26.590> we<00:01:27.130> had<00:01:27.220> a<00:01:27.250> quick<00:01:27.490> look<00:01:27.520> at<00:01:27.790> some<00:01:27.820> of<00:01:28.030> the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
fact we had a quick look at some of the

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.480 
fact we had a quick look at some of the
specs<00:01:28.810> here<00:01:28.960> and<00:01:29.620> we're<00:01:29.740> looking<00:01:29.830> at<00:01:30.100> a<00:01:30.130> 72

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
specs here and we're looking at a 72

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.060 
specs here and we're looking at a 72
hour<00:01:30.970> battery<00:01:31.410> standard<00:01:32.410> which<00:01:32.530> is<00:01:32.710> running

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
hour battery standard which is running

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.370 
hour battery standard which is running
for<00:01:33.250> predicted<00:01:34.150> sort<00:01:34.330> of<00:01:34.390> eight<00:01:34.600> hours<00:01:35.140> on

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
for predicted sort of eight hours on

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.480 
for predicted sort of eight hours on
that

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
that

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.789 
that
so<00:01:38.030> this<00:01:38.180> is<00:01:38.329> actually<00:01:38.479> a<00:01:38.750> second<00:01:39.680> series

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
so this is actually a second series

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.350 
so this is actually a second series
prototype<00:01:40.430> here<00:01:40.759> this<00:01:40.909> is<00:01:40.970> not<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.180> final

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
prototype here this is not the final

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.330 
prototype here this is not the final
product<00:01:41.899> so<00:01:42.290> the<00:01:42.380> keyboard<00:01:42.770> is<00:01:42.860> a<00:01:42.920> little<00:01:43.130> bit

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
product so the keyboard is a little bit

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.330 
product so the keyboard is a little bit
to<00:01:44.079> offset<00:01:45.079> and<00:01:45.290> a<00:01:45.649> couple<00:01:45.920> of<00:01:46.070> build<00:01:46.280> quality

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
to offset and a couple of build quality

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.990 
to offset and a couple of build quality
issues<00:01:47.000> on<00:01:47.210> this<00:01:47.479> but<00:01:48.350> it's<00:01:48.470> not<00:01:48.680> sir<00:01:49.009> but<00:01:49.909> oh

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
issues on this but it's not sir but oh

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.760 
issues on this but it's not sir but oh
yeah<00:01:50.180> it<00:01:50.240> is<00:01:50.299> backlit<00:01:50.750> actually<00:01:51.350> if<00:01:51.439> I<00:01:51.560> just
