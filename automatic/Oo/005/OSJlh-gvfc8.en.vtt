00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
Zen and for a while now and I've been

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.290 
Zen and for a while now and I've been
thinking<00:00:24.720> about<00:00:24.840> doing<00:00:25.140> some<00:00:25.410> videos<00:00:25.710> myself

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
thinking about doing some videos myself

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.099 
thinking about doing some videos myself
and<00:00:28.160> he<00:00:29.160> came<00:00:29.369> out<00:00:29.429> with<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:30.119> video<00:00:30.480> that<00:00:30.660> said

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
and he came out with a video that said

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.470 
and he came out with a video that said
basically<00:00:31.859> why<00:00:32.189> he<00:00:32.399> thought<00:00:32.579> minecraft<00:00:33.239> was

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
basically why he thought minecraft was

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.979 
basically why he thought minecraft was
so<00:00:33.660> successful<00:00:34.670> he<00:00:35.670> basically<00:00:36.450> chalked<00:00:36.870> it

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
so successful he basically chalked it

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.660 
so successful he basically chalked it
down<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.739> fact<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.399> adventure

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
down to the fact that the adventure

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.860 
down to the fact that the adventure
factor<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:40.050> fact<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.620> was<00:00:41.870> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
factor and the fact that it was the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.229 
factor and the fact that it was the
night<00:00:43.050> time<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:44.010> night<00:00:44.190> time<00:00:44.430> was<00:00:44.670> made

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
night time and the night time was made

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.529 
night time and the night time was made
it<00:00:45.390> really<00:00:45.780> kind<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.379> give<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.920> edge

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
it really kind of give you that edge

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.049 
it really kind of give you that edge
that<00:00:48.539> edgy<00:00:48.989> feeling<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.340> something

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
that edgy feeling to it and something

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.930 
that edgy feeling to it and something
that<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.270> didn't<00:00:51.539> have<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.230> lot<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.500> things

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.840 
that you didn't have in a lot of things
and<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.449> would<00:00:54.750> say<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.440> because<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.610> didn't

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
and I would say that because I didn't

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.240 
and I would say that because I didn't
get<00:00:56.940> into<00:00:57.090> Minecraft<00:00:57.600> until<00:00:58.410> January<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.039> this

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.130 
see and I've really gotten into it and I
think<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.979> main<00:01:23.580> reason<00:01:23.610> because<00:01:24.600> I've<00:01:24.750> kind

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
think the main reason because I've kind

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.840 
think the main reason because I've kind
of<00:01:25.200> asked<00:01:25.439> myself<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.860> question<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.580> you

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
of asked myself that question of you

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.289 
of asked myself that question of you
know<00:01:26.880> why<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:27.990> popular<00:01:28.549> and<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:30.060> me<00:01:30.270> I

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
know why is it so popular and to me I

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.420 
know why is it so popular and to me I
think<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.840> main<00:01:31.049> reason<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:31.799> popular<00:01:32.040> is

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
think the main reason it's so popular is

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.719 
think the main reason it's so popular is
because<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:33.060> its<00:01:33.329> tremendous<00:01:33.689> versatility

pack<00:02:36.209> which<00:02:36.900> is<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.290> lot<00:02:37.560> easier<00:02:37.890> than<00:02:38.040> creating

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
pack which is a lot easier than creating

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.870 
pack which is a lot easier than creating
a<00:02:38.459> mod<00:02:39.290> but<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.470> texture<00:02:40.830> pack<00:02:41.010> can<00:02:41.280> change

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
a mod but the texture pack can change

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.229 
a mod but the texture pack can change
the<00:02:42.150> whole<00:02:42.709> look<00:02:43.709> of<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.980> game<00:02:44.190> by<00:02:44.760> just<00:02:44.790> you

the whole look of the game by just you

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.060 
the whole look of the game by just you
know<00:02:45.360> putting<00:02:45.780> in<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:46.020> different<00:02:46.440> texture<00:02:46.739> pack

all<00:02:47.730> of<00:02:48.120> a<00:02:48.360> sudden<00:02:50.780> you've<00:02:51.780> got<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.380> really

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
all of a sudden you've got a really

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.270 
all of a sudden you've got a really
different<00:02:54.480> looking<00:02:55.140> game<00:02:55.380> here<00:02:55.800> I<00:02:55.890> mean

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
different looking game here I mean

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.729 
different looking game here I mean
basically<00:02:56.870> everything<00:02:57.870> looks<00:02:58.080> much<00:02:58.560> more

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
basically everything looks much more

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.560 
basically everything looks much more
modern<00:02:59.160> in<00:02:59.310> this<00:02:59.459> particular<00:02:59.910> is<00:03:00.180> one<00:03:00.390> of<00:03:00.480> the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
modern in this particular is one of the

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.800 
modern in this particular is one of the
modern<00:03:00.750> texture<00:03:01.260> packs<00:03:02.239> so<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.360> doors<00:03:03.600> look

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
modern texture packs so the doors look

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.180 
modern texture packs so the doors look
totally<00:03:04.019> different<00:03:04.230> than<00:03:04.739> I<00:03:04.830> mean<00:03:04.980> that's

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
totally different than I mean that's

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.880 
totally different than I mean that's
that's<00:03:05.760> just<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.390> fairly<00:03:06.930> simple<00:03:07.260> modification

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
that's just a fairly simple modification

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.710 
that's just a fairly simple modification
you<00:03:08.010> know<00:03:08.130> just<00:03:08.370> just<00:03:08.820> about<00:03:08.970> anybody<00:03:09.420> can<00:03:09.570> do

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
you know just just about anybody can do

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.210 
you know just just about anybody can do
a<00:03:09.750> texture<00:03:10.230> pack<00:03:12.200> but<00:03:13.200> that's<00:03:13.410> one<00:03:14.010> of<00:03:14.130> the

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
a texture pack but that's one of the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.240 
a texture pack but that's one of the
things<00:03:14.459> that<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:14.820> think<00:03:14.880> has<00:03:15.870> made<00:03:16.680> minecraft

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
things that I think has made minecraft

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.150 
things that I think has made minecraft
so<00:03:17.370> successful<00:03:17.910> is<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.150> fact<00:03:18.360> that<00:03:18.650> it<00:03:19.650> is<00:03:19.860> so

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
so successful is the fact that it is so

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.400
