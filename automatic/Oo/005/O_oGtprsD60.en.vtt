daylight's<00:05:12.080> and<00:05:12.699> so<00:05:13.699> you<00:05:14.089> will<00:05:14.240> duplicate<00:05:14.779> the

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
daylight's and so you will duplicate the

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.929 
daylight's and so you will duplicate the
existing<00:05:15.379> assembly<00:05:15.889> by<00:05:16.129> copying<00:05:16.639> all<00:05:16.819> the
