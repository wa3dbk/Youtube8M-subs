00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:03.719
 a month 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.559
 bangkok 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:09.589
 1 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:14.419
 this week again our destiny to answer questions today you 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:17.130
 know everything about the champions league at home 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.189
 we find for this is a unique and it works 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:24.970
 always is he that he arrived home a few days before three 

00:00:24.969 --> 00:00:25.829
 month 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.159
 we ask ourselves a lot of questions about how to best accommodate 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.769
 then there is a golden rule when we made the choice of staging very 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:35.769
 quickly dedicate him a class to find a place 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.990
 the act secure or do not want to do nonsense and me bettcher list 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.110
 for me, I advise the takers 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.170
 Umbrellas - took part for baby it's with its place during the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.400
 first few weeks and you're going to position the party let's go right to 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.990
 later you will position his basket for music you bring him everything 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.030
 these games for furniture and we can even in this bed umbrella brought him% 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.650
 to his food his place is his territory 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:03.570
 it does not mean at all that we will leave all the time in his park 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.920
 see regularly to get the show we will invite him in our 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.310
 living space so we'll even put him a second cushion for example 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.670
 your sofa feet in the living room but regularly when you want to slice 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.750
 when we work because we can say 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.900
 we will be able to put the show back in his living space in his party and as 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.580
 that we will leave 36 'so we make sure that it will not do any nonsense and especially 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.210
 will not argue because he will have done some nonsense on our return a boil 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.960
 win the heart a little school can do to insufflate so if the dog 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.040
 killer the first half and I think it's essential to take on oneself 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.850
 even past newer show but it takes ap soleiman not to get up 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.159
 otherwise he will quickly understand that he is crying on stage and sabotage the horror 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.690
 to reassure it can possibly brought back from the breeding of smells 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.430
 kindergarten so if the breeder can give you a little blanket - linen 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.500
 which contains the smells of the door and that's fine 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.270
 we will put them in his sleeping place 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.130
 we also have the possibility of veterinary songs that will you 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.850
 propose synthetic maternal odors there are necklaces 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.680
 that we can be hot on the first lines 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.670
 or else we can put catches that will also diffuse smells that make 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.470
 peace is a beautiful day of spring but on the contrary open a 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.290
 first rule of thumb is not to change his diet by 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.289
 report at 8pm 

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:19.089
 so often from the breeding a brand of croquettes we will stay on 

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:21.539
 this mark in a few days few weeks 

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:23.979
 until the first visit to the veterinarian who will then 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:27.539
 eventually make a more definite transition from the most 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:28.569
 suitable for dogs 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.599
 I think that a dog until the age of 4 months it is necessary especially to maintain it with 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.829
 three meals a day we understand the daily ration we disappeared three 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.609
 and the show will eat in the morning at noon and in the evening a betty necessary she 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.309
 already sees the vet so it is essential to go very quickly 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:46.659
 cons in Sochaux sees a veterinarian for a visit 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.609
 called buying 

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:51.909
 as you petition it should try to see wither in the 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.729
 48 to 72 hours 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:56.389
 first to check that they are healthy it eventually allows 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:00.659
 to turn around if a problem against the breeder and also to take a 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.450
 first contact with the veterinarian 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.299
 so that they establish with you a protocol to visit vaccination 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.249
 then 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:10.649
 there will be another visit if it's a visit basically from them it's 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:13.369
 what is called the prepubescent visit the aim of the six months 

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:16.049
 at that moment we will take stock of the growth of the show 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.919
 we will talk about the socialization of the show and above all we will be able to set up 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.779
 additional vaccines that are plenary complements for the dog 

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:26.639
 vaccines against tick-borne diseases during the 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.709
 fasting it often happens what motive 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.110
 well what can we do when we let it go 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.640
 so the Sunday death of essential things in his way for him to 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.359
 communicate with your environment 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.149
 simply if he died too loud the shabbat league go 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:42.189
 unfortunately the sky has dropped and at that moment we will congratulate you 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:45.809
 that is to say we now have a kasab attack will be able to claim a place 

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:47.619
 in a store 

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:49.799
 so for learning about the cleanliness of things that is 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:53.129
 extremely important deaths of jeanne and dispute his dog when 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:54.309
 was justified 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:57.569
 because the company is not talking about growing your food 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.549
 simply made certainties 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.859
 on the other hand we will go out very often his dog outside 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.680
 especially after meals alas when happily business chili 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.210
 pee in a flower bed or in the earth 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.500
 you must immediately have a reward to tell him it's good and 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.900
 to associate at that time 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.739
 the pique of the reward that this is how we 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.519
 education as well by encouraging him 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.419
 without reward we try especially not for the hard drive m 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.050
 Is she allowed to go out a year before her first booster 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.150
 you can actually take a dog out of the house 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.849
 avoiding contact with his people in the accident 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:33.259
 it's even very important because it's going this party quoted at the 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:36.719
 socialization of the day it is only from the moment for the manager and his 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:39.550
 first booster vaccine we can do what we want with him is good 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.960
 take it out as much as you want 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.139
 and the serones do all the faience dogs 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.240
 via last advises to avoid making puppies sleep in other units 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.610
 bad habits come alive 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.770
 also think about educating your dog with a professional 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:53.770
 in general 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:54.310
 a few sessions
