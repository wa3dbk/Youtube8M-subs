00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
tiling and there's the green line

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.310 
tiling and there's the green line
showing<00:01:06.000> traffic<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.540> good<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:06.930> that's<00:01:07.140> good

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
showing traffic is good so that's good

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.600 
showing traffic is good so that's good
and<00:01:08.060> there's<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.619> little<00:01:10.619> soft-<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.340> can<00:01:11.460> turn

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
and there's a little soft- you can turn

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.600 
and there's a little soft- you can turn

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
and let's see what the road view looks

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.730 
and let's see what the road view looks
like<00:01:18.220> the<00:01:18.370> map<00:01:18.550> view<00:01:18.790> without<00:01:18.970> the<00:01:19.210> satellite

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740
