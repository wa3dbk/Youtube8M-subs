phones compared with an iphone 5 none of

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.060 
phones compared with an iphone 5 none of
them<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.330> better<00:01:06.600> pixels<00:01:07.049> per<00:01:07.200> inch<00:01:07.260> than<00:01:07.830> an

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
them have better pixels per inch than an

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.179 
them have better pixels per inch than an
apple<00:01:08.939> iphone<00:01:09.390> 5<00:01:09.630> but<00:01:10.320> resolutions<00:01:11.010> are

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
apple iphone 5 but resolutions are

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.210 
apple iphone 5 but resolutions are
better<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.820> s3<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.360> note<00:01:12.450> 2<00:01:12.930> even<00:01:13.680> though<00:01:13.830> s3

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
better on s3 and note 2 even though s3

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.390 
better on s3 and note 2 even though s3
mini<00:01:14.250> has<00:01:14.640> similar<00:01:15.030> size<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.509> iphone<00:01:16.110> 5<00:01:16.409> its

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
mini has similar size of iphone 5 its

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.030 
mini has similar size of iphone 5 its
display<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.390> pixels<00:01:18.780> per<00:01:18.990> inch<00:01:19.020> are<00:01:19.380> very<00:01:19.799> low

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
display and pixels per inch are very low

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.270 
display and pixels per inch are very low
so<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.820> course<00:01:20.850> two<00:01:21.450> galaxies<00:01:22.020> are<00:01:22.280> better

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
so of course two galaxies are better

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.940 
so of course two galaxies are better
than<00:01:23.549> iphone<00:01:24.420> 5<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.689> resolution<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:25.590> iphone

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
than iphone 5 and resolution but iphone

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.460 
than iphone 5 and resolution but iphone
5<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.640> better<00:01:26.850> than<00:01:27.119> all<00:01:27.390> three<00:01:27.689> galaxies<00:01:28.229> in

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
5 is better than all three galaxies in

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.880 
5 is better than all three galaxies in
pixels<00:01:29.070> per<00:01:29.340> inch<00:01:30.140> now<00:01:31.140> let's<00:01:31.500> see<00:01:31.680> which

some<00:02:50.579> of<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.849> things<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.299> these<00:02:51.810> three

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
some of the things that these three

some of the things that these three
galaxy<00:02:52.739> phones<00:02:53.040> have<00:02:53.870> when<00:02:54.870> considering<00:02:55.439> our

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
galaxy phones have when considering our

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.179 
galaxy phones have when considering our
dimensions<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.209> these<00:02:57.419> phones<00:02:57.919> the<00:02:58.919> things

dimensions of these phones the things

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:02.809 
dimensions of these phones the things
get<00:02:59.489> much<00:02:59.760> better<00:03:00.000> for<00:03:00.450> an<00:03:00.629> iphone<00:03:01.109> 5<00:03:01.819> because

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
get much better for an iphone 5 because

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.879 
get much better for an iphone 5 because
it<00:03:03.030> is<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.239> thinnest<00:03:03.659> phone<00:03:03.750> as<00:03:04.139> compared<00:03:04.799> to

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
it is the thinnest phone as compared to

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.129 
it is the thinnest phone as compared to
all<00:03:05.219> of<00:03:05.639> these<00:03:05.879> three<00:03:06.209> galaxy<00:03:06.659> phones<00:03:06.900> and

here<00:03:07.650> you<00:03:07.799> can<00:03:07.950> have<00:03:08.159> a<00:03:08.189> look<00:03:08.280> at<00:03:08.639> it<00:03:09.680> so<00:03:10.680> it<00:03:10.950> is

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
here you can have a look at it so it is

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.309 
here you can have a look at it so it is
a<00:03:11.129> thinnest<00:03:11.700> phone<00:03:11.790> among<00:03:12.359> all<00:03:12.599> of<00:03:13.079> these

a thinnest phone among all of these
three<00:03:13.620> glaxy<00:03:14.069> phones<00:03:14.310> so<00:03:15.239> this<00:03:15.450> is<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.780> plus

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:16.169 
three glaxy phones so this is a plus

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:20.050 
three glaxy phones so this is a plus

impressive<00:04:06.720> but<00:04:06.900> thanks<00:04:07.530> God<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:07.979> it<00:04:08.639> is<00:04:08.790> at

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
impressive but thanks God that it is at

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.909 
impressive but thanks God that it is at
least<00:04:09.269> better<00:04:09.659> than<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:10.049> battery<00:04:10.409> power<00:04:10.620> of

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
least better than the battery power of

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.849 
least better than the battery power of
an<00:04:11.310> iphone<00:04:11.669> 5<00:04:12.180> battery<00:04:12.599> so<00:04:13.319> in<00:04:13.439> other<00:04:13.560> words

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
an iphone 5 battery so in other words

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.839 
an iphone 5 battery so in other words
iphone<00:04:14.639> 5<00:04:15.560> 1440<00:04:16.560> milliamp<00:04:16.919> hours<00:04:17.220> battery<00:04:17.459> is

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
iphone 5 1440 milliamp hours battery is

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:22.850 
iphone 5 1440 milliamp hours battery is
taking<00:04:18.329> it<00:04:18.479> nowhere<00:04:18.930> except<00:04:19.859> charger<00:04:21.860> now

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
taking it nowhere except charger now

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.680 
taking it nowhere except charger now
let's<00:04:23.159> see<00:04:23.340> which<00:04:23.520> device<00:04:23.849> is<00:04:24.150> better<00:04:24.419> in

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
let's see which device is better in

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.500 
let's see which device is better in
snapping<00:04:25.229> and<00:04:25.409> shooting<00:04:25.919> lot<00:04:26.190> of<00:04:26.370> videos

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
snapping and shooting lot of videos

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.380 
snapping and shooting lot of videos
so<00:04:27.750> no<00:04:27.990> two<00:04:28.050> and<00:04:28.500> big<00:04:29.250> s3<00:04:29.640> have<00:04:29.820> better<00:04:30.090> friend

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
so no two and big s3 have better friend

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.300 
so no two and big s3 have better friend
camera<00:04:30.810> and<00:04:31.050> again<00:04:31.410> leaving<00:04:31.740> behind<00:04:31.890> their

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
camera and again leaving behind their

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.150 
camera and again leaving behind their
little<00:04:32.790> baby<00:04:33.090> s3<00:04:33.510> mini<00:04:33.540> which<00:04:34.290> has<00:04:34.530> only<00:04:34.740> got

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
little baby s3 mini which has only got

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.110 
little baby s3 mini which has only got
vga<00:04:35.580> camera<00:04:35.790> and<00:04:36.150> by<00:04:36.810> looking<00:04:37.230> at<00:04:37.350> the<00:04:37.560> face<00:04:37.800> of

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
vga camera and by looking at the face of

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.050 
vga camera and by looking at the face of
s3<00:04:39.120> mini<00:04:39.150> iphone<00:04:40.080> 5<00:04:40.650> thanks<00:04:41.010> to<00:04:41.220> God<00:04:41.430> at<00:04:41.700> least

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
s3 mini iphone 5 thanks to God at least

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.240 
s3 mini iphone 5 thanks to God at least
I<00:04:42.360> have<00:04:42.780> better<00:04:42.990> camera<00:04:43.440> than<00:04:43.530> one<00:04:43.950> galaxy

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
I have better camera than one galaxy

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.910 
I have better camera than one galaxy
phone<00:04:44.610> so<00:04:45.480> back<00:04:45.750> camera<00:04:46.230> is<00:04:46.350> almost<00:04:46.710> identical

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:46.920 
phone so back camera is almost identical

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:51.320 
phone so back camera is almost identical
on<00:04:47.640> no<00:04:47.940> tube<00:04:48.210> big<00:04:48.780> s3<00:04:49.200> and<00:04:49.410> an<00:04:49.770> iphone<00:04:50.760> 5<00:04:51.000> but

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
on no tube big s3 and an iphone 5 but

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.390 
on no tube big s3 and an iphone 5 but
again<00:04:51.600> s3<00:04:51.990> mini<00:04:52.020> is<00:04:52.440> missing<00:04:52.920> something<00:04:53.370> here

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
again s3 mini is missing something here

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.030 
again s3 mini is missing something here
because<00:04:54.330> it<00:04:54.510> has<00:04:54.660> only<00:04:54.810> got<00:04:55.140> 5<00:04:55.440> megapixel

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
because it has only got 5 megapixel

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.030 
because it has only got 5 megapixel
camera<00:04:56.400> instead<00:04:57.240> of<00:04:57.450> 8<00:04:57.870> megapixel<00:04:58.530> camera<00:04:58.890> on

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
camera instead of 8 megapixel camera on

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.470 
camera instead of 8 megapixel camera on
3<00:04:59.670> monsters<00:05:01.370> now<00:05:02.370> let's<00:05:02.730> have<00:05:03.000> a<00:05:03.060> quick<00:05:03.450> look

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
3 monsters now let's have a quick look

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.200 
3 monsters now let's have a quick look
into<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.170> software<00:05:04.770> of<00:05:04.800> these<00:05:05.100> devices<00:05:05.490> so<00:05:06.180> I

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
into the software of these devices so I

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.090 
into the software of these devices so I
think<00:05:06.390> when<00:05:06.810> we're<00:05:07.020> looking<00:05:07.290> into<00:05:07.470> a<00:05:07.590> software

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
think when we're looking into a software

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.280 
think when we're looking into a software
it's<00:05:08.430> pretty<00:05:08.760> straightforward<00:05:09.180> to<00:05:09.630> say<00:05:09.990> that

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
it's pretty straightforward to say that

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.050 
it's pretty straightforward to say that
its<00:05:10.620> iOS<00:05:11.550> 6.1<00:05:12.240> vs<00:05:12.840> android<00:05:13.050> 4.1<00:05:13.950> point<00:05:14.430> one<00:05:14.790> of

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
its iOS 6.1 vs android 4.1 point one of

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.410 
its iOS 6.1 vs android 4.1 point one of
four<00:05:15.870> point<00:05:16.110> one<00:05:16.200> point<00:05:16.440> two<00:05:16.950> with<00:05:17.610> TouchWiz

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
four point one point two with TouchWiz

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.140 
four point one point two with TouchWiz
so<00:05:19.260> TouchWiz<00:05:19.740> on<00:05:19.980> these<00:05:20.220> galaxies<00:05:20.850> have

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
so TouchWiz on these galaxies have

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.660 
so TouchWiz on these galaxies have
widgets<00:05:21.450> live<00:05:22.230> wallpapers<00:05:22.830> a<00:05:22.950> lot<00:05:23.340> of<00:05:23.490> motion

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
widgets live wallpapers a lot of motion

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.600 
widgets live wallpapers a lot of motion
sensors<00:05:24.300> and<00:05:24.510> even<00:05:25.050> this<00:05:25.260> big<00:05:25.560> device<00:05:25.890> have

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
sensors and even this big device have

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.090 
sensors and even this big device have
espan<00:05:27.480> capability<00:05:28.410> which<00:05:28.860> makes

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
espan capability which makes

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.130 
espan capability which makes
productivity<00:05:29.760> things<00:05:30.030> more<00:05:30.330> easier<00:05:30.660> on<00:05:30.840> the

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:31.140 
productivity things more easier on the

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.040 
productivity things more easier on the
go<00:05:31.290> ious<00:05:32.280> means<00:05:32.580> get<00:05:32.970> every<00:05:33.450> game<00:05:33.690> on<00:05:33.900> the

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
go ious means get every game on the

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.720 
go ious means get every game on the
first<00:05:34.320> day<00:05:34.470> of<00:05:34.500> its<00:05:34.830> launch<00:05:35.040> and<00:05:35.310> better

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
first day of its launch and better

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:39.350 
first day of its launch and better
optimization<00:05:36.270> from<00:05:36.960> developers<00:05:38.120> so<00:05:39.120> what

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
optimization from developers so what

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.080 
optimization from developers so what
actually<00:05:39.540> is<00:05:40.110> estranged<00:05:40.830> for<00:05:41.070> is<00:05:41.280> actually
