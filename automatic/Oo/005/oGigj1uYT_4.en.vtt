congenital heart disease so we do

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.849 
congenital heart disease so we do
neonatal<00:00:21.210> cardiac<00:00:21.570> surgery<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.230> we're<00:00:22.560> going

to<00:00:22.980> be<00:00:23.070> talking<00:00:23.430> about<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.820> but<00:00:24.510> also

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
to be talking about that but also

heart disease which is an emerging
population<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.829> patients<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.210> cover

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
population of patients so we cover

neonatal and infant cardiac surgery is a

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.700 
neonatal and infant cardiac surgery is a
little<00:00:50.280> bit<00:00:50.489> different<00:00:50.879> from<00:00:51.710> preparation

little bit different from preparation

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
smaller that goes without saying but

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.000 
smaller that goes without saying but

they're<00:01:06.990> going<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.260> be<00:01:07.380> more<00:01:07.680> susceptible<00:01:08.040> to

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
they're going to be more susceptible to

their heart beats faster for example the

their heart beats faster for example the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
in a neonate versus older kids so

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.020 
in a neonate versus older kids so
because<00:01:21.840> we<00:01:22.020> know<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.100> science<00:01:23.909> has

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
because we know this and the science has

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.510 
because we know this and the science has
advanced<00:01:24.479> quite<00:01:24.720> a<00:01:24.780> bit<00:01:25.049> with<00:01:25.950> respect<00:01:26.369> to

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
advanced quite a bit with respect to

advanced quite a bit with respect to

in<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> sense<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.350> that<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.890> may<00:01:32.009> give

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
have to give a lot of volume to the baby

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.740 
have to give a lot of volume to the baby
when<00:01:40.350> we<00:01:40.380> go<00:01:40.590> on<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.740> heart-lung<00:01:40.950> machine<00:01:41.750> all

when we go on a heart-lung machine all

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.770 
when we go on a heart-lung machine all
of<00:01:43.200> these<00:01:43.350> things<00:01:43.590> occur<00:01:44.270> routinely<00:01:45.270> nowadays

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
of these things occur routinely nowadays

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.130 
of these things occur routinely nowadays
but<00:01:46.020> they<00:01:46.530> are<00:01:46.619> part<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.070> why<00:01:47.990> neonatal<00:01:48.990> care

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
but they are part of why neonatal care

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.110 
but they are part of why neonatal care
surgery<00:01:49.530> nowadays<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.130> really<00:01:50.670> has<00:01:50.820> become

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
surgery nowadays is really has become

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.990 
surgery nowadays is really has become
extremely<00:01:53.120> safe<00:01:53.650> we<00:01:54.650> like<00:01:55.100> to<00:01:55.280> really<00:01:55.520> focus

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
extremely safe we like to really focus

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.790 
extremely safe we like to really focus
on<00:01:56.360> minimally<00:01:56.690> invasive<00:01:57.080> techniques<00:01:57.470> a<00:01:57.650> lot

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
on minimally invasive techniques a lot

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.490 
on minimally invasive techniques a lot
because<00:01:58.930> the<00:01:59.930> impact<00:02:00.290> on<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.770> child<00:02:02.170> is<00:02:03.170> very

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
because the impact on the child is very

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.370 
because the impact on the child is very
positive<00:02:03.800> long-term<00:02:04.550> but<00:02:05.240> also<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.810> trauma

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
positive long-term but also the trauma

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.590 
positive long-term but also the trauma
because<00:02:06.770> let's<00:02:07.280> face<00:02:07.370> it<00:02:07.490> every<00:02:07.970> surgery<00:02:08.360> is<00:02:08.570> a

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
because let's face it every surgery is a

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.900 
because let's face it every surgery is a
trauma<00:02:08.930> to<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.680> child's<00:02:10.010> body<00:02:10.160> so<00:02:10.490> if<00:02:10.610> we<00:02:10.730> can

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
trauma to the child's body so if we can

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.730 
trauma to the child's body so if we can
minimize<00:02:11.180> that<00:02:11.510> trauma<00:02:11.780> it's<00:02:12.380> a<00:02:12.530> necessary

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740

now<00:04:43.910> of<00:04:44.030> course<00:04:44.240> they<00:04:44.330> don't<00:04:44.390> all<00:04:44.690> require

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
now of course they don't all require

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.600 
now of course they don't all require
surgery<00:04:45.500> which<00:04:45.680> is<00:04:45.800> a<00:04:45.830> good<00:04:46.070> thing<00:04:46.220> and<00:04:46.430> if

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
surgery which is a good thing and if

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:49.240 
surgery which is a good thing and if
there's<00:04:46.880> any<00:04:47.090> way<00:04:47.900> we<00:04:48.080> can<00:04:48.230> avoid<00:04:48.500> to<00:04:48.830> operate

there's any way we can avoid to operate

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.450 
there's any way we can avoid to operate
on<00:04:49.370> them<00:04:49.550> or<00:04:49.820> do<00:04:50.300> a<00:04:50.330> less<00:04:50.630> invasive<00:04:51.250> therapy<00:04:52.250> of

on them or do a less invasive therapy of

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.280 
on them or do a less invasive therapy of
course<00:04:52.700> we'll<00:04:52.940> do<00:04:53.090> that<00:04:53.270> because<00:04:53.900> we're

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
course we'll do that because we're

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:56.860 
course we'll do that because we're
specializing<00:04:55.040> because<00:04:55.340> we<00:04:55.520> are<00:04:55.760> very<00:04:56.090> focused

neonatologists in cardiac disease and
that<00:05:11.570> is<00:05:11.720> something<00:05:12.050> I<00:05:12.470> worked<00:05:13.100> in<00:05:13.360> Chicago

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
that is something I worked in Chicago
