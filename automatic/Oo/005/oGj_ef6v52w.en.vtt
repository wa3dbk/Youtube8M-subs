00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
bit is down low because they've actually

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.480 
bit is down low because they've actually

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
storage underneath now first of all

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.960 
storage underneath now first of all
there's<00:01:17.810> this<00:01:17.960> draw<00:01:18.320> really<00:01:19.070> deep<00:01:19.370> draw<00:01:19.730> with

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:19.970 
there's this draw really deep draw with

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.570 
there's this draw really deep draw with
storage<00:01:20.780> for<00:01:20.930> things<00:01:21.050> like<00:01:21.230> they<00:01:22.100> have<00:01:22.250> mains

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
storage for things like they have mains

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
lead leveling wedges that sort of thing

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.450 
lead leveling wedges that sort of thing
all<00:01:24.260> the<00:01:24.350> stuff<00:01:24.560> that<00:01:24.590> you<00:01:24.770> don't<00:01:24.830> cluttering

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
all the stuff that you don't cluttering

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.400 
all the stuff that you don't cluttering
up<00:01:25.580> the<00:01:25.730> inside<00:01:26.120> of<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.330> vehicle<00:01:26.450> but<00:01:27.290> the

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410 
up the inside of the vehicle but the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.790 
up the inside of the vehicle but the
really<00:01:27.890> clever<00:01:28.130> bit<00:01:28.310> is<00:01:28.670> this<00:01:29.680> pull<00:01:30.680> that<00:01:30.860> out

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
really clever bit is this pull that out

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.520 
really clever bit is this pull that out
massively<00:01:33.800> strong<00:01:34.270> runners<00:01:35.270> that<00:01:35.570> support<00:01:36.320> it

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
massively strong runners that support it

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.260 
massively strong runners that support it
and<00:01:36.770> you've<00:01:37.010> got<00:01:37.040> storage<00:01:37.520> in<00:01:37.670> here<00:01:37.820> for<00:01:38.000> two

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
and you've got storage in here for two

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.020 
and you've got storage in here for two
chairs<00:01:38.720> and<00:01:39.080> then<00:01:39.560> a<00:01:39.680> tabletop<00:01:40.130> simply<00:01:40.700> clips

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
chairs and then a tabletop simply clips

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:58.060 
chairs and then a tabletop simply clips
on<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.360> top<00:01:41.570> there

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.230 

this<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.189> perhaps<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.670> most<00:01:59.700> conventional

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
this is perhaps the most conventional

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.480 
this is perhaps the most conventional
part<00:02:00.900> of<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.140> buckston<00:02:01.560> you've<00:02:01.950> got<00:02:02.159> four

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
part of the buckston you've got four

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.090 
part of the buckston you've got four
seats<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.030> cab<00:02:03.240> seats<00:02:03.600> height<00:02:04.470> adjust<00:02:04.950> you

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
seats the cab seats height adjust you

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.649 
seats the cab seats height adjust you
need<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.369> raise<00:02:05.610> them<00:02:05.880> up<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:06.180> swivel<00:02:06.420> them

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
need to raise them up to swivel them

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.840 
need to raise them up to swivel them
round<00:02:06.960> but<00:02:07.470> it's<00:02:07.619> not<00:02:07.799> too<00:02:08.039> much<00:02:08.220> effort<00:02:08.489> and

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
round but it's not too much effort and

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.790 
round but it's not too much effort and
then<00:02:09.119> you've<00:02:09.239> got<00:02:09.420> these<00:02:09.539> RI<00:02:09.899> basics<00:02:10.619> which

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
then you've got these RI basics which

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.680 
then you've got these RI basics which
are<00:02:10.950> fully<00:02:11.160> crash<00:02:11.489> tested<00:02:11.940> for<00:02:12.150> rear

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
are fully crash tested for rear

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.990 
are fully crash tested for rear
passengers<00:02:13.380> they're<00:02:13.860> sort<00:02:14.459> of<00:02:14.550> top<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.790> the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
passengers they're sort of top of the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.699 
passengers they're sort of top of the
range<00:02:15.239> seats<00:02:15.660> as<00:02:15.810> far<00:02:16.020> as<00:02:16.110> my<00:02:16.260> ohms<00:02:16.530> are

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
range seats as far as my ohms are

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.080 
range seats as far as my ohms are
concerned<00:02:17.040> you've<00:02:17.160> got<00:02:17.310> height<00:02:17.520> adjustable

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
concerned you've got height adjustable

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.880 
concerned you've got height adjustable
head<00:02:18.300> restraints<00:02:18.750> on<00:02:18.840> these<00:02:18.959> arm<00:02:19.170> rests<00:02:19.620> too

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
head restraints on these arm rests too

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.540 
head restraints on these arm rests too
so<00:02:20.130> all<00:02:20.340> four<00:02:21.330> passengers<00:02:21.959> travel<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:22.590> quite

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
so all four passengers travel in quite

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.120 
so all four passengers travel in quite
luxurious<00:02:23.790> car<00:02:24.720> like<00:02:25.020> seats<00:02:25.380> with<00:02:25.620> well

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
luxurious car like seats with well

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.559 
luxurious car like seats with well
perhaps<00:02:26.370> better<00:02:26.610> than<00:02:26.760> car<00:02:27.030> life<00:02:27.209> seats<00:02:27.420> and

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
perhaps better than car life seats and
