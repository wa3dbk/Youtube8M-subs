00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:06.720
 welcome to the new digital photographer tutorial dotcom 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.319
 today we have a technique again 

00:00:10.319 --> 00:00:12.780
 to be made in the color space 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.099
 the color 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.569
 it's a technique to be so bad you're an American color expert 

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:20.869
 and all that 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.130
 cumbia mate the brand man 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.520
 it is a technique to highlight some colors not the general tonality 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.519
 but some colors of the mpa in the color accents 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.840
 the one piece especially in the portrait 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.530
 let's see the applied to the portrait here also to the landscape 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.370
 here we have an otography of a na model 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.460
 I saved laura Salgado is a redhead she has very white skin 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.300
 This portrait has retouched digitally focused make-up 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.180
 We are going to give fulfillment that with this technique the first thing we will do 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.220
 these were to change the color space image 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.070
 rgb to color space 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.230
 lava color 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.140
 ok now instead of having the rgb layers we have the layers l ap of 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.520
 and we are going to add to the image a 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.420
 adjustment layer 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.660
 d curves 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.650
 this dialogue opens up and 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.869
 of curves 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.429
 where as we see here we have in the channels the channel luminosidad in canada 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:33.979
 and the caribbean are not going to do anything with the luminosity channel 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.530
 yes with the other two 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.030
 and what are we going to do 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.170
 well then to start with canada let's let this curve 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.730
 practically 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.730
 in vertical 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.640
 what do we do 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.870
 p 

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.760
 they stand out as if it were a psychedelic image to the Red Basques 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.610
 in some areas 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.610
 and we went to colo now mbe channels 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.840
 in the cavern art in repeating more the operation 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.189
 now 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:12.919
 the yellows and the consuls will come out in the 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:15.919
 in the image 

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:19.449
 we let the image be exaggerated 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:22.230
 we click on roque 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.930
 well we have an image that is totally unacceptable of course by 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.520
 true where the saturation that is totally 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.669
 Excessive colors are not natural 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:37.689
 but we are going to influence the opacity of zacapa and we will leave it 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.929
 in percentage, which I usually placed between 15 and 20 percent 

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:46.929
 in this case we do not leave in 15 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:53.339
 do not regret our image have two more highlighted color lens jars 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:57.579
 let's see the before and after fixed for example on the lips 

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.720
 the lips is now sincere before we were like this 

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:04.469
 again the after 

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:05.569
 much more 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.879
 intense in the shade 

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:11.029
 I cross red majó or in the eye socket 

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:17.629
 ewan mind the color of the hair that is highlighted as you see is a technique 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:18.950
 very simple 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.910
 that adds an extra color not generalized throughout the image but 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.970
 specifically in some areas now well as a hundred percent although lady 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.740
 gray the pupi gesture for portraits I find that the 

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:44.210
 the landscape is also suitable to give 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:45.259
 gurza 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:48.539
 technique here we have an image 

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:51.539
 percent in the original image that is being 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:56.329
 per hundred we have it already in lava color 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.009
 i will see what happens if you have added we have 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:02.080
 the cappa 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.639
 adjustment 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:05.749
 of curves 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:08.679
 if we go to the amc channel 

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:11.979
 if we put the curve practically in vertical 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.439
 let these areas become red 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:20.269
 they were slightly 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.050
 Orange famous area b 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.050
 the one with the channel v 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.050
 we accentuate the blue 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:32.139
 and the yellow 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:35.770
 I feel we have 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.039
 many one in the blue sky in the sea 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:40.860
 we give ap jocay 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.879
 we have a rather psychedelic image more psychedelic even than his 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:47.999
 portrait of the work savior 

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:53.299
 and again we are going to lower the opacity in this case we are going to leave it around 

00:04:53.299 --> 00:04:56.299
 see between 15 and the 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:02.300
 and what has happened 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.650
 Well, we see that 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.509
 where he before 

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:08.699
 the color differences were not my most useful 

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:14.249
 now suddenly we have the nará to the orange looking behind the 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:15.559
 clouds the dawn 

00:05:15.559 --> 00:05:20.370
 he is much more intense and nevertheless remains a very natural image 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.990
 what has happened to the blues because it is exactly the same 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:28.559
 this set the after the sky has become a reef much more 

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:31.500
 sharp with a lighter color less 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.830
 pasty - grayish 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.819
 i by the way m that looks pretty good thing that happens too 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:39.689
 at sea 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:42.539
 What do I know about Indian left in the clouds 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:43.580
 here is 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.020
 in the original shot 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.090
 clouds and sea 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:49.220
 it has a rather grayish appearance while 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.219
 for now we see that the sea was much more astute i 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.050
 it stands out more about the clouds 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.940
 so that 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.230
 I think this is a fairly simple technique with quite a few applications 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.550
 both for the portrait and for 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:07.110
 some landscapes I hope it's useful
