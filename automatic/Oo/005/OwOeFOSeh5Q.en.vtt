00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
compression abilities to do it so we're

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.109

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.350 
going to encrypt the contents to secure
data<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.629> say<00:02:10.110> okay<00:02:10.410> and<00:02:10.770> we're<00:02:11.069> going

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
data and say okay and we're going

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.230

say<00:02:11.600> apply<00:02:11.960> to<00:02:12.020> that<00:02:12.410> now<00:02:13.400> we<00:02:13.460> get<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.700> option

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
say apply to that now we get the option

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.030 
say apply to that now we get the option
to<00:02:14.270> encrypt<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.900> file<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.710> parent

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
to encrypt the file and the parent

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.160 
to encrypt the file and the parent
folder<00:02:16.220> or<00:02:16.610> in<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.300> encrypt<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.630> file<00:02:17.810> only

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
folder or in to encrypt a file only

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.660 
folder or in to encrypt a file only
we're<00:02:18.320> only<00:02:18.470> going<00:02:18.770> to<00:02:18.980> encrypt<00:02:19.340> the<00:02:19.460> file

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
we're only going to encrypt the file

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.120 
we're only going to encrypt the file
itself<00:02:19.850> we<00:02:20.360> might<00:02:20.540> not<00:02:20.660> want<00:02:20.900> to<00:02:21.020> encrypt<00:02:21.350> the

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
itself we might not want to encrypt the

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.070 
itself we might not want to encrypt the
other<00:02:22.370> files<00:02:22.700> are<00:02:22.910> in<00:02:23.060> that<00:02:23.270> folder<00:02:23.300> although

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
other files are in that folder although

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.560 
other files are in that folder although
normal<00:02:24.620> practice<00:02:25.220> is<00:02:25.460> if<00:02:25.700> you're<00:02:26.270> going<00:02:26.480> to

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:26.570 
normal practice is if you're going to

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:28.240 
normal practice is if you're going to
have<00:02:26.870> encrypted<00:02:27.290> files<00:02:27.620> keep<00:02:27.950> them<00:02:28.100> all

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
have encrypted files keep them all

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.980 
have encrypted files keep them all
together<00:02:28.370> in<00:02:28.820> one<00:02:28.850> folder<00:02:29.300> that's<00:02:29.600> also

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
together in one folder that's also

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.560 
together in one folder that's also
encrypted<00:02:30.380> that<00:02:30.800> way<00:02:31.040> when<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.400> add<00:02:31.700> files<00:02:32.360> to

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
encrypted that way when you add files to

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.270 
encrypted that way when you add files to
that<00:02:32.930> encrypted<00:02:33.350> folder<00:02:33.590> they<00:02:33.950> become

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
that encrypted folder they become

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.250 
that encrypted folder they become
encrypted<00:02:34.760> as<00:02:34.910> well<00:02:35.210> right<00:02:35.810> now<00:02:35.840> we're<00:02:36.080> only

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
encrypted as well right now we're only

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.400 
encrypted as well right now we're only
going<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.680> encrypt<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.040> one<00:02:37.220> file<00:02:38.410> we're

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
going to encrypt the one file we're

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.770 
going to encrypt the one file we're
going<00:02:39.590> to<00:02:39.709> say<00:02:39.920> okay<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.850> now<00:02:41.060> if<00:02:41.209> we<00:02:41.360> look<00:02:41.390> at

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
going to say okay and now if we look at

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.980 
going to say okay and now if we look at
it<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.610> color<00:02:43.610> context<00:02:44.209> has<00:02:44.330> changed<00:02:44.720> its<00:02:44.840> now

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
it the color context has changed its now

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.110 
it the color context has changed its now
green<00:02:45.350> in<00:02:45.620> Windows<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.310> indicates<00:02:46.940> an

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
encrypted file and as you can see we can

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.250 
encrypted file and as you can see we can
open<00:02:49.580> it<00:02:49.700> with<00:02:49.820> no<00:02:50.000> problem<00:02:50.510> all<00:02:50.959> it<00:02:51.110> is<00:02:51.230> a

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
open it with no problem all it is a

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:52.810 
open it with no problem all it is a
simple<00:02:51.620> directory<00:02:52.100> listing<00:02:52.459> by<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.640> way

nothing<00:02:53.330> secret<00:02:54.170> in<00:02:54.290> there<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.820> we<00:02:55.820> can<00:02:55.940> close

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
nothing secret in there and we can close

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.270 
nothing secret in there and we can close
it<00:02:56.480> and<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:57.050> actually<00:02:57.200> decrypt<00:02:57.830> sit<00:02:58.010> in<00:02:58.100> order

it and it actually decrypt sit in order

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.210 
it and it actually decrypt sit in order
for<00:02:58.459> us<00:02:58.489> to<00:02:58.550> look<00:02:58.820> at<00:02:59.060> it<00:02:59.180> but<00:02:59.709> we<00:03:00.709> don't<00:03:00.920> notice

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
for us to look at it but we don't notice

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.710 
for us to look at it but we don't notice
that<00:03:01.400> it's<00:03:01.550> transparent<00:03:02.270> that's<00:03:02.450> what<00:03:02.600> you

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
that it's transparent that's what you

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.250 
that it's transparent that's what you
want<00:03:03.020> from<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.410> user<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.950> have<00:03:04.610> is<00:03:04.970> a

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
want from the user to have is a

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.960 
want from the user to have is a
transparent<00:03:06.260> file<00:03:06.440> encryption<00:03:06.739> utility<00:03:07.459> okay

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
transparent file encryption utility okay

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.150 
transparent file encryption utility okay
as<00:03:08.120> we<00:03:08.270> can<00:03:08.360> see<00:03:08.540> new<00:03:08.720> product<00:03:09.020> info<00:03:09.350> is<00:03:09.560> not

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
as we can see new product info is not

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.920 
as we can see new product info is not
encrypted<00:03:10.489> now<00:03:11.150> let's<00:03:11.300> go<00:03:11.390> ahead<00:03:11.510> and<00:03:11.630> take<00:03:11.870> a

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
encrypted now let's go ahead and take a

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.220 
encrypted now let's go ahead and take a
look<00:03:12.290> at<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:12.910> command<00:03:13.910> line<00:03:14.060> utility<00:03:14.720> cipher

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
look at the command line utility cipher

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.420 
look at the command line utility cipher
as<00:03:15.410> you<00:03:15.560> can<00:03:15.709> see<00:03:15.920> from<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.160> user<00:03:16.340> perspective

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
as you can see from a user perspective

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.170 
as you can see from a user perspective
this<00:03:17.000> is<00:03:17.180> very<00:03:17.390> easy<00:03:17.600> to<00:03:17.870> use<00:03:19.030> let's<00:03:20.030> go<00:03:20.120> ahead

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
this is very easy to use let's go ahead

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.420 
this is very easy to use let's go ahead
and<00:03:20.269> take<00:03:20.360> a<00:03:20.510> look<00:03:20.780> at<00:03:23.950> the<00:03:24.950> command<00:03:25.280> line

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
and take a look at the command line

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.690 
and take a look at the command line
utility<00:03:26.000> cipher<00:03:29.470> okay<00:03:30.470> we're<00:03:30.650> going<00:03:30.860> to<00:03:30.950> run

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
utility cipher okay we're going to run

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.330 
utility cipher okay we're going to run
cipher<00:03:32.209> and<00:03:32.390> run<00:03:32.959> by<00:03:33.140> itself<00:03:33.530> it<00:03:33.830> looks<00:03:34.070> at<00:03:34.220> the

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
cipher and run by itself it looks at the

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.370 
cipher and run by itself it looks at the
current<00:03:34.640> directory<00:03:35.239> and<00:03:35.450> it<00:03:35.810> tells<00:03:36.019> you<00:03:36.260> if

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
current directory and it tells you if

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.620 
current directory and it tells you if
there's<00:03:36.590> any<00:03:36.830> encrypted<00:03:37.400> or<00:03:37.630> unencrypted

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
there's any encrypted or unencrypted

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.600

as long as it can take cipher and use it
let's<00:04:26.910> go<00:04:27.060> ahead<00:04:27.180> and<00:04:27.300> encrypt<00:04:28.340> because<00:04:29.340> it's

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
let's go ahead and encrypt because it's

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:36.140 
let's go ahead and encrypt because it's
the<00:04:29.580> best<00:04:29.610> practice<00:04:30.500> that<00:04:31.500> folder<00:04:32.100> vtc<00:04:35.150> okay

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
the best practice that folder vtc okay

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.850 
the best practice that folder vtc okay
we've<00:04:36.330> encrypted<00:04:36.780> the<00:04:36.810> directory<00:04:37.350> now<00:04:37.680> let's

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
we've encrypted the directory now let's

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.480 
we've encrypted the directory now let's
run<00:04:38.010> cipher<00:04:38.430> again<00:04:41.990> now<00:04:42.990> that<00:04:43.170> we<00:04:43.260> see<00:04:43.560> whereas

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
run cipher again now that we see whereas

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.000 
run cipher again now that we see whereas
previously<00:04:44.970> before<00:04:45.330> vtc<00:04:46.110> was<00:04:46.410> unencrypted

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
previously before vtc was unencrypted

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.550 
previously before vtc was unencrypted
now<00:04:47.520> vtc<00:04:48.120> is<00:04:48.240> showing<00:04:48.600> as<00:04:48.750> encrypted<00:04:49.290> and<00:04:49.410> we

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
now vtc is showing as encrypted and we

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.920 
now vtc is showing as encrypted and we
use<00:04:49.710> cipher<00:04:50.160> to<00:04:50.310> do<00:04:50.490> that<00:04:50.760> so<00:04:51.270> now<00:04:51.450> we<00:04:51.510> have<00:04:51.780> an

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
use cipher to do that so now we have an

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:53.510 
use cipher to do that so now we have an
encrypted<00:04:52.260> folder<00:04:52.620> now<00:04:53.070> let's<00:04:53.340> check

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
encrypted folder now let's check

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.750 
encrypted folder now let's check
something<00:04:53.940> out<00:04:54.620> it's<00:04:55.620> going<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:55.950> vtc<00:04:56.250> and<00:04:56.670> then

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
something out it's going to vtc and then

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.780 
something out it's going to vtc and then
run<00:04:56.940> cipher<00:04:57.360> again<00:04:57.630> now<00:04:58.500> encrypting<00:04:59.280> a<00:04:59.370> folder

doesn't<00:05:00.210> necessarily<00:05:00.780> mean<00:05:00.990> that<00:05:01.050> you've

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
doesn't necessarily mean that you've

doesn't necessarily mean that you've

since<00:05:06.240> it's<00:05:06.390> encrypted<00:05:06.720> will<00:05:07.380> be<00:05:07.590> encrypted

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920 
since it's encrypted will be encrypted

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
trusted recover data recovery agent and

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.960 
trusted recover data recovery agent and
this<00:05:42.900> is<00:05:43.080> a<00:05:43.250> person<00:05:44.250> or<00:05:44.400> a<00:05:44.460> user<00:05:44.700> account

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
this is a person or a user account

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.860 
this is a person or a user account
rather<00:05:45.270> that<00:05:45.570> generates<00:05:46.140> a<00:05:46.400> key<00:05:47.400> and<00:05:47.700> that<00:05:47.870> key

rather that generates a key and that key

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.710 
rather that generates a key and that key
can<00:05:49.200> be<00:05:49.350> used<00:05:49.620> also<00:05:49.920> to<00:05:50.580> recover<00:05:51.270> encrypted

their encryption key their password

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.470 
their encryption key their password
changes<00:05:56.040> so<00:05:56.430> their<00:05:56.580> crypts<00:05:56.820> and<00:05:56.910> key<00:05:57.090> changes

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:57.480 
changes so their crypts and key changes

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.630 
changes so their crypts and key changes
or<00:05:57.720> they<00:05:58.260> leave<00:05:58.500> the<00:05:58.650> organization<00:05:58.830> and<00:05:59.580> they

data<00:06:01.740> recovery<00:06:02.310> agent<00:06:02.340> can<00:06:02.940> get<00:06:03.120> those<00:06:03.330> files

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
data recovery agent can get those files

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.320 
data recovery agent can get those files
back<00:06:03.800> otherwise<00:06:04.800> if<00:06:05.160> you<00:06:05.250> don't<00:06:05.430> have<00:06:05.640> one<00:06:05.670> you

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
back otherwise if you don't have one you

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.540 
back otherwise if you don't have one you
may<00:06:06.450> have<00:06:06.570> lost<00:06:06.750> those<00:06:06.990> files<00:06:07.260> forever<00:06:07.620> so

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
may have lost those files forever so

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.740 
may have lost those files forever so
those<00:06:08.760> are<00:06:08.790> a<00:06:08.940> couple<00:06:08.970> of<00:06:09.210> things<00:06:09.420> you<00:06:09.570> might

those are a couple of things you might

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.810 
those are a couple of things you might
want<00:06:10.050> to<00:06:10.140> think<00:06:10.350> about<00:06:10.560> as<00:06:10.920> well<00:06:11.130> when<00:06:11.160> using
