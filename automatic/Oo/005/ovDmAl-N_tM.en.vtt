00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
that there's a barrier away from the

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.630 
that there's a barrier away from the
heat<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.470> that<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:31.650> don't<00:01:31.740> scorch<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.400> end<00:01:32.520> of

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
heat so that I don't scorch the end of

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.660 
heat so that I don't scorch the end of
my<00:01:32.820> move<00:01:33.689> every<00:01:33.930> day<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:35.040> we'll<00:01:35.159> get<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.460> lit

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
my move every day so we'll get that lit

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.660 
my move every day so we'll get that lit
up<00:01:35.700> later<00:01:36.000> on<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.920> there's<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.130> scale<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.430> mean

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
up later on and there's the scale I mean

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.520 
up later on and there's the scale I mean
like<00:01:38.820> it's<00:01:38.970> it's<00:01:39.299> only<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.600> small<00:01:39.930> 30<00:01:40.229> Cal<00:01:40.500> I

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
like it's it's only a small 30 Cal I

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.190 
like it's it's only a small 30 Cal I
think<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.210> so<00:01:42.210> I've<00:01:42.299> just<00:01:42.360> got<00:01:42.600> some<00:01:42.810> smalls

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
think it is so I've just got some smalls

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.859 
think it is so I've just got some smalls
hopefully<00:01:43.590> off<00:01:43.710> I'll<00:01:44.009> need<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.880> chop<00:01:45.630> some<00:01:45.780> of

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
hopefully off I'll need to chop some of

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.520 
hopefully off I'll need to chop some of
this<00:01:45.930> down<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.259> get<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.470> going<00:01:46.649> but<00:01:47.509> for<00:01:48.530> for

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
this down to get it going but for for

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.749 
this down to get it going but for for
sleeping<00:01:50.009> I'll<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.280> try<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.490> chuck<00:01:50.729> a

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
sleeping I'll just try and chuck a

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.090 
sleeping I'll just try and chuck a
couple<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.290> rounds<00:01:52.290> in<00:01:52.409> there<00:01:52.560> so<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:52.950> should

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
couple of rounds in there so that should

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.230 
couple of rounds in there so that should
keep<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.399> going<00:01:53.579> for<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> little<00:01:53.880> while<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.060> mean

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
keep it going for a little while I mean

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.060 
keep it going for a little while I mean
like<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.450> does<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:55.140> retains<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.590> warmth<00:01:55.920> in

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
like it does it retains the warmth in

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.179 
like it does it retains the warmth in
there<00:01:56.219> pretty<00:01:56.520> pretty<00:01:57.000> well<00:01:57.090> but<00:01:57.540> we'll<00:01:58.189> we'll

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
there pretty pretty well but we'll we'll

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.830 
there pretty pretty well but we'll we'll
Stoke<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.549> up<00:01:59.640> later<00:01:59.820> on<00:01:59.909> we<00:02:00.450> set<00:02:00.659> up<00:02:00.719> this

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
Stoke it up later on we set up this

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.260 
Stoke it up later on we set up this
little<00:02:01.020> wind<00:02:01.290> deflector<00:02:01.790> just<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.909> stop<00:02:03.149> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
little wind deflector just to stop the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.170 
little wind deflector just to stop the
wind<00:02:03.420> from<00:02:03.540> being<00:02:03.869> forced<00:02:04.320> down<00:02:04.350> into<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.180> end

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
wind from being forced down into the end

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.700 
wind from being forced down into the end
of<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.390> stove<00:02:06.659> itself<00:02:07.049> but<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.409> seemed<00:02:07.619> to

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
of the stove itself but that seemed to

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:17.830 
of the stove itself but that seemed to
work<00:02:07.860> fairly<00:02:08.220> effectively

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.210 

just<00:02:19.390> settling<00:02:20.390> into<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.750> pop<00:02:20.930> 10<00:02:21.170> had<00:02:22.070> the

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
just settling into the pop 10 had the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.670 
just settling into the pop 10 had the
fire<00:02:22.430> going<00:02:22.760> in<00:02:22.970> there<00:02:23.150> tore<00:02:24.110> me<00:02:24.230> up<00:02:24.260> I've<00:02:24.530> just

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
fire going in there tore me up I've just

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.520 
fire going in there tore me up I've just
got<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:24.920> yeah<00:02:27.310> just<00:02:28.310> got<00:02:28.490> some<00:02:28.670> hot<00:02:28.850> water<00:02:29.530> just

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
got a yeah just got some hot water just

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.730 
got a yeah just got some hot water just
come<00:02:30.710> to<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.920> boil<00:02:31.160> now<00:02:32.260> really<00:02:33.260> really<00:02:33.500> warm

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
come to the boil now really really warm

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.110 
come to the boil now really really warm
in<00:02:33.860> here<00:02:34.040> it's<00:02:34.160> quite<00:02:34.340> a<00:02:34.370> cold<00:02:34.640> night<00:02:34.880> down

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120

in here it's quite a cold night down
here<00:02:35.150> in<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.570> forest<00:02:36.370> winds<00:02:37.370> are<00:02:37.460> up<00:02:37.610> I<00:02:37.910> think

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
here in the forest winds are up I think

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.210 
here in the forest winds are up I think
that<00:02:38.900> some<00:02:39.110> boys<00:02:39.350> sit<00:02:39.620> on<00:02:39.740> the<00:02:39.890> thermometer

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
that some boys sit on the thermometer

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.670 
that some boys sit on the thermometer
set<00:02:40.670> around<00:02:40.880> round<00:02:41.630> 8<00:02:41.990> but<00:02:42.410> with<00:02:42.560> the

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
set around round 8 but with the

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.350 
set around round 8 but with the
windchill<00:02:43.010> that<00:02:43.310> really<00:02:43.670> feels<00:02:43.880> like<00:02:44.030> it's

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
windchill that really feels like it's

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.950
