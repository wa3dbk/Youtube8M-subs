00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.539 
ties these other heavier-duty surprised
to<00:02:42.489> get<00:02:43.180> all<00:02:43.299> these<00:02:43.530> wires<00:02:44.530> clipped<00:02:45.100> uh<00:02:45.190> but<00:02:45.400> I

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
to get all these wires clipped uh but I

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:46.860 
to get all these wires clipped uh but I
had<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.760> come<00:02:45.850> up<00:02:45.970> with<00:02:46.090> a<00:02:46.120> better<00:02:46.329> system<00:02:46.540> cuz

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
had to come up with a better system cuz

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.740 
had to come up with a better system cuz
it<00:02:46.989> doesn't<00:02:47.170> look<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:47.440> nice<00:02:48.420> probably<00:02:49.420> what

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
it doesn't look that nice probably what

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.410 
it doesn't look that nice probably what
I<00:02:49.780> should<00:02:50.019> do<00:02:50.170> is<00:02:50.820> have<00:02:51.820> some<00:02:51.970> kind<00:02:52.120> of<00:02:52.209> cover

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
I should do is have some kind of cover

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.770 
I should do is have some kind of cover
to<00:02:52.690> cover<00:02:52.810> all<00:02:53.079> this<00:02:53.230> maybe<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.970> table<00:02:54.970> one<00:02:55.690> of

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
to cover all this maybe a table one of

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.690 
to cover all this maybe a table one of
those<00:02:55.870> plastic<00:02:56.290> tablecloths<00:02:56.799> or<00:02:57.130> maybe<00:02:57.489> some

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
those plastic tablecloths or maybe some

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.750 
those plastic tablecloths or maybe some
felt<00:02:58.030> or<00:02:58.269> something<00:02:59.370> that's<00:03:00.370> quite<00:03:00.579> something

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
felt or something that's quite something

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.350 
felt or something that's quite something
I<00:03:00.970> should<00:03:01.180> look<00:03:01.299> at<00:03:01.450> because<00:03:02.519> this<00:03:03.519> kind<00:03:04.180> of

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
I should look at because this kind of

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.030 
I should look at because this kind of
claim<00:03:04.630> but<00:03:04.840> I<00:03:04.870> think<00:03:05.140> what<00:03:05.290> the<00:03:05.410> cover<00:03:05.620> looked

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
claim but I think what the cover looked

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.190 
claim but I think what the cover looked
better<00:03:07.530> but<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.560> am<00:03:08.769> running<00:03:08.980> the<00:03:09.190> virtual<00:03:09.340> DJ

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
better but I am running the virtual DJ

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.650 
better but I am running the virtual DJ
al<00:03:11.200> e<00:03:11.560> which<00:03:11.980> is<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.700> guess<00:03:13.030> it's<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.360> light

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
al e which is the I guess it's a light

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.830 
al e which is the I guess it's a light
addition<00:03:14.140> it<00:03:14.470> comes<00:03:14.739> free<00:03:15.010> with<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.840> Mixtrack

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
speakers but I mean I guess that's

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.850 
speakers but I mean I guess that's
already<00:05:29.460> 200<00:05:29.849> bucks<00:05:30.000> but<00:05:30.270> you<00:05:30.740> could<00:05:31.740> probably

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 
already 200 bucks but you could probably

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.580 
already 200 bucks but you could probably
mix<00:05:32.159> and<00:05:32.280> match<00:05:32.400> different<00:05:32.430> parts<00:05:33.090> as<00:05:33.409> you<00:05:34.409> see

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
mix and match different parts as you see

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.860 
mix and match different parts as you see

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
fit make this thing even a little bit

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.589 
fit make this thing even a little bit
cheaper<00:05:37.139> than<00:05:37.289> what<00:05:37.560> I<00:05:37.590> got<00:05:37.770> it<00:05:37.889> for<00:05:38.039> so

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599
