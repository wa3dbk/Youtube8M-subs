which will make the de molding process

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.629 
which will make the de molding process
easier<00:00:53.199> than<00:00:53.589> if<00:00:53.739> we<00:00:53.859> had<00:00:53.979> screwed<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:54.399> frame

easier than if we had screwed the frame
together<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:56.559> have<00:00:56.649> made<00:00:56.859> sure<00:00:56.889> the<00:00:57.129> mold<00:00:57.519> is

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
together we have made sure the mold is

this edge which will become necessary

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.169 
this edge which will become necessary
when<00:01:59.259> we<00:01:59.409> begin<00:01:59.740> to<00:01:59.799> cut<00:02:00.219> our<00:02:00.429> clear<00:02:00.759> mold<00:02:00.999> in

next we remove our last two clamps and
pry<00:04:02.500> the<00:04:02.560> two<00:04:02.890> halves<00:04:03.129> apart<00:04:03.360> revealing<00:04:04.360> our

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
pry the two halves apart revealing our

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.760 
pry the two halves apart revealing our
clear<00:04:04.780> mold

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
clear mold

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.490

as<00:04:06.970> you<00:04:07.970> can<00:04:08.120> see<00:04:08.390> most<00:04:09.050> of<00:04:09.170> the<00:04:09.290> surface

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
as you can see most of the surface

as you can see most of the surface
bubbles<00:04:10.070> that<00:04:10.190> appeared<00:04:10.610> at<00:04:10.730> the<00:04:10.760> end<00:04:10.970> of<00:04:11.150> our

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.009 
bubbles that appeared at the end of our
pour<00:04:11.570> have<00:04:12.050> broken<00:04:12.590> as<00:04:12.770> the<00:04:12.950> mold<00:04:13.160> cured

here<00:04:17.019> we<00:04:17.170> are<00:04:17.200> removing<00:04:17.739> the<00:04:17.829> flashing<00:04:18.340> around

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
here we are removing the flashing around

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.610 
here we are removing the flashing around
the<00:04:18.850> mold<00:04:19.120> which<00:04:19.660> was<00:04:19.870> created<00:04:20.410> when<00:04:20.590> the

the mold which was created when the

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.530 
the mold which was created when the
silicone<00:04:21.130> rubber<00:04:21.370> seeped<00:04:21.880> between<00:04:22.390> the

silicone rubber seeped between the
plywood<00:04:22.960> sections<00:04:23.550> notice<00:04:24.550> how<00:04:24.700> easily<00:04:25.000> we

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
plywood sections notice how easily we

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
can see the clear tape parting line

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.740 
can see the clear tape parting line
because<00:04:27.580> we<00:04:27.730> had<00:04:27.850> marked<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.270> ends<00:04:28.600> of<00:04:28.690> the

now<00:04:32.780> it<00:04:32.990> is<00:04:33.110> time<00:04:33.319> to<00:04:33.560> cut<00:04:33.770> our<00:04:33.979> parting<00:04:34.430> line

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
now it is time to cut our parting line

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.790 
now it is time to cut our parting line
we<00:04:35.210> mark<00:04:35.509> the<00:04:35.689> edge<00:04:35.840> of<00:04:36.080> our<00:04:36.199> gouge<00:04:36.439> with<00:04:36.650> a

we mark the edge of our gouge with a

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.770 
we mark the edge of our gouge with a

but<00:04:50.300> rather<00:04:50.539> we<00:04:50.840> are<00:04:50.870> planning<00:04:51.259> on<00:04:51.469> taking<00:04:51.650> two

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:52.069 
but rather we are planning on taking two

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:54.790 
but rather we are planning on taking two
passes<00:04:52.550> with<00:04:52.580> the<00:04:52.879> gouge<00:04:53.120> this<00:04:54.080> conservative

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
passes with the gouge this conservative

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.830 
passes with the gouge this conservative
approach<00:04:55.099> not<00:04:55.430> only<00:04:55.460> makes<00:04:55.909> it<00:04:56.060> easier<00:04:56.120> to<00:04:56.509> cut

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
approach not only makes it easier to cut

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.439 
approach not only makes it easier to cut
but<00:04:57.530> it<00:04:57.650> also<00:04:57.830> establishes<00:04:58.129> a<00:04:58.639> more<00:04:58.909> complex

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
but it also establishes a more complex

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.600 
but it also establishes a more complex
registration<00:05:00.289> that<00:05:00.770> will<00:05:00.949> ensure<00:05:01.250> proper

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
registration that will ensure proper

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.200 
registration that will ensure proper
alignment<00:05:02.030> of<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.599> two<00:05:02.810> mold<00:05:03.050> halves<00:05:03.289> later

our<00:05:05.210> first<00:05:05.539> pass<00:05:05.779> simply<00:05:06.259> establishes<00:05:06.889> the

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009 
our first pass simply establishes the

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:09.730 
our first pass simply establishes the
outside<00:05:07.490> of<00:05:07.639> our<00:05:07.759> parting<00:05:08.150> line<00:05:08.590> with<00:05:09.590> the

outside of our parting line with the
second<00:05:10.129> pass<00:05:10.340> we<00:05:10.610> place<00:05:11.090> a<00:05:11.120> wedge<00:05:11.539> in<00:05:11.810> this

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
second pass we place a wedge in this

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.080 
second pass we place a wedge in this
established<00:05:12.680> parting<00:05:13.069> line<00:05:13.219> which<00:05:13.669> makes<00:05:13.969> it

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
established parting line which makes it

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.179 
established parting line which makes it
easier<00:05:14.509> to<00:05:14.659> access<00:05:14.840> and<00:05:15.349> then<00:05:15.740> cut<00:05:16.009> the

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:16.189 
easier to access and then cut the

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:17.830 
easier to access and then cut the
remaining<00:05:16.490> rubber<00:05:16.879> all<00:05:17.090> the<00:05:17.360> way<00:05:17.479> to<00:05:17.539> our

rubber not completely cut through and

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.890 
rubber not completely cut through and
therefore<00:05:25.819> keeping<00:05:26.360> the<00:05:26.479> two<00:05:26.659> halves

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
therefore keeping the two halves

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.350 
therefore keeping the two halves

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.870 

we<00:05:37.140> remove<00:05:37.530> the<00:05:37.650> clear<00:05:37.920> tape<00:05:38.130> from<00:05:38.400> the<00:05:38.550> model

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
we remove the clear tape from the model

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:46.190 
we remove the clear tape from the model
and<00:05:39.060> then<00:05:39.570> pull<00:05:39.900> the<00:05:40.020> model<00:05:40.350> out<00:05:40.560> of<00:05:40.740> the<00:05:40.830> mold

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.350 

now<00:05:47.200> we<00:05:47.260> are<00:05:47.500> ready<00:05:47.710> to<00:05:47.800> cast<00:05:48.160> our<00:05:48.400> part<00:05:48.700> which

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.360 
now we are ready to cast our part which

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.840 
now we are ready to cast our part which
requires<00:05:49.810> us<00:05:50.050> to<00:05:50.080> pour<00:05:50.470> our<00:05:50.710> Freeman<00:05:51.160> 1060

requires us to pour our Freeman 1060
semi<00:05:52.330> rigid<00:05:52.540> urethane<00:05:53.170> around<00:05:53.710> a<00:05:53.860> metal<00:05:54.010> core

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
semi rigid urethane around a metal core

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.210 
semi rigid urethane around a metal core
the<00:05:55.540> metal<00:05:55.870> core<00:05:56.140> and<00:05:56.410> the<00:05:56.470> threads<00:05:56.770> make<00:05:57.070> this

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
the metal core and the threads make this

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.810 
the metal core and the threads make this
particular<00:05:57.820> part<00:05:58.120> more<00:05:58.390> involved<00:05:59.050> than<00:05:59.200> most

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
particular part more involved than most

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.340 
particular part more involved than most
therefore<00:06:00.820> most<00:06:01.180> other<00:06:01.450> clear<00:06:01.780> mold<00:06:02.020> making

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
therefore most other clear mold making

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.860 
therefore most other clear mold making
projects<00:06:02.830> will<00:06:03.190> be<00:06:03.220> less<00:06:03.580> complex<00:06:04.060> and<00:06:04.300> easier

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
projects will be less complex and easier

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.350 
projects will be less complex and easier
to<00:06:04.900> complete<00:06:05.640> since<00:06:06.640> we<00:06:06.790> don't<00:06:07.030> want<00:06:07.270> the
