00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.039
 gathered at this table and between a conversation and 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.680
 another beer and another and a cup and 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.039
 another one of wine rose to the kitchen 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.750
 in order to be worth the snacks of the 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:03.570

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.740
 therapy 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.860

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.560
 time and have friends gathered around 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.780

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.460
 That relaxation cooks for me. 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.409
 as an occupational therapy to leave 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.409
 a bit of the routine of the problems of 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.320
 money and mathematical problems 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.780

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.659
