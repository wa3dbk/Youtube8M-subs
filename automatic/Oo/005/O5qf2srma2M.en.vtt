00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.540
 hello to all I am viso and today I come to you 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.950
 talk about the flashes of the peepholes 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.850
 and first of all what we're going to see 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.340
 here is if the laser invalidates the flash 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.230
 from the peephole as you can see my 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.710
 Charlie's partner is during the boy 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.240
 with a sniper and there you see the laser you have 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.589
 laser equipped but as you can see 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.800
 long distance laser 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:30.659
 is canceled, nothing is seen, therefore if 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.430
 class is available to override the 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:34.850
 of this and to the extent you do not do it because 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.750
 he does not 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:40.969
 only in the one you only see up close 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.719
 you can also try to cancel the 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:46.280
 flash of the peephole with the flashlight 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.260
 but we find the same 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.629
 situation as you can see here already 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.250
 begins to see a small flash of 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.019
 the flashlight and as we 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.350
 we approach as it increases 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:59.629
 gradually but we see that from a distance 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.489
 you see nothing as you can see every time 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.049
 see less come we are to a certain 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.659
 distance we're not going to see practically 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.789
 nothing we only see the flash of the 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.319
 peephole so we see that long 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:12.940
 distance from I'm almerÃ­a I do not know 

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:16.270
 can cancel in any way 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.070
 we went to look at the flashes of 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.230
 all the peepholes start with the 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.260
 peephole of three with four increases as 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.390
 you can see there is nothing you can not see anything 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:29.440
 there is no flash of any light and it is 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.590
 that indoor rods increase the 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.230
 from the cobra to the SLR and these from a 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.670
 increase they also have no light is 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:41.890
 of 3.4 the pk is as we have seen no 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.840
 had glint in the American model 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.290
 neither has flash here we are 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.110
 seeing the lake the increase of the 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.070
 four magnification peephole and we see that 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.450
 neither has flash in this in this 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.190
 visualization we see the ts or the version 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.410
 Russian and the American does not have 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.270
 flash and here we are already making a 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.690
 seven-times yellow the pk that 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.150
 script 07 the Russian version a version 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.180
 American is eight arguments 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.070
 in the sleepers and ruices is 6 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.590
 increases also has flash starting 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:17.380
 of 6 increases already have flash as 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.600
 you can see and also in the flash and a 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.670
 detail as you have seen now that 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.650
 I was approaching the companion 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.940
 if you are very close to the flash you can not see 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.830
 the flash only starts to see 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.830
 from about 10 meters 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.590
 and here we are already seeing the last 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.380
 peephole to the 12-fold that also 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.110
 has flash as I said from 6 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.270
 increases have flash below no and 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.940
 if you know more trick you tell me 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.769
 as always in the credits and if it has 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.849
 liked like favorites and if not no and we 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.849
 we see in the next trick
