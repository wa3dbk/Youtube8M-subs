it's<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.670> new<00:00:42.030> our<00:00:42.330> v6<00:00:42.980> this<00:00:43.980> replaces<00:00:44.370> our

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
it's the new our v6 this replaces our

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.509 
it's the new our v6 this replaces our
former<00:00:44.940> rv5<00:00:45.540> pedal<00:00:46.019> it's<00:00:46.769> a<00:00:46.830> brand<00:00:47.100> new<00:00:47.160> pedal

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
former rv5 pedal it's a brand new pedal

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.460 
former rv5 pedal it's a brand new pedal
with<00:00:47.640> all<00:00:47.910> new<00:00:48.150> algorithms<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.170> these<00:00:49.320> were

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
with all new algorithms and these were

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.920 
with all new algorithms and these were
developed<00:00:49.620> by<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.970> engineer<00:00:51.479> who<00:00:51.720> actually

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
developed by the engineer who actually

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.109 
developed by the engineer who actually
did<00:00:52.379> all<00:00:52.589> of<00:00:52.710> our<00:00:52.799> rackmount<00:00:53.280> reverb<00:00:53.760> effects

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:54.119 
did all of our rackmount reverb effects

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:56.780 
did all of our rackmount reverb effects
and<00:00:54.449> delay<00:00:54.809> effects<00:00:55.220> back<00:00:56.220> in<00:00:56.339> the<00:00:56.430> 80s<00:00:56.699> and

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:56.790 
and delay effects back in the 80s and

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.359 
and delay effects back in the 80s and
90s<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.720> were<00:00:57.900> so<00:00:58.290> highly<00:00:58.799> rated<00:00:59.129> and

00:00:59.359 --> 00:00:59.369 
90s that were so highly rated and

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:02.210 
90s that were so highly rated and
acclaimed<00:00:59.930> these<00:01:00.930> new<00:01:01.170> algorithms<00:01:01.769> are

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
acclaimed these new algorithms are

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.060 
acclaimed these new algorithms are
really<00:01:02.280> quite<00:01:02.909> amazing<00:01:03.180> they<00:01:03.510> sound<00:01:03.869> great<00:01:04.140> my

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
really quite amazing they sound great my

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.710 
really quite amazing they sound great my
personal<00:01:05.580> favorite<00:01:05.909> is<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.060> modulated

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
personal favorite is the modulated

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.630 
personal favorite is the modulated
reverb<00:01:07.110> but<00:01:07.890> we<00:01:08.040> have<00:01:08.250> eight<00:01:08.460> different

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
reverb but we have eight different

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.160 
reverb but we have eight different
algorithms<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.570> have<00:01:09.689> everything<00:01:09.930> from

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
algorithms we have everything from

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.760 
algorithms we have everything from
plates<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.799> halls<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.340> rooms<00:01:11.869> we<00:01:12.869> have<00:01:13.110> shimmer

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
plates to halls to rooms we have shimmer

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.880 
plates to halls to rooms we have shimmer
type<00:01:14.070> effects<00:01:14.490> now<00:01:15.229> we<00:01:16.229> also<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.710> brought

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
type effects now we also have brought

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.670 
type effects now we also have brought
back<00:01:17.159> from<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.610> rv3<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:19.020> ability<00:01:19.380> to<00:01:19.409> do<00:01:19.650> a

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
back from the rv3 the ability to do a

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.370 
back from the rv3 the ability to do a
delay<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.700> reverb<00:01:21.030> at<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.479> same<00:01:21.720> time<00:01:22.020> so

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
delay and reverb at the same time so

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.990 
delay and reverb at the same time so
that's<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.650> big<00:01:22.830> deal<00:01:23.010> so<00:01:23.280> now<00:01:23.430> we<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.820> as

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
that's a big deal so now we have that as

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.950 
that's a big deal so now we have that as
well<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.510> Don<00:01:25.290> if<00:01:25.770> you'd<00:01:25.980> be<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.250> kind<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:26.730> to

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
well so Don if you'd be so kind as to

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.360 
well so Don if you'd be so kind as to
maybe<00:01:27.960> play<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> couple<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.500> chords<00:01:28.710> dry<00:01:29.040> and

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
maybe play a couple of chords dry and

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.980 
maybe play a couple of chords dry and
we'll<00:01:29.760> hear<00:01:29.970> what<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.090> sounds<00:01:30.630> like

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.200 

there's<00:01:36.530> no<00:01:36.799> reverb<00:01:37.010> and<00:01:37.460> now<00:01:37.909> we're<00:01:38.030> going<00:01:38.150> to

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
there's no reverb and now we're going to

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.670 
there's no reverb and now we're going to
engage<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.750> pedal<00:01:39.020> we<00:01:39.110> have<00:01:39.229> it<00:01:39.350> set<00:01:39.530> on<00:01:39.560> a

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
engage the pedal we have it set on a

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:50.980 
engage the pedal we have it set on a
modulated<00:01:40.340> reverb

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.760 

beautiful<00:01:51.990> beautiful

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
beautiful beautiful

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.930 
beautiful beautiful
so<00:01:53.430> yeah<00:01:53.580> the<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:54.480> other<00:01:55.550> sounds<00:01:56.550> in<00:01:56.670> here<00:01:56.790> we

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
so yeah the the other sounds in here we

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.420 
so yeah the the other sounds in here we
have<00:01:57.150> a<00:01:57.200> let's<00:01:58.200> do<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> room<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:59.160> know<00:01:59.190> these

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
have a let's do a room you know these

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.250 
have a let's do a room you know these
room<00:01:59.670> simulations<00:02:00.390> especially<00:02:00.990> in<00:02:01.050> when<00:02:01.170> you

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
room simulations especially in when you

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:11.809 
room simulations especially in when you
lower<00:02:01.410> the<00:02:01.620> time<00:02:01.830> very<00:02:02.550> realistic

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.789 

very<00:02:12.420> nice<00:02:13.019> and<00:02:13.200> also<00:02:14.159> let's<00:02:15.079> do<00:02:16.079> a<00:02:16.109> delay<00:02:16.620> in

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
very nice and also let's do a delay in

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:32.569 
very nice and also let's do a delay in
reverb<00:02:17.099> at<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.400> same<00:02:17.579> time<00:02:30.650> next<00:02:31.650> on<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:32.459> our

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
reverb at the same time next on the our

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:35.990 
reverb at the same time next on the our
v6<00:02:32.730> has<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.180> ability<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.769> add<00:02:34.769> an<00:02:35.519> eb-5

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
v6 has the ability to add an eb-5

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.849 
v6 has the ability to add an eb-5
expression<00:02:36.659> pedal<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.019> it<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.709> way<00:02:37.799> you

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
expression pedal to it and that way you

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.550 
expression pedal to it and that way you
can<00:02:38.040> control<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.639> reverb<00:02:38.970> level<00:02:39.420> on<00:02:40.170> all<00:02:40.409> of

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
can control the reverb level on all of

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.750 
can control the reverb level on all of
the<00:02:40.650> algorithms<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:41.939> stunning<00:02:42.659> sound<00:02:43.760> great

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
the algorithms so stunning sound great

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.610 
the algorithms so stunning sound great
