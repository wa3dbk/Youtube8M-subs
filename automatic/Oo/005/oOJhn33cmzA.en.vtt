guess I didn't explain that when you

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.620 
guess I didn't explain that when you
kill<00:01:07.140> someone<00:01:07.350> whoever<00:01:08.340> whoever<00:01:08.909> they<00:01:09.570> were

kill someone whoever whoever they were
going<00:01:09.930> after<00:01:10.260> now<00:01:10.590> you're<00:01:10.799> going<00:01:10.979> after<00:01:11.159> them

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
going after now you're going after them

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.399 
going after now you're going after them
it<00:01:11.640> that's<00:01:12.150> your<00:01:12.330> new<00:01:12.390> killing<00:01:12.659> assignment<00:01:13.049> so

it that's your new killing assignment so

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.980 
it that's your new killing assignment so
sometimes<00:01:13.830> person<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.549> person<00:01:14.700> B<00:01:14.990> might

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
sometimes person a and person B might

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.870 
sometimes person a and person B might
have<00:01:16.140> each<00:01:16.259> other<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.400> one<00:01:17.549> kills<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
have each other and so on one kills the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.370 
have each other and so on one kills the
other<00:01:17.970> they<00:01:18.780> don't<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.049> new<00:01:19.140> assignment

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
other they don't have a new assignment

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.060 
other they don't have a new assignment
and<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.420> there<00:01:21.420> has<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.659> be<00:01:21.689> some<00:01:22.070> slightly

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
and so there has to be some slightly

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.160 
and so there has to be some slightly
non-random<00:01:23.850> way<00:01:24.030> something<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.960> little<00:01:25.080> more

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
non-random way something a little more

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.039 
non-random way something a little more
organized<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:26.490> way<00:01:27.150> to<00:01:27.210> distribute<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.840> names

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
organized a way to distribute the names

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.249 
organized a way to distribute the names
and<00:01:28.229> here's<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> puzzle<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.869> course<00:01:30.869> we<00:01:31.079> could

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
and here's the puzzle of course we could

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.950 
and here's the puzzle of course we could
have<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.740> third<00:01:32.640> party<00:01:33.329> person<00:01:33.659> who's<00:01:33.840> not

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
playing the game to organize the list

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.840 
playing the game to organize the list
and<00:01:35.930> in<00:01:36.930> such<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.200> way<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.460> no<00:01:38.460> two<00:01:38.520> people

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
and in such a way that no two people

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.819 
and in such a way that no two people
have<00:01:38.880> each<00:01:39.090> other<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.479> beginning<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.990> I

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
have each other in the beginning and I

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.289 
have each other in the beginning and I
mean<00:01:41.100> that's<00:01:41.189> fine<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:41.729> we<00:01:41.850> only<00:01:41.939> have<00:01:42.119> eight

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
mean that's fine but we only have eight

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.580 
mean that's fine but we only have eight
people<00:01:42.659> and<00:01:42.720> all<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.110> want<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.380> play<00:01:43.530> so

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
people and all this want to play so

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.249 
people and all this want to play so
we're<00:01:43.920> trying<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.189> think<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.549> way<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:45.450> only

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
we're trying to think of a way that only

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.929 
we're trying to think of a way that only
participants<00:01:49.259> can<00:01:49.409> organize<00:01:49.770> this<00:01:49.979> list<00:01:50.280> but

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
participants can organize this list but

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.030 
participants can organize this list but
do<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.329> an<00:01:51.479> impartial<00:01:51.840> way<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.380> such<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.860> way

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
do it in an impartial way in such a way

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.469 
do it in an impartial way in such a way
that<00:01:53.070> none<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.460> us<00:01:53.579> have<00:01:53.790> an<00:01:53.880> advantage<00:01:54.180> by

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
that none of us have an advantage by

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.630 
that none of us have an advantage by
knowing<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.899> master<00:01:55.320> list<00:01:55.350> now<00:01:56.159> my<00:01:56.430> friend

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
knowing the master list now my friend

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.039 
knowing the master list now my friend
Daniel<00:01:56.939> Gingrich<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.360> came<00:01:57.600> up<00:01:57.630> with<00:01:57.869> a<00:01:57.930> way

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
Daniel Gingrich and I came up with a way

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.649 
Daniel Gingrich and I came up with a way
that<00:01:58.170> works<00:01:58.290> pretty<00:01:58.500> well<00:01:59.390> it'll<00:02:00.390> work

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
that works pretty well it'll work

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.200 
that works pretty well it'll work
twenty-five<00:02:01.290> percent<00:02:01.469> of<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.799> time<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.250> I

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
twenty-five percent of the time and I

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.120 
twenty-five percent of the time and I
mean<00:02:03.479> it'll<00:02:04.110> work<00:02:04.290> seventy-five<00:02:04.799> percent<00:02:04.979> of

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
mean it'll work seventy-five percent of

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.590 
mean it'll work seventy-five percent of
the<00:02:05.189> time<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:05.880> twenty-five<00:02:06.240> percent<00:02:06.390> of

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
the time and the twenty-five percent of

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.160 
the time and the twenty-five percent of
the<00:02:06.659> time<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.990> it

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
the time that it

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.660 
the time that it
doesn't<00:02:07.350> work<00:02:07.500> we'll<00:02:07.890> know<00:02:08.099> by<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.340> first

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
doesn't work we'll know by the first

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.780 
doesn't work we'll know by the first
drawing<00:02:09.140> and<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.470> we<00:02:10.590> can<00:02:10.740> quickly<00:02:10.920> redraw

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
drawing and so we can quickly redraw

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.690 
drawing and so we can quickly redraw
them<00:02:11.910> that's<00:02:12.120> not<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.330> problem<00:02:12.800> but<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.340> system

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
them that's not a problem but the system

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.160 
them that's not a problem but the system
is<00:02:14.819> fairly<00:02:15.030> easily<00:02:15.270> hacked<00:02:15.660> so<00:02:15.989> I'm<00:02:16.080> looking

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
is fairly easily hacked so I'm looking

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.229 
is fairly easily hacked so I'm looking
for<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.470> better<00:02:16.620> way<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.830> do<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.099> i'll<00:02:17.250> post<00:02:17.970> a

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
for a better way to do it i'll post a

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.059 
for a better way to do it i'll post a
little<00:02:18.599> later<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:19.410> method<00:02:19.739> that<00:02:19.770> we<00:02:19.920> actually

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
little later the method that we actually

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.790 
little later the method that we actually
used<00:02:20.459> but<00:02:21.150> I'd<00:02:21.510> like<00:02:21.660> some<00:02:21.840> ideas<00:02:22.170> what<00:02:22.410> are

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
used but I'd like some ideas what are

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.059 
used but I'd like some ideas what are
your<00:02:22.890> idea<00:02:23.130> is<00:02:23.220> how<00:02:23.340> can<00:02:23.400> we<00:02:23.700> organize<00:02:24.209> a<00:02:24.450> list

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
your idea is how can we organize a list

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.340 
your idea is how can we organize a list
of<00:02:26.120> assignments<00:02:27.120> of<00:02:27.540> killing<00:02:27.810> assignments<00:02:28.230> in

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
of assignments of killing assignments in

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.770 
of assignments of killing assignments in
such<00:02:29.340> a<00:02:29.370> way<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:29.550> none<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:29.940> us<00:02:30.120> know<00:02:30.420> the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
such a way that none of us know the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.199 
such a way that none of us know the
entire<00:02:31.440> list<00:02:31.770> we<00:02:32.340> only<00:02:32.489> know<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.880> person<00:02:33.180> that

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
entire list we only know the person that

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.050 
entire list we only know the person that
were<00:02:33.360> assigned<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:35.280> other<00:02:35.400> ideas<00:02:35.700> post

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
were assigned to the other ideas post

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.580 
were assigned to the other ideas post
them<00:02:36.209> as<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.390> video<00:02:36.569> response<00:02:36.690> text<00:02:37.260> response

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
them as a video response text response

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.979 
them as a video response text response
whatever<00:02:38.580> and<00:02:38.849> I<00:02:39.239> look<00:02:39.450> forward<00:02:39.480> handful

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
whatever and I look forward handful
