goal today explain how the development

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.240 
goal today explain how the development
of<00:00:10.950> agricultural<00:00:11.610> techniques<00:00:12.030> such<00:00:12.450> as

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:13.250 
of agricultural techniques such as

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.279 
of agricultural techniques such as
irrigation<00:00:14.250> systems<00:00:15.059> led<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.990> emergence

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
irrigation systems led to the emergence

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.150 
irrigation systems led to the emergence
of<00:00:16.680> Sumerian<00:00:17.400> city-states<00:00:18.590> all<00:00:19.590> right<00:00:19.800> so

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
of Sumerian city-states all right so

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.029 
of Sumerian city-states all right so
when<00:00:20.880> we<00:00:21.000> talk<00:00:21.210> a<00:00:21.420> Greek<00:00:21.660> ultra<00:00:22.199> we're<00:00:22.740> talking

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
when we talk a Greek ultra we're talking

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.120 
when we talk a Greek ultra we're talking
about<00:00:23.130> farming<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.240> growing<00:00:25.170> crops<00:00:25.710> and

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
about farming so growing crops and

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.419 
about farming so growing crops and
raising<00:00:26.670> animals<00:00:28.039> and<00:00:29.039> when<00:00:29.189> we<00:00:29.250> talk

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
raising animals and when we talk

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.830 
raising animals and when we talk
city-states<00:00:30.000> obviously<00:00:30.480> we're<00:00:30.630> talking

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
city-states obviously we're talking

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.380 
city-states obviously we're talking
about<00:00:30.929> independent<00:00:31.710> cities<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:33.000> have<00:00:33.210> their

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
about independent cities that have their

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.190 
about independent cities that have their
own<00:00:33.420> religion<00:00:34.079> laws<00:00:34.550> government<00:00:36.200> completely

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
own religion laws government completely

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.319 
own religion laws government completely
independent<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.100> other<00:00:38.730> cities

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
independent of the other cities

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.860 
independent of the other cities
surrounding<00:00:39.899> okay<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:42.239> what<00:00:42.629> we're<00:00:42.809> gonna

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
surrounding okay so what we're gonna

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.290 
surrounding okay so what we're gonna
talk<00:00:43.170> about<00:00:43.200> specifically<00:00:44.190> most<00:00:44.610> important

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
talk about specifically most important

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.660 
talk about specifically most important
is<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.930> irrigation<00:00:46.350> system<00:00:46.649> I'm<00:00:47.309> also<00:00:47.460> gonna

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
is the irrigation system I'm also gonna

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.350 
is the irrigation system I'm also gonna
discuss<00:00:48.149> levees<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.489> the<00:00:50.489> plow<00:00:50.760> because

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
discuss levees and the plow because

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.000 
discuss levees and the plow because
these<00:00:51.629> are<00:00:51.750> some<00:00:51.930> developments<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.800> come

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
these are some developments that come

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.340 
these are some developments that come
out<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.329> ancient<00:00:54.329> Sumer<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.750> are<00:00:54.870> very

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
out of ancient Sumer that are very

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.220 
out of ancient Sumer that are very
important<00:00:56.300> all<00:00:57.300> right<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.629> let's<00:00:57.870> take<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.050> look

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
important all right so let's take a look

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.840 
important all right so let's take a look
at<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.559> irrigation<00:00:59.010> system<00:00:59.609> what<00:00:59.730> we<00:00:59.820> have

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
at this irrigation system what we have

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.760 
at this irrigation system what we have
right<00:01:00.180> here<00:01:00.210> is<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.780> trench<00:01:01.230> I've<00:01:01.559> been

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
right here is that trench I've been

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.950 
right here is that trench I've been
talking<00:01:02.100> about<00:01:02.160> so<00:01:02.879> over<00:01:03.120> here<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.570> the

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
talking about so over here in the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.850 
talking about so over here in the
distance<00:01:04.110> we<00:01:04.530> see<00:01:04.799> a<00:01:05.010> river<00:01:06.170> and<00:01:07.170> they're

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
distance we see a river and they're

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.480 
distance we see a river and they're
gonna<00:01:08.010> use<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.790> river<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.810> actually<00:01:10.490> supply

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
gonna use this river to actually supply

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.700 
gonna use this river to actually supply
crops<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> surrounding<00:01:12.869> area<00:01:13.110> so<00:01:13.320> what

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
crops in the surrounding area so what

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.920 
crops in the surrounding area so what
they<00:01:13.860> have<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.340> river<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.000> they<00:01:15.600> dig

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
they have is this river and they dig

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.160 
they have is this river and they dig
this<00:01:16.110> trench<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:18.240> water<00:01:18.509> comes<00:01:18.900> from<00:01:19.080> the

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
this trench and the water comes from the

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.370 
this trench and the water comes from the
river<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.650> goes<00:01:19.799> down<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.159> trench<00:01:20.930> so<00:01:24.380> how

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
river and goes down this trench so how

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.469 
river and goes down this trench so how
did<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.340> development<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.939> agricultural

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
did the development of agricultural

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.060 
did the development of agricultural
techniques<00:01:27.900> lead<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> emergence<00:01:28.770> of

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
techniques lead to the emergence of

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.640 
techniques lead to the emergence of
Sumerian<00:01:29.759> city-states<00:01:30.030> well<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.380> an

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
Sumerian city-states well this is an

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.270 
Sumerian city-states well this is an
irrigation<00:01:32.280> system<00:01:32.310> works<00:01:32.970> great<00:01:33.860> unless<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
irrigation system works great unless the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.469 
irrigation system works great unless the
person<00:01:35.570> upstream<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:37.939> not<00:01:38.939> taking<00:01:39.270> care<00:01:39.450> of

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
person upstream is not taking care of

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.350 
person upstream is not taking care of
their<00:01:40.009> business<00:01:41.009> all<00:01:41.729> right<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.000> let's<00:01:42.180> say

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
their business all right so let's say

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:51.140 
their business all right so let's say
this<00:01:43.049> person<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:45.649> right<00:01:46.649> here

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.640 

and<00:01:52.910> they're<00:01:53.910> not<00:01:54.210> taking<00:01:55.170> care<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.410> their

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
and they're not taking care of their

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.340 
and they're not taking care of their
stuff<00:01:56.120> all<00:01:57.120> right<00:01:57.300> so<00:01:57.540> what's<00:01:57.750> happening<00:01:58.200> is

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
stuff all right so what's happening is

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.700 
stuff all right so what's happening is
there's<00:01:59.190> a<00:01:59.280> little<00:01:59.490> bit<00:01:59.730> of<00:01:59.990> silt<00:02:00.990> buildup<00:02:01.500> in

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
there's a little bit of silt buildup in

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.530 
there's a little bit of silt buildup in
the<00:02:01.860> stream<00:02:02.220> right<00:02:02.340> here<00:02:02.400> what<00:02:03.060> happens<00:02:03.390> is

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
the stream right here what happens is

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.050 
the stream right here what happens is
that<00:02:05.240> stops<00:02:06.800> the<00:02:07.800> irrigation<00:02:08.190> system<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:08.820> the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
that stops the irrigation system so the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.000 
that stops the irrigation system so the
person<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.450> lives<00:02:09.660> down<00:02:09.810> here<00:02:09.840> all<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.890> a

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
person that lives down here all of a

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.060 
person that lives down here all of a
sudden<00:02:11.340> they're<00:02:11.550> not<00:02:11.730> getting<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:13.770> water

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
sudden they're not getting the water

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:24.200 
sudden they're not getting the water
that<00:02:14.310> they<00:02:14.550> need<00:02:19.940> for<00:02:20.940> their<00:02:22.430> stream<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:23.820> they

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
that they need for their stream so they

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.980 
that they need for their stream so they
are<00:02:24.420> steamed<00:02:25.670> they<00:02:26.670> are<00:02:26.820> not<00:02:27.090> getting<00:02:27.840> what

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
are steamed they are not getting what

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.840 
are steamed they are not getting what
they<00:02:28.020> need<00:02:28.290> from<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:28.740> irrigation<00:02:29.550> system

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
they need from this irrigation system

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.540 
they need from this irrigation system
because<00:02:30.120> this<00:02:30.330> person<00:02:30.750> dropped<00:02:31.020> fall<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.550> has

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
because this person dropped fall and has

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.670 
because this person dropped fall and has
clogged<00:02:32.850> up<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.120> irrigation<00:02:34.050> system

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
clogged up the irrigation system

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.250 
clogged up the irrigation system
all<00:02:35.520> right<00:02:35.670> so<00:02:35.850> how<00:02:36.450> does<00:02:36.600> this<00:02:36.750> lead<00:02:37.050> to<00:02:37.080> the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
all right so how does this lead to the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.200 
all right so how does this lead to the
emergence<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.740> city<00:02:38.070> states<00:02:38.280> well<00:02:38.550> city

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
emergence of city states well city

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.580 
emergence of city states well city
states<00:02:39.540> were<00:02:40.050> created<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.980> govern<00:02:41.730> these

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
states were created to govern these

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.540 
states were created to govern these
canals<00:02:43.590> these<00:02:44.010> trenches<00:02:44.550> so<00:02:45.450> if<00:02:45.750> this<00:02:46.020> person

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
canals these trenches so if this person

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.940 
canals these trenches so if this person
failed<00:02:47.550> to<00:02:47.820> keep<00:02:48.000> theirs<00:02:48.330> clean<00:02:48.780> there<00:02:49.590> would

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
failed to keep theirs clean there would

00:02:49.950 --> 00:03:00.480 
failed to keep theirs clean there would
be<00:02:51.320> government<00:02:52.320> official

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.220 

that<00:03:00.790> would<00:03:01.120> be<00:03:01.270> coming<00:03:01.540> to<00:03:01.690> talk<00:03:01.960> to<00:03:02.110> this

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
that would be coming to talk to this

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.350 
that would be coming to talk to this
person<00:03:02.440> and<00:03:03.400> they<00:03:04.300> would<00:03:05.140> be<00:03:06.270> signing<00:03:07.270> a

stays clean and working that's
essentially<00:04:01.120> it<00:04:01.150> that's<00:04:01.480> what<00:04:01.870> leads<00:04:02.140> to<00:04:02.290> the

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
essentially it that's what leads to the

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
this trench stays clean and continues to

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.300 
this trench stays clean and continues to
work<00:04:09.690> it<00:04:10.690> takes<00:04:10.930> a<00:04:11.050> lot<00:04:11.200> of<00:04:11.290> work<00:04:11.470> so<00:04:11.890> you<00:04:11.980> don't

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
work it takes a lot of work so you don't

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.680 
work it takes a lot of work so you don't
have<00:04:12.550> people<00:04:12.820> that<00:04:12.970> are<00:04:13.180> just<00:04:13.330> living<00:04:13.570> by

this<00:04:17.710> work<00:04:17.980> in<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.820> oolitic<00:04:19.239> settlements<00:04:19.690> we

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
this work in the oolitic settlements we

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.060 
this work in the oolitic settlements we
saw<00:04:20.020> pretty<00:04:20.440> small<00:04:21.480> farming<00:04:22.480> communities

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
saw pretty small farming communities

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.160 
saw pretty small farming communities
look<00:04:24.070> like<00:04:24.310> ten<00:04:24.700> to<00:04:24.790> fifteen<00:04:25.150> people<00:04:25.420> working

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
look like ten to fifteen people working

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.010 
look like ten to fifteen people working
on<00:04:26.260> a<00:04:26.290> farm<00:04:26.590> well<00:04:27.190> this<00:04:27.520> requires<00:04:28.300> a<00:04:28.690> lot<00:04:28.990> more

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
on a farm well this requires a lot more

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.710 
on a farm well this requires a lot more
work<00:04:29.290> the<00:04:29.800> irrigation<00:04:30.280> system<00:04:30.640> the<00:04:31.240> trenches

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720 
work the irrigation system the trenches

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.750 
work the irrigation system the trenches
take<00:04:31.990> a<00:04:32.020> lot<00:04:32.290> of<00:04:32.320> work<00:04:32.500> to<00:04:32.680> dig<00:04:32.890> and<00:04:33.130> when<00:04:33.670> we

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
take a lot of work to dig and when we

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.390 
take a lot of work to dig and when we
come<00:04:33.910> down<00:04:33.940> here<00:04:34.300> and<00:04:34.390> look<00:04:34.540> at<00:04:34.750> levees<00:04:35.710> these

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
come down here and look at levees these

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.670 
come down here and look at levees these
take<00:04:36.880> a<00:04:36.910> lot<00:04:37.480> of<00:04:37.750> work<00:04:37.900> because<00:04:38.080> you've<00:04:38.290> got<00:04:38.500> to

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
take a lot of work because you've got to

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.790 
take a lot of work because you've got to
build<00:04:38.920> up<00:04:39.130> all<00:04:39.460> this<00:04:39.910> dirt<00:04:40.360> and<00:04:40.630> build<00:04:41.230> a<00:04:41.380> wall

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
build up all this dirt and build a wall

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.640 
build up all this dirt and build a wall
so<00:04:42.430> here<00:04:42.640> we<00:04:42.760> have<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:43.000> Euphrates<00:04:43.630> they<00:04:44.350> build

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
so here we have the Euphrates they build

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.010 
so here we have the Euphrates they build
a<00:04:44.830> town<00:04:45.100> up<00:04:45.370> on<00:04:45.550> top<00:04:45.850> of<00:04:45.880> it<00:04:46.180> that's<00:04:46.420> the<00:04:46.630> city

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
a town up on top of it that's the city

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.370 
a town up on top of it that's the city
state<00:04:47.350> and<00:04:48.060> then<00:04:49.060> this<00:04:49.270> is<00:04:49.480> the<00:04:49.780> levee<00:04:50.050> and

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
state and then this is the levee and

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.010 
state and then this is the levee and
then<00:04:51.370> you're<00:04:51.910> going<00:04:52.030> to<00:04:52.090> have<00:04:52.210> the<00:04:52.420> fertile

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
then you're going to have the fertile

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.740 
then you're going to have the fertile
soil<00:04:53.170> from<00:04:53.980> the<00:04:54.250> river<00:04:54.910> the<00:04:55.150> sediment<00:04:55.630> the

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
soil from the river the sediment the

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:59.640 
soil from the river the sediment the
silt<00:04:57.090> that's<00:04:58.090> basically<00:04:58.570> what<00:04:58.780> a<00:04:58.810> levee<00:04:59.410> looks

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
silt that's basically what a levee looks

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.150 
silt that's basically what a levee looks
like<00:04:59.860> they<00:05:00.130> have<00:05:00.610> this<00:05:00.850> wall<00:05:01.150> that<00:05:01.480> protects

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
like they have this wall that protects

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.030 
like they have this wall that protects
them<00:05:03.160> from<00:05:03.460> the<00:05:03.610> floods<00:05:03.910> of<00:05:04.210> the<00:05:04.630> river<00:05:05.040> and

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
them from the floods of the river and

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.260 
them from the floods of the river and
that<00:05:06.190> takes<00:05:06.370> a<00:05:06.430> lot<00:05:06.550> of<00:05:06.670> work<00:05:06.790> and<00:05:06.970> anything

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
that takes a lot of work and anything

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
that takes a lot of work is going to

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.270 
that takes a lot of work is going to
require<00:05:08.800> cooperation<00:05:09.610> teamwork

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280

another innovation or development in
farming<00:05:17.409> that<00:05:17.500> I<00:05:17.560> wanted<00:05:17.830> to<00:05:17.919> discuss<00:05:18.340> was<00:05:18.669> the

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:18.879 
farming that I wanted to discuss was the

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:24.240 
farming that I wanted to discuss was the
plow<00:05:19.180> plow<00:05:19.659> was<00:05:19.960> this<00:05:22.139> now<00:05:23.139> initially<00:05:24.039> they

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
plow plow was this now initially they

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.850 
plow plow was this now initially they
had<00:05:24.300> just<00:05:25.300> a<00:05:25.449> person<00:05:26.169> dragging<00:05:26.560> the<00:05:26.680> plow

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
had just a person dragging the plow

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.939 
had just a person dragging the plow
across<00:05:27.220> the<00:05:27.400> field<00:05:27.669> and<00:05:28.470> that's<00:05:29.470> a<00:05:29.770> lot<00:05:29.919> of

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:29.949 
across the field and that's a lot of

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:31.369 
across the field and that's a lot of
work<00:05:30.220> so<00:05:30.490> what<00:05:30.699> they<00:05:30.789> did<00:05:30.849> is<00:05:31.060> they

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:31.379 
work so what they did is they

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:33.869 
work so what they did is they
domesticated<00:05:32.379> some<00:05:32.560> cows<00:05:32.800> and<00:05:33.250> they<00:05:33.610> had<00:05:33.729> the

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:33.879 
domesticated some cows and they had the

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:35.480 
domesticated some cows and they had the
cows<00:05:34.060> pull<00:05:34.449> the<00:05:34.599> plow

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
cows pull the plow

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.369 
cows pull the plow
much<00:05:36.490> easier<00:05:36.520> now<00:05:37.360> why<00:05:37.690> would<00:05:37.930> they<00:05:38.080> plow<00:05:38.349> a

00:05:38.369 --> 00:05:38.379 
much easier now why would they plow a

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:40.589 
much easier now why would they plow a
field<00:05:38.740> well<00:05:39.099> this<00:05:39.849> has<00:05:40.030> already<00:05:40.150> been<00:05:40.330> plowed

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:40.599 
field well this has already been plowed

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:42.540 
field well this has already been plowed
the<00:05:41.139> reason<00:05:41.530> you<00:05:41.620> plow<00:05:41.800> a<00:05:41.830> field<00:05:42.129> is<00:05:42.340> because

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
the reason you plow a field is because

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.850 
the reason you plow a field is because
that<00:05:42.699> turns<00:05:43.000> the<00:05:43.300> soil<00:05:43.569> I<00:05:43.930> would<00:05:44.650> kind<00:05:44.800> of

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
that turns the soil I would kind of

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:52.980 
that turns the soil I would kind of
describe<00:05:45.039> it<00:05:45.460> as<00:05:48.930> kool-aid<00:05:51.330> you<00:05:52.330> don't<00:05:52.509> stir

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:52.990 
describe it as kool-aid you don't stir

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:56.219 
describe it as kool-aid you don't stir
up<00:05:53.169> the<00:05:53.379> kool-aid<00:05:53.800> all<00:05:54.099> the<00:05:54.430> the<00:05:55.419> flavoring<00:05:56.050> is

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
up the kool-aid all the the flavoring is

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:59.010 
up the kool-aid all the the flavoring is
at<00:05:56.379> the<00:05:56.530> bottom<00:05:56.919> so<00:05:57.129> all<00:05:58.120> the<00:05:58.270> flavoring<00:05:58.870> and

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
at the bottom so all the flavoring and

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:00.570 
at the bottom so all the flavoring and
the<00:05:59.110> dirt<00:05:59.319> was<00:05:59.560> at<00:05:59.710> the<00:05:59.830> bottom<00:06:00.190> they<00:06:00.310> needed

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
the dirt was at the bottom they needed

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.670 
the dirt was at the bottom they needed
to<00:06:00.669> turn<00:06:00.940> the<00:06:01.150> soil<00:06:01.449> so<00:06:02.229> that<00:06:02.379> they<00:06:02.500> could

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
to turn the soil so that they could

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.649 
to turn the soil so that they could
bring<00:06:02.889> some<00:06:03.219> of<00:06:03.250> the<00:06:03.460> nutrients<00:06:04.240> up<00:06:04.419> to<00:06:04.539> the

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:04.659 
bring some of the nutrients up to the

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:07.230 
bring some of the nutrients up to the
top<00:06:04.870> so<00:06:05.800> the<00:06:05.919> plants<00:06:06.250> that<00:06:06.639> they<00:06:06.819> planted

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
top so the plants that they planted

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.219 
top so the plants that they planted
could<00:06:07.509> have<00:06:07.659> the<00:06:07.810> nutrients<00:06:09.659> so<00:06:10.659> going<00:06:11.110> with

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
could have the nutrients so going with

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:13.589 
could have the nutrients so going with
our<00:06:11.379> kool-aid<00:06:11.830> reference<00:06:12.340> this<00:06:12.940> is<00:06:13.000> stirring

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 
our kool-aid reference this is stirring

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:16.200 
our kool-aid reference this is stirring
the<00:06:13.870> kool-aid<00:06:14.229> and<00:06:14.530> this<00:06:15.400> is<00:06:15.550> adding<00:06:16.090> the

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
the kool-aid and this is adding the

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.110 
the kool-aid and this is adding the
water<00:06:16.830> so<00:06:17.830> by<00:06:18.069> the<00:06:18.159> time<00:06:18.400> they<00:06:18.699> put<00:06:18.969> this

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:19.120 
water so by the time they put this

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.629 
water so by the time they put this
together<00:06:19.300> they've<00:06:19.719> got<00:06:20.130> it's<00:06:21.130> a<00:06:21.190> pretty<00:06:21.400> good

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 
together they've got it's a pretty good

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:26.959 
together they've got it's a pretty good
kool-aid<00:06:22.330> I<00:06:23.759> hope<00:06:24.759> this<00:06:24.969> has<00:06:25.180> been<00:06:25.210> a<00:06:25.659> defying
