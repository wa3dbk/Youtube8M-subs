00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
the rest of this hand and then some on

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.219 
the rest of this hand and then some on
my<00:00:55.970> last<00:00:56.300> dominant<00:00:56.750> hand<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.949> let's<00:00:58.159> go<00:00:59.229> okay

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:00.229 
my last dominant hand so let's go okay

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.280 
my last dominant hand so let's go okay
so<00:01:00.290> I'm<00:01:00.440> using<00:01:00.650> my<00:01:01.010> bare<00:01:01.460> en<00:01:01.699> pink<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.809> this<00:01:02.960> is

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
so I'm using my bare en pink and this is

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.240 
so I'm using my bare en pink and this is
what<00:01:03.440> I<00:01:03.470> do<00:01:04.479> first<00:01:05.479> of<00:01:05.750> all<00:01:05.870> I<00:01:06.229> put<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:06.920> hand<00:01:07.130> a

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
what I do first of all I put the hand a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.770 
what I do first of all I put the hand a
little<00:01:07.310> bit<00:01:07.520> sideways<00:01:07.820> so<00:01:08.390> I<00:01:08.420> can<00:01:08.600> probably

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
little bit sideways so I can probably

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.620 
little bit sideways so I can probably
get<00:01:09.050> in<00:01:09.170> there<00:01:09.409> and<00:01:09.650> rotate<00:01:10.400> my<00:01:10.729> hand<00:01:11.060> into<00:01:11.450> the

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
get in there and rotate my hand into the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.950 
get in there and rotate my hand into the
brush<00:01:12.310> and<00:01:13.310> first<00:01:13.580> of<00:01:13.760> all<00:01:13.850> I<00:01:13.880> start<00:01:14.270> at<00:01:14.630> this

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
brush and first of all I start at this

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.780 
brush and first of all I start at this
end<00:01:15.670> and<00:01:17.229> I<00:01:18.229> kind<00:01:18.620> of<00:01:18.680> draw<00:01:18.890> a<00:01:18.920> line<00:01:19.340> around<00:01:20.270> the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
end and I kind of draw a line around the

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.429 
end and I kind of draw a line around the
base<00:01:22.790> of<00:01:23.120> my<00:01:23.810> finger<00:01:24.290> like<00:01:24.320> this<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:26.350> then<00:01:27.350> I

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
base of my finger like this and then I

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.170 
base of my finger like this and then I
go<00:01:27.469> back<00:01:27.860> the<00:01:28.070> other<00:01:28.100> way<00:01:28.250> just<00:01:28.369> from<00:01:28.969> this

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
go back the other way just from this

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:36.130 
go back the other way just from this
side<00:01:30.579> like<00:01:31.579> that<00:01:34.210> and<00:01:35.210> then<00:01:35.360> from<00:01:35.509> there<00:01:35.780> I

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
side like that and then from there I

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:48.969 
side like that and then from there I
just<00:01:36.409> do<00:01:36.979> a<00:01:37.659> few<00:01:38.659> strokes

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:48.979 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.069 

and<00:01:49.979> there<00:01:50.490> you<00:01:50.610> have<00:01:50.640> your<00:01:50.850> fully<00:01:51.840> painted

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
and there you have your fully painted

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.960 
and there you have your fully painted
nail<00:01:52.470> without<00:01:52.680> any<00:01:53.420> gaps<00:01:55.460> and<00:01:56.460> you<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:56.790> want

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970

know the thumb this is exactly the same
the<00:03:30.290> roll<00:03:31.290> across<00:03:32.239> go<00:03:33.239> down<00:03:33.769> just<00:03:34.769> fill<00:03:35.099> in<00:03:35.250> the

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
the roll across go down just fill in the

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:45.680 
the roll across go down just fill in the
empty<00:03:35.519> spaces

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.369 

and<00:03:46.690> there<00:03:47.170> you<00:03:47.290> have<00:03:47.819> your<00:03:48.819> fingers<00:03:49.659> nicely

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
and there you have your fingers nicely

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.850 
and there you have your fingers nicely
painted<00:03:50.590> and<00:03:51.250> looking<00:03:51.849> professional<00:03:52.739> and<00:03:53.739> I'm

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
painted and looking professional and I'm

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.080 
painted and looking professional and I'm
going<00:03:53.980> to<00:03:54.040> show<00:03:54.129> you<00:03:54.220> how<00:03:54.340> I<00:03:54.370> do<00:03:54.519> my<00:03:54.640> less

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
going to show you how I do my less

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:56.490 
going to show you how I do my less
dominant<00:03:55.480> hand<00:03:55.659> which<00:03:55.870> can<00:03:55.900> be<00:03:56.230> kind<00:03:56.440> of

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
dominant hand which can be kind of

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.440 
dominant hand which can be kind of
tricky<00:03:56.940> if<00:03:57.940> you're<00:03:58.090> not<00:03:58.209> used<00:03:58.390> to<00:03:58.540> it<00:03:58.690> and

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
tricky if you're not used to it and

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.250 
tricky if you're not used to it and
you've<00:04:01.450> not<00:04:01.569> done<00:04:01.750> it<00:04:01.870> much<00:04:03.060> so<00:04:04.060> what<00:04:04.840> I<00:04:04.900> do<00:04:04.989> is

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
you've not done it much so what I do is

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.650 
you've not done it much so what I do is
it's<00:04:05.410> after<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.739> same<00:04:06.629> technique<00:04:08.910> so<00:04:09.910> I<00:04:10.269> just

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
it's after the same technique so I just

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.530 
it's after the same technique so I just
roll<00:04:10.900> from<00:04:11.319> the<00:04:11.500> other<00:04:11.650> side<00:04:15.150> and<00:04:16.150> it's<00:04:16.299> much

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
roll from the other side and it's much

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.569 
roll from the other side and it's much
easier<00:04:16.660> if<00:04:17.019> you<00:04:17.139> move<00:04:17.380> your<00:04:17.590> finger<00:04:18.160> rather

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
easier if you move your finger rather

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.080 
easier if you move your finger rather
than<00:04:18.820> the<00:04:18.940> brush<00:04:20.310> like<00:04:21.310> sometimes<00:04:21.789> I<00:04:21.940> find

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
than the brush like sometimes I find

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.909 
than the brush like sometimes I find
myself<00:04:22.300> doing<00:04:22.600> when<00:04:22.780> I'm<00:04:22.900> filing<00:04:23.260> this<00:04:23.650> hand

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
myself doing when I'm filing this hand

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.480 
myself doing when I'm filing this hand
snails<00:04:25.620> just<00:04:26.620> take<00:04:26.830> your<00:04:26.949> time<00:04:27.130> with<00:04:27.370> it

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
snails just take your time with it

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.640 
snails just take your time with it
because<00:04:27.760> you<00:04:28.000> don't<00:04:28.150> want<00:04:28.360> to<00:04:28.470> go<00:04:29.470> all<00:04:29.620> over

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
because you don't want to go all over

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.050

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
your finger so just have to be slow and

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:40.740 
your finger so just have to be slow and
patient<00:04:38.699> the<00:04:39.699> more<00:04:39.850> you<00:04:39.970> practice<00:04:40.449> the<00:04:40.720> easier

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
patient the more you practice the easier

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.490 
patient the more you practice the easier

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
it'll be
