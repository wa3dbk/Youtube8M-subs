Thanks for joining us here on World Tech Update.
I’m Nick Barber. Coming up on this week’s

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.099
show we’ll take a look at a concept tablet
from Google, hear from Bill Gates from Davos

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:25.180
and take a look take a look at a robot underdevelopment
by NASA and General Motors. Since the launch

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.359
of Apple's iPad last week, reviews have been
mixed on it usefulness as a web browser. One

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.640
of the biggest complaints is the device's
lack of Adobe Flash support; used on major

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.710
websites like YouTube, Hulu, and Facebook.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.150
However, more fuel was added to the fire last
Friday when Apple blog AppleInsider.com noticed

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.430
that promotional images and even a video posted
on Apple's Web site which you’re seeing

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.239
here appeared to show Flash-based content
being displayed on the iPad.

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.260
By Saturday, the materials had been pulled
from Apple's website. The image posted on

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.629
the company's home page has been removed,
and the video on Apple's Web site now shows

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.489
a broken Flash box in place of what had previously
been live Flash content.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.110
While Apple has not explicitly said the iPad
won't support Flash, representatives did not

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.649
respond to requests for comment.

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.700
Trying to steal some of Apple’s thunder,
Google showed off a mock up of a tablet running

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.060
Google Chrome OS. While it’s obviously a
very early concept video we can see that the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.800
tablet could multitouch which is also available
on the iPad. But one upping Apple, the Google

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.990
concept could support multitasking, something
the iPad cannot. There’s no word on when

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.929
or if Google’s concept will come to market.
In more Google news this week, the company

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.570
has started pushing out an update for the
Nexus One that will fix a 3G connectivity

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.110
problem that has plagued some users and adds
limited support for multitouch.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.649
Bill Gates co-chair of the Bill &amp; Melinda
Gates Foundation was at the World Economic

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.970
Forum in Davos Switzerland late last week
where he announced more money for vaccinations.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.550
Over this last decade we have spent over $4
and a half million on vaccine research and

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:12.090
delivery and today, we are announcing a commitment,
over this next decade, which we think of as

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:19.620
a decade of vaccines having incredible impact,
we’re announcing that we will spend over

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.689
$10 billion on vaccines. That will help invent
new vaccines; that will help get some new

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:31.489
vaccines out; that will help increase coverage.

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.469
World Economic Forum is an annual gathering
of the world’s who’s who in politics and

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:40.349
business focusing on issues like global development
and Gates has been in attendance for the past

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:43.079
few years.

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.670
NASA and General Motors are working on the
next generation of robot designed to help

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.920
both the automotive and aerospace industries.
Called Robonaut2 or R2, the next generation

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.129
bot is faster, more dexterous and technologically
more advanced than its predecessor. It works

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:03.189
under supervised autonomy, so it will be able
to perform tasks with little human intervention.

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:08.450
From General Motors' perspective, we want
to be able to automate tasks that are very

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:15.000
repetitious, dull, or ergonomically challenging
for our operators. And those requirements

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.090
are very similar to some of the tasks that
NASA would like to be able to automate to

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.159
help an astronaut.

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:26.439
The robot has force sensors so it should be
able to cope well with working in a zero gravity

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:30.249
environment. There’s no word on when it
will be complete and it’s cost is being

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:33.120
kept secret.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.879
In a report release this week a team of psychologists
at the University of Leeds in the UK said

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.549
they found that people who spend a significant
time online are far more likely to suffer

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.779
symptoms of depression. When people begin
to substitute real-life, face-to-face interaction

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:52.079
with online conversations in chat rooms and
on social networking sites like Facebook and

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:57.019
Twitter , there's often a serious impact on
mental health, the study found. A similar

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.810
study conducted by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention last year came to a

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.209
similar conclusion. What neither study has
yet to determine is which comes first…are

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.889
depressed people drawn to the internet or
do they become depressed because of it.

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:17.040
A data center in a box, that’s the idea
behind the HP POD or performance optimized

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.050
datacenter. The company released a new, smaller
version of its POD based on a standard 20

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.800
foot shipping container. It can house 10 racks
of gear and while it may look like a gimmick,

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.320
some analysts say that they are useful for
some situations, such as allowing companies

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.360
to add additional storage much more quickly
and at a lower cost than building a new data

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.880
center. The PODs are very energy efficient
and can be delivered to customers in the US

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.380
in six weeks and worldwide within 12 weeks.
The empty POD costs 600,000 US dollars, but

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.380
when filled with IT equipment it could top
several million.

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.690
