00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
in this video we're going to make Chuck

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.959 
in this video we're going to make Chuck
one<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.379> Angry<00:00:07.680> Birds<00:00:07.889> now<00:00:08.519> I'm<00:00:08.730> going<00:00:08.910> to

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:08.969 
one of the Angry Birds now I'm going to

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:10.879 
one of the Angry Birds now I'm going to
use<00:00:09.000> some<00:00:09.690> flour<00:00:09.959> and<00:00:10.110> modeling<00:00:10.440> paste<00:00:10.620> I've

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
use some flour and modeling paste I've

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.230 
use some flour and modeling paste I've
just<00:00:11.010> got<00:00:11.129> the<00:00:11.190> Renshaw's<00:00:11.519> one<00:00:11.789> here<00:00:12.000> because

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
just got the Renshaw's one here because

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.840 
just got the Renshaw's one here because
it's<00:00:12.389> ready<00:00:12.629> died<00:00:13.189> I'm<00:00:14.189> just<00:00:14.400> going<00:00:14.520> to<00:00:14.580> start

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:14.850 
it's ready died I'm just going to start

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.630 
it's ready died I'm just going to start
by<00:00:14.939> rolling<00:00:15.270> it<00:00:15.510> into<00:00:15.869> a<00:00:15.930> bit<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.109> a<00:00:16.139> ball<00:00:16.640> and

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
by rolling it into a bit of a ball and

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.980 
by rolling it into a bit of a ball and
then<00:00:17.820> we<00:00:17.970> want<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.240> create<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.600> bit<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:18.869> a

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
then we want to create a bit of a

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.579 
then we want to create a bit of a
triangle<00:00:19.500> shape<00:00:19.740> for<00:00:20.010> him<00:00:20.390> so<00:00:21.390> I'm<00:00:22.380> going<00:00:22.529> to

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:22.589 
triangle shape for him so I'm going to

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:24.399 
triangle shape for him so I'm going to
try<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.890> keep<00:00:22.980> it<00:00:23.130> like<00:00:23.249> a<00:00:23.279> sort<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.550> a<00:00:23.640> 3d

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:24.409 
try and keep it like a sort of a 3d

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:27.319 
try and keep it like a sort of a 3d
pyramid<00:00:25.409> shape<00:00:25.710> for<00:00:26.009> this<00:00:26.130> one<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:27.210> we're

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:27.329 
pyramid shape for this one so we're

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:29.569 
pyramid shape for this one so we're
going<00:00:27.419> to<00:00:27.539> squash<00:00:27.839> three<00:00:28.349> sides<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:29.369> might

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:29.579 
going to squash three sides you might

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.440 
going to squash three sides you might
find<00:00:29.759> it<00:00:29.909> easier<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.499> pick<00:00:31.499> it<00:00:31.710> up<00:00:32.270> rub<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.390> on

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
find it easier to pick it up rub it on

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.700 
find it easier to pick it up rub it on
the<00:00:33.510> table<00:00:34.070> on<00:00:35.070> each<00:00:35.100> side<00:00:36.320> so<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.380> get<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
the table on each side so you get the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.650 
the table on each side so you get the
shape<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.340> want<00:00:38.370> now<00:00:39.240> it<00:00:39.360> doesn't<00:00:39.510> need

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
shape that you want now it doesn't need

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.330 
shape that you want now it doesn't need
to<00:00:39.810> have<00:00:39.900> really<00:00:40.170> straight<00:00:40.410> edges<00:00:40.770> he's<00:00:41.010> quite

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
to have really straight edges he's quite

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.580 
to have really straight edges he's quite
rounded<00:00:42.060> on<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> corners<00:00:45.380> we're<00:00:46.380> going<00:00:46.530> to

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
rounded on the corners we're going to

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.190 
rounded on the corners we're going to
use<00:00:46.740> one<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.040> the<00:00:47.100> flat<00:00:47.370> sides<00:00:47.930> but<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.020> front

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
use one of the flat sides but the front

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.310 
use one of the flat sides but the front
of<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.440> just<00:00:49.970> gonna<00:00:50.970> roll<00:00:51.240> a<00:00:51.570> tiny<00:00:52.020> bit<00:00:52.230> of

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.820 
a frisbee I'm just gonna take a slightly
deeper<00:02:12.790> yellow<00:02:13.180> so<00:02:13.690> I've<00:02:13.780> mixed<00:02:13.959> a<00:02:14.170> tiny<00:02:14.500> tiny

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
deeper yellow so I've mixed a tiny tiny

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.980 
deeper yellow so I've mixed a tiny tiny
bit<00:02:14.980> of<00:02:15.100> red<00:02:15.190> in<00:02:15.459> with<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.730> yellow<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.510> already

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
bit of red in with the yellow I already

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.930 
bit of red in with the yellow I already
had<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.950> just<00:02:18.190> try<00:02:18.400> and<00:02:18.430> make<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.670> slightly

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
had to just try and make a slightly

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.400 
had to just try and make a slightly
different<00:02:19.330> color<00:02:19.540> from<00:02:19.840> his<00:02:20.050> body

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
different color from his body

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.280 
different color from his body
now<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.220> beak<00:02:21.459> is<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.790> bit<00:02:21.910> that<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.030> find<00:02:22.480> the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
now the beak is the bit that I find the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.930 
now the beak is the bit that I find the
hardest<00:02:23.650> on<00:02:23.920> these<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:24.520> we're<00:02:24.670> going<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:24.820> make

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
hardest on these so we're going to make

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.820 
hardest on these so we're going to make
the<00:02:25.150> top<00:02:25.360> that's<00:02:25.570> a<00:02:25.690> big<00:02:25.870> bit<00:02:26.140> bigger<00:02:26.470> than<00:02:26.740> the

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
the top that's a big bit bigger than the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.800 
the top that's a big bit bigger than the
bottom<00:02:26.950> so<00:02:27.760> I'm<00:02:27.820> just<00:02:28.030> gonna<00:02:28.120> pull<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.630> small

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
bottom so I'm just gonna pull a small

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.570 
bottom so I'm just gonna pull a small
amount<00:02:29.200> off<00:02:29.470> and<00:02:29.830> we're<00:02:29.980> gonna<00:02:30.070> try<00:02:30.459> and

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
amount off and we're gonna try and

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:41.020 
amount off and we're gonna try and
create<00:02:30.840> bit<00:02:31.840> of<00:02:32.020> a<00:02:32.140> triangle<00:02:33.660> shape

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.039 

just<00:02:42.030> see<00:02:42.209> what<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.390> looks<00:02:42.540> like<00:02:42.720> size-wise

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
just see what it looks like size-wise

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:49.009 
just see what it looks like size-wise
against<00:02:43.709> his<00:02:43.860> face<00:02:45.920> it's<00:02:46.920> not<00:02:47.099> too<00:02:47.430> bad<00:02:48.019> I'm

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
against his face it's not too bad I'm

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.960 
against his face it's not too bad I'm
just<00:02:49.080> gonna<00:02:49.290> widen<00:02:49.560> it<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.860> little<00:02:50.220> bit<00:02:50.340> but

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
just gonna widen it a little bit but

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.960 
just gonna widen it a little bit but
this<00:02:51.090> far<00:02:51.480> end<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:56.430> I'm<00:02:56.519> putting<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.790> slight

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
this far end and I'm putting a slight

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.430 
this far end and I'm putting a slight
indentation<00:02:58.040> just<00:02:59.269> either<00:03:00.269> side<00:03:00.690> of<00:03:01.220> his<00:03:02.220> beak

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
indentation just either side of his beak

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.170 
indentation just either side of his beak
you<00:03:04.440> want<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.769> stick<00:03:05.069> that<00:03:05.280> in<00:03:05.340> place<00:03:05.760> with<00:03:06.030> a

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
you want to stick that in place with a

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.210 
you want to stick that in place with a
little<00:03:06.360> bit<00:03:06.599> water

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.380 

think<00:03:13.670> so

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
think so

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.280 
think so
hopefully<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.410> will<00:03:16.500> stay<00:03:16.710> on<00:03:16.740> a<00:03:18.110> little<00:03:19.110> bit

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
hopefully that will stay on a little bit

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.020 
hopefully that will stay on a little bit
water<00:03:19.470> just<00:03:19.830> below<00:03:20.040> his<00:03:20.310> beak<00:03:20.520> now<00:03:20.820> we're

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
water just below his beak now we're

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.200 
water just below his beak now we're
we're<00:03:21.180> gonna<00:03:21.270> stick<00:03:21.710> the<00:03:22.710> bottom<00:03:23.130> half<00:03:23.400> he's

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
we're gonna stick the bottom half he's

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.390 
we're gonna stick the bottom half he's
become<00:03:25.790> I'm<00:03:26.790> gonna<00:03:26.970> make<00:03:27.120> that<00:03:27.270> smaller<00:03:28.400> than

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
become I'm gonna make that smaller than

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.700 
become I'm gonna make that smaller than
the<00:03:29.520> top<00:03:29.730> it<00:03:30.000> again<00:03:30.990> I'm<00:03:31.170> gonna<00:03:31.350> try<00:03:31.590> and

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
the top it again I'm gonna try and

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:38.360 
the top it again I'm gonna try and

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:45.540 
create a little triangle shape and then
we're<00:03:38.520> gonna<00:03:38.610> push<00:03:38.880> that<00:03:39.470> underneath<00:03:43.190> so

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
we're gonna push that underneath so

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.790 
we're gonna push that underneath so
I'm<00:03:45.970> just<00:03:46.180> gonna<00:03:46.330> curve<00:03:46.630> the<00:03:46.900> beak<00:03:47.110> and<00:03:47.530> this

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
I'm just gonna curve the beak and this

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.620 
I'm just gonna curve the beak and this
is<00:03:47.950> slightly<00:03:49.800> no<00:03:50.800> I<00:03:50.830> did<00:03:51.160> a<00:03:51.190> bit<00:03:51.400> more<00:03:51.430> red<00:03:52.030> the

as well we're just gonna roll it out I'm
just<00:03:59.320> gonna<00:03:59.770> cut<00:04:00.040> two<00:04:00.250> eyebrows<00:04:00.670> out<00:04:00.850> so<00:04:01.030> we

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
just gonna cut two eyebrows out so we

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
that and we want a couple of pieces for

that and we want a couple of pieces for
his<00:04:10.420> eyebrows<00:04:10.870> I<00:04:11.470> think<00:04:11.770> about<00:04:12.040> that<00:04:12.220> month

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
his eyebrows I think about that month

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.540 
his eyebrows I think about that month
should<00:04:12.700> be<00:04:12.880> fine<00:04:14.280> cut<00:04:15.280> them<00:04:15.430> a<00:04:15.520> similar<00:04:15.820> length

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:17.550 
should be fine cut them a similar length

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:20.780 
should be fine cut them a similar length
and<00:04:18.550> we'll<00:04:18.760> just<00:04:18.970> see<00:04:19.180> what<00:04:19.330> they<00:04:19.420> look<00:04:19.540> like

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
and we'll just see what they look like

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.530 
and we'll just see what they look like
against<00:04:22.200> his<00:04:23.200> face<00:04:23.910> for<00:04:24.910> size

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
against his face for size

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.880 
against his face for size
so<00:04:25.810> might<00:04:26.470> be<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:26.650> tiny<00:04:27.040> bit<00:04:27.360> Milan<00:04:28.560> just<00:04:29.560> might

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
so might be a tiny bit Milan just might

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.440 
so might be a tiny bit Milan just might
have<00:04:29.980> to<00:04:30.010> just<00:04:30.250> cut<00:04:30.460> a<00:04:30.490> really<00:04:30.850> small<00:04:31.120> amount

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
have to just cut a really small amount

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:36.300 
have to just cut a really small amount
of<00:04:31.600> each<00:04:31.780> one<00:04:34.740> and<00:04:35.740> then<00:04:35.860> when<00:04:36.040> you're<00:04:36.160> happy

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
of each one and then when you're happy

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.170 
of each one and then when you're happy
with<00:04:36.580> it<00:04:36.730> we<00:04:36.760> can<00:04:36.940> stick<00:04:37.240> those<00:04:38.520> in<00:04:39.520> place<00:04:39.880> just

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
with it we can stick those in place just

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:49.499 
with it we can stick those in place just
with<00:04:40.330> a<00:04:40.390> lot<00:04:40.570> of<00:04:40.720> water

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:51.230 

when<00:04:49.990> a<00:04:50.020> mine<00:04:50.259> looks<00:04:50.469> a<00:04:50.620> little<00:04:50.740> bit<00:04:50.979> longer

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
when a mine looks a little bit longer

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.070 
when a mine looks a little bit longer
than<00:04:52.240> the<00:04:52.419> other<00:04:52.599> one<00:04:52.629> I<00:04:52.749> think<00:04:54.689> and<00:04:55.689> now<00:04:56.020> we

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
than the other one I think and now we
