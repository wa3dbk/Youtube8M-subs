00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.069
 hello together today there is tuna 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.069
 lowers from the salt bare 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:20.800
 2 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:22.029
 many winners to throw so today 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.320
 it is especially important that we are up 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.060
 to the end remains because I show you 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.200
 first how it does not work and then show 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.200
 I can make you better 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.980
 We start with an onion in dice 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.530
 to cut 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.700
 We make a small salt from mango 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.700
 pineapple and iron 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.239
 the exact quantities for my 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.660
 salsa is then down in the video 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.660
 description 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.100
 I will not try you for long 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.650
 cut it to a small size 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.689
 to be bored if the mango at the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.650
 cut nose is then you have it 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.930
 Almost done 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.799
 here are cubes of fresh pineapple and 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.210
 fish make them especially good then 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.210
 In addition a few halved cherry tomatoes 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.360
 the onions 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.400
 a shot of balsamic vinegar 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.509
 a small shot of olive oil 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.900
 juice of half a lemon 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.280
 a teaspoon of salt 1 teaspoon of pepper 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.990
 and who wants to can now even a 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.499
 Add a shot and a little bit 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.499
 fresh mint 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.430
 then we'll do it a bit more 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.280
 cold in the meantime, we take care of each other 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.229
 To bare our salt here 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.270
 our two protagonists two 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:15.910
 tuna steaks these too fresh the 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.500
 almost fidget 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.420
 and after we got our salt banks 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.700
 we can easily catch up with them 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.660
 already put on it 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.620
 they really only need two 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.340
 minutes per page 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.370
 and then we turn it around so far is 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.830
 everything is fine then totally 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.630
 cool is it from then markus so a 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:37.720
 holzbrett lately where you the 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.360
 salt plank on it could be that is 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.310
 First of all, totally good idea only 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.930
 unfortunately you have to go to the tuna steaks 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.260
 we do once briefly goes in from 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.450
 So the salat gets the salsa and in that 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.970
 moment i was severely disappointed i 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.890
 I've packed it often enough 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.960
 discussed here with me too 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.520
 not things work but me 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.050
 can tell you it really lived on me 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.780
 Look like I'm gnawing I'm mine 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.020

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.230

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.230
 fun 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.200
 but I said stay tuned 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.520

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.290

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.510
 try to show you that it works 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:23.920
 salt blank preheated and wrapped 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:26.730
 good for steaks this were 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.730
 much better 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.450

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.680
