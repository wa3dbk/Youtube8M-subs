00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.960
 can take off 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:09.859
 the fan club 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.929
 from kate moss and I was kind so for the 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.849
 photos and I signed the autographs that I 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.960
 you asked but this is different you do not have 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.789
 to teach me anything 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.609
 Insects Move your fighting style 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.479

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.479
 biggest admirer 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:44.010
 now it refers to yourself but never 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.230
 clarified that part of one must be 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.860
 faithful good because he has finally understood 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.860
 who I am 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.820
 and now you have officially passed the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.100
 line for you is because I have no powers 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.840
 that if not all superheroes have 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.720
 powers and if they can be very 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.480
 well I have invented this and I can 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:09.619
 talk you can fly the baby house yo 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.619
 work does not only have an opportunity 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.440
 l 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.080
 is ready to admit a few missing 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.560
 superheroes to make it worth fighting 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.080
 against you but that strong still was not 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.910
 enough when you trashed the last 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.970
 I had to make very important changes 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:00.479
 the truth has not been simple but you 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.560
 you're worth it because after all I'm your 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.720
 biggest admirer 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.720
 for you I do not call myself 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:14.650
 I'm past page 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.410
 if I just wanted to get to the future it 's 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.590
 door I come home for you I work 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.320
 you just left me trashed but I learned 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:26.170
 an important lesson never trust 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:29.170
 Nobody especially on your cell phone I know that no 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.510
 it must be treated that way, sorry, you see it 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.150
 Now you respect me because I am a 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.100
 threat that's how it works there's a lot 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.660
 people whole countries who demand respect and 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.640
 are willing to pay anything with 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.520
 to achieve it as you think I did 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.930
 rich inventing weapons and now I have a 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.250
 to which you can only beat shot and 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.250
 control and I will see with sections 

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:53.340
 I can not believe it 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.230
 but the zero point giga that is that 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:00.650
 I keep for my own use my best 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.650
 creations 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.370
