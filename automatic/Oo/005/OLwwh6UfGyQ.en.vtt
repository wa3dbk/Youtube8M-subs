little rhinestones

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.669 
little rhinestones
squares<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.299> on<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.539> bag<00:01:51.749> they've<00:01:52.229> got<00:01:52.469> this

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
squares and on the bag they've got this

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.639 
squares and on the bag they've got this
mirrored<00:01:53.310> look<00:01:53.609> and<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:55.109> thought<00:01:55.469> oh<00:01:55.590> yeah

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
mirrored look and so I thought oh yeah

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.359 
mirrored look and so I thought oh yeah
that's<00:01:56.249> ideal<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:56.909> windows<00:01:57.630> making<00:01:57.899> windows

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
that's ideal for windows making windows

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.779 
that's ideal for windows making windows
so<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.670> stuck<00:02:00.060> those<00:02:00.329> together<00:02:01.249> and<00:02:02.249> made<00:02:02.549> some

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
so I stuck those together and made some

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.349 
so I stuck those together and made some
windows<00:02:03.359> out<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.840> those<00:02:04.219> the<00:02:05.219> door<00:02:05.520> are<00:02:06.149> made

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:06.359 
windows out of those the door are made

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:08.600 
windows out of those the door are made
from<00:02:06.630> cardboard<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.469> then<00:02:07.649> made<00:02:08.100> cobble

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
from cardboard and then made cobble

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.240 
from cardboard and then made cobble
pieces<00:02:09.119> cut<00:02:09.810> them<00:02:09.959> all<00:02:10.140> out<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.950> they<00:02:11.069> look

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
pieces cut them all out so they look

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.339 
pieces cut them all out so they look
like<00:02:11.400> wood<00:02:11.640> put<00:02:12.390> some<00:02:12.599> bits<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.900> glue<00:02:13.110> on

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
like wood put some bits of glue on

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.860 
like wood put some bits of glue on
before<00:02:13.739> I<00:02:13.769> colored<00:02:14.220> them<00:02:14.489> with<00:02:15.090> my<00:02:15.599> pro

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
before I colored them with my pro

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:16.710 
before I colored them with my pro
markers

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
markers

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.650 
markers
so<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.470> looked<00:02:17.680> like<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.550> knots<00:02:19.240> in<00:02:19.510> the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
so that it looked like the knots in the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.790 
so that it looked like the knots in the
wood<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:21.060> glossy<00:02:22.060> accent<00:02:22.540> I'm<00:02:23.230> afterwards

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
wood and glossy accent I'm afterwards

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.390
