00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 there are people who write me with 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:07.589
 regarding the subject of self-esteem 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.230
 like to be able to raise your esteem and what is 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.179
 the problem of this situation of this 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.980
 question that has to do with that 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.820
 many times many people if they are 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.590
 with a low estimate for start the 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.439
 self-esteem has to do with what the 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.019
 others project externally into one and 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.519
 that one finally finishes it 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:29.460
 then incorporating many times one 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.059
 is a victim of certain mandates 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.860
 external and ends them internalizing what 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.559
 ends up believing then a person 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.840
 he says not only to play tennis 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.210
 I do not study languages I do not 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.129
 I would bet run then it's going to 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.500
 self convincing or you are 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.620
 completely convinced of their own 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.850
 limitations and the whole environment favors 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.489
 so that's it 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.110
 many times the mother says poor my son 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.930
 he can not run because he has such a son 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.520
 Once overweight and is the worst that 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.289
 can make the child who is already 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.940
 convincing is putting tab to 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.580
 everyday 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.290
 also victimizing herself she has a 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.479
 son who does not have the ability to 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.600
 run also a person who maybe 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.759
 a course is late for example from 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.720
 languages ​​for example is written down to the month that 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.770
 all the people were already 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.200
 learning begins to maybe read 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.360
 some prayer everyone laugh the person 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.430
 be complex and it is a vicious circle 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.030
 After that, it will not animate again 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.770
 will feel uncomfortable and will disappear 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.930
 will stop doing that course and I'll 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.420
 doing that why I do not serve but 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.909
 always end the causes or the reasons 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.190
 that made you feel that you did not 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.369
 you serve for a certain area of ​​life 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.170
 then basically the external mockery or 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.170
 also the conditioning of the 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.420
 parents or the environment are going to influence a lot 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.840
 in the psyche of the person and then the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.929
 person will assimilate it as if it were 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.060
 a problem of its own that does not serve to 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:03.030
 certain issues such as a 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.340
 teenager who does not stop eating and who 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.679
 then the mother complains like that 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.789
 situation that we saw earlier the 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.689
 mother who says 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.189
 He had a somewhat obese son and he regrets 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:16.769
 as if it were the end of the world and the 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:20.129
 boy is 13 years old then none 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:22.769
 situation of no return but if the 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.470
 external environment will influence the 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.980
 psyche of the person the strong mind goes 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.170
 to dominate the weak mind and the child or 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:34.920
 the teenager or even a person 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.609
 adult who is a victim of a mandate 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.709
 is going to feel conditioned then that's going 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:42.470
 to diminish in the self-esteem of the person 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.120
 that you feel you can not achieve 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.579
 certain activity then there is never 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.500
 than let us be conditioned 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:53.010
 with physical beauty a person who is 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.709
 can feel not very gracefully just 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.329
 by that external conditioning 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.459
 then you should never let the 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:03.419
 others condition us if a person 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.340
 he comes and they tell us or he tells us you do not serve 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:07.590
 for such a thing as long as you defend yourself 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.060
 you always have to be aware that yes 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.340
 what 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.000
 the approval that one needs is the 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.620
 own to achieve any activity or 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.280
 to achieve any goal or objective 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.260
 that we can get to propose a 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.480
 very clear example of a very self-esteem 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.019
 high was once a meeting for 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.959
 alone and alone in a well-known bar 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.810
 of capital in Buenos Aires- and they arrived 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.200
 many people many women many 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.230
 men a little shy or not so 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.440
 physically graceful or whatever it was 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.470
 always conditioned by that situation 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.060
 of solitude in which they were and 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.910
 a little bit later it's twelve o'clock and 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.640
 half an hour and a half according to man a 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.959
 a little bit bigger than the rest, about 55 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.209
 years badly dressed in a jacket 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:04.380
 eighty of those that inflate little 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:07.440
 hair an incomplete denture beard 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.810
 three days only five pesos in the 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.560
 pocket look like brother did not recognize 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.180
 the neurus doctor and he asked me is here and 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.579
 it is chosen if it is here 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.870
 The meeting saw the table where 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.359
 they found all the candidates all 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.090
 lonely girls with a certain face of 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:26.580
 contempt he did not want to sit down and he stayed 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.190
 by my side and then every time I passed 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:33.330
 a girl of the place who were like 30 years 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:36.150
 more younger than he would have 25 and that 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.090
 if they were physically very graceful he 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.990
 I was advancing without caring 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.090
 achieve the conquest obviously the girls 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.639
 are the waitresses or the waitresses turned 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.550
 on his heels without directing the 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.650
 look 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.770
 and the anyway will double the 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.650
 bet was still trying with another and with 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.620
 another one made a little surprised of that 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.900
 audacity so I was telling him but date 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.360
 realize that in reality maybe you have 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.250
 to look for something more according to you because 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.360
 they are younger and also seemed 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:14.150
 some advertising models then 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.310
 he was not even listening to me and I was trying 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.879
 convince him to join the table 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.319
 alone and alone to look for some 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:23.960
 more suited to the woman who was he 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:26.659
 then finally he insisted again 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:30.379
 with another wench this wench turned again 

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:32.509
 on his heels without answering he did 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:34.819
 again in insist come and sit down 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:37.879
 It integrates you'll know what you will achieve 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:40.669
 Integrate better if you sit down and you 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:42.500
 you join the group then he looked at me 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.810
 with a certain face of contempt and I 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.800
 he replied listening to the fact that I was 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.639
 done shit does not mean that no 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.639
 have good taste
