00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.490
 hello girls how about here I am again 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.840
 and today I want to talk about my accessory 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.359
 absolutely favorite of the moment 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.369
 First I have to say that I am not 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.609
 a particularly technological girl 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.619
 but there are two technological devices and 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:35.800
 those that I can not live the first 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:39.250
 would be my kindle that is my twitter for 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.050
 read and that the one that finds me by the 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.820
 street that sees me out there in a room 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.010
 wait waiting for a meeting at 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:50.100
 doctor or whatever it is always going to see me 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:52.629
 reading in the kindle because I am 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.420
 I love reading 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:57.789
 it helps a lot to evade me and when I'm 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.770
 in situations where you really do not 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.649
 I want to be because I'm going to wait 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.809
 I am always reading and I am also 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.509
 It helps to separate me a bit from my device 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.729
 technological favorite number one that is 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.250
 my cell phone up until now I was 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.700
 using my 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:18.540
 Galassi Samsung nutri for me has 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:21.710
 been my best friend without difference 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:26.040
 This cell phone is like my office contains 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.790
 all the information contains millions of 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.470
 photos I believe and 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:36.220
 I got my trusted best friend 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:39.950
 it's always there the battery can stand it 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.500
 all good but a few weeks ago I received 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.000
 this other phone that is also of 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.640
 samsung is the galaxy 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.050
 3 and when I received it was love at first 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.820
 view because because this is the cell phone 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:58.310
 of which I have had in my hand the 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:02.600
 Most stylish cell phone in life is super 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.160
 super super sic is pure design by all 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.149
 the sides wherever you look 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.040
 It's amazing and the details are everything 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.459
 everything is a cell phone that is completely 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.020
 aluminum and it does not open is it can not be 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.940
 remove the back cover to put the 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.800
 battery the battery is in and 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.870
 you can only open it for a few 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.780
 hours that you have here next to 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.120
 insert the sim card or a card 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.930
 memory and that's it then 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.750
 color the shape the weight that weighs nothing 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.580
 because it weighs a little bit more though 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.739
 it does not weigh so much really I think that the 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.830
 cover of this one weighs more than the cell phone in 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:44.250
 yes but it's clear it does not weigh anything if 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.980
 we look at the difference is considerable from 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.010
 one or the other and how bad this has is 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.250
 that is definitely not cloud friendly 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.470
 that is, I am one of those that I walk with 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.299
 car by the hand and next I have to 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.879
 have the cell phone like this because this one 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.280
 definitely unless it's a close 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.140
 this more as big a man do not fit 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.349
 but sometimes one of those little ones that 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.370
 They are more festive and I can not fit but this one 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:15.209
 yes and this as I said is a beautiful 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.090
 it's aesthetic I would not commit the sin 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:21.420
 capital to put a shed is that 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.980
 they cover everything because it would be a waste of 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.709
 weather 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.080
 a crime against fashion put a 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.269
 cover but I have to take care of it a lot for 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.879
 that I do not fall clear and do not go to 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.980
 suffer no stroke or anything but also 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.459
 that these samsung phones the good thing 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.440
 they have is that they are beaten 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.170
 crashes and all because the indian has 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.720
 abused this cell I do not carry much 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:49.019
 time without cover and niko the truth is that 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:52.260
 He has done great things with this cell phone 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.540
 then it is intact it is perfect and 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.870
 I am now one of those crazy women who walk with 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.420
 two cell phones in the wallet because they do not 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.780
 I can get rid of this but this one 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.769
 fascinates and I love this I'm going to put 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.359
 all the specifications of these 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.980
 technology in the blog because I'm going to 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.720
 do a copy-paste directly because 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.489
 As I say, I'm not very technological 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:16.320
 but if I want to speak from a 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.989
 feature that has this phone 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.549
 What is special about it is that it is a 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.799
 phone thought for those of us 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.139
 we make 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:26.210
 then he has a way of making us 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.400
 the fish that is much simpler 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.139
 that having to hit the button to 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.389
 give us and this is a bit uncomfortable because 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:35.360
 you have to be like this and until you eliminate 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:37.819
 the photo as such is with this not with 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.280
 this phone we have a function that 

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:42.979
 we can do the selphy through a 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.930
 voice command or with the use of the palm 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:46.940
 from our hand that how it is done 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.190
 study because you simply have 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:51.530
 to put the phone like this 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.900
 be a self and traditional that in which 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.639
 you will hit it with your finger but you do not have 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.469
 that use your finger you just put 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:00.199
 the palm of your hand so the phone 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:02.270
 he recognizes them and then he gives you two 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:05.500
 seconds to by removing the hand and 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.500
 get fabulous 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.610
 and it's that simple now you can do it 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.320
 to self and without having to be stretching 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.810
 the hand that we sometimes have to do 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.000
 acrobatics and everything to get to 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.530
 button and give it the one that looks natural that 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.660
 do not look like it's a self and 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.630
 too much inn also has a mode 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.460
 of self and panoramic that you exist with 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.919
 several friends so you can do the 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.500
 selphy that you see all your friends and 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.520
 more so it's fabulous but how do you 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.570
 I said I'm going to put all the 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.910
 specifications in the blog and do not leave 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.430
 to check it because it's definitely a 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:51.120
 fabulous option for which we seek 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:54.180
 design and we want everything we use 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:57.780
 be super super stylish the phone is 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:00.180
 a low-mid-range phone is not a 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.040
 high-end phone then it 's a 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.590
 phone that comes at a pretty price 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.690
 affordable but nothing like I say a 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.270
 check on this phone the ones that are 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.550
 looking for one is a fabulous choice of 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:13.560
 photos are wonderful and as I say 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.260
 the blog I'm going to leave you some photos of 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.450
 what I've done with the cellphone I hope 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.020
 that you liked my mini tribe of my 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:21.720
 new 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:23.400
 favorite accessory cell phone and nothing we 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.060
 let's see in the next video a 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:26.060
 supervisor
