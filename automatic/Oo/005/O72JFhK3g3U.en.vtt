00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
like all right I also be like okay it's

three<00:04:37.110> o'clock<00:04:37.199> good<00:04:37.500> morning<00:04:37.830> I<00:04:37.889> really

00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:38.129 
three o'clock good morning I really

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:40.279 
three o'clock good morning I really
should<00:04:38.280> do<00:04:38.430> my<00:04:38.550> uncharted<00:04:39.000> video<00:04:39.270> and<00:04:39.599> then

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
should do my uncharted video and then

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:42.290 
should do my uncharted video and then
I'm<00:04:40.409> thinking<00:04:40.650> if<00:04:41.430> I<00:04:41.550> do<00:04:41.610> it<00:04:41.819> now<00:04:41.969> so<00:04:42.000> we'll

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
I'm thinking if I do it now so we'll

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.850 
I'm thinking if I do it now so we'll
take<00:04:42.449> four<00:04:42.659> hours<00:04:42.689> of<00:04:43.020> ender<00:04:43.289> and<00:04:43.319> then<00:04:43.650> six

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
take four hours of ender and then six

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.740 
take four hours of ender and then six
hours<00:04:44.099> upload<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:44.759> it's<00:04:45.300> going<00:04:45.449> to<00:04:45.539> upload

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
hours upload and it's going to upload

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.420 
hours upload and it's going to upload
while<00:04:46.110> I'm<00:04:46.199> awake<00:04:46.500> trying<00:04:46.919> to<00:04:47.009> use<00:04:47.129> internet

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
while I'm awake trying to use internet

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.149 
while I'm awake trying to use internet
so<00:04:47.759> i<00:04:47.789> can't<00:04:48.060> do<00:04:48.240> it<00:04:48.270> i<00:04:48.569> mean<00:04:49.139> if<00:04:49.349> i<00:04:49.469> use<00:04:49.710> if<00:04:50.069> I

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:50.159 
so i can't do it i mean if i use if I

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:52.969 
so i can't do it i mean if i use if I
tone<00:04:50.610> down<00:04:50.789> the<00:04:50.939> video<00:04:51.150> quality<00:04:51.770> it<00:04:52.770> would<00:04:52.889> be

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
tone down the video quality it would be

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:54.469 
tone down the video quality it would be
a<00:04:53.009> lot<00:04:53.129> easier<00:04:53.189> and<00:04:53.610> i<00:04:53.819> probably<00:04:54.030> wouldn't<00:04:54.360> i

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
a lot easier and i probably wouldn't i

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.240 
a lot easier and i probably wouldn't i
would<00:04:54.719> probably<00:04:55.050> have<00:04:55.199> these<00:04:55.500> videos<00:04:55.860> up<00:04:56.039> more

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
would probably have these videos up more

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.459 
would probably have these videos up more
often<00:04:56.400> but<00:04:57.389> just<00:04:57.449> because<00:04:57.780> they<00:04:58.050> take<00:04:58.289> like

00:04:58.459 --> 00:04:58.469 
often but just because they take like

00:04:58.469 --> 00:05:00.140 
often but just because they take like
six<00:04:58.710> hours<00:04:58.889> upload<00:04:59.400> before<00:04:59.729> i<00:04:59.759> was<00:04:59.879> to<00:04:59.940> render

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
six hours upload before i was to render

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.869 
six hours upload before i was to render
that's<00:05:00.599> why<00:05:00.750> I'm<00:05:00.960> really<00:05:01.560> like<00:05:02.400> I've<00:05:02.699> been

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:02.879 
that's why I'm really like I've been

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:05.649 
that's why I'm really like I've been
really<00:05:03.120> lazy<00:05:03.360> with<00:05:03.659> it<00:05:03.719> but<00:05:04.440> I<00:05:04.680> don't<00:05:04.740> want<00:05:05.069> to

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:05.659 
really lazy with it but I don't want to

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:08.899 
really lazy with it but I don't want to
I<00:05:06.659> don't<00:05:07.080> want<00:05:07.500> to<00:05:07.620> use<00:05:07.860> the<00:05:08.159> faster<00:05:08.669> rendering

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:08.909 
I don't want to use the faster rendering

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:11.360 
I don't want to use the faster rendering
and<00:05:09.330> uploading<00:05:09.419> settings<00:05:10.289> only<00:05:10.979> because<00:05:11.129> the

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
and uploading settings only because the

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.740 
and uploading settings only because the
graphics<00:05:11.819> in<00:05:12.030> like<00:05:12.180> you<00:05:12.330> know<00:05:12.360> the<00:05:12.539> video

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
graphics in like you know the video

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.540 
graphics in like you know the video
quality<00:05:12.930> isn't<00:05:13.289> as<00:05:13.349> great<00:05:13.560> and<00:05:13.860> i<00:05:14.250> figured

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
quality isn't as great and i figured

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.129
