 rounded shape for the phenomenon to be 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.869
 so there are several kinds of this 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.780
 various types of measurements 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.939
 in several measures he more closed and 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.180

 each of 29 paraná is not good for the 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.520
 sea ​​without impulse issues of pinus 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.950
 hardwood has no dorival 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.150
 uses neither drawings nor 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.560
 home 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.560
 20 years ago, it turns wood into 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.630
 true works of art is normal ii 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.720

 your mind I work as well as one 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.010
 customer asks he starts talking about that 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.150
 He wants my mind already. 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:33.370
 practically on the idea already ready 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:35.290
 the activity is interesting that I saw that 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.330
 you carving there in the wood you do not 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.410
 uses no design no design 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:46.380
 how can you basically do 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.380
 only the risk only the drawing that I want 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.970
 in practice what did you discover 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.940
 this gift 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.220
 This was a joke, a friend. 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.110
 I said I know how to do 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.670
 one day he invited me to 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.350
 working with him the young man worked and 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.600
 service charge 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.600
 now the tek did not even start like this 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.400
 joking after a few years and I 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.430
 say as a profession 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.140

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.670
 to make money carved in wood 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.640
 making the artisan and never winning 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:23.820
 money but that's what he likes to see 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:27.900
 the cool thing is good you imagine yourself doing 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.820
 something else or there is nothing else that I 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.440
 is also related to art 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.260
 I nor even the transformation of 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:39.420
 motorcycles are also involved with 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:43.280
 the idea of calling 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:46.620
 like a lot of beautiful work and no 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.470
 norival success after the break 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.130
