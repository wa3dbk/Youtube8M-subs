00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.280
 The system I did talking on the radio 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.580
 through the telephone with connection

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.930
 made on the memory module that is the 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.120
 The system works very simply. 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.000
 audio goes over the phone to boxivo 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.340

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.949

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.590

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.350
 When I speak on this phone, 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.880
 I was filming when I said it to him. 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.759
 sound comes on my phone on the 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.280
 it the audio comes in that the vox gets 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.820
 triggered in the system the little subject 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.380
 command and audio is transmitted 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.560
 usually performed with a lot of quality 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.630
 the staff has enjoyed it very much and now 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.259
 I want to change how often 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.549
 does 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:47.119
 on this phone here I have fillmann myself 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.520
 I have a skype has an internet of $ 9 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.100
 nor does it also cost 9 reais per month 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.940
 hit internet because the connection by 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.700
 telephone 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.860
 the guy to come to my plan then 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.450
 What is your skype on this phone there? 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.490
 I'll send a command, will not I? 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.650
 to the computer here 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.330
 and then the command arrives at the frequency 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.890
 not assume that the frequency reaches the 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:18.510
 I sent 7058 sends this frequency here 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.990
 read program is the Skype screen sends 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:26.090
 in the form of transform in command kate 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:29.730
 send to radio and arrow on radio 7058 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.400
 if I want to increase that which is your 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.500
 I send the esquel spirit of two here. 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.660
 law program does the same thing send 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.590
 cache command and so I'm messing with 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:44.370
 side of putting power by pulling 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.840
 the system needs noc beauty fell 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:50.010
 telephone 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:54.030
 the system needs a radio that has 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:58.820
 cat with radio that has 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:03.810
 modern skateboard command today everyone has 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:07.680
 kate metal commands and if you have 57 have this 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.320
 has radio while you have kate command if 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.920
 You go down to quit this program 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.200
 to operate the radio via skype 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.270
 we have is the luxury network program that 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.230
 operates by computer if it does not operate 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.350
 telephone 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:24.570
 Good, but if you want to do it's a 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.600
 system where you use the radio in the 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:31.950
 fixed frequency for you to play just 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:34.800

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.500
