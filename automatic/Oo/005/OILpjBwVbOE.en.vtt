do<00:03:43.560> all<00:03:43.710> the<00:03:43.830> same<00:03:43.860> size<00:03:44.520> serrations<00:03:45.180> first<00:03:45.480> so

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
do all the same size serrations first so

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.000 
do all the same size serrations first so
it's<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.320> little<00:03:46.530> easier<00:03:48.620> the<00:03:49.620> angle<00:03:49.890> I<00:03:49.980> have

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
it's a little easier the angle I have

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.980 
it's a little easier the angle I have
set<00:03:50.430> here<00:03:50.700> is<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:50.820> little<00:03:51.030> bit<00:03:51.180> higher<00:03:51.420> than<00:03:51.720> the

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
set here is a little bit higher than the

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:53.450 
set here is a little bit higher than the
straight<00:03:52.350> edge<00:03:52.500> of<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.710> knife<00:03:52.860> this<00:03:53.130> is<00:03:53.250> about

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:53.460 
straight edge of the knife this is about

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.430 
straight edge of the knife this is about
28<00:03:53.850> degrees<00:03:54.060> where<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:54.720> angle<00:03:55.020> over<00:03:55.110> here

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
28 degrees where the angle over here

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.430 
28 degrees where the angle over here
would<00:03:55.590> be<00:03:55.710> about<00:03:55.920> 20<00:03:56.370> so<00:03:57.270> then<00:03:57.570> do<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.960> larger

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
would be about 20 so then do the larger

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:03.260 
would be about 20 so then do the larger
diameter<00:03:58.980> serrations<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:02.760> that's<00:04:02.970> really

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
diameter serrations and that's really

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.200 
diameter serrations and that's really
all<00:04:03.930> there<00:04:04.170> is<00:04:04.200> to<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:04.850> hoping<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:05.940> guesswork
