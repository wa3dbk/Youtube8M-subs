ordinarily<00:00:44.730> I<00:00:44.850> wouldn't<00:00:45.090> do<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.420> but<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.960> just

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
ordinarily I wouldn't do this but I just

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.869 
ordinarily I wouldn't do this but I just
wanted<00:00:46.890> people<00:00:47.930> to<00:00:48.930> see<00:00:49.379> that<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.399> gets<00:00:50.550> bigger

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
wanted people to see that it gets bigger

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.520 
wanted people to see that it gets bigger
before<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.629> gets<00:00:51.780> smaller<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.350> know

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
before it gets smaller you know

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.889 
before it gets smaller you know
ultimately<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:53.520> will<00:00:53.640> be<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:54.120> size<00:00:55.910> hmm<00:00:56.910> but

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
ultimately it will be this size hmm but

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.439 
ultimately it will be this size hmm but
it<00:00:58.230> gets<00:00:58.469> way<00:00:59.039> bigger<00:00:59.309> before<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.910> gets<00:01:00.090> smart

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449
