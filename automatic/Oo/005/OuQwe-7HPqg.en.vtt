accident<00:00:00.960> the<00:00:01.680> demonstration<00:00:02.340> I'm<00:00:02.429> doing

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
accident the demonstration I'm doing

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.220 
accident the demonstration I'm doing
today<00:00:02.909> is<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:04.100> formulaic<00:00:05.270> way<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.330> come<00:00:06.990> to<00:00:07.200> a

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
today is a formulaic way to come to a

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.709 
today is a formulaic way to come to a
likeness<00:00:07.560> very<00:00:08.099> quickly<00:00:08.519> without<00:00:09.120> actually

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
likeness very quickly without actually

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.080 
likeness very quickly without actually
looking<00:00:09.870> at<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.349> model<00:00:10.710> in<00:00:11.610> other<00:00:11.790> words<00:00:11.969> this

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
looking at the model in other words this

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.419 
looking at the model in other words this
will<00:00:12.300> be<00:00:12.450> just<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:13.230> short<00:00:13.679> cut<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:14.099> how<00:00:14.370> to

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
will be just a short cut in how to

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.240 
will be just a short cut in how to
create<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.150> portrait<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.710> first<00:00:16.890> thing<00:00:17.010> we

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
create a portrait so the first thing we

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.250 
create a portrait so the first thing we
need<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.670> front<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.600> we're<00:00:18.840> looking<00:00:19.109> at<00:00:19.230> a

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
need is front of you we're looking at a

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.029 
need is front of you we're looking at a
line<00:00:19.680> here<00:00:20.130> line<00:00:20.430> here<00:00:21.350> roughly<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.590> shape<00:00:22.619> of

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
line here line here roughly the shape of

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.490 
line here line here roughly the shape of
the<00:00:23.100> face<00:00:23.550> comes<00:00:23.880> into<00:00:24.240> play<00:00:24.480> we're<00:00:25.350> going<00:00:25.439> to

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
the face comes into play we're going to

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.240 
the face comes into play we're going to
go<00:00:25.760> pupil<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:27.359> pupil<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.019> tip<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.380> nose<00:00:28.590> that's

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
go pupil to pupil to tip of nose that's

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.250 
go pupil to pupil to tip of nose that's
a<00:00:29.460> triangle<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.890> from<00:00:31.890> there<00:00:32.099> we<00:00:32.960> cut<00:00:33.960> into

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
a triangle and from there we cut into

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.709 
a triangle and from there we cut into
the<00:00:34.469> language<00:00:35.399> will<00:00:35.850> then<00:00:36.030> constitute<00:00:36.690> the

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
the language will then constitute the

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.950 
the language will then constitute the
mouth<00:00:37.160> from<00:00:38.160> pupil<00:00:38.940> down<00:00:39.149> here<00:00:39.480> gives<00:00:39.690> us<00:00:39.809> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
mouth from pupil down here gives us the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.350 
mouth from pupil down here gives us the
end<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.290> mouth<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.890> from<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.000> end<00:00:42.239> of

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
end of the mouth and from the end of

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.420 
end of the mouth and from the end of
this<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.140> end<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.530> gives<00:00:43.980> us<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
this I to the end of that I gives us the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.170 
this I to the end of that I gives us the
nostril<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.960> nostril<00:00:46.170> is<00:00:46.590> there<00:00:47.180> once

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
nostril so that nostril is there once

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.060 
nostril so that nostril is there once
we've<00:00:48.390> achieved<00:00:48.539> these<00:00:48.989> lines<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.649> next<00:00:49.890> step

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
we've achieved these lines the next step

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.310 
we've achieved these lines the next step
is<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.280> create<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.700> sense<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.149> planes<00:00:51.840> which<00:00:52.289> are

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
is to create a sense of planes which are

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.250 
is to create a sense of planes which are
like<00:00:53.070> facets<00:00:53.789> like<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.149> jewel<00:00:54.510> that's<00:00:54.719> been<00:00:54.989> cut

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
like facets like a jewel that's been cut

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.110 
like facets like a jewel that's been cut
and<00:00:56.219> I'm<00:00:56.430> going<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.850> instead<00:00:57.300> making<00:00:57.870> these

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
and I'm going to instead making these

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.810 
and I'm going to instead making these
rigid<00:01:00.120> planes<00:01:00.870> instead<00:01:01.739> i'm<00:01:01.890> using<00:01:02.309> circles

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
rigid planes instead i'm using circles

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.509 
rigid planes instead i'm using circles
so<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:03.750> constitutes<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.530> plane<00:01:04.890> this

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
so this constitutes the plane this

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.429 
so this constitutes the plane this
constitutes<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.240> plane<00:01:06.540> or<00:01:06.720> chief<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.290> a

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
constitutes the plane or chief this is a

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.490 
constitutes the plane or chief this is a
plane<00:01:08.119> here<00:01:09.119> we<00:01:09.240> have<00:01:09.450> a<00:01:09.479> space<00:01:09.840> under<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.260> lip

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
plane here we have a space under the lip

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.469 
plane here we have a space under the lip
this<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.070> chin<00:01:11.400> which<00:01:11.670> constitutes<00:01:12.299> a

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
this is the chin which constitutes a

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.620 
this is the chin which constitutes a
plane<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:12.960> analog<00:01:13.760> elongated<00:01:14.760> oval

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
plane this is analog elongated oval

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.300 
plane this is analog elongated oval
which<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.080> nose<00:01:16.320> here's<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> tip<00:01:17.100> of<00:01:17.130> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
which is the nose here's the tip of the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.420 
which is the nose here's the tip of the
nose<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.720> we<00:01:18.869> have<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.439> nice<00:01:19.830> happy<00:01:21.320> plane

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
nose and so we have a nice happy plane

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.080 
nose and so we have a nice happy plane
the<00:01:23.430> ears<00:01:23.810> kind<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.900> work<00:01:25.080> off<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.320> that<00:01:25.590> line

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
the ears kind of work off of that line

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.440 
the ears kind of work off of that line
give<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.360> form<00:01:27.780> lots<00:01:28.110> of<00:01:28.380> cranium<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.450> so

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
give this form lots of cranium and so

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.679 
give this form lots of cranium and so
now<00:01:30.479> what<00:01:31.020> we're<00:01:31.170> doing<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.909> looking<00:01:32.909> for<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
now what we're doing is looking for the

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.480 
now what we're doing is looking for the
skeletal<00:01:34.560> structure<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.189> anatomical

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
skeletal structure of the anatomical

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.649 
skeletal structure of the anatomical
structure<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:37.409> means<00:01:37.680> cheekbone<00:01:38.390> it<00:01:39.390> means

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
structure that means cheekbone it means

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.899 
structure that means cheekbone it means
the<00:01:39.930> hollow<00:01:40.290> when<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.250> look<00:01:41.369> at<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.610> skull

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
the hollow when you look at the skull

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.830 
the hollow when you look at the skull
we've<00:01:42.150> got<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> hollow<00:01:42.780> here<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.340> ice

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
we've got a hollow here that the ice

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.789 
we've got a hollow here that the ice
sockets<00:01:45.840> fit<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.380> reason<00:01:46.619> why<00:01:46.740> these

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
sockets fit in the reason why these

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.950 
sockets fit in the reason why these
hollows<00:01:47.369> are<00:01:47.399> important<00:01:48.000> because<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.630> gives

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
hollows are important because that gives

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.389 
hollows are important because that gives
us<00:01:49.170> lines<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.979> create<00:01:51.079> the<00:01:52.079> facial<00:01:52.590> map<00:01:53.100> or

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
us lines that create the facial map or

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.810 
us lines that create the facial map or
facial<00:01:53.579> features<00:01:54.590> you've<00:01:55.590> got<00:01:55.799> two<00:01:56.159> planes

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
facial features you've got two planes

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.499 
facial features you've got two planes
for<00:01:57.180> lips<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:58.590> one<00:01:58.829> underneath<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.850> in<00:02:00.119> shadow

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
for lips the one underneath is in shadow

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.230 
for lips the one underneath is in shadow
so<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.170> one<00:02:01.320> usually<00:02:01.579> I'm<00:02:02.579> sorry<00:02:02.909> this<00:02:03.060> is

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
so that one usually I'm sorry this is

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.670 
so that one usually I'm sorry this is
the<00:02:03.360> other<00:02:03.479> way<00:02:03.600> around<00:02:03.630> we're<00:02:04.079> going<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.380> make

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
the other way around we're going to make

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.430 
the other way around we're going to make
the<00:02:04.740> top<00:02:05.010> one<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.370> shadow<00:02:05.810> which<00:02:06.810> creates<00:02:07.290> this

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
the top one in shadow which creates this

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.960 
the top one in shadow which creates this
bottom<00:02:07.860> lip<00:02:08.070> that<00:02:08.490> has<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:09.229> lighter<00:02:10.670> plane<00:02:11.670> to

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
bottom lip that has a lighter plane to

to put a stone up bony Ridge here the

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.150 
to put a stone up bony Ridge here the
reason<00:02:30.570> why<00:02:30.660> that's<00:02:30.870> important<00:02:31.410> for<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.770> it

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
creates the eyebrow which is probably

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.560 
creates the eyebrow which is probably
more<00:02:35.070> expressive<00:02:35.459> actually<00:02:36.120> than<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.330> eyes

I've got plenty of expression so now his
the<00:02:45.060> face<00:02:45.239> oval<00:02:45.690> is<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:45.840> square<00:02:46.230> everybody's

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
the face oval is a square everybody's

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.220 
the face oval is a square everybody's
got<00:02:47.190> a<00:02:47.220> different<00:02:47.310> facial<00:02:47.820> type<00:02:48.239> so<00:02:49.080> we're

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
got a different facial type so we're

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.300 
got a different facial type so we're
going<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.410> come<00:02:49.590> in<00:02:49.739> and<00:02:49.890> kind<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.160> do<00:02:50.280> some

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
going to come in and kind of do some

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.910 
going to come in and kind of do some
parameters<00:02:51.120> here<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:54.180> year<00:02:54.420> again<00:02:54.830> there's<00:02:55.830> a

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
parameters here the year again there's a

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.729 
parameters here the year again there's a
bone<00:02:56.250> here<00:02:56.390> coming<00:02:57.390> off<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.540> nose<00:02:57.900> and<00:02:58.320> the

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
bone here coming off the nose and the

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.100 
bone here coming off the nose and the
from<00:02:59.430> about<00:02:59.640> here<00:02:59.670> down<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.300> cartilage<00:03:00.720> and

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
from about here down is cartilage and

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.020 
from about here down is cartilage and
what<00:03:01.890> that<00:03:02.070> means<00:03:02.340> is<00:03:02.520> you<00:03:02.730> can<00:03:02.850> have<00:03:02.970> a

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
what that means is you can have a

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.240 
what that means is you can have a
different<00:03:03.150> value<00:03:03.570> either<00:03:04.080> darker<00:03:04.770> here

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
different value either darker here

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.940 
different value either darker here
lighter<00:03:05.550> here<00:03:05.910> or<00:03:06.150> reverse<00:03:06.690> depending<00:03:07.260> on<00:03:07.380> the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
lighter here or reverse depending on the

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.130 
lighter here or reverse depending on the
direction<00:03:08.130> of<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.520> light<00:03:08.690> so<00:03:09.690> this<00:03:09.930> is<00:03:10.110> a

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
direction of the light so this is a

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.400 
direction of the light so this is a
little<00:03:10.230> bone<00:03:10.650> this<00:03:11.430> is<00:03:11.640> bone<00:03:11.930> this<00:03:12.930> is<00:03:13.110> bone

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
little bone this is bone this is bone

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.220 
little bone this is bone this is bone
this<00:03:14.100> is<00:03:14.310> bone<00:03:14.580> and<00:03:16.070> this<00:03:17.070> is<00:03:17.310> muzzle<00:03:17.850> so<00:03:18.660> those

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
this is bone and this is muzzle so those

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.199 
this is bone and this is muzzle so those
muzzle<00:03:20.040> lines<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.970> upper<00:03:21.630> lip<00:03:21.810> actually

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
muzzle lines the the upper lip actually

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.960 
muzzle lines the the upper lip actually
protrude<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.750> whole<00:03:25.130> thing<00:03:26.130> is<00:03:26.340> constitutes

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
protrude the whole thing is constitutes

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.300 
protrude the whole thing is constitutes
a<00:03:27.120> plane<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.750> then<00:03:28.470> there's<00:03:28.650> a<00:03:28.739> space<00:03:29.040> between

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
a plane and then there's a space between

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.030 
a plane and then there's a space between
lip<00:03:29.850> to<00:03:30.000> lip<00:03:30.230> so<00:03:31.230> we<00:03:31.380> go<00:03:31.560> two<00:03:32.310> lines<00:03:32.549> dot-to-dot

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
lip to lip so we go two lines dot-to-dot

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.410 
lip to lip so we go two lines dot-to-dot
triangle<00:03:35.040> that<00:03:35.880> is<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.180> question<00:03:36.420> of<00:03:37.400> skeletal

will come out this way the shape of the

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
lips in shadow the chin and then we have

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:57.709 
lips in shadow the chin and then we have
our<00:05:53.130> chin<00:05:53.909> cheekbone<00:05:54.919> reg<00:05:55.919> bone<00:05:56.280> bone<00:05:57.210> here<00:05:57.630> on

our chin cheekbone reg bone bone here on
this<00:05:57.870> nose<00:05:58.250> again<00:05:59.250> the<00:05:59.370> reason<00:05:59.520> why<00:05:59.729> that's

00:05:59.959 --> 00:05:59.969 
this nose again the reason why that's

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:01.820 
this nose again the reason why that's
important<00:06:00.539> is<00:06:00.690> because<00:06:00.750> this<00:06:01.289> is<00:06:01.440> a<00:06:01.469> different

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
important is because this is a different

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.399 
important is because this is a different
value<00:06:02.039> as<00:06:02.490> it<00:06:02.820> moves<00:06:03.449> from<00:06:03.659> cartilage<00:06:04.169> and<00:06:04.320> you

00:06:04.399 --> 00:06:04.409 
value as it moves from cartilage and you

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:06.950 
value as it moves from cartilage and you
can<00:06:04.590> see<00:06:04.740> the<00:06:04.889> shape<00:06:05.130> if<00:06:05.400> you<00:06:05.969> look<00:06:06.150> closely<00:06:06.630> at

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
can see the shape if you look closely at

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.640 
can see the shape if you look closely at
