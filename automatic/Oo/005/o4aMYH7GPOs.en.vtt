 the sepia is spied on office lis belongs to the family of roh be asked 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.620
 it is also known as choco silvia or if well 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.559
 it reproduces in a way I know Órica that is to say 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.370
 by sexes separated 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.990
 the cuttlefish that shoots 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.680
 executing its internal fertilization surveys that take place between February 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.940
 and October 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.540
 the female is responsible for the incubation of eggs between one and three months in 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.420
 temperature function 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.050
 its life cycle is two to three years with a single start in the entire cycle 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.460
 vital between 150 to 4 thousand eggs 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.790
 Each female deposits between 200 and 500 50 eggs in several days since the 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.470
 incubation lasts about 50 days 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.860
 in his birth he usually measures around a centimeter 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.500
 growing rapidly and reaching sexual maturity between the year and the year and 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.500
 half measuring then about 10 centimeters 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.370
 can reach a maximum size of 60 centimeters and more than two kilograms of 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.190
 weight in exceptional cases 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.320
 the cuttlefish is a cephalopod mollusk of carbon that is to say it has 10 tentacles 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.270
 eight longer with four rows of suckers on its inner side and two more 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.480
 short and retractable that end in some weeds with suckers that uses 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.630
 for the House 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.360
 the males have a short snatch arm which introduces 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.940
 inside the female's partial cavity at parking time 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.070
 moment that occurs in spring and summer 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.990
 his body is oval symmetrical somewhat depressed and projectile shaped 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.560
 attached to his head by a short neck 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.450
 in its interior it carries a shell called egídio not totally covered session 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.709
 for his body 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.609
 This one is straight and cackle 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:18.609
 rich in cameras that serve them for the flotation 

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:23.349
 the edge of the salt mantle forms an obtuse ovule between the eyes 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:24.849
 contour 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.689
 what of this mantle is provided with two lateral expansions that way 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:29.650
 of athletes that go 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.099
 from the top margin until almost its premiere 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.079
 to move 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.620
 in horizontal position used the 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.839
 the alerts that line your body as well as 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:44.689
 saving pressurized water that activates through a bodily opening or 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:47.369
 sifontes you have behind your head 

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:51.899
 This same serves as the squid or octopus to launch a jet 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:53.309
 colored ink 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:57.079
 that darkens the water in order to treat her predators as a bride 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:02.999
 It has a high capacity mimic function that activates through its 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:05.519
 groups of cells that topped seals 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.629
 He is also able to change sex 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:14.759
 a classic that you see ads on your skin that confer 

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:17.169
 Petism consume 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:19.839
 these color changes are also 

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:22.839
 as communication channels 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.969
 even grated placement like 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.489
 before the complex 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:29.769
 although it presents a month 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:30.830
 and very variable 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.830
 black or gray party 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.199
 in zone b 

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:40.119
 the drought is a lonely species 

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:43.119
 mika and territorial that feeds 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:48.679
 a type of fund 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:03:55.819
 aquatic loses to the underwater terrestrial case 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:59.449
 stalking game feeding on fish 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:02.269
 tibaldo 6 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.209
 even of its own kind 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:05.010
 that kills with 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.010
 Horny beak he has in his mouth 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:11.039
 The modern 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:13.189
 a trio the dolphin 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:14.549
 the seal years 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.439
 same species 

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:17.719
 the drought have 

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:20.229
 you are high commercial 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:23.229
 cleaner species that can be fished 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.590
 Presents the lowest levels of contaminants in your body 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:31.120
 in terms of its use 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.449
 the edible portion of drought is 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.759
 2 per 100 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.240
 when they are commercialized 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.050
 fresh usually comes from our evils 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.199
 but nevertheless 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.249
 when it is frozen and clean it generally corresponds to a 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:50.669
 sepia from India sepia aculeata 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.110
 sepia rings sold the 'poton' pacific dosidicus gigas 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.360
 thicker and bigger than sepia 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.009
 what is known in the markets as chopitos do not correspond with our 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.009
 sepia although the product belongs to the same genus 

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:11.199
 it's about different species that are usually the sepi claim if the 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.489
 sepia ordiñana whose sizes are much lower than those of sepia 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.290
 From the nutritional point of view the cuttlefish has a composition similar to 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.630
 that of squid with a somewhat lower fat content and significantly 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:27.759
 lower cholesterol 

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:32.389
 the protein intake is also very high as well as that of minerals and 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:33.650
 vitamins 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.300
 from among the minerals 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.639
 highlight selenium phosphorus black and sound 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.740
 for the first of them the edible portion of a serving of cuttlefish 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.949
 contributes 100% of the recommended intakes per day for men and 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:52.409
 women from 20 to 39 years of age who develop a physical activity 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:54.139
 moderate 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:00.340
 for phosphorus 40% and 22% of those corresponding to the thread for men and 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.300
 women respectively 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.689
 for sodium represents 18% of the nutritional objectives 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:12.219
 this last data will justify or recommend the consumption of sepia 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:14.680
 in cases of hypertension 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.580
 Regarding vitamins, sepia turns out to be a very good source of almost 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.090
 all the vitamins of group b b12 look thin 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.060
 riboflavin 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:27.280
 and b6 and moderate in terms of vitamin type a
