user function we are actually sending

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.990 
user function we are actually sending
the<00:00:24.210> ID<00:00:24.449> number<00:00:28.160> where<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.369> data<00:00:29.670> user

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the ID number where this data user

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.920

function<00:00:30.510> wants<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.199> email<00:00:31.769> address<00:00:32.870> now<00:00:33.870> we

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
function wants the email address now we

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.260 
function wants the email address now we
could<00:00:34.410> actually<00:00:34.680> just<00:00:35.579> go<00:00:35.700> ahead<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.030> change

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
could actually just go ahead and change

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.130 
could actually just go ahead and change
this<00:00:36.600> instead<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:36.989> ID<00:00:38.570> just<00:00:39.570> use<00:00:39.750> email

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
this instead of ID just use email

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.540 
this instead of ID just use email
address<00:00:40.410> so<00:00:40.590> let's<00:00:40.739> do<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.370> see

address so let's do that just to see

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.750 
address so let's do that just to see
this<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:41.910> action<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:43.100> instead<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.160> ID<00:00:44.399> we'll

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
this in action so instead of ID we'll

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.310 
this in action so instead of ID we'll
select<00:00:44.910> email<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.510> when<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.750> change<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.170> to

now this is going to work as far as
having<00:01:47.500> the<00:01:47.620> correct<00:01:47.860> value<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:48.700> sending

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
anything in the database yet so we need

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.420 
anything in the database yet so we need
to<00:01:53.860> add<00:01:54.010> this<00:01:54.250> to<00:01:54.310> our<00:01:54.520> list<00:01:54.640> here<00:01:55.360> so<00:01:56.280> let's<00:01:57.280> go

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
to add this to our list here so let's go

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.950 
to add this to our list here so let's go
ahead<00:01:57.580> and<00:01:57.790> before<00:01:58.540> title<00:02:00.060> put<00:02:01.060> in<00:02:01.240> user<00:02:01.600> for

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
ahead and before title put in user for

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.410 
ahead and before title put in user for
the<00:02:02.020> user<00:02:02.230> column<00:02:02.680> and<00:02:02.970> then<00:02:03.970> over<00:02:04.210> here<00:02:04.360> in

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
the user column and then over here in

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.859 
the user column and then over here in
the<00:02:04.510> values<00:02:05.310> before<00:02:06.310> title<00:02:07.950> we<00:02:08.950> need<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.220> do

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
the values before title we need to do

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:17.660 
the values before title we need to do
underscore<00:02:10.869> post

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.130 

user<00:02:19.160> comma<00:02:20.160> now<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:20.910> is<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.090> number<00:02:21.720> or<00:02:22.020> an

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
user comma now this is a number or an

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.500 
user comma now this is a number or an
integer<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:22.740> we<00:02:23.550> don't<00:02:23.760> need<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:23.940> put<00:02:24.120> this<00:02:24.300> in

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
integer so we don't need to put this in

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.280 
integer so we don't need to put this in
single<00:02:25.290> quotes<00:02:26.300> so<00:02:27.300> we<00:02:27.360> can<00:02:27.510> save<00:02:27.750> this<00:02:28.020> and

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
single quotes so we can save this and

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.590 
single quotes so we can save this and
now<00:02:28.350> this<00:02:28.650> is<00:02:28.800> going<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.150> send<00:02:30.150> everything<00:02:30.420> to

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
now this is going to send everything to

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.240 
now this is going to send everything to
the<00:02:30.750> database<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.440> way<00:02:31.530> we<00:02:31.650> need<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:31.950> so<00:02:32.100> let's

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
the database the way we need it so let's

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.320 
the database the way we need it so let's
go<00:02:32.400> ahead<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:32.670> test<00:02:32.819> that

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
go ahead and test that

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:42.710 
go ahead and test that
so<00:02:33.540> really<00:02:33.840> reload<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.470> page<00:02:34.650> here<00:02:41.540> so<00:02:42.540> we'll

email address as the ID that we check
against<00:03:31.760> to<00:03:32.090> get<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.359> data<00:03:33.129> let's<00:03:34.129> go<00:03:34.250> ahead

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
against to get the data let's go ahead

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.509 
against to get the data let's go ahead
and<00:03:34.760> give<00:03:35.120> it<00:03:35.239> some<00:03:35.420> options<00:03:36.250> so<00:03:37.250> if<00:03:37.310> we<00:03:37.400> go

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
and give it some options so if we go

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.000 
and give it some options so if we go
back<00:03:37.670> to<00:03:37.700> data<00:03:37.970> dot<00:03:38.269> PHP<00:03:41.470> we're<00:03:42.470> using<00:03:42.769> the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
back to data dot PHP we're using the

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.830 
back to data dot PHP we're using the
email<00:03:43.159> address<00:03:43.370> because<00:03:44.060> that's<00:03:44.510> how<00:03:44.659> we're

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
email address because that's how we're

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.699 
email address because that's how we're
logging<00:03:45.079> in<00:03:45.409> however<00:03:47.379> let's<00:03:48.379> give<00:03:48.560> it<00:03:48.650> the

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
logging in however let's give it the

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.069 
logging in however let's give it the
option<00:03:49.189> to<00:03:49.280> take<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:49.639> email<00:03:49.879> address<00:03:50.299> or<00:03:50.510> the

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:51.079 
option to take the email address or the

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.710 
option to take the email address or the
ID<00:03:51.290> so<00:03:51.950> one<00:03:52.129> way<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.310> detect<00:03:52.760> that<00:03:53.000> is<00:03:53.239> that

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
ID so one way to detect that is that

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.809 
ID so one way to detect that is that
these<00:03:53.840> two<00:03:53.900> different<00:03:54.470> values<00:03:54.950> are<00:03:55.549> two

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
these two different values are two

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.920 
these two different values are two
different<00:03:56.120> data<00:03:56.299> types<00:03:56.530> ID<00:03:57.530> is<00:03:58.010> an<00:03:58.220> integer

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
different data types ID is an integer

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.129 
different data types ID is an integer
whereas<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.049> email<00:04:00.319> address<00:04:00.560> is<00:04:00.739> a<00:04:00.829> string<00:04:02.139> so

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:03.139 
whereas the email address is a string so

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:05.770 
whereas the email address is a string so
that<00:04:03.170> makes<00:04:03.439> this<00:04:03.530> really<00:04:03.739> easy<00:04:03.859> to<00:04:04.849> decipher

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
that makes this really easy to decipher

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.680 
that makes this really easy to decipher
so<00:04:06.650> let's<00:04:06.769> go<00:04:06.919> ahead<00:04:07.040> and<00:04:07.250> do<00:04:08.150> an<00:04:08.299> if<00:04:08.449> statement

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
so let's go ahead and do an if statement

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:18.060 
so let's go ahead and do an if statement
here<00:04:12.519> let's<00:04:13.519> give<00:04:13.790> ourself<00:04:13.970> some<00:04:14.449> space<00:04:15.049> so<00:04:15.889> if

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
here let's give ourself some space so if

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.649 
here let's give ourself some space so if
we<00:04:19.070> do<00:04:19.190> ID<00:04:19.400> but<00:04:19.820> we're<00:04:19.940> going<00:04:20.060> to<00:04:20.150> wrap<00:04:20.329> this<00:04:20.510> in

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:20.659 
we do ID but we're going to wrap this in

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:24.330 
we do ID but we're going to wrap this in
a<00:04:20.780> function<00:04:21.250> we're<00:04:22.250> going<00:04:22.280> to<00:04:22.430> call<00:04:22.610> it<00:04:22.729> is

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
a function we're going to call it is

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:36.230 
a function we're going to call it is
underscore<00:04:25.720> numeric

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.540 

make<00:04:36.780> sure<00:04:36.960> you<00:04:37.050> have<00:04:37.169> the<00:04:37.350> correct<00:04:38.039> amount<00:04:38.400> of

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
make sure you have the correct amount of

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.580 
make sure you have the correct amount of
parentheses<00:04:39.150> here<00:04:39.300> so<00:04:40.080> we're<00:04:40.229> going<00:04:40.319> to<00:04:40.380> check

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
parentheses here so we're going to check

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.010 
parentheses here so we're going to check
if<00:04:40.889> ID<00:04:41.310> is<00:04:41.610> numeric<00:04:42.210> then<00:04:42.509> we're<00:04:42.630> going<00:04:42.750> to<00:04:42.840> do

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
if ID is numeric then we're going to do

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.200 
if ID is numeric then we're going to do
something<00:04:45.919> so<00:04:46.919> do<00:04:47.099> our<00:04:47.130> curly<00:04:47.580> brackets<00:04:48.000> and

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
something so do our curly brackets and

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.279 
something so do our curly brackets and
what<00:04:49.199> we<00:04:49.289> could<00:04:49.440> do<00:04:50.630> let's<00:04:51.630> go<00:04:51.810> ahead<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:52.110> grab

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
what we could do let's go ahead and grab

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.909 
what we could do let's go ahead and grab
this<00:04:52.560> query<00:04:52.949> here<00:04:54.110> cut<00:04:55.110> that<00:04:55.259> out<00:04:55.319> and<00:04:55.500> paste

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
this query here cut that out and paste

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:02.480 
this query here cut that out and paste
it<00:04:56.099> inside<00:04:56.400> here<00:05:00.800> and<00:05:01.800> we're<00:05:01.919> going<00:05:02.039> to<00:05:02.069> change

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
it inside here and we're going to change

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.939 
it inside here and we're going to change
the<00:05:03.270> where<00:05:03.599> clause<00:05:04.099> from<00:05:05.099> email<00:05:05.550> to<00:05:06.270> ID<00:05:06.800> so<00:05:07.800> if

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
the where clause from email to ID so if

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.800 
the where clause from email to ID so if
it's<00:05:08.099> numeric<00:05:08.639> it's<00:05:08.849> going<00:05:09.000> to<00:05:09.060> be<00:05:09.210> looking

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
it's numeric it's going to be looking

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.990 
it's numeric it's going to be looking
for<00:05:10.110> a<00:05:10.380> numeric<00:05:11.099> value<00:05:11.250> which<00:05:11.580> is<00:05:11.699> going<00:05:11.759> to<00:05:11.849> be

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
for a numeric value which is going to be

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.110 
for a numeric value which is going to be
the<00:05:12.120> ID<00:05:12.270> number<00:05:12.750> instead<00:05:13.440> of<00:05:13.560> the<00:05:13.680> email<00:05:14.120> we

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 
the ID number instead of the email we

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:21.890 
the ID number instead of the email we
can<00:05:15.240> do<00:05:15.330> Pels<00:05:19.940> paste<00:05:20.940> again<00:05:21.120> and<00:05:21.630> we've<00:05:21.750> got

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
can do Pels paste again and we've got

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.900 
can do Pels paste again and we've got
the<00:05:22.080> original<00:05:22.410> one<00:05:22.919> with<00:05:23.130> the<00:05:23.280> email<00:05:23.639> address

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
the original one with the email address

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.150 
the original one with the email address
so<00:05:24.660> Q<00:05:24.930> is<00:05:25.050> only<00:05:25.229> going<00:05:25.440> to<00:05:25.530> equal<00:05:25.830> the

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
so Q is only going to equal the

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:31.670 
so Q is only going to equal the
appropriate<00:05:26.759> query<00:05:27.389> here<00:05:30.110> save<00:05:31.110> that<00:05:31.440> and

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
appropriate query here save that and

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:23.969 
let's go ahead and we'll just take one

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:29.810 
let's go ahead and we'll just take one

of these copy this and paste it here put
it<00:06:29.909> back<00:06:30.060> where<00:06:30.270> it<00:06:30.300> was<00:06:32.330> and<00:06:33.330> instead<00:06:33.539> of<00:06:33.840> Q

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:36.210 
let's go ahead and create a variable

let's go ahead and create a variable
that<00:06:36.599> will<00:06:36.960> call<00:06:37.229> condition<00:06:37.949> or<00:06:38.130> just<00:06:38.610> Co<00:06:38.849> nd

that will call condition or just Co nd
for<00:06:39.780> short

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.270 

and<00:06:46.470> we'll<00:06:46.590> go<00:06:46.650> ahead<00:06:46.770> and<00:06:46.860> take<00:06:46.980> the<00:06:47.100> whole

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
and we'll go ahead and take the whole

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.520 
and we'll go ahead and take the whole
select<00:06:47.700> part<00:06:48.000> out<00:06:48.210> then<00:06:49.020> we'll<00:06:49.139> do<00:06:49.230> the<00:06:49.320> same

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:49.530 
select part out then we'll do the same

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:54.340 
select part out then we'll do the same
down<00:06:49.740> here<00:06:49.800> so<00:06:51.830> see<00:06:52.830> you<00:06:52.889> in<00:06:52.980> d4<00:06:53.610> condition

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:54.350 
down here so see you in d4 condition

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:59.870 
down here so see you in d4 condition
take<00:06:55.350> out<00:06:55.530> the<00:06:55.740> select<00:06:58.310> and<00:06:59.310> we<00:06:59.460> need<00:06:59.610> to<00:06:59.700> do

00:06:59.870 --> 00:06:59.880 
take out the select and we need to do

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:03.170 
take out the select and we need to do
the<00:07:00.000> same<00:07:00.440> down<00:07:01.440> here<00:07:01.500> in<00:07:01.919> the<00:07:02.070> query<00:07:02.669> when<00:07:03.060> you

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
the same down here in the query when you

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.159 
the same down here in the query when you
take<00:07:03.389> out<00:07:03.570> the<00:07:03.750> condition<00:07:04.260> part<00:07:04.530> of<00:07:04.620> it<00:07:06.169> and

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:07.169 
take out the condition part of it and

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:10.580 
take out the condition part of it and
after<00:07:08.300> users<00:07:09.300> select<00:07:09.570> all<00:07:09.840> from<00:07:10.020> users<00:07:10.410> in

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:10.590 
after users select all from users in

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:16.870 
after users select all from users in
space<00:07:11.150> and<00:07:12.150> we'll<00:07:12.270> just<00:07:12.480> stick<00:07:12.690> in<00:07:12.870> CO<00:07:13.770> and<00:07:14.040> D

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.550 

now<00:07:17.880> we<00:07:18.360> could<00:07:18.570> have<00:07:18.690> actually<00:07:19.139> killed<00:07:19.350> the

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 
now we could have actually killed the

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.730 
now we could have actually killed the
redundancies<00:07:20.160> even<00:07:20.430> more<00:07:21.020> by<00:07:22.020> taking<00:07:22.410> out

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:22.740 
redundancies even more by taking out

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:26.240 
redundancies even more by taking out
where<00:07:23.100> and<00:07:24.169> simply<00:07:25.169> placing<00:07:25.530> that<00:07:25.620> down<00:07:25.830> here

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:26.250 
where and simply placing that down here

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:28.159 
where and simply placing that down here
but<00:07:26.940> the<00:07:27.030> reason<00:07:27.300> I<00:07:27.389> did<00:07:27.540> it<00:07:27.660> this<00:07:27.780> way<00:07:27.840> is<00:07:28.139> that

00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:28.169 
but the reason I did it this way is that

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:30.290 
but the reason I did it this way is that
in<00:07:28.560> case<00:07:29.070> for<00:07:29.340> some<00:07:29.400> reason<00:07:29.580> this<00:07:30.120> if

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 
that happening are pretty slim in fact

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:46.580 
that happening are pretty slim in fact
it<00:07:44.820> probably<00:07:44.850> wouldn't<00:07:45.450> happen<00:07:45.630> unless<00:07:45.990> we

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:46.590 
it probably wouldn't happen unless we

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.190 
it probably wouldn't happen unless we

string but I wanted to show you why I
did<00:07:54.690> that<00:07:56.060> so<00:07:57.060> go<00:07:57.240> ahead<00:07:57.300> and<00:07:57.419> save<00:07:57.690> that<00:07:57.720> and
