00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
there and then um right here you turn on

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.840 
there and then um right here you turn on
the<00:00:48.780> light<00:00:49.100> right<00:00:50.100> there's<00:00:50.430> your<00:00:50.460> arm<00:00:50.670> I'll

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the light right there's your arm I'll

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.029 
the light right there's your arm I'll
switch<00:00:53.660> right<00:00:54.660> here<00:00:54.870> this<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.289> how<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.440> like

switch right here this is how you like
there's<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.579> other<00:00:56.699> those<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.600> charging

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
there's the other those of the charging

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.900 
there's the other those of the charging
types<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.410> then<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:59.660> put<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:00.930> and

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.910 
types and then you do this put it on and
it'll<00:01:02.910> blink<00:01:03.180> when<00:01:03.359> it's<00:01:03.510> charging<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.739> then

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
it'll blink when it's charging so then

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.330 
it'll blink when it's charging so then
when<00:01:05.100> it's<00:01:05.220> done<00:01:05.460> it'll<00:01:05.850> shut<00:01:06.150> off<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:07.340> then

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
when it's done it'll shut off and then

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.649 
when it's done it'll shut off and then
I'll<00:01:08.720> do<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:10.250> this<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:12.030> then<00:01:12.150> right<00:01:12.299> here<00:01:12.479> is

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
I'll do that this and then right here is

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.120 
I'll do that this and then right here is
on<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.110> off<00:01:13.229> or<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.280> thrust<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.119> go<00:01:15.299> forward

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
on and off or the thrust to go forward

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.249 
on and off or the thrust to go forward
it<00:01:17.130> tends<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.759> drift<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.540> kind<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.840> turn<00:01:19.049> off<00:01:19.229> a

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
it tends to drift and kind of turn off a

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.929 
it tends to drift and kind of turn off a
little<00:01:19.680> ways<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:20.159> don't<00:01:20.340> know<00:01:20.430> why<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.670> does

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
little ways I don't know why it does
