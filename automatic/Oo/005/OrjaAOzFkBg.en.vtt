foot<00:00:14.849> piece<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.240> rope<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.599> actually<00:00:15.780> bought

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
foot piece of rope I actually bought

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.830 
foot piece of rope I actually bought
this<00:00:16.320> one<00:00:16.529> for<00:00:16.710> $8<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:17.490> little<00:00:18.240> carabiners

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
this one for $8 and little carabiners

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.529 
this one for $8 and little carabiners
for<00:00:19.170> $2<00:00:19.680> then<00:00:20.550> what<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.789> do<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.240> hook<00:00:21.420> it

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
for $2 then what you do is you hook it

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.660 
for $2 then what you do is you hook it
onto<00:00:21.689> your<00:00:21.869> cage<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.439> stretch<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.310> out<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:23.580> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
onto your cage and stretch it out to the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.910 
onto your cage and stretch it out to the
top<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:24.029> your<00:00:24.119> circle<00:00:24.510> what<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.410> does<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.800> it

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
top of your circle what this does is it

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.009 
top of your circle what this does is it
creates<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.340> visual<00:00:26.550> for<00:00:26.970> your<00:00:27.029> goalkeeper<00:00:27.570> to

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
creates a visual for your goalkeeper to

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.209 
creates a visual for your goalkeeper to
see<00:00:28.230> what<00:00:28.470> angle<00:00:28.890> she<00:00:29.160> really<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.580> on<00:00:29.820> so<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:31.219> lot

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
see what angle she really is on so a lot

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.100 
see what angle she really is on so a lot
of<00:00:32.250> goalkeepers<00:00:32.820> when<00:00:32.969> they<00:00:33.090> first<00:00:33.300> start<00:00:33.660> out

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
of goalkeepers when they first start out

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.290 
of goalkeepers when they first start out
stand<00:00:34.649> back<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.100> their<00:00:35.250> line<00:00:35.489> because<00:00:36.120> they're

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
stand back on their line because they're

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.270 
stand back on their line because they're
not<00:00:36.420> sure<00:00:36.600> where<00:00:36.780> else<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.110> stands<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:38.129> when

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
not sure where else the stands so when

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.630 
not sure where else the stands so when
you<00:00:38.399> stand<00:00:38.579> back<00:00:38.820> on<00:00:39.000> your<00:00:39.149> line<00:00:40.460> you<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:41.579> a

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
you stand back on your line you have a

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.720 
you stand back on your line you have a
whole<00:00:41.850> lot<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.090> goal<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.510> cover<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:43.550> still<00:00:44.550> have

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
whole lot of goal to cover I still have

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.310 
whole lot of goal to cover I still have
another<00:00:44.969> six<00:00:45.329> inches<00:00:45.600> before<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:45.960> cover<00:00:46.200> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
another six inches before I cover the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.500 
another six inches before I cover the
whole<00:00:46.469> goal<00:00:46.710> same<00:00:47.579> thing<00:00:47.760> happens<00:00:48.120> when<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.300> try

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
whole goal same thing happens when I try

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.779 
whole goal same thing happens when I try
to<00:00:48.570> go<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> other<00:00:48.930> side<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.579> still<00:00:50.579> have<00:00:50.760> a

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
to go the other side I still have a

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.840 
to go the other side I still have a
little<00:00:50.969> bit<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.270> space<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.510> cover<00:00:52.280> so<00:00:53.280> like<00:00:53.699> I

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
little bit of space to cover so like I

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.150 
little bit of space to cover so like I
said<00:00:54.120> what<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.539> angle<00:00:54.719> does<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:55.829> shows<00:00:55.980> my

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
said what this angle does is it shows my

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.900 
said what this angle does is it shows my
keeper<00:00:56.489> if<00:00:57.230> I<00:00:58.230> step<00:00:58.500> up<00:00:58.620> out<00:00:58.829> of<00:00:59.039> my<00:00:59.070> goal<00:00:59.340> I<00:00:59.579> now

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
keeper if I step up out of my goal I now

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.650 
keeper if I step up out of my goal I now
have<00:01:00.149> less<00:01:00.329> space<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.660> cover<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:02.270> I'm<00:01:03.270> covered

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
have less space to cover and I'm covered

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.170 
have less space to cover and I'm covered
straight<00:01:04.019> through<00:01:04.290> I<00:01:04.549> go<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.610> my<00:01:05.760> left<00:01:05.939> side

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
straight through I go to my left side

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.789 
straight through I go to my left side
and<00:01:06.920> I'm<00:01:07.920> covered<00:01:08.250> straight<00:01:08.580> through<00:01:09.290> so<00:01:10.290> some

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
and I'm covered straight through so some

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.770 
and I'm covered straight through so some
kids<00:01:11.100> think<00:01:11.340> okay<00:01:11.790> well<00:01:11.970> maybe<00:01:12.119> it's<00:01:12.360> okay<00:01:12.659> if

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
kids think okay well maybe it's okay if

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.469 
kids think okay well maybe it's okay if
I<00:01:12.930> move<00:01:13.140> up<00:01:13.260> further<00:01:13.530> well<00:01:14.220> when<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.030> move<00:01:15.299> up

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
I move up further well when I move up

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.980 
I move up further well when I move up
closer<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:16.229> lose<00:01:17.070> reaction<00:01:17.700> speed<00:01:18.000> so<00:01:18.659> yeah

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
closer I lose reaction speed so yeah

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.980 
closer I lose reaction speed so yeah
it's<00:01:19.259> pretty<00:01:19.409> cool<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.920> now<00:01:20.630> it's<00:01:21.630> only<00:01:21.840> a

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
it's pretty cool that now it's only a

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.679 
it's pretty cool that now it's only a
half<00:01:22.170> step<00:01:22.200> away<00:01:22.560> from<00:01:22.680> me<00:01:23.030> but<00:01:24.030> now<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.360> don't

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
half step away from me but now I don't

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.870 
half step away from me but now I don't
have<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:25.080> much<00:01:25.200> time<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.500> react<00:01:25.920> so<00:01:26.610> what<00:01:26.850> I

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
have as much time to react so what I

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.649 
have as much time to react so what I
like<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.150> do<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:28.229> like<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.409> tell<00:01:28.680> my<00:01:28.829> keepers

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
like to do is I like to tell my keepers

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.359 
like to do is I like to tell my keepers
to<00:01:30.659> settle<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.140> between<00:01:31.500> two<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> half<00:01:32.130> to

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
to settle in between two and a half to

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.010 
to settle in between two and a half to
three<00:01:32.400> yards<00:01:32.850> off<00:01:33.030> their<00:01:33.270> line<00:01:35.750> right<00:01:36.750> about

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
three yards off their line right about

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.469 
three yards off their line right about
here<00:01:37.439> from<00:01:37.920> here<00:01:38.250> it's<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.610> nice<00:01:38.820> easy<00:01:39.060> stretch

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
here from here it's a nice easy stretch

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.139 
here from here it's a nice easy stretch
to<00:01:39.720> my<00:01:39.840> right<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:41.210> also<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.299> my<00:01:42.420> left<00:01:43.909> it<00:01:44.909> also

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
to my right and also to my left it also

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.149 
to my right and also to my left it also
gives<00:01:45.479> me<00:01:45.600> ample<00:01:46.020> reaction<00:01:46.500> time<00:01:46.740> from<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
gives me ample reaction time from the

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.480 
gives me ample reaction time from the
top<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.579> circle<00:01:48.680> okay<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:49.740> now<00:01:50.130> let's<00:01:50.340> see

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
top of the circle okay so now let's see

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.639 
top of the circle okay so now let's see
this<00:01:50.610> guy<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:50.970> action<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.780> what<00:01:52.079> we<00:01:52.170> do<00:01:52.290> now<00:01:52.470> is

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
this guy in action so what we do now is

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.370 
this guy in action so what we do now is
we<00:01:52.770> scatter<00:01:53.070> balls<00:01:53.369> throughout<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.880> circle

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
we scatter balls throughout the circle

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.170 
we scatter balls throughout the circle
different<00:01:55.380> angles<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.040> different<00:01:56.549> distances

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
different angles and different distances

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.179 
different angles and different distances
from<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.540> cage<00:01:57.780> cool<00:01:58.500> thing<00:01:58.680> about<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.009> rope

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
from the cage cool thing about the rope

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.889 
from the cage cool thing about the rope
is<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.549> could<00:01:59.700> walk<00:01:59.850> around<00:02:00.000> with<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.299> and<00:02:00.810> you

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
is you could walk around with it and you

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.899 
is you could walk around with it and you
could<00:02:01.049> also<00:02:01.200> tighten<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.770> up<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.189> reflect<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
could also tighten it up to reflect the

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.600 
could also tighten it up to reflect the
closer<00:02:03.180> angle<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:03.860> good<00:02:04.860> drill<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.100> do<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.490> to

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
closer angle so good drill to do is to

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.670 
closer angle so good drill to do is to
get<00:02:05.759> your<00:02:05.880> goalkeepers<00:02:06.479> in<00:02:06.719> line<00:02:07.110> with<00:02:07.320> all<00:02:07.530> of

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
get your goalkeepers in line with all of

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.550 
get your goalkeepers in line with all of
these<00:02:07.799> different<00:02:08.220> balls<00:02:08.399> first<00:02:09.149> one<00:02:09.509> I<00:02:09.750> get

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
these different balls first one I get

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.120 
these different balls first one I get
set<00:02:10.800> here

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
set here

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.630 
set here
unto<00:02:13.120> my<00:02:13.210> right<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.600> covered<00:02:14.010> on<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.340> my<00:02:15.460> left

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
unto my right and covered on to my left

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.670 
unto my right and covered on to my left
and<00:02:15.820> covered<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:16.810> now<00:02:16.990> what<00:02:17.200> now<00:02:17.230> I'm<00:02:17.530> gonna

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
and covered so now what now I'm gonna

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.440 
and covered so now what now I'm gonna
move<00:02:17.860> to<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.070> next<00:02:18.280> ball<00:02:18.520> along<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.910> circle<00:02:19.300> I

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
move to the next ball along the circle I

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.180 
move to the next ball along the circle I
want<00:02:20.050> to<00:02:20.110> get<00:02:20.200> on<00:02:20.290> angle<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.680> this<00:02:20.770> next<00:02:21.010> fall

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
want to get on angle to this next fall

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.730 
want to get on angle to this next fall
so<00:02:21.340> what<00:02:21.490> I<00:02:21.520> do<00:02:21.640> is<00:02:21.850> I<00:02:21.970> move<00:02:22.180> and<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:23.230> get<00:02:23.410> on<00:02:23.560> what

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
so what I do is I move and I get on what

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.250 
so what I do is I move and I get on what
I<00:02:23.860> think<00:02:24.250> is<00:02:24.370> my<00:02:24.520> angle<00:02:24.970> I<00:02:25.150> then<00:02:25.660> halves<00:02:25.930> to

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
I think is my angle I then halves to

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.550 
I think is my angle I then halves to
walk<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:28.120> rope<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:28.870> angle<00:02:29.350> and

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
walk the the rope to that angle and

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.760 
walk the the rope to that angle and
tighten<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.250> rope<00:02:30.730> up<00:02:30.970> around<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.630> ball<00:02:31.810> now

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
tighten the rope up around the ball now

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.070 
tighten the rope up around the ball now
what<00:02:32.980> it<00:02:33.070> looks<00:02:33.250> like<00:02:33.510> looks<00:02:34.510> like<00:02:34.660> I'm<00:02:34.840> on<00:02:34.960> my

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
what it looks like looks like I'm on my

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.650 
what it looks like looks like I'm on my
angle<00:02:35.380> I<00:02:35.530> can<00:02:35.590> come<00:02:35.890> here<00:02:36.190> I<00:02:36.400> have<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.120> covered<00:02:37.450> I

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
angle I can come here I have a covered I

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.010 
angle I can come here I have a covered I
can<00:02:38.110> come<00:02:38.460> here<00:02:39.460> and<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:39.700> have<00:02:39.850> it<00:02:40.000> covered<00:02:40.030> the

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
can come here and I have it covered the

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.660 
can come here and I have it covered the
next<00:02:41.290> Bowl<00:02:41.440> just<00:02:41.680> moves<00:02:41.860> me<00:02:41.980> slightly<00:02:42.340> around

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
next Bowl just moves me slightly around

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.820 
next Bowl just moves me slightly around
the<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:43.360> outside<00:02:43.750> the<00:02:43.840> circle<00:02:44.020> now<00:02:44.620> it's<00:02:44.800> a

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
the the outside the circle now it's a

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.570 
the the outside the circle now it's a
little<00:02:44.950> bit<00:02:45.160> further<00:02:45.370> back<00:02:45.580> so<00:02:47.190> now<00:02:48.190> I<00:02:48.220> want<00:02:48.520> to

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
little bit further back so now I want to

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.060 
little bit further back so now I want to
be<00:02:48.730> here<00:02:49.540> on<00:02:49.660> my<00:02:49.750> angle<00:02:50.110> so<00:02:50.590> I<00:02:50.620> have<00:02:50.800> it<00:02:50.920> covered

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
be here on my angle so I have it covered

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.250 
be here on my angle so I have it covered
here<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.290> I<00:02:53.290> have<00:02:53.470> it<00:02:53.590> covered<00:02:53.910> here<00:02:55.260> another

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
here and I have it covered here another

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.990 
here and I have it covered here another
ball<00:02:56.500> in<00:02:56.620> this<00:02:56.740> left<00:02:56.950> side<00:02:57.160> takes<00:02:57.730> me<00:02:57.880> down

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
ball in this left side takes me down

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.270 
ball in this left side takes me down
lower

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
lower

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.430 
lower
from<00:03:00.280> here<00:03:00.550> it's<00:03:00.670> safe<00:03:00.880> to<00:03:01.060> say<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:02.260> could

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
from here it's safe to say you could

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.140 
from here it's safe to say you could
almost<00:03:02.710> stand<00:03:02.980> on<00:03:03.130> your<00:03:03.250> post<00:03:03.490> and<00:03:03.760> be<00:03:03.880> okay

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
almost stand on your post and be okay

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.290 
almost stand on your post and be okay
with<00:03:04.210> it<00:03:05.010> so<00:03:06.010> now<00:03:06.040> all<00:03:06.520> I<00:03:06.550> really<00:03:06.850> have<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.180> do

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
with it so now all I really have to do

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.330 
with it so now all I really have to do
is<00:03:07.480> cover<00:03:07.690> out<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:08.050> my<00:03:08.140> right<00:03:08.320> side<00:03:08.560> I<00:03:08.830> have

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
is cover out to my right side I have

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.240 
is cover out to my right side I have
this<00:03:09.610> side<00:03:09.850> covered<00:03:10.240> I<00:03:10.830> clear<00:03:11.830> it<00:03:11.920> out<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.130> my

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
this side covered I clear it out to my

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.850 
this side covered I clear it out to my
right<00:03:12.460> no<00:03:12.670> problem
