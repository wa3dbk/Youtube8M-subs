unit<00:00:14.809> a<00:00:15.809> valve<00:00:16.560> which<00:00:17.220> when<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:18.390> put<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:19.080> pit

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
unit a valve which when you put the pit

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.689 
unit a valve which when you put the pit
pit<00:00:19.439> about<00:00:19.800> some<00:00:19.949> potato<00:00:20.220> in<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.550> in<00:00:20.609> this

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
pit about some potato in the in this

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.300 
pit about some potato in the in this
pipe<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.180> snap<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.600> off<00:00:21.830> you<00:00:22.830> fill<00:00:23.039> up<00:00:23.160> with<00:00:23.250> gas

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
pipe a snap it off you fill up with gas

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.400 
pipe a snap it off you fill up with gas
when<00:00:24.060> it's<00:00:24.180> probably<00:00:24.420> guess<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:25.019> turn<00:00:25.230> the

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
when it's probably guess you turn the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.740 
when it's probably guess you turn the
valve<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:26.099> it<00:00:26.130> shuts<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.670> keeps<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> gas<00:00:27.090> in

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
valve so it shuts that keeps the gas in

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.009 
valve so it shuts that keeps the gas in
this<00:00:27.900> cylinder<00:00:28.460> and<00:00:29.460> then<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:30.570> what<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.869> do

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
this cylinder and then you what you do

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.260 
this cylinder and then you what you do
then<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.410> you<00:00:31.470> have<00:00:32.070> a<00:00:32.099> spark<00:00:32.489> plug<00:00:32.550> that's<00:00:33.120> a

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
then is you have a spark plug that's a

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.840 
then is you have a spark plug that's a
to<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> barbecue<00:00:34.079> lighter

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
to a barbecue lighter

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.190 
to a barbecue lighter
there's<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.000> wires<00:00:36.180> for<00:00:36.360> that<00:00:36.510> simple<00:00:36.960> device

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
there's the wires for that simple device

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.619 
there's the wires for that simple device
really<00:00:37.640> so<00:00:38.640> when<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.969> gas<00:00:39.180> inside<00:00:39.570> the

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
really so when the gas inside the

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.680 
really so when the gas inside the
cylinder<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.410> ignited<00:00:41.280> by<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.489> spark<00:00:41.690> and

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
cylinder is ignited by the spark and

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.560 
cylinder is ignited by the spark and
spark<00:00:43.020> plug<00:00:43.260> it's<00:00:44.129> ignites<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.059> gas<00:00:45.210> inside

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
spark plug it's ignites the gas inside

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.760 
spark plug it's ignites the gas inside
the<00:00:45.629> cylinder<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.350> shoots<00:00:46.620> out<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.239> potato

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
the cylinder and shoots out the potato

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.729 
the cylinder and shoots out the potato
I've<00:00:49.770> stuffed<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.160> demonstration<00:00:50.940> for<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.300> now

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
plate I built this last year that's

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.510 
plate I built this last year that's
where<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.600> Hodgins<00:01:22.320> made<00:01:22.799> into<00:01:23.189> for<00:01:23.340> water

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
where the Hodgins made into for water

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.350 
where the Hodgins made into for water
and<00:01:23.850> oxygen

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
and oxygen

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.620 
and oxygen
there's<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.409> primary<00:01:25.830> bubbler<00:01:26.630> sentry

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
there's the primary bubbler sentry

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.719 
there's the primary bubbler sentry
bubbler<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.490> feed<00:01:29.970> into<00:01:30.180> my<00:01:31.310> so<00:01:32.310> yeah

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
bubbler and in that feed into my so yeah

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.690 
bubbler and in that feed into my so yeah
plug<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.210> into<00:01:33.329> your<00:01:33.509> run<00:01:33.750> into<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.380> device

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
plug it into your run into the device

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.969 
plug it into your run into the device
make<00:01:35.700> sure<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:36.000> valve<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.390> open<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.770> that's

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
make sure the valve is open so that's

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.340 
make sure the valve is open so that's
the<00:01:38.070> gas<00:01:38.250> flow<00:01:38.490> through<00:01:38.930> turn<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> hydrogen

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
the gas flow through turn the hydrogen

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.789 
the gas flow through turn the hydrogen
on<00:01:41.509> so<00:01:42.509> now<00:01:42.630> it's<00:01:42.810> making<00:01:42.930> hydrogen<00:01:43.439> now<00:01:43.560> let's

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
on so now it's making hydrogen now let's

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:53.060 
on so now it's making hydrogen now let's
go<00:01:43.920> up<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.100> little<00:01:44.220> bit<00:01:45.799> yes<00:01:47.630> it's<00:01:50.450> alright<00:01:52.070> so

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
go up a little bit yes it's alright so

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.880 
go up a little bit yes it's alright so
that's<00:01:53.250> now<00:01:54.619> filling<00:01:56.810> I'll<00:01:57.810> turn<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.259> valve

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
that's now filling I'll turn the valve

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.959 
that's now filling I'll turn the valve
off<00:01:59.070> now<00:01:59.780> turn<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.869> halogen<00:02:01.200> off<00:02:01.790> I'm<00:02:02.790> gonna

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
off now turn the halogen off I'm gonna

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.080 
off now turn the halogen off I'm gonna
plug<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:04.140> now<00:02:04.259> that's<00:02:04.590> got<00:02:04.950> hydrogen<00:02:05.790> gas

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
plug that so now that's got hydrogen gas

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.800 
plug that so now that's got hydrogen gas
in<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:06.990> tube<00:02:07.259> look<00:02:07.950> outside<00:02:08.220> Alfie
