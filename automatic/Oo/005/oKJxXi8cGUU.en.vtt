00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.893
Welcome!

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.320
You're going to order two Bo Bun

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.360
And I'll have to cook the same

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.000
Here, with fresh ingredients

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.360
before the deliveryman arrives

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:10.740
I hope you already cooked a Bo Bun in your life!

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.840
No, never!

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:12.174
It's a first!

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.260
It is indeed!

00:00:13.413 --> 00:00:14.413
You put pressure on her!

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.780
I know a good restaurant!

00:00:21.027 --> 00:00:22.027
Do you want order while singing?

00:00:22.273 --> 00:00:23.273
No, please

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.920
A boooo buuuun 

00:00:28.708 --> 00:00:29.708
When I say "Bo"

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:30.769
You say "Bun"

00:00:30.835 --> 00:00:31.835
-Bo -Bun

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:32.879
-Bo -Bun

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.240
And then, the guy hang up

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.980
Hello, we would like to order

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.960
two beef Bo Bun

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.120
15,80 euros in 30-40 minutes maximum

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.320
Good luck thank you!

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.400
Let's go!

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.620
I put soy sauce, honey and chili

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.540
I'm gonna quickly marinate the beef in it

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.920
before searing it on the pan

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.860
I'm making raw and cooked vegetables

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.600
rice vermicelli and spring rolls

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.580
I'm choping a onion

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.620
I'll cook the onions and then I'll sear the marinated beef

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.980
Now, I'm cooking my beef and my rice noodles

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.620
Then I'll do spring rolls with vegetables

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.420
Veggie spring rolls

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.760
And that's all

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.780
For the marinade I put chili, ginger and soy sauce

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.280
It's fresh ginger

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.000
I'm chopping it to put it on the marinade

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.640
I love the lemon-flavor of the fresh ginger

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.840
One part of the vegetables will be cooked

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.720
And one part raw

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.120
I'm just searing the beef very quickly

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.560
I can clean this pan

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.380
I don't want the meat to be cooked

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.320
I want it a little roasted

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.680
I'm going to prepare the vegetables now

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.880
So what are you doing now?

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.800
I cooked the beef and the rice noodles

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.800
I'm chopping the veggies

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.700
I'm using only the cucumber's flesh, not the middle

00:02:18.995 --> 00:02:19.995
because it's hard to digest

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.160
I do the same

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.920
It's full of water

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.720
It smells very good

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:25.759
Have you ever made a Bo bun?

00:02:26.057 --> 00:02:27.057
-No never -Never!

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.260
I love this dish but I've never....

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.260
I'm very traditional when I cook

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.340
- I have to admitt, I didn't know this dish -Really?

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.300
Is there some moments when you feel stressed or anxious?

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.060
I'm not really a stressed girl

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.860
It's very rare for a chef!

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.400
I do not work better when I'm stressed

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.140
It's not always a contest

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.720
Here, there is a challenge

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.060
In the real life, it's not Top Chef everyday!

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.160
I'm gonna make the spring rolls

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.280
I really want to see how you'll made them

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.840
The issue is the folding

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.880
So it's a cooked spring roll?

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.540
Yes it's the same but it's fried

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.180
I make a lot of spring roll at home

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:08.120
There is the fried ones and the raw ones

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.180
I marinated the rice noodles with chili and soy sauce

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.840
So for the spring rolls, you take your rice paper

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.100
It's made with rice flour

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.400
I'm putting rice noodles and veggie in it

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.940
Soya, cucumber

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.100
You don't add schrimps or avocado?

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:29.919
We can

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.080
How much times do I have left?

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.004
I think you have 15 minutes left

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:33.180
Okay, fine

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.780
Let me remind you that the guy said "45 minutes" while laughing

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.320
he was almost contemptuous

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.440
He was showing off!

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.500
I'm the one who cook the less, I think

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.400
No, I made a wok once...

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.860
Tell us how you ruin your pasta

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.660
I burnt the entire pan

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.320
It's hard to cook really good pasta

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.880
I know how to make pasta with ham and cheese

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.860
There it is

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.140
It's over

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.360
You really missed this one

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.740
They were fast

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.700
It took them 20 minutes, it was quick

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.900
Too bad, I'll just finish the presentation

00:04:25.614 --> 00:04:26.614
It was very quick!

00:04:26.929 --> 00:04:27.929
Compared to...

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.900
They are a little tigh on the sauce

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.920
-What is it? -The spring rolls

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.700
Did you ever miss a challenge?

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.940
No, it never happened

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.857
What a show-off

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.137
I'm a little disapointed !

00:04:39.137 --> 00:04:40.114

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.660
It's the first time you're late?!

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.240
My performance was bad!

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.340
It's easier for them, they microwaved it

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.640
You cooked everything!

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.140
Indeed!

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.660
It's not frozen food!

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.780
Is it the first time he arrives this quick?

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.100
Generally, it tooks a 1000 years!

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.420
The last episode we waited one hour

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.440
It's the real problem of this show!

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.040
And you were finished way before

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.380
It has been one hour!

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.140
Un poco de salsa !

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.640
some soya

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.720
Spring roll sauce

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.080
some ginger

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.540
It's going to be hot at Labatut's tonight

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.200
Ouuuuh yeah!

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.700
- So you added what? - Mint and cilantro

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.260
You win for the presentation!

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.500
Then the taste...

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.600
Let's mix it

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.740
Ha, its... It's...

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.060
It has been all day in the window display

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:33.780
It's a little dry

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.560
It does not cost too much to cook a Bo Bun

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.260
Because it's mostly vegetables and rice noodle

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.920
Around.. Around 3 or 4 euros one bo bun

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.160
3-4 euros??

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.480
Yes with the spring rolls and all

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.360
4 times cheaper than what we ordered

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.840
I think we can start!

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.340
First, spring rolls

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.380
It's cold!

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.020
It's not bad it's just flabby

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.240
However, we can taste the fat

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:00.580
Fat is tasty!

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.820
It's cold, not very tasty

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.580
I want to try

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.700
Your turn!

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.120
There is not enough dressing but it's not bad

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.100
Let's taste your...

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.080
It's not fried spring rolls, only spring rolls

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.560
It's "fring rolls" !

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.360
It's spring rolls!

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.360
Too much spices for me

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.901
I love it 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.600
I love exactly the way you spiced it

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.640
The advantage is that you know what's inside!

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.220
because with those products, the ingredients origin's is suspicious

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.140
All of this is rice paper

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.600
Here, there is a real taste

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.200
Yes it's fresh

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.420
It's your sauce...

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.140
The marinade?

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.500
The marinade, the famous!

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.360
It's really really good

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.040
Those two things are very good

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:48.100
And those one, you can feel there are not very fresh...

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.120
The spring rolls are cold and flabby, it has not been mixed...

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.200
The deliveryman arrives after 20 minutes, but you win

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.360
the taste was way better

00:06:57.369 --> 00:06:58.369
It's nice!

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.320
I have to admit, I only cook pasta

00:07:07.414 --> 00:07:08.414
Like Juliette

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:09.729
We are the pasta crew

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.940
Pasta will be a good challenge

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:13.280
Fresh pasta it can be cool

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.680
Next time i'll cook homemade pasta

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.680
Deal? Deal for the pasta!

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.460
Long live the pasta shells!

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:30.180
Give your opinion by clicking on your favorite Bo Bun !

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:35.860
"fly me to the moooon"

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.100
Hello we would like to order

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.680
We do not deliver in your area

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.880
There it is!

00:07:43.994 --> 00:07:44.994
Good job

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.260
You look like hell and you're happy!
