00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.930
One of the most important questions that we
get asked about hair transplants all the time

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:11.270
is, "What technique should I use?"

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:16.670
FUT, which is the strip method, or FUE, which
is when individual hair follicles are taken

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:19.190
from the back of the head one at a time.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:25.050
Well, the answer to that question depends
on what you're looking for and what your desires

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.630
are, goals, expectations, and what your fears
may be.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.320
For example, the strip method, which is still
the gold standard today, is where we take

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.980
a strip of tissue out of the back of the head
and we remove that tissue, hand that off to

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.270
our skilled technicians who under a microscope
divide it into follicular units - one, two,

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.940
three, and four haired grafts.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.170
And then the doctor will suture that area
up.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.829
The hair falls back over that area, and you
really can't identify anything.

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.350
However, if you were to try to shave your
head, you would see a line, so you would have

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.820
a linear scar.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.220
For patients who don't want the linear scar
whatsoever, the technique of FUE, or removing

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.510
them one at a time, is the best method for
that.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.710
However, this method is much more time consuming
for the physician because the surgeon has

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.860
to remove those follicles one at a time themselves.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.580
So in other words, it can take two, three,
four, or even five, six hours to harvest the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.189
necessary grafts that are going to be transplanted
into the head.

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:30.020
This takes away some of the focus with regard
to the physician on concentrating on the recipient

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.290
area or where we're going to transplant the
hairs.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.180
In conclusion, the FUE procedure is best for
patients who want to keep their hair really,

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.180
really short or want the option to shave their
hair.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.850
It's generally done for smaller sessions,
or if there's a large session that needs to

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.180
be done, it's going to be done over two days
because, again, it's more time consuming for

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.710
the harvesting process.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.579
If you to want to do a large session and get
the most number of grafts in the quickest

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.720
time period while the grafts are cut under
a microscope so we get complete visualization

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.360
of those grafts in the time tested technique,
that's the strip method.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.100
And that's the best method to harvest the
most amount of grafts in the shortest amount

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.310
of time so that the physician can focus on
the recipient site in creating the most natural

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.560
look possible.
