00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
hiding it from way above I was easily

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.380 
hiding it from way above I was easily
able<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.180> see<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:39.689> then<00:01:40.170> go

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
able to see it and then go
