00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.809
 hello guys from youtube to your pool and in 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.910
 Today video with you can already see 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.549
 by the title of the video is another module 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.609
 can gta san andreas is a way of 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.250
 civics it will add in cgt to mini 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:24.779
 gta5 map you can see through the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:28.019
 images as well as the exchange of weapons in a 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.019
 style gta 4 because this mole does not have on 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.530
 gta style 5 the exchange of arms I do not 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.149
 I know if it was already in the 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.149
 can not install just a mini map 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.760
 unfortunately gta5 alone does not have to 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.640
 be there both but the way is very good 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.160
 I tested it like I always do in everyone. 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.469
 the ways I bring here to the channel 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.160
 I tested it, it's okay, it does not have 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:57.390
 no error and does not lock the gta or anything 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.850
 the way is not heavy but as I always say 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.399
 throughout the video make a copy of the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.559
 gta files before installation 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.290
 therefore always makes a cover for 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.060
 avoid problems that before showing the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.220
 you set it up this way it does not 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.000
 said something that is important then 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.479
 pay close attention to these molds or 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.090
 in original gta and it is not me who is 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.100
 talking is the author of the template itself 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.380
 There are several websites on the internet. 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.119
 look for it 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.700
 This is also something I can do. 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.280
 control or you can control 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.400
 change is from the paper around the mobi and 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.880
 I researched a lot about it and found it 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.850
 several websites saying that some 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.399
 pirates work some not in 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.520
 some work normally is like 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.320
 It was one day in some original you will 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.130
 show up if I'm going to show you 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.740
 now 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.310
 so if you do not show up this 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.140
 error 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.960
 You already know why it is 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.790
 This is happening, I can not change 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.009
 This I have nothing to do with this. 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.520
 I'm saying this because I know the 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.710
 The vast majority of you have pirate gta 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.289
 then it does not work does not reach me and 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.730
 commentators I 'm not to blame is for 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.750
 these and other people that I always 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.080
 I say that you 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.540
 gta in this same also cheap do not know 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.550
 to download the digital media is 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.920
 much cheaper than physics 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.930
 the plan you will have no more this 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.850
 All disorder is okay 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.130
 and this is not the only way it happens 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.680
 this other monis also happens 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.150
 unfortunately and be totally out of the 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.290
 my control I can not do anything in 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.400
 relation to this 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.950
 What I can do what I am 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.700
 doing now warning you are some 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.720
 of you who is pirate the gta in case it goes 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.720
 to function 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.450
 others did not appear this error that is 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.550
 on the screen you already know that it's okay that is the 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.350
 Your gta, then unfortunately I can not. 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.270
 do nothing about it 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.860
 so now I'm going back in the area 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.230
 and I'll show you the 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.489
 So that's how it goes. 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.200
 there folks now we go to the installation 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.959
 as I will always leave in the description of the 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.540
 video the link for you to download on a 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.239
 mold and will also leave a according to 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.250
 ic that is a folder that we from my blog 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.810
 it is in the strange that a page that 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.150
 contains the files that we will 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.970
 also need to install How 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.980
 it works normally then it's usually so 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.799
 you will download this part MOBI.E 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.900
 these files the link of the two will 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.850
 be in the description of the first video 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.130
 we will install the folder of the files that 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:36.310
 I told you that it 's the second link. 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.799

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.350
 locate as always as you already 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.110
 are so accustomed to seeing here in the 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.140
 channels in the channel videos from the 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.400
 your gps year is that initial match 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:02.260

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.540
 of gta and how do people talk about this folder? 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.140

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:26.380

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.639

 shine folder does not close this way 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.400
 part of gta san andreas is leaving 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.409

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.810

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:40.029
 name and arrived at the module port will have 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.110
 two folders for multiplayer and for 

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:43.180

 example of the single player folder and 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:55.240
 multiplayer setup is the same thing 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.699
 what I will do now the same thing 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.370
 do not change anything do the same thing 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:03.009

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:12.550
 part of the single player with the ps 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:15.789
 files control a control c in back 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.259

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:21.189

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:26.830
 installation staff is just that you 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:29.409

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:33.250

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.889
 I'll also leave it in the video description 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:39.009
 for you to download in also in that same 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.569

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:47.649
 single player and multiplayer does not have to 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.610
 being one or the other you will have to 

00:05:47.649 --> 00:05:50.589
 to choose 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.539
 unfortunately I can not change having the 

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:54.159
 author of the world and so you will have 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:56.669
 you choose or single player or 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:56.669
 multiplayer 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.650
 I just finished gta san andreas 

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:06.729

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:09.550
 normally running template gta

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.169
 nothing of the kind and you may already notice 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:16.990
 a mini map of gps 5 is already 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:20.530
 working without any problem and the exchange 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.930
 of weapons is already as in gta 4 as 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:26.289

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:27.699
 gt map is in style then so is 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:30.789
