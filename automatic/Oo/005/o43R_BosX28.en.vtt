most<00:00:04.340> important<00:00:04.910> things<00:00:05.150> remember<00:00:05.720> grip<00:00:06.230> and

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:06.529 
most important things remember grip and

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.700 
most important things remember grip and
backswing<00:00:07.780> I'm<00:00:08.780> amazed<00:00:09.290> at<00:00:09.530> how<00:00:09.590> little

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
backswing I'm amazed at how little

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.730 
backswing I'm amazed at how little
attention<00:00:10.160> is<00:00:10.760> given<00:00:10.910> to<00:00:11.240> the<00:00:11.330> grip<00:00:11.599> but<00:00:12.559> there

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:12.740 
attention is given to the grip but there

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.100 
attention is given to the grip but there
are<00:00:12.799> certain<00:00:13.190> grips<00:00:13.490> that<00:00:14.150> make<00:00:14.360> it<00:00:14.509> very<00:00:14.719> easy

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:15.110 
are certain grips that make it very easy

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.560 
are certain grips that make it very easy
to<00:00:15.289> be<00:00:15.499> vertical<00:00:15.740> at<00:00:16.070> contact<00:00:16.610> and<00:00:16.880> some<00:00:17.420> that

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
to be vertical at contact and some that

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.070 
to be vertical at contact and some that
make<00:00:17.720> it<00:00:17.840> very<00:00:17.870> difficult<00:00:18.680> and<00:00:18.800> remember<00:00:19.730> in

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 
make it very difficult and remember in

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.120 
make it very difficult and remember in
ninety<00:00:21.080> percent<00:00:21.260> of<00:00:21.500> your<00:00:21.620> shots<00:00:21.860> in<00:00:22.040> this

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:22.130 
ninety percent of your shots in this

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.920 
ninety percent of your shots in this
game<00:00:22.250> you<00:00:22.580> want<00:00:22.790> the<00:00:22.910> racket<00:00:23.120> vertical<00:00:23.840> when

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
game you want the racket vertical when

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.640 
game you want the racket vertical when
you<00:00:24.020> hit<00:00:24.170> the<00:00:24.290> ball<00:00:24.470> as<00:00:25.540> an<00:00:26.540> example<00:00:26.900> if<00:00:27.410> you

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
you hit the ball as an example if you

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.920 
you hit the ball as an example if you
are<00:00:27.740> holding<00:00:27.920> a<00:00:28.130> continental<00:00:28.730> grip<00:00:28.760> with<00:00:29.660> the

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
are holding a continental grip with the

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.510 
are holding a continental grip with the
index<00:00:30.440> knuckle<00:00:30.860> on<00:00:31.010> number<00:00:31.940> two<00:00:33.399> when<00:00:34.399> you

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
index knuckle on number two when you

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.160 
index knuckle on number two when you
bring<00:00:34.700> the<00:00:34.850> racket<00:00:35.180> back<00:00:35.210> you'll<00:00:35.719> notice<00:00:35.899> the

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
bring the racket back you'll notice the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.770 
bring the racket back you'll notice the
racket<00:00:36.499> looks<00:00:36.679> nice<00:00:36.920> and<00:00:37.129> vertical<00:00:37.309> here<00:00:37.879> but

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
racket looks nice and vertical here but

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.169 
racket looks nice and vertical here but
as<00:00:38.929> you<00:00:39.140> swing<00:00:39.499> up<00:00:39.739> to<00:00:39.769> hit<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:40.280> ball<00:00:40.489> the

00:00:41.169 --> 00:00:41.179 
as you swing up to hit the ball the

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:43.270 
as you swing up to hit the ball the
racket<00:00:41.570> is<00:00:41.659> naturally<00:00:42.140> open<00:00:42.530> so<00:00:43.129> this

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
racket is naturally open so this

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.630 
racket is naturally open so this
requires<00:00:43.789> a<00:00:43.940> forearm<00:00:44.390> and<00:00:44.809> a<00:00:45.109> wrist<00:00:45.409> roll<00:00:45.710> but

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
requires a forearm and a wrist roll but

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.660 
requires a forearm and a wrist roll but
this<00:00:46.820> is<00:00:46.999> a<00:00:47.030> millisecond<00:00:47.989> happening<00:00:48.440> here<00:00:48.710> so

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
this is a millisecond happening here so

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.549 
this is a millisecond happening here so
if<00:00:49.940> your<00:00:50.089> timing<00:00:50.539> is<00:00:50.600> not<00:00:50.809> perfect<00:00:51.409> for

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559

00:00:53.369 --> 00:00:53.379 
instance if you're swinging up and

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.719 
instance if you're swinging up and
you're<00:00:54.379> open<00:00:54.769> the<00:00:54.920> ball<00:00:55.100> is<00:00:55.249> hitting<00:00:55.399> the<00:00:55.579> back

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:55.729 
you're open the ball is hitting the back

you're open the ball is hitting the back
fence<00:00:56.059> if<00:00:56.659> you<00:00:56.809> swing<00:00:57.109> too<00:00:57.350> early<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:58.010> ball

okay<00:01:04.430> you<00:01:04.489> keep<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:04.940> ball<00:01:05.089> on<00:01:05.120> the<00:01:05.300> court<00:01:05.570> and

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
okay you keep the ball on the court and

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.139 
okay you keep the ball on the court and
then<00:01:06.770> you're<00:01:06.920> thinking<00:01:06.950> see<00:01:07.520> all<00:01:07.759> I<00:01:07.790> need<00:01:08.030> is

00:01:08.139 --> 00:01:08.149 
then you're thinking see all I need is

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.139 
then you're thinking see all I need is
more<00:01:08.329> practice<00:01:08.930> wrong<00:01:09.770> you<00:01:10.430> really<00:01:10.820> need<00:01:11.030> to

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
more practice wrong you really need to

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.060 
more practice wrong you really need to
get<00:01:11.299> rid<00:01:11.479> of<00:01:11.509> this<00:01:11.659> roll<00:01:11.960> because<00:01:12.619> you<00:01:12.890> can

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
get rid of this roll because you can

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.030 
get rid of this roll because you can
practice<00:01:13.640> from<00:01:13.850> now<00:01:14.090> until<00:01:14.750> forever<00:01:15.259> and<00:01:15.770> it's

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
practice from now until forever and it's

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.039 
practice from now until forever and it's
gonna<00:01:16.159> be<00:01:16.369> very<00:01:16.670> difficult<00:01:16.969> to<00:01:17.360> do<00:01:17.659> this<00:01:17.810> on<00:01:18.020> a

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
gonna be very difficult to do this on a

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:19.270 
gonna be very difficult to do this on a
consistent<00:01:18.320> base

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
consistent base

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.149 
consistent base
beyond<00:01:20.149> the<00:01:20.329> baseline<00:01:20.840> it's<00:01:21.439> usually<00:01:21.770> because

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
beyond the baseline it's usually because

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.029 
beyond the baseline it's usually because
the<00:01:22.610> racket<00:01:23.000> is<00:01:23.180> tilted<00:01:23.869> or<00:01:23.990> laid<00:01:24.439> back<00:01:24.799> at

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
the racket is tilted or laid back at

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.139 
the racket is tilted or laid back at
contact<00:01:25.700> other<00:01:26.000> than<00:01:26.930> slice<00:01:27.380> shots<00:01:27.799> on<00:01:28.149> 90

contact with the ball usually players

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.950 
contact with the ball usually players
make<00:01:36.649> the<00:01:36.799> mistake<00:01:37.189> of<00:01:37.219> being<00:01:37.609> open<00:01:38.210> on<00:01:38.359> the
