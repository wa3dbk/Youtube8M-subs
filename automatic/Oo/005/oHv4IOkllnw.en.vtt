00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
in the greens today you know I think we

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.680

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
together I think we have a similar

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.840 
together I think we have a similar
approach<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:15.650> to<00:00:16.650> just<00:00:16.859> seein<00:00:17.070> lines<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.699> so

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
approach to to just seein lines and so
