and look at the size of this transfer
case<00:01:07.960> I<00:01:08.140> mean<00:01:08.320> this<00:01:08.439> is<00:01:08.680> enormous

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
case I mean this is enormous

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.590 
case I mean this is enormous
really<00:01:10.720> heavy-duty<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:12.570> front-wheel<00:01:13.570> drive

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
really heavy-duty the front-wheel drive

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.539 
really heavy-duty the front-wheel drive
here<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:16.710> universal<00:01:17.710> joint<00:01:17.950> they're<00:01:18.189> going

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
here the universal joint they're going

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.999 
here the universal joint they're going
forward<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.600> the<00:01:19.810> sizing<00:01:20.289> the<00:01:20.380> drive<00:01:20.679> shaft

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
forward to the sizing the drive shaft

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:22.889 
forward to the sizing the drive shaft
here<00:01:21.340> it's<00:01:21.520> a<00:01:21.640> bigger<00:01:21.850> drive<00:01:22.270> shaft<00:01:22.600> bigger

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
here it's a bigger drive shaft bigger

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.499 
here it's a bigger drive shaft bigger
bearings<00:01:23.640> there<00:01:24.640> really<00:01:24.880> did<00:01:25.149> a<00:01:25.210> nice<00:01:25.450> job

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
bearings there really did a nice job

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.190 
bearings there really did a nice job
setting<00:01:26.289> this<00:01:26.409> all<00:01:26.619> up<00:01:27.270> we've<00:01:28.270> also<00:01:28.600> sent<00:01:29.020> this

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
setting this all up we've also sent this

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.260 
setting this all up we've also sent this
out<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:29.560> had<00:01:29.740> a<00:01:29.770> stretch<00:01:30.249> so<00:01:30.700> you<00:01:30.729> can<00:01:30.999> see

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
out and had a stretch so you can see

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.319 
out and had a stretch so you can see
here<00:01:31.509> this<00:01:31.689> is<00:01:31.749> going<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.079> be<00:01:32.170> a<00:01:32.200> model<00:01:33.329> 25:52

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:34.329 
here this is going to be a model 25:52

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.709 
here this is going to be a model 25:52
so<00:01:35.079> we<00:01:35.289> lengthen<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:36.219> wheelbase<00:01:36.609> on<00:01:36.909> it<00:01:37.060> and

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
so we lengthen the wheelbase on it and

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:40.080 
so we lengthen the wheelbase on it and
you<00:01:37.810> can<00:01:37.990> see<00:01:38.200> the<00:01:38.320> welding<00:01:38.740> on<00:01:38.920> here<00:01:39.219> it<00:01:39.700> is

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
you can see the welding on here it is

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.660 
you can see the welding on here it is
welded<00:01:40.390> here<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:41.049> it<00:01:41.170> has<00:01:41.320> a<00:01:41.350> splice<00:01:41.770> plate<00:01:42.009> on

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
welded here and it has a splice plate on

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.969 
welded here and it has a splice plate on
there<00:01:42.999> so<00:01:43.149> that's<00:01:43.359> just<00:01:43.659> as<00:01:43.810> strong<00:01:44.140> if<00:01:44.829> not

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
there so that's just as strong if not

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.499 
there so that's just as strong if not
stronger<00:01:45.460> than<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.939> original<00:01:46.200> chassis<00:01:47.200> frame

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
stronger than the original chassis frame

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.090 
stronger than the original chassis frame
now<00:01:49.509> on<00:01:49.659> the<00:01:49.780> back<00:01:49.960> end<00:01:50.259> here<00:01:50.439> you<00:01:50.499> can<00:01:50.770> see<00:01:50.979> the

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
now on the back end here you can see the

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.090 
now on the back end here you can see the
tires<00:01:51.429> we<00:01:51.909> have<00:01:52.380> they've<00:01:53.380> switched<00:01:53.679> out<00:01:53.950> the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
tires we have they've switched out the

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.289 
tires we have they've switched out the
tires<00:01:54.340> from<00:01:54.549> the<00:01:54.759> Michelin's

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299

the<00:01:55.899> BF<00:01:56.229> Goodrich<00:01:56.770> this<00:01:57.490> is<00:01:57.670> a<00:01:57.759> rugged<00:01:57.999> terrain

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
the BF Goodrich this is a rugged terrain

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.929 
the BF Goodrich this is a rugged terrain
tire<00:01:58.719> which<00:01:59.710> has<00:01:59.889> a<00:01:59.920> more<00:02:00.189> aggressive<00:02:00.280> tread

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
tire which has a more aggressive tread

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.419 
tire which has a more aggressive tread
but<00:02:01.929> still<00:02:02.170> it's<00:02:02.350> gonna<00:02:02.530> be<00:02:02.710> quiet<00:02:03.039> on<00:02:03.280> the

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
but still it's gonna be quiet on the

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.129 
but still it's gonna be quiet on the
road<00:02:03.579> we<00:02:03.909> don't<00:02:04.329> want<00:02:04.509> something<00:02:04.810> that's

00:02:05.129 --> 00:02:05.139 
road we don't want something that's

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:07.499 
road we don't want something that's
gonna<00:02:05.319> be<00:02:05.560> real<00:02:05.859> noisy<00:02:06.429> so<00:02:06.969> we<00:02:07.060> still<00:02:07.299> wanted

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
gonna be real noisy so we still wanted

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.690 
gonna be real noisy so we still wanted
to<00:02:07.569> be<00:02:07.689> a<00:02:07.719> luxury<00:02:08.170> motor<00:02:08.380> homes<00:02:08.679> it's<00:02:09.220> just<00:02:09.520> a

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
to be a luxury motor homes it's just a

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.400 
to be a luxury motor homes it's just a
lot<00:02:09.880> more<00:02:09.910> rugged<00:02:10.600> and

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
lot more rugged and

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.950 
lot more rugged and
good<00:02:11.560> for<00:02:11.770> offroad<00:02:12.190> also<00:02:12.670> on<00:02:13.630> the<00:02:13.780> backend

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
good for offroad also on the backend

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.650 
good for offroad also on the backend
also<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.800> may<00:02:15.400> be<00:02:15.460> hard<00:02:15.850> to<00:02:15.910> see<00:02:16.000> but<00:02:16.420> we<00:02:16.510> do

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
also it may be hard to see but we do

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.260 
also it may be hard to see but we do
have<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.840> bigger<00:02:17.230> heavier<00:02:18.130> duty<00:02:18.670> stabilizer

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
have a bigger heavier duty stabilizer

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.050 
have a bigger heavier duty stabilizer
bar<00:02:19.600> down<00:02:19.840> here

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
bar down here

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.080 
bar down here
that's<00:02:22.060> been<00:02:22.300> added<00:02:22.540> for<00:02:23.440> more<00:02:23.650> stability<00:02:27.090> the

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
that's been added for more stability the

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.060 
that's been added for more stability the
hair<00:02:28.300> at<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.510> front<00:02:28.750> end<00:02:28.990> you<00:02:29.170> have<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.410> locking

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
hair at the front end you have a locking

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.000 
hair at the front end you have a locking
differential<00:02:30.820> so<00:02:31.750> you<00:02:31.870> just<00:02:32.080> turn<00:02:32.320> the<00:02:32.470> hub<00:02:32.680> to

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
differential so you just turn the hub to

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.480 
differential so you just turn the hub to
the<00:02:33.760> locking<00:02:34.240> position<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:35.160> then<00:02:36.160> you<00:02:36.310> go

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:36.490 
the locking position and then you go

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:38.400 
the locking position and then you go
inside<00:02:36.670> and<00:02:37.150> I'll<00:02:37.210> show<00:02:37.240> you<00:02:37.480> where<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.900> this

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
inside and I'll show you where the this

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.320 
inside and I'll show you where the this
gear<00:02:39.070> selector<00:02:39.580> is<00:02:39.700> in<00:02:39.880> there<00:02:40.090> for<00:02:40.270> the

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
gear selector is in there for the

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.930 
gear selector is in there for the
transfer<00:02:40.780> case<00:02:41.020> also<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.220> wanted<00:02:42.490> to<00:02:42.580> point<00:02:42.730> out

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
transfer case also I wanted to point out

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.240 
transfer case also I wanted to point out
this<00:02:43.120> extra<00:02:43.750> heavy-duty<00:02:44.290> steering<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:45.130> these

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
this extra heavy-duty steering and these

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.270 
this extra heavy-duty steering and these
stabilizers<00:02:45.820> under<00:02:46.480> here<00:02:46.800> so<00:02:47.800> that's<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.100> lot

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
stabilizers under here so that's a lot

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.570 
stabilizers under here so that's a lot
more<00:02:48.490> rugged<00:02:49.500> then<00:02:50.500> you'll<00:02:50.830> see<00:02:51.070> on<00:02:51.370> the

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
more rugged then you'll see on the

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.970 
more rugged then you'll see on the
regular<00:02:51.940> two<00:02:52.150> Walter<00:02:52.510> I<00:02:52.570> can<00:02:52.930> see<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:53.770> from

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
regular two Walter I can see and from

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.950 
regular two Walter I can see and from
the<00:02:54.130> inside<00:02:54.550> after<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:54.970> lock<00:02:55.180> that<00:02:55.210> hub<00:02:55.720> into

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
the inside after you lock that hub into

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.480 
the inside after you lock that hub into
the<00:02:56.470> wheel<00:02:56.700> then<00:02:57.700> you<00:02:57.850> just<00:02:58.030> come<00:02:58.240> around<00:02:58.390> and

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
the wheel then you just come around and

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:02.070 
the wheel then you just come around and
just<00:03:00.490> pull<00:03:00.760> this<00:03:00.910> from<00:03:01.150> two<00:03:01.360> high<00:03:01.570> to<00:03:01.630> four

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
just pull this from two high to four

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.830 
just pull this from two high to four
high<00:03:02.260> and<00:03:02.850> then<00:03:03.850> there's<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.150> neutral<00:03:04.600> switch

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
high and then there's a neutral switch

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.680 
high and then there's a neutral switch
and<00:03:05.080> also<00:03:05.230> for<00:03:05.830> law<00:03:06.100> with<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:06.430> formol<00:03:06.940> it's

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
and also for law with the formol it's

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.000 
and also for law with the formol it's
going<00:03:07.900> to<00:03:07.960> be<00:03:08.080> really<00:03:08.320> great<00:03:08.560> if<00:03:08.830> you're
