it's the long ones probably another one

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.480 
it's the long ones probably another one
somewhere<00:01:12.510> else<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:13.590> example<00:01:13.920> portal<00:01:14.310> will

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
somewhere else for example portal will

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.990 
somewhere else for example portal will
be<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:16.460> portal<00:01:17.460> gun<00:01:18.440> it's<00:01:19.440> somewhere<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.400> mods

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
be in portal gun it's somewhere in mods

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.680 
be in portal gun it's somewhere in mods
it<00:01:21.960> has<00:01:22.110> its<00:01:22.290> own<00:01:22.590> folder<00:01:23.250> which<00:01:23.700> isn't<00:01:24.510> here

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.130 
it has its own folder which isn't here
right<00:01:24.720> now<00:01:26.120> yeah<00:01:27.120> so<00:01:27.330> for<00:01:27.450> example<00:01:27.540> for<00:01:27.870> Street

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
right now yeah so for example for Street

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.289 
right now yeah so for example for Street
just<00:01:28.320> go<00:01:28.440> there<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:31.760> it's<00:01:32.760> not<00:01:32.909> liking<00:01:33.210> me

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
today it's one of these config files for

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.340 
today it's one of these config files for
example<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.190> see<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.490> config<00:01:35.820> file<00:01:36.000> will<00:01:36.180> work

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
example I see to config file will work

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.020 
example I see to config file will work
it's<00:01:37.350> just<00:01:37.590> Turner<00:01:38.100> max<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.640> you<00:01:38.700> can<00:01:38.850> see<00:01:39.000> a

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
it's just Turner max and you can see a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.859 
it's just Turner max and you can see a
bunch<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.650> ID's<00:01:40.650> here<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.280> block<00:01:41.490> IDs<00:01:41.850> are<00:01:42.659> all

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
bunch of ID's here the block IDs are all

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.880 
bunch of ID's here the block IDs are all
here<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:44.490> if<00:01:44.970> for<00:01:45.420> example<00:01:45.510> for<00:01:46.470> example<00:01:46.500> red
