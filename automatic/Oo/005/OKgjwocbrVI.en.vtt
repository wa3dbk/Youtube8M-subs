00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
shot no I'm not calling you bad bro but

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.569 
shot no I'm not calling you bad bro but
you<00:01:43.020> know<00:01:43.320> what<00:01:43.560> if<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.799> can't<00:01:44.040> get<00:01:44.130> one<00:01:44.369> shot

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
you know what if you can't get one shot

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.310 
you know what if you can't get one shot
with<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.329> might<00:01:45.360> need<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.899> start<00:01:46.170> aiming

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
with it you might need to start aiming

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.520 
with it you might need to start aiming
for<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.710> chest<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.280> not<00:01:47.430> their<00:01:47.640> foot<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.530> it

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
for the chest and not their foot and it

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.039 
for the chest and not their foot and it
will<00:01:49.829> just<00:01:50.100> destroy<00:01:50.340> kids<00:01:51.090> I<00:01:51.390> don't<00:01:51.570> know<00:01:51.750> why

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
will just destroy kids I don't know why

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.380 
will just destroy kids I don't know why
they<00:01:52.229> made<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:52.590> powerful<00:01:53.220> but<00:01:53.670> my<00:01:53.820> idea

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
they made it this powerful but my idea

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.950 
they made it this powerful but my idea
of<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.630> type<00:01:55.590> 95<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.430> basically<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.600> mw2

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
of the type 95 is basically the mw2

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.920 
of the type 95 is basically the mw2
famas<00:01:58.710> added<00:01:59.579> along<00:01:59.909> with<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.210> g11<00:02:00.450> from

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
famas added along with the g11 from

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.289 
famas added along with the g11 from
black<00:02:01.140> ops<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.680> what<00:02:02.189> I<00:02:02.219> mean<00:02:02.280> by<00:02:02.460> that<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:03.000> the

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
black ops and what I mean by that is the

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.050 
black ops and what I mean by that is the
famas<00:02:03.659> was<00:02:04.170> really<00:02:04.560> dirty<00:02:04.740> as<00:02:05.100> a<00:02:05.159> three<00:02:05.850> bursts

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
famas was really dirty as a three bursts

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.779 
famas was really dirty as a three bursts
gun<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.719> then<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.500> take<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.979> g11<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.670> it

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
gun and then you take the g11 in it

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.240 
gun and then you take the g11 in it
shoots<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.119> lot<00:02:09.300> faster<00:02:09.509> than<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.050> famas<00:02:10.379> did

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
shoots a lot faster than the famas did

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.000 
shoots a lot faster than the famas did
and<00:02:11.880> you<00:02:12.180> get<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.420> tide<00:02:12.570> 95<00:02:12.990> so<00:02:13.500> basically<00:02:13.890> it

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
and you get the tide 95 so basically it

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.880 
and you get the tide 95 so basically it
shoots<00:02:14.220> really<00:02:14.700> fast<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.240> really<00:02:15.890> freakin

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
shoots really fast and really freakin

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.000 
shoots really fast and really freakin
deadly<00:02:17.370> and<00:02:17.640> it's<00:02:18.450> just<00:02:18.990> really<00:02:19.350> overpowered

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
deadly and it's just really overpowered

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.430 
deadly and it's just really overpowered
in<00:02:20.100> my<00:02:20.220> opinion<00:02:20.520> everyone<00:02:20.910> I<00:02:21.450> played<00:02:22.080> against

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
in my opinion everyone I played against

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.440 
in my opinion everyone I played against
uses<00:02:23.100> it<00:02:23.250> it's<00:02:23.460> like<00:02:23.640> always<00:02:23.970> a<00:02:24.000> one<00:02:24.240> hit<00:02:24.420> kill

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
uses it it's like always a one hit kill

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.270 
uses it it's like always a one hit kill
and<00:02:24.870> every<00:02:25.560> time<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.740> should<00:02:25.950> have<00:02:26.040> done<00:02:26.100> with

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
and every time I should have done with

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.370 
and every time I should have done with
the<00:02:26.340> one<00:02:26.460> he<00:02:26.550> told<00:02:26.790> ya<00:02:26.910> it's<00:02:27.120> very<00:02:27.330> fair<00:02:27.660> well

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
the one he told ya it's very fair well

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.800 
the one he told ya it's very fair well
it's<00:02:28.650> almost<00:02:28.860> like<00:02:29.040> playing<00:02:29.160> hardcore<00:02:29.730> so<00:02:30.390> all

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
it's almost like playing hardcore so all

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.870 
it's almost like playing hardcore so all
the<00:02:30.990> other<00:02:31.170> guns<00:02:31.410> are<00:02:31.620> not<00:02:31.650> really<00:02:32.340> worth<00:02:32.670> even

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
the other guns are not really worth even

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.880 
the other guns are not really worth even
using<00:02:33.360> yes<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:34.050> close-range<00:02:34.410> battle

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
using yes in close-range battle

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.490 
using yes in close-range battle
obviously<00:02:35.370> a<00:02:35.400> UMP<00:02:35.940> or<00:02:36.270> mp5<00:02:36.959> or<00:02:37.230> something<00:02:37.440> like

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
obviously a UMP or mp5 or something like

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.800 
obviously a UMP or mp5 or something like
that<00:02:37.560> my<00:02:37.890> twinge<00:02:38.220> because<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:39.240> can<00:02:39.390> spray<00:02:39.750> you

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
that my twinge because it can spray you

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.230 
that my twinge because it can spray you
and<00:02:40.320> you<00:02:41.070> only<00:02:41.100> get<00:02:41.340> one<00:02:41.370> burst<00:02:41.670> if<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.090> miss

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
and you only get one burst if you miss

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.449 
and you only get one burst if you miss
that<00:02:42.270> burst<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:42.900> you're<00:02:42.990> dead<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.620> yes<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.220> is

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
that burst and you're dead so yes it is

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.050 
that burst and you're dead so yes it is
I<00:02:45.239> guess<00:02:45.690> kind<00:02:46.530> of<00:02:46.590> balance<00:02:46.980> this<00:02:47.520> game<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:47.910> the

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
I guess kind of balance this game is the

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.940 
I guess kind of balance this game is the
most<00:02:48.300> balanced<00:02:48.690> out<00:02:48.840> of<00:02:48.959> any<00:02:49.230> call<00:02:49.530> of<00:02:49.680> duty

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
most balanced out of any call of duty

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.280 
most balanced out of any call of duty
though<00:02:50.130> so<00:02:50.730> keep<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.970> in<00:02:51.180> mind<00:02:51.480> but<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:52.020> will

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
though so keep that in mind but I will

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.199 
though so keep that in mind but I will
go<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.500> tell<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:52.830> that<00:02:53.070> if<00:02:53.489> they<00:02:53.850> don't<00:02:54.030> nerf

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
go and tell you that if they don't nerf

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.180 
go and tell you that if they don't nerf
it<00:02:54.420> I'd<00:02:54.570> be<00:02:54.780> completely<00:02:54.989> shocked<00:02:55.680> just

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
it I'd be completely shocked just

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.949 
it I'd be completely shocked just
because<00:02:56.520> most<00:02:57.120> of<00:02:57.270> the<00:02:57.360> time<00:02:57.540> whenever<00:02:57.780> you

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
because most of the time whenever you

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.960 
because most of the time whenever you
have<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.110> gun<00:02:58.470> that's<00:02:58.650> this<00:02:58.830> powerful<00:02:59.340> usually

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
have a gun that's this powerful usually

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.330 
have a gun that's this powerful usually
people<00:03:00.239> will<00:03:00.510> decide<00:03:00.959> well<00:03:01.470> hey<00:03:01.680> let's<00:03:02.010> nerve

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
people will decide well hey let's nerve

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.420 
people will decide well hey let's nerve
again<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.090> make<00:03:03.360> it<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.540> little<00:03:03.690> less

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
again and make it a little less

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.100 
again and make it a little less
effective<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.640> that's<00:03:06.420> what<00:03:06.570> I'm<00:03:06.690> expecting

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
effective and that's what I'm expecting

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.350 
effective and that's what I'm expecting
then<00:03:07.800> again<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.190> can<00:03:08.340> go<00:03:08.459> and<00:03:08.610> move<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:08.940> argue

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
then again you can go and move and argue

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.570 
then again you can go and move and argue
that<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.720> ACR<00:03:10.290> is<00:03:10.320> the<00:03:10.770> most<00:03:10.950> deadly<00:03:11.370> the

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
that the ACR is the most deadly the

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.080 
that the ACR is the most deadly the
scars<00:03:11.940> the<00:03:12.209> deadliest<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:13.080> UMP<00:03:13.850> they<00:03:14.850> all

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
scars the deadliest the UMP they all

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.750 
scars the deadliest the UMP they all
have<00:03:15.390> their<00:03:15.570> great<00:03:15.959> benefits<00:03:16.500> and<00:03:16.769> I<00:03:17.459> think

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
have their great benefits and I think

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.750 
have their great benefits and I think
they're<00:03:17.850> all<00:03:18.090> really<00:03:18.450> great<00:03:18.660> guns<00:03:19.019> now<00:03:19.860> it's

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
they're all really great guns now it's

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.250 
they're all really great guns now it's
really<00:03:21.120> interesting<00:03:21.330> to<00:03:21.570> see<00:03:21.840> what<00:03:21.989> kind<00:03:22.170> of

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
really interesting to see what kind of

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.530 
really interesting to see what kind of
Professor<00:03:22.880> proficiencies<00:03:23.880> you<00:03:24.060> can<00:03:24.209> use<00:03:24.390> with

Professor proficiencies you can use with

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.850 
Professor proficiencies you can use with
the<00:03:24.630> guns<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.080> what<00:03:25.410> works<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.769> best

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
the guns and what works the best

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.400 
the guns and what works the best
obviously<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.790> ACR<00:03:27.239> works<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.959> best<00:03:28.080> with<00:03:28.380> a

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
obviously the ACR works the best with a

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.100 
obviously the ACR works the best with a
kick<00:03:28.680> so<00:03:28.920> you<00:03:28.980> can<00:03:29.190> get<00:03:29.280> best<00:03:29.790> accuracy<00:03:30.180> the

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
kick so you can get best accuracy the

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.009 
kick so you can get best accuracy the
famas<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:31.920> typically<00:03:32.459> use<00:03:32.580> I<00:03:33.420> don't<00:03:33.540> even<00:03:33.630> know

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
famas I typically use I don't even know

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.990 
famas I typically use I don't even know

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
why no sleep amoss enough uh moss in

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.210 
why no sleep amoss enough uh moss in
this<00:03:36.120> game<00:03:36.420> I<00:03:36.750> think<00:03:37.200> that's<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.769> reason<00:03:38.010> they

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
this game I think that's the reason they

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.650 
this game I think that's the reason they
didn't<00:03:38.430> put<00:03:38.519> a<00:03:38.580> full<00:03:38.730> oz<00:03:38.880> everybody's<00:03:39.239> sick

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
didn't put a full oz everybody's sick

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.479 
didn't put a full oz everybody's sick
and<00:03:39.810> tired<00:03:39.900> of<00:03:40.049> seeing<00:03:40.260> the<00:03:40.350> famas<00:03:40.620> but<00:03:41.370> the

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
and tired of seeing the famas but the

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.840 
and tired of seeing the famas but the
type<00:03:41.670> 95<00:03:42.000> has<00:03:42.989> how<00:03:43.620> many<00:03:43.650> men<00:03:43.950> like<00:03:44.430> kick<00:03:44.700> you

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
type 95 has how many men like kick you

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.640 
type 95 has how many men like kick you
don't<00:03:45.030> need<00:03:45.239> on<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:45.600> you<00:03:46.049> can<00:03:46.170> use<00:03:46.320> double

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
don't need on it you can use double

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.930 
don't need on it you can use double
attachments<00:03:47.160> that's<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.370> really<00:03:47.579> good<00:03:47.700> way<00:03:47.880> to

attachments that's a really good way to

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.780 
attachments that's a really good way to
go<00:03:48.209> stability<00:03:48.840> is<00:03:48.900> not<00:03:49.079> bad<00:03:49.290> I<00:03:49.560> do<00:03:50.070> like<00:03:50.549> the

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
go stability is not bad I do like the

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.280 
go stability is not bad I do like the
thing<00:03:50.970> that<00:03:51.180> makes<00:03:51.329> you<00:03:51.480> not<00:03:51.660> flinch<00:03:51.959> as<00:03:52.110> much

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
thing that makes you not flinch as much

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.319 
thing that makes you not flinch as much
when<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.560> get<00:03:52.680> shot<00:03:52.890> that<00:03:53.160> makes<00:03:53.489> you<00:03:53.640> destroy

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
when you get shot that makes you destroy

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.930 
when you get shot that makes you destroy
kits<00:03:54.750> so<00:03:55.380> everyone<00:03:55.920> keeps<00:03:56.160> asking<00:03:56.310> me<00:03:56.700> what

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
kits so everyone keeps asking me what

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
guns i've been using type 95 definitely

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.490 
guns i've been using type 95 definitely
is<00:03:58.860> up<00:03:59.010> there<00:03:59.190> one<00:03:59.549> with<00:03:59.670> a<00:03:59.730> CR<00:04:00.299> UMP<00:04:01.200> and<00:04:01.440> of

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
is up there one with a CR UMP and of

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.800 
is up there one with a CR UMP and of
course<00:04:01.709> most<00:04:01.860> hyper<00:04:02.160> rifles<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.910> they're<00:04:03.660> all

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
course most hyper rifles and they're all

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.479 
course most hyper rifles and they're all
really<00:04:04.049> good<00:04:04.290> just<00:04:04.709> kind<00:04:05.070> of<00:04:05.130> have<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.280> balance

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
really good just kind of have to balance

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.569 
really good just kind of have to balance
them<00:04:05.790> out<00:04:05.880> I<00:04:06.180> know<00:04:06.780> this<00:04:06.930> was<00:04:07.170> kind<00:04:07.380> of<00:04:07.519> more<00:04:08.519> of

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
them out I know this was kind of more of

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:10.250 
them out I know this was kind of more of
a<00:04:08.640> commentary<00:04:09.000> about<00:04:09.150> overpowered<00:04:09.810> guns<00:04:09.989> but

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
a commentary about overpowered guns but

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.550 
a commentary about overpowered guns but
can<00:04:10.410> go<00:04:10.769> into<00:04:10.890> also<00:04:11.610> custom<00:04:12.000> classes<00:04:12.269> so<00:04:13.170> just

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
can go into also custom classes so just

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.229 
can go into also custom classes so just
kind<00:04:13.739> of<00:04:13.799> keep<00:04:13.980> in<00:04:14.130> mind<00:04:14.370> that<00:04:14.549> these<00:04:15.030> are<00:04:15.209> just

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
kind of keep in mind that these are just

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.849 
kind of keep in mind that these are just
some<00:04:15.690> things<00:04:15.750> I've<00:04:16.169> been<00:04:16.260> working<00:04:16.739> around

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
some things I've been working around

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.920 
some things I've been working around
with<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.430> a<00:04:17.489> lot<00:04:17.729> of<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:18.030> proficiencies

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
with and a lot of the proficiencies

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.839 
with and a lot of the proficiencies
mainly<00:04:19.260> being<00:04:19.440> kicked<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:19.890> that's<00:04:20.489> usually

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:20.849 
mainly being kicked and that's usually

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:21.920 
mainly being kicked and that's usually
with<00:04:21.030> the<00:04:21.180> submachine<00:04:21.510> guns<00:04:21.810> because

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
with the submachine guns because

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:22.410 
with the submachine guns because
whenever<00:04:22.169> you

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
whenever you

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.270 
whenever you
look<00:04:22.480> at<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.780> submachine<00:04:23.170> guns<00:04:23.590> in<00:04:23.770> this<00:04:23.950> game

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
look at the submachine guns in this game

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.930 
look at the submachine guns in this game
they<00:04:25.060> are<00:04:25.300> actually<00:04:26.160> keeping<00:04:27.160> it<00:04:27.370> to<00:04:27.730> the

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
they are actually keeping it to the

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.000 
they are actually keeping it to the
point<00:04:28.210> that<00:04:28.330> some<00:04:29.140> machine<00:04:29.410> guns<00:04:29.590> are<00:04:29.800> close

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
point that some machine guns are close

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.250 
point that some machine guns are close
range<00:04:30.310> guns<00:04:31.090> they're<00:04:31.420> not<00:04:31.600> meant<00:04:31.870> to<00:04:32.050> shoot

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
range guns they're not meant to shoot

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.010 
range guns they're not meant to shoot
thousands<00:04:33.070> of<00:04:33.160> feet<00:04:33.340> away<00:04:33.550> they<00:04:34.450> are<00:04:34.600> meant<00:04:34.840> to

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
thousands of feet away they are meant to

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.840 
thousands of feet away they are meant to
shoot<00:04:35.320> close<00:04:35.740> range<00:04:36.100> so<00:04:36.370> therefore<00:04:36.700> you're

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
shoot close range so therefore you're

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:38.250 
shoot close range so therefore you're
going<00:04:36.970> to<00:04:37.030> see<00:04:37.150> more<00:04:37.360> recoil<00:04:37.810> they're<00:04:38.080> going

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
going to see more recoil they're going

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.840 
going to see more recoil they're going
to<00:04:38.320> start<00:04:38.410> bouncing<00:04:38.860> around<00:04:38.950> that's<00:04:39.670> why

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
to start bouncing around that's why

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.220 
to start bouncing around that's why
you're<00:04:40.030> gonna<00:04:40.180> have<00:04:40.300> hard<00:04:40.570> time<00:04:40.870> shooting

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
you're gonna have hard time shooting

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:44.010 
you're gonna have hard time shooting
people<00:04:41.650> far<00:04:41.950> away<00:04:41.980> and<00:04:42.640> unlike<00:04:43.570> the<00:04:43.600> assault

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
people far away and unlike the assault

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.540 
people far away and unlike the assault
rifles<00:04:44.350> are<00:04:44.530> going<00:04:44.680> to<00:04:44.770> actually<00:04:45.070> about<00:04:45.280> shoot

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
rifles are going to actually about shoot

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.120 
rifles are going to actually about shoot
far<00:04:45.820> away<00:04:46.060> but<00:04:46.780> up<00:04:47.170> close<00:04:47.230> they're<00:04:47.860> gonna<00:04:48.010> be

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
far away but up close they're gonna be

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.280 
far away but up close they're gonna be
shooting<00:04:48.550> a<00:04:48.610> little<00:04:48.790> slower<00:04:49.300> and<00:04:49.630> that's

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.290 
shooting a little slower and that's

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.810 
shooting a little slower and that's
actually<00:04:50.500> I<00:04:50.710> guess<00:04:51.160> the<00:04:51.310> way<00:04:51.430> to<00:04:51.490> look<00:04:51.700> at

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
actually I guess the way to look at

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.470 
actually I guess the way to look at
assault<00:04:52.300> rifle<00:04:52.660> compared<00:04:53.050> to<00:04:53.140> SMG<00:04:53.790> SMG<00:04:54.790> fast

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.480 
assault rifle compared to SMG SMG fast

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.930 
assault rifle compared to SMG SMG fast
shooting<00:04:56.050> bounces<00:04:56.740> around<00:04:56.860> a<00:04:57.160> lot<00:04:57.340> assault

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
shooting bounces around a lot assault

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.210 
shooting bounces around a lot assault
rifle<00:04:58.330> slow<00:04:58.930> shooting<00:04:59.440> doesn't<00:05:00.070> bounce

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
rifle slow shooting doesn't bounce

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.550 
rifle slow shooting doesn't bounce
around<00:05:00.460> as<00:05:00.700> much<00:05:01.030> and<00:05:01.390> then<00:05:02.020> of<00:05:02.200> course<00:05:02.260> you

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
too much so just kind of keep in mind

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.250 
too much so just kind of keep in mind
that<00:05:36.400> my<00:05:36.580> brain<00:05:36.850> might<00:05:37.270> be<00:05:37.420> fried<00:05:37.840> a<00:05:37.870> little

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
that my brain might be fried a little

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.830 
that my brain might be fried a little
bit<00:05:38.410> and<00:05:38.650> I<00:05:39.610> might<00:05:39.850> really<00:05:40.270> need<00:05:40.360> to<00:05:40.660> go<00:05:40.780> to

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
bit and I might really need to go to

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.170 
bit and I might really need to go to
sleep<00:05:41.050> soon<00:05:41.470> and<00:05:42.310> not<00:05:42.550> to<00:05:42.640> mention<00:05:42.730> this<00:05:43.000> is

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
sleep soon and not to mention this is

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.540 
sleep soon and not to mention this is
gameplay<00:05:43.540> as<00:05:43.870> long<00:05:44.170> the<00:05:44.860> only<00:05:45.070> reason<00:05:45.340> I<00:05:45.400> had

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
gameplay as long the only reason I had

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.310 
gameplay as long the only reason I had
to<00:05:45.640> bring<00:05:45.760> this<00:05:45.880> gameplay<00:05:46.120> is<00:05:46.450> just<00:05:47.020> because

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
to bring this gameplay is just because

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.410 
to bring this gameplay is just because
if<00:05:47.560> you<00:05:47.650> look<00:05:47.860> at<00:05:48.040> me<00:05:48.160> using<00:05:48.580> the<00:05:48.670> skinnin<00:05:49.000> you

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:49.420 
if you look at me using the skinnin you

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.900 
if you look at me using the skinnin you
see<00:05:49.720> how<00:05:50.200> easy<00:05:50.650> it<00:05:50.920> is<00:05:50.980> to<00:05:51.220> get<00:05:51.370> kills<00:05:51.670> with<00:05:51.880> a

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
see how easy it is to get kills with a

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.600 
see how easy it is to get kills with a
tight<00:05:52.150> 95<00:05:52.360> and<00:05:52.930> it<00:05:53.800> just<00:05:54.010> seems<00:05:54.220> like<00:05:54.340> you<00:05:54.490> can

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 
tight 95 and it just seems like you can

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.280 
tight 95 and it just seems like you can
get<00:05:54.730> really<00:05:54.910> good<00:05:55.120> streaks<00:05:55.480> I<00:05:55.660> bet<00:05:55.990> you<00:05:56.020> this

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.010 
and I kind of like it because whenever

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.990 
and I kind of like it because whenever
you're<00:07:05.190> talking<00:07:05.370> about<00:07:05.490> so<00:07:05.760> many<00:07:05.850> different

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 
you're talking about so many different

guns<00:07:06.419> perks<00:07:06.840> and<00:07:07.050> everything<00:07:07.320> else<00:07:07.500> it<00:07:07.979> makes

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:08.190 
guns perks and everything else it makes

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.610 
guns perks and everything else it makes
the<00:07:08.400> game<00:07:08.550> not<00:07:08.850> so<00:07:09.090> boring<00:07:09.449> like<00:07:10.380> whenever

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:10.620 
the game not so boring like whenever

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.460 
the game not so boring like whenever
you're<00:07:10.949> talking<00:07:11.220> about<00:07:11.340> blackouts<00:07:11.850> mw2<00:07:12.750> call

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:13.470 
you're talking about blackouts mw2 call

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:15.950 
you're talking about blackouts mw2 call
of<00:07:13.680> duty<00:07:13.860> 4<00:07:13.889> you<00:07:14.789> know<00:07:14.910> you<00:07:15.000> have<00:07:15.180> only<00:07:15.330> so<00:07:15.750> much

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:15.960 
of duty 4 you know you have only so much

00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.140 
of duty 4 you know you have only so much
I<00:07:16.289> guess<00:07:16.710> classes<00:07:17.400> that<00:07:17.699> you<00:07:17.820> can<00:07:17.850> kind<00:07:18.120> of

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.150 
I guess classes that you can kind of

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.600 
I guess classes that you can kind of
make<00:07:18.360> and<00:07:18.740> people<00:07:19.740> only<00:07:19.860> use<00:07:19.979> certain<00:07:20.400> things

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:20.610 
make and people only use certain things

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.340 
make and people only use certain things
I<00:07:20.820> think<00:07:20.910> this<00:07:21.449> game<00:07:21.630> is<00:07:21.690> the<00:07:21.840> most<00:07:22.110> well

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.350 
I think this game is the most well

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:23.629 
I think this game is the most well
balanced<00:07:22.710> and<00:07:22.800> they<00:07:22.889> have<00:07:23.039> things<00:07:23.370> that

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:23.639 
balanced and they have things that

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:25.310 
balanced and they have things that
people<00:07:24.000> will<00:07:24.120> use<00:07:24.300> all<00:07:24.479> the<00:07:24.600> time<00:07:24.810> not

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:25.320 
people will use all the time not

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.080 
people will use all the time not
necessarily<00:07:25.830> the<00:07:26.039> exact<00:07:26.310> same<00:07:26.550> things<00:07:26.820> other
