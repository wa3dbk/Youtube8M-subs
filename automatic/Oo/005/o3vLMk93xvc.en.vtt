00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.209 
to go through this opening shot from the
sci-fi<00:00:08.340> thriller<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:09.150> created<00:00:09.920> you<00:00:10.920> can<00:00:11.010> check

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
sci-fi thriller I created you can check

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.770 
sci-fi thriller I created you can check
that<00:00:11.250> video<00:00:11.550> out<00:00:11.700> here<00:00:12.150> if<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.330> haven't<00:00:12.599> seen

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
that video out here if you haven't seen

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.140 
that video out here if you haven't seen
it<00:00:12.809> yet<00:00:13.349> anyway<00:00:14.340> this<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.639> definitely<00:00:15.000> one<00:00:15.120> of

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
it yet anyway this is definitely one of

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.450 
it yet anyway this is definitely one of
my<00:00:15.379> favorite<00:00:16.379> shots<00:00:16.619> from<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.980> trailer<00:00:17.220> and

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
my favorite shots from the trailer and

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.730 
my favorite shots from the trailer and
it<00:00:17.550> actually<00:00:17.789> was<00:00:18.750> incredibly<00:00:19.320> easy<00:00:19.500> to<00:00:19.650> make

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
it actually was incredibly easy to make

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.010 
it actually was incredibly easy to make
I'd<00:00:20.070> say<00:00:20.310> from<00:00:20.820> start<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.300> finish<00:00:21.330> it<00:00:21.720> took<00:00:21.810> me

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
I'd say from start to finish it took me

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.370 
I'd say from start to finish it took me
about<00:00:22.199> 30<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.220> 40<00:00:23.490> minutes<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:24.330> create<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:25.140> this

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
about 30 to 40 minutes to create so this

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.150 
about 30 to 40 minutes to create so this
this<00:00:26.039> breakdown<00:00:26.310> should<00:00:26.789> go<00:00:26.970> very<00:00:27.180> quickly<00:00:28.160> so

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
this breakdown should go very quickly so

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.250 
this breakdown should go very quickly so
here<00:00:29.340> we<00:00:29.429> have<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.789> basic<00:00:30.179> setup<00:00:30.689> for<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
here we have the basic setup for the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.470 
here we have the basic setup for the
scene<00:00:31.470> as<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:32.250> could<00:00:32.579> probably<00:00:32.669> guess<00:00:33.180> the

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
scene as you could probably guess the

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.319 
scene as you could probably guess the
scene<00:00:33.899> consists<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.710> only<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.640> two<00:00:35.820> elements

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
scene consists of only the two elements

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.950 
scene consists of only the two elements
one<00:00:36.960> being<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.350> satellite<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.040> got<00:00:38.520> from<00:00:38.960> blend

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
one being the satellite I got from blend

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.650 
one being the satellite I got from blend
swap<00:00:40.200> calm<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.250> second<00:00:41.640> being<00:00:42.210> this

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
swap calm and the second being this

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.000 
swap calm and the second being this
primitive<00:00:42.989> sphere<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.649> added<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.980> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
primitive sphere that I added to the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.220 
primitive sphere that I added to the
scene<00:00:44.280> so<00:00:45.059> for<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> texturing<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
scene so for the texturing of the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.600 
scene so for the texturing of the
spacecraft<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.890> didn't<00:00:47.070> do<00:00:47.160> anything<00:00:47.370> out<00:00:47.550> of

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
spacecraft I didn't do anything out of

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.000 
spacecraft I didn't do anything out of
the<00:00:47.700> norm<00:00:47.969> I<00:00:48.239> added<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.660> metal<00:00:48.989> diffuse<00:00:49.620> texture

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
the norm I added a metal diffuse texture

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.279 
the norm I added a metal diffuse texture
mixed<00:00:50.430> with<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.610> concrete<00:00:50.850> specular<00:00:51.480> map<00:00:51.629> for

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
mixed with a concrete specular map for

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.810 
mixed with a concrete specular map for
the<00:00:52.350> body<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.829> satellite<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.460> then<00:00:53.579> get

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
the body of the satellite and then get

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.389 
the body of the satellite and then get
used<00:00:54.000> a<00:00:54.289> glossy<00:00:55.289> material<00:00:55.860> for<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.129> satellite

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
used a glossy material for the satellite

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.209 
used a glossy material for the satellite

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.179 
got this image now this image by itself
is<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:21.630> very<00:01:21.689> impressive<00:01:22.110> even<00:01:22.799> though<00:01:23.070> we

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
is not very impressive even though we

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.620 
is not very impressive even though we
have<00:01:23.340> some<00:01:23.460> good<00:01:23.670> reflections<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
have some good reflections on the

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.350 
have some good reflections on the
satellite<00:01:25.049> panels<00:01:25.409> from<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.619> earth<00:01:25.830> and

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
satellite panels from the earth and

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.090 
satellite panels from the earth and
environment<00:01:27.360> map<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:28.229> mission<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
environment map the mission of the

environment map the mission of the
lights<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.610> earth<00:01:29.729> seemed<00:01:30.060> very

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
lights on the earth seemed very

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.980 
lights on the earth seemed very
one-dimensional<00:01:32.000> so<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> lot<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.869> other

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
one-dimensional so like a lot of other

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.969 
one-dimensional so like a lot of other
shots<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.560> went<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.340> compositor<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.979> I

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
shots I went to the compositor and I

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.560 
shots I went to the compositor and I
first<00:01:38.579> increased<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.090> overall<00:01:39.390> brightness

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
first increased the overall brightness

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.050 
first increased the overall brightness
of<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:39.990> image<00:01:40.170> after<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.520> added<00:01:41.729> some

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
of the image after that I added some

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.200 
of the image after that I added some
lens<00:01:42.420> flares<00:01:42.750> using<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.290> streaks<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.460> fog

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
lens flares using the streaks and fog

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.260 
lens flares using the streaks and fog
glare<00:01:45.540> nodes<00:01:45.780> then<00:01:46.740> lastly<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.250> used<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:48.030> color

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
glare nodes then lastly I used the color

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.319 
glare nodes then lastly I used the color
wheels<00:01:48.509> node<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.649> color<00:01:50.430> grade<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.850> at<00:01:51.270> a

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
wheels node to color grade in at a

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.630 
wheels node to color grade in at a
blueish<00:01:52.140> tint<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.890> shot<00:01:53.100> because<00:01:53.310> as<00:01:53.520> we

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
blueish tint to the shot because as we
