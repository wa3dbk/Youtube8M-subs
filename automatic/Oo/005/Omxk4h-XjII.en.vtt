00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:18.189
 acer is very prudent 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.960
 venerated virgin we prefer to pray 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:28.210
 god that some politician on duty 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:31.570
 good we are here for the millionth time 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.460
 asking that the regional government 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.320
 stabilization of institutions precarious 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.900
 public administration premises 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.330
 we are almost twenty thousand we ask that later 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.239
 23 years is given up to this 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.250
 rubbish that politicians have created not 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.830
 we are recommended as someone has 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.570
 he says then we ask this 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.589
 president of the region since he has us 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.570
 asked to pray 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.280
 we pray but he must do the 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.780
 possible because the situation comes 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.640
 permanently closed 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.799
 we want the contract to be determined 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.420
 indeterminate we are not the ones to do 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:03.369
 standards but this government and these 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.530
 politicians who have taken us up to now 

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:08.140
 around we do not stop at the actions of 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.740
 fight this is a start to claim 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.740
 our battles 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.299
 we are historical precarious of the region 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.329
 Sicilian used at institutions 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:27.170
 common public provinces harsh rooms of 

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:29.000
 trade and anything else of public us 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.090
 both in Sicily we are historians because 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.549
 we are to connote the former articles 23 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.130
 so we have been coming for over 23 years 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.689
 let 's say fights what we ask today 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.100
 because we are an ancient embry 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.039
 because we had a meeting with 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.799
 ticks less than a month ago on 10 of 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.750
 April to the response that to 31 July 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.119
 every form of precariousness must 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.700
 then end with a dismissal 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.399
 with everyone at home we asked for answers 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.069
 and he told us I'm trying one 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.709
 mediation with the national government does not 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:02.030
 You getting any results us 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.819
 we asked what we do 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.979
 pray god now clearly pray to god 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.630
 the first of August when everything is now 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.759
 finished maybe god can tell me why not 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.430
 you came before and then we have 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.620
 favorite today already start this cycle 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.480
 of prayers that should not be concluded today 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.209
 it started we are here in palermo 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.709
 we represent all nine provinces and 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.170
 we are all trying to have 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.060
 visibility and you're pulling it but 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.639
 above all to make the government understand 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.549
 cross that we want answers 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:33.530
 concrete because the words have it 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.680
 all said in 23 years transversally 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:40.600
 Left-wing governments remain a coalition 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.600
 of center we want concrete forms 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.840
 we have been in various forms for 23 years 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.490
 states precarious the region has set gods 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.170
 money the institutions that used us 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.900
 they put money to the latest estimates 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.450
 they give us 22,000 units, that is, we talk about 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.280
 asp aspas therefore milic hospitals 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.500
 health facilities then we talk about 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.460
 common I for example deal with 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.260
 public Works 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.180
 he is an architect and takes care of the 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.680
 public works we have police 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.870
 municipal then do service of 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.790
 urban policeman who has only one 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.670
 precarious social assistance person 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.360
 we talk about services and even services 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.250
 demographic of protocol cards all 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.540
 now in the fabric of the institution 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.340
 as the institution could not do 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.770
 competitions and sent retired people 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.110
 so now we have surrogated us if 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.570
 we are gone there is not materially 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.370
 no one who does this service vi 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.370
 we ask for an invariable expenditure 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.709
 means without spending an extra euro 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.680
 to transform these precarious relationships to 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.180
 fixed term indefinitely 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.610
 at the same conditions at the same time 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.200
 then as the first point we then ask for the 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.600
 long-term stabilization 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.459
 means overcoming the shackles of the 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.640
 national government concerning pacts 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:04:00.390
 of stability spending for personnel e 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.459
 turnover and progressively implement laws 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.220
 then concrete stabilization 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:06.720
 we first ask for real things then 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.940
 we ask for something complicated but 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.410
 let's give the government time to formulate 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.180
 but immediately what can be done 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.459
 he must give it to us because we cannot 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.229
 to 31 July lines to our children 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.900
 because we already have grown children 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:21.330
 university say heard patavina life 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.070
 who is struggling to have his done 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:24.900
 duty worked now send him home 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.450
 because there is nothing left to do then 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:32.090
 we cannot surrender to this 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.090
 dramatic eventuality of 31 July
