00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.839
 hello with you gleb today is the fifth of january 

00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:09.240
 2014 and this means that my nexus 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.580
 exactly a year to the seventh and most 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.280
 time to review it will be an experience 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.550
 operating this device there will be 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.070
 a small overview of accessories that I 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.960
 use in tandem with this tablet it 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.689
 also tell you whether to take 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:31.140
 Now this device let's start and 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:34.680
 First of all I want to say that the tablet 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.950
 for a year he showed himself to him as a father 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.760
 there was absolutely no problem 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.690
 really i didn't try it in some way 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.110
 customize rut ie 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.379
 inside the operating systems I did not climb in 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.550
 principle, no problems should be 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.920
 let's start with why i chose this 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.050
 device first of all it was 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.530
 value for money guys from 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.930
 cedar com truly noticed the fact that google 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.700
 and asus I do not know what is making money 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.909
 and literally sold their tablets by 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.950
 cost of all components and this 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.049
 very pleasant considering it can be 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.810
 use a good tablet for quite 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.350
 imputed money for example at the moment 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.540
 Shopping this tablet has become 300 dollars and 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.409
 there was a quad-core nvidia processor 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.650
 tegra 3 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.780
 wildly RAM and clean android which 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.380
 you can customize in any way or 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.740
 update to the most recent new 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.610
 versions so i think it's great 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.220
 Pros android device and choose 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.110
 of course between galaxy tab 2 0 7 inches 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.479
 and there was of course dual core 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.100
 CPU 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:52.829
 buggy touchwiz and of course right away 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.770
 galaxy tab 2 from by me and decided 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:59.189
 choose exactly nexus 7 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:02.100
 let me tell you now how I am 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.649
 I use this device I use it 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:09.640
 Here in this case it is my case with 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:12.010
 my olya ipad smart cover or smart case 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.930
 he is very comfortable working the same here 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.490
 function 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.730
 magnet i.e. unlock 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.980
 will block the device and it is during this time 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.370
 managed to get a bit of a shabby however 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:27.280
 price 7 dollars I can not see it 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.610
 disadvantage since he already survived two 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.380
 falls and adequately protected the device 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.570
 the only thing that has fallen off is this already 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.680
 rear part 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:42.190
 there was a crack here, but it was all 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.120
 it is a matter of unstuck and unstuck here but 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.580
 I think something can be put on a super 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.910
 glue and no big deal thanks 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:55.150
 him for what a couple of falls it is already on 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.910
 This case took over and of course already 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.340
 it should be changed because this one 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.400
 the part is killed and another fall is unlikely 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.350
 this case can survive and let's 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.260
 let's see the following what is the price 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.780
 this cover is 7 dollars here is this cover i 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.500
 after January last year it was 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.070
 My first case was originally he 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.360
 positioned for both in and in the domain 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.220
 so looked so happy 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.350
 Wonderful and decided to buy it 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.000
 cost 25 dollars and he doesn't 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.810
 to be interested in what is here 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.430
 stiffeners that allow 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:36.730
 protect your device and third case 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.260
 was bought for $ 14 on the site 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.570
 ebay is like green and it is 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:46.510
 case-keyboard drop of course he 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:50.470
 does not protect however has one very 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.660
 the cool advantage is what it is 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.799
 the device can be used as 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:58.650
 the usual keyboard let's put 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:03.209
 the tablet 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:07.709
 connect the keyboard to our nexus 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:13.840
 search line drive in and as you can see 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:15.730
 quietly and on the keyboard it works well 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:18.209
 I thought that I would be on the keyboard 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.970
 convenient to type however looked 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.190
 on the member looking and putting it in 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.080
 standard android keyboard i with 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.550
 I can easily gain a plot about 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:32.250
 marchesa let's type as you see 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.960
 word typed in a short time and this 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.789
 very comfortable and considering so 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.199
 I almost never use the keyboard 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:42.660
 However, since the release of android 4 4 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:45.419
 already a program of pieces from which 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:48.030
 support vordovsky point of ski 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:50.729
 their country papers then this of course 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.030
 convenient and it can be typed 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:57.110
 and now let's talk more of those 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.610
 accessories that i use it 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.919
 2600 portable battery 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:05.610
 milliamps per hour and told about him already 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:08.099
 the previous videos are pretty good 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:11.130
 device weapons use order 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:13.650
 Seven months and with him nothing yet 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.280
 it happened so that I would recommend most 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:20.490
 obvious thing and not expensive and that 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.759
 As for my charge , this one 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:27.860
 yusbi charger who walks the plug socket 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:31.199
 then it works well however my 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:33.570
 Nekrasovskaya charging broke here in 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:35.909
 this place just broke the wires there 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.919
 it was just twisted maybe I 

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:40.949
 somehow not neatly enjoyed perhaps 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:42.599
 just there it was poorly soldered by 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:43.110
 at least she perry spun 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:46.020
 and all 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:49.669
 and she had to throw it away I took myself on 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:54.870
 a replacement for this samsungovskaya 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:59.009
 charging hello does it focus shorter 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:02.130
 saying samsung charging too microusb and 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:05.310
 here, too, it seems to me, this is more 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.880
 reliably all soldered 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:11.210
 and it will work much better 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:13.949
 summing up I can say that the tablet 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.840
 I definitely recommend to buy because 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:18.229
 what are iron plans for today same 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.750
 for Sandra is without lags without glitches 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:24.120
 also ipad mini window in principle but i 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.639
 still would recommend a closer look 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:28.480
 to the seventh nexus of 2013 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:31.660
 so how goes 

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:33.430
 more let's say so you can upgrade to 

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.620
 more will bind the proton system i.e. 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.170
 most likely for this device 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.530
 android 4 4 kitkat will be the last 

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:44.530
 operating system she nexus 7 2013 you 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:46.960
 can still be updated for two or three 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.900
 operating system above and here's a video 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.800
 come to an end thanks for watching
