to make the fan trellis wrap working

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.100 
to make the fan trellis wrap working
from<00:00:20.890> the<00:00:21.130> center<00:00:21.490> out<00:00:21.730> now<00:00:22.390> you<00:00:22.450> can<00:00:22.750> do<00:00:22.900> this

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
from the center out now you can do this

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.839 
from the center out now you can do this
on<00:00:23.380> you<00:00:23.650> know<00:00:23.740> other<00:00:23.950> ones<00:00:24.160> working<00:00:24.520> from<00:00:24.670> the

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
on you know other ones working from the

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.510 
on you know other ones working from the
foundation<00:00:25.599> and<00:00:25.720> you<00:00:25.779> can<00:00:26.439> see<00:00:26.680> here<00:00:27.130> I've

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 
foundation and you can see here I've

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.250 
foundation and you can see here I've
done<00:00:27.880> this<00:00:28.029> in<00:00:28.210> two<00:00:28.330> separate<00:00:28.720> colors<00:00:28.900> so<00:00:29.200> you

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
done this in two separate colors so you

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.140 
done this in two separate colors so you
can<00:00:29.500> see<00:00:29.680> how<00:00:29.829> it's<00:00:30.009> going<00:00:30.220> in<00:00:30.460> in<00:00:30.730> different

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
can see how it's going in in different

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.930 
can see how it's going in in different
directions<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:32.529> is<00:00:32.710> one<00:00:32.950> side<00:00:33.220> this<00:00:33.640> is<00:00:33.700> the

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:33.940 
directions this is one side this is the

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.670 
directions this is one side this is the
other<00:00:34.060> side<00:00:34.329> and<00:00:34.600> we've<00:00:34.750> completed<00:00:35.200> it<00:00:35.410> going

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
other side and we've completed it going

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.889 
other side and we've completed it going
down<00:00:35.829> the<00:00:36.010> foundation<00:00:36.700> row<00:00:36.910> and<00:00:37.239> this<00:00:37.660> just

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
down the foundation row and this just

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:39.780 
down the foundation row and this just
makes<00:00:38.079> the<00:00:38.260> pattern<00:00:38.470> lay<00:00:38.890> nice<00:00:39.130> and<00:00:39.160> flat<00:00:39.399> when

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
makes the pattern lay nice and flat when

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.270 
makes the pattern lay nice and flat when
when<00:00:40.090> it's<00:00:40.239> wrapped<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.710> what<00:00:41.890> we're<00:00:42.040> going<00:00:42.190> to

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
when it's wrapped so what we're going to

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.940 
when it's wrapped so what we're going to
do<00:00:42.489> is<00:00:42.730> I've<00:00:42.910> started<00:00:43.510> my<00:00:43.750> piece<00:00:43.989> here<00:00:44.020> we're

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 
do is I've started my piece here we're
