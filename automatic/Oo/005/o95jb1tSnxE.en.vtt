okay<00:00:01.990> I<00:00:02.020> wanted<00:00:02.590> to<00:00:02.770> do<00:00:02.950> one<00:00:03.310> more<00:00:03.870> demo<00:00:04.870> video

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:05.350 
okay I wanted to do one more demo video

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.970 
okay I wanted to do one more demo video
for<00:00:05.740> the<00:00:06.430> new<00:00:06.790> head<00:00:07.120> tracking<00:00:07.509> headset<00:00:08.440> setup

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:08.980 
for the new head tracking headset setup

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.129 
for the new head tracking headset setup
I've<00:00:09.160> got<00:00:09.370> here<00:00:10.290> this<00:00:11.290> is<00:00:11.590> the<00:00:11.769> new<00:00:11.920> setup<00:00:13.139> you

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.139 
I've got here this is the new setup you

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.170 
I've got here this is the new setup you
can<00:00:14.320> see<00:00:14.500> that<00:00:14.679> mounted<00:00:15.190> it<00:00:15.339> on<00:00:15.670> a<00:00:15.700> normal

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:16.180 
can see that mounted it on a normal

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.370 
can see that mounted it on a normal
gaming<00:00:17.020> headset<00:00:17.619> I<00:00:18.430> now<00:00:19.300> am<00:00:19.689> using<00:00:19.960> these

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
gaming headset I now am using these

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.279 
gaming headset I now am using these
high-powered<00:00:21.369> infrared<00:00:21.720> LEDs<00:00:22.720> that<00:00:22.750> are<00:00:23.170> a

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
high-powered infrared LEDs that are a

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.200 
high-powered infrared LEDs that are a
lot<00:00:23.619> brighter<00:00:23.980> and<00:00:24.369> a<00:00:24.400> lot<00:00:24.550> more<00:00:24.730> consistent

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:25.210 
lot brighter and a lot more consistent

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.599 
lot brighter and a lot more consistent
have<00:00:25.660> a<00:00:25.689> wider<00:00:26.140> viewing<00:00:26.500> angle<00:00:26.740> they're

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:27.609 
have a wider viewing angle they're

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:30.980 
have a wider viewing angle they're
powered<00:00:28.029> by<00:00:28.240> this<00:00:28.300> constant<00:00:28.960> current<00:00:29.289> driver

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
powered by this constant current driver

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.830 
powered by this constant current driver
and<00:00:31.990> what<00:00:32.259> these<00:00:32.439> are<00:00:32.910> connected<00:00:33.910> to<00:00:34.329> this<00:00:34.510> up

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
and what these are connected to this up

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.380 
and what these are connected to this up
here<00:00:35.110> you<00:00:35.320> can<00:00:35.469> see<00:00:35.500> that<00:00:36.040> when<00:00:36.760> they<00:00:36.969> get<00:00:37.210> in

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
here you can see that when they get in

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.540 
here you can see that when they get in
front<00:00:37.750> of<00:00:37.960> the<00:00:38.200> camera<00:00:38.649> that's<00:00:38.860> mounted<00:00:39.100> on

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
front of the camera that's mounted on

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.040 
front of the camera that's mounted on
top<00:00:39.879> of<00:00:39.910> the<00:00:40.210> TV

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
top of the TV

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.250 
top of the TV
that<00:00:41.469> blue<00:00:41.980> infrared<00:00:42.820> LED<00:00:43.420> light<00:00:43.719> aren't<00:00:44.110> that

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
that blue infrared LED light aren't that

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.069 
that blue infrared LED light aren't that
blue<00:00:44.530> LED<00:00:45.100> light<00:00:45.399> lights<00:00:45.760> up<00:00:46.030> and<00:00:46.690> what<00:00:46.870> that's

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
blue LED light lights up and what that's

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:50.400 
blue LED light lights up and what that's
basically<00:00:47.500> saying<00:00:47.829> is<00:00:48.160> it<00:00:48.489> sees<00:00:49.410> three

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
basically saying is it sees three

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.790 
basically saying is it sees three
infrared<00:00:51.219> LEDs<00:00:51.879> here<00:00:52.360> and<00:00:52.600> what<00:00:53.110> it<00:00:53.199> can<00:00:53.320> do<00:00:53.500> is

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
infrared LEDs here and what it can do is

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.010 
infrared LEDs here and what it can do is
it<00:00:53.829> can<00:00:54.129> triangulate<00:00:54.430> the<00:00:55.090> angle<00:00:55.629> that<00:00:55.870> your

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
it can triangulate the angle that your

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.290 
it can triangulate the angle that your
head<00:00:56.260> is<00:00:56.620> pointed<00:00:57.160> based<00:00:57.489> upon<00:00:57.789> where<00:00:58.030> those

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
head is pointed based upon where those

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.299 
head is pointed based upon where those
infrared<00:00:58.840> LEDs<00:00:59.379> are<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:02.079> I<00:01:02.500> have<00:01:02.859> a<00:01:02.890> program

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
infrared LEDs are so I have a program

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.469 
infrared LEDs are so I have a program
that's<00:01:04.149> running<00:01:04.540> on<00:01:04.839> this<00:01:05.229> that<00:01:05.680> helps

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
that's running on this that helps

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.570 
that's running on this that helps
visualize<00:01:08.130> what<00:01:09.130> that<00:01:09.400> data<00:01:09.729> looks<00:01:09.909> like<00:01:11.580> and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
visualize what that data looks like and

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.429 
visualize what that data looks like and
if<00:01:12.729> you'll<00:01:12.909> see<00:01:13.150> here<00:01:13.510> right<00:01:13.780> now<00:01:13.900> it<00:01:14.080> doesn't

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
if you'll see here right now it doesn't

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.859 
if you'll see here right now it doesn't
see<00:01:14.710> anything<00:01:15.010> but<00:01:15.909> when<00:01:16.090> I<00:01:16.119> put<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:16.659> headset

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
see anything but when I put the headset

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.530 
see anything but when I put the headset
in<00:01:17.290> front<00:01:17.619> of<00:01:17.740> it<00:01:17.890> it<00:01:18.869> makes<00:01:19.869> a<00:01:21.270> calculation<00:01:22.270> to

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
in front of it it makes a calculation to

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.740 
in front of it it makes a calculation to
determine<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:24.210> orientation<00:01:25.210> of<00:01:25.360> the<00:01:25.509> head

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
determine the orientation of the head

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.890 
determine the orientation of the head
based<00:01:26.110> upon<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:27.100> three<00:01:27.430> LEDs<00:01:27.970> it<00:01:28.240> says<00:01:28.509> it

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
based upon the three LEDs it says it

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.740 
based upon the three LEDs it says it
sees<00:01:29.560> so<00:01:30.310> when<00:01:30.729> I<00:01:30.759> look<00:01:31.060> up<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.329> the<00:01:31.720> left

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
sees so when I look up to the left

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.990 
sees so when I look up to the left
you'll<00:01:32.320> notice<00:01:32.740> that<00:01:32.920> it<00:01:33.159> points<00:01:33.610> up<00:01:33.759> to<00:01:33.909> the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
you'll notice that it points up to the

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.780 
you'll notice that it points up to the
left<00:01:34.240> when<00:01:34.540> I<00:01:34.570> look<00:01:34.930> down<00:01:35.710> to<00:01:36.040> the<00:01:36.070> right<00:01:36.189> it

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
left when I look down to the right it

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.160 
left when I look down to the right it
goes<00:01:37.090> down<00:01:37.390> to<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.720> right

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
goes down to the right

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.399 
goes down to the right
so<00:01:38.799> basically<00:01:39.729> when<00:01:40.240> I<00:01:40.270> have<00:01:40.600> the<00:01:40.750> headset<00:01:41.170> on

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
so basically when I have the headset on

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.929 
so basically when I have the headset on
and<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:43.000> look<00:01:43.299> at<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.509> TV<00:01:44.579> if<00:01:45.579> I'm<00:01:45.729> looking

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:45.939 
and I look at the TV if I'm looking

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.749 
and I look at the TV if I'm looking
directly<00:01:46.570> at<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:47.079> TV<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.710> dot<00:01:47.950> is<00:01:48.250> close<00:01:48.549> to

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
directly at the TV the dot is close to

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.420 
directly at the TV the dot is close to
the<00:01:48.880> center<00:01:49.090> if<00:01:49.659> I<00:01:49.869> look<00:01:50.170> to<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.560> left<00:01:50.829> side<00:01:51.130> of

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
the center if I look to the left side of

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.569 
the center if I look to the left side of
the<00:01:51.520> TV<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.540> dot<00:01:52.840> is<00:01:52.869> over<00:01:53.350> to<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:53.590> left<00:01:53.860> if<00:01:54.430> I

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
the TV the dot is over to the left if I

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.550 
the TV the dot is over to the left if I
look<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:54.939> the<00:01:55.060> right<00:01:55.270> side<00:01:55.540> of<00:01:55.810> the<00:01:55.960> TV<00:01:56.320> the

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560 
look to the right side of the TV the

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.620 
look to the right side of the TV the
table<00:01:56.770> is<00:01:56.950> over<00:01:57.100> the<00:01:57.280> right<00:01:57.460> and<00:01:57.759> that<00:01:58.119> data<00:01:58.420> is

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
table is over the right and that data is

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.020 
table is over the right and that data is
piped<00:01:59.170> because<00:01:59.860> it's<00:02:00.040> listening<00:02:00.310> over<00:02:00.700> X

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
piped because it's listening over X

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.730 
piped because it's listening over X
being<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:01.420> same<00:02:01.600> way<00:02:01.810> this<00:02:01.990> visualizer<00:02:02.560> is

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
being the same way this visualizer is

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.149 
being the same way this visualizer is
it's<00:02:03.750> taking<00:02:04.750> that<00:02:04.780> data<00:02:05.200> from<00:02:05.619> the<00:02:05.710> camera

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
it's taking that data from the camera

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:06.969 
it's taking that data from the camera
and<00:02:06.340> piping

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
and piping

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.029 
and piping
into<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:07.909> Xbox<00:02:08.360> controller<00:02:08.899> so<00:02:09.619> that<00:02:09.920> when

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
into the Xbox controller so that when

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.220 
into the Xbox controller so that when
I'm<00:02:10.129> looking<00:02:10.340> right<00:02:10.789> it<00:02:11.239> tells<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:11.870> Xbox

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
I'm looking right it tells the Xbox

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.490 
I'm looking right it tells the Xbox
controller<00:02:12.769> to<00:02:13.129> look<00:02:13.459> right<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:14.349> we'll<00:02:15.349> go

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500

you know you're used to using a normal

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.100 
you know you're used to using a normal
controller<00:05:03.840> and<00:05:05.240> you<00:05:06.240> know<00:05:06.390> it's<00:05:06.630> a<00:05:06.750> little

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
controller and you know it's a little

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.710 
controller and you know it's a little
bit<00:05:07.260> four<00:05:07.590> into<00:05:08.070> two<00:05:08.490> trying<00:05:08.909> to<00:05:09.030> control<00:05:09.479> the

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
bit four into two trying to control the

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.190 
bit four into two trying to control the
guy<00:05:09.870> this<00:05:10.140> way<00:05:10.880> but<00:05:11.880> you<00:05:12.090> can<00:05:12.270> see<00:05:12.510> that<00:05:12.810> you

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
guy this way but you can see that you

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.899 
guy this way but you can see that you
know<00:05:13.320> after<00:05:13.950> a<00:05:13.979> little<00:05:14.130> bit<00:05:14.310> of<00:05:14.400> practice<00:05:14.880> that

00:05:14.899 --> 00:05:14.909 
know after a little bit of practice that

00:05:14.909 --> 00:05:18.260 
know after a little bit of practice that
it's<00:05:15.330> pretty<00:05:15.599> easy<00:05:15.840> to<00:05:16.080> pick<00:05:16.260> up<00:05:16.880> it's<00:05:17.880> pretty

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
it's pretty easy to pick up it's pretty

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.600 
it's pretty easy to pick up it's pretty
intuitive<00:05:18.720> so<00:05:19.380> it's<00:05:19.830> not<00:05:20.010> like<00:05:20.220> you're<00:05:20.370> doing

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
intuitive so it's not like you're doing

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.510 
intuitive so it's not like you're doing
something<00:05:20.849> that<00:05:21.000> doesn't<00:05:21.150> make<00:05:21.690> sense<00:05:22.520> but

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
something that doesn't make sense but

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:28.670 
something that doesn't make sense but
it's<00:05:23.700> easy<00:05:23.849> fun<00:05:24.120> with<00:05:24.240> this<00:05:24.360> you<00:05:27.530> get<00:05:28.530> some

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
it's easy fun with this you get some

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.570 
it's easy fun with this you get some
kibbles<00:05:29.010> but<00:05:29.220> I<00:05:29.490> don't<00:05:30.479> so<00:05:30.780> this<00:05:31.050> is<00:05:31.260> the

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:31.580 
kibbles but I don't so this is the

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.610 
kibbles but I don't so this is the
controller<00:05:32.580> it's<00:05:33.090> completely<00:05:33.599> wireless<00:05:33.960> I

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:34.620 
controller it's completely wireless I

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.370 
controller it's completely wireless I
can<00:05:34.830> plug<00:05:35.039> the<00:05:35.190> headset<00:05:35.640> into<00:05:36.150> it<00:05:36.539> so<00:05:36.840> that<00:05:37.169> I

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
can plug the headset into it so that I

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.969 
can plug the headset into it so that I
can<00:05:37.890> talk<00:05:38.539> this<00:05:39.539> is<00:05:39.599> the<00:05:39.870> headset<00:05:40.080> which<00:05:40.710> just

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:40.979 
can talk this is the headset which just

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:43.310 
can talk this is the headset which just
has<00:05:41.220> three<00:05:41.580> high-powered<00:05:42.419> infrared<00:05:42.570> LEDs

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:43.320 
has three high-powered infrared LEDs

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.500 
has three high-powered infrared LEDs
right<00:05:43.950> now<00:05:44.159> I<00:05:44.190> have<00:05:44.580> the<00:05:44.729> power<00:05:44.940> we're<00:05:45.270> going

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:45.510 
right now I have the power we're going

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:47.779 
right now I have the power we're going
over<00:05:45.690> the<00:05:45.960> attachment<00:05:46.890> cable<00:05:47.340> just<00:05:47.550> because

00:05:47.779 --> 00:05:47.789 
over the attachment cable just because

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:49.790 
over the attachment cable just because
it's<00:05:48.240> a<00:05:48.390> little<00:05:48.630> bit<00:05:48.750> simpler<00:05:49.110> than<00:05:49.409> running<00:05:49.650> a

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
it's a little bit simpler than running a

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.880 
it's a little bit simpler than running a
battery<00:05:50.280> to<00:05:50.460> it<00:05:50.930> and<00:05:51.930> that's<00:05:52.260> the<00:05:52.470> complete

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
battery to it and that's the complete

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.370 
battery to it and that's the complete
hardware<00:05:53.430> aside<00:05:54.210> from<00:05:54.570> this<00:05:54.780> piece<00:05:55.080> right

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
hardware aside from this piece right

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.630 
hardware aside from this piece right
here<00:05:55.640> which<00:05:56.640> is<00:05:57.060> the<00:05:57.349> the<00:05:58.349> infrared<00:05:59.010> camera

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
here which is the the infrared camera

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.990 
here which is the the infrared camera
which<00:05:59.909> feeds<00:06:00.240> the<00:06:00.450> data<00:06:00.860> to<00:06:01.860> the<00:06:02.280> controller

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
which feeds the data to the controller

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.600 
which feeds the data to the controller
and<00:06:03.930> just<00:06:04.169> sits<00:06:04.349> on<00:06:04.500> top<00:06:04.710> of<00:06:04.770> your<00:06:04.919> TV<00:06:05.280> and<00:06:05.310> just

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
and just sits on top of your TV and just

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.530 
and just sits on top of your TV and just
plugs<00:06:05.880> in<00:06:06.060> for<00:06:06.240> power<00:06:06.390> thanks<00:06:07.020> for<00:06:07.200> watching
