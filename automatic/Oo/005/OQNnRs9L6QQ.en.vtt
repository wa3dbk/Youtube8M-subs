00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.379
 because with all the info I have 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.550
 could give last week on the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.290
 books as well as the craze 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.049
 exceptional around the contest you 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.519
 have been more than 250 to participate eh 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.450

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.160
 trapped 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.930
 so first of all can start that 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.939
 is the two books are available 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.490

 according to the booksellers 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.410
 so as I know that the choice of 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.900
 the camera is also a 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.309
 big question for a lot of in between 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.370

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.170

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.520
 which you will learn the differences 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.370
 between the types of devices whose 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.050
 compact hybrid reflex bridge I you 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.789
 would also say what is the criterion to 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.500
 look to not be disappointed in 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.850
 particular in the market a little 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.020
 complex a desire nothing I know it's 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.390
 not very clear for a lot of 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.120
 you are also seen together at what 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.579
 type of device is suitable for your needs 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.770
