00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 my employer and margaux I am a scientific expert at bordeaux in the laboratory 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.460
 analyzed and appraised an investigator 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.810
 hervé bonnet by the afp 21h21 his lowered note of christmas bernard accoyer c'est 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.970
 in fact a dead a boarding school to a collector and especially he comes from 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:17.329
 sign every moment 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.769
 and the one who made me discover the paintings of the painter and thus to execute 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.699
 strikes and she among all he had his ticket but seems not in 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:27.699
 professional training at the site by maroua t the material itself 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:30.749
 since it allows Israeli Arabs also this morning 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:34.250
 actually constitutes and then at the center to us at the instigation of their expertise 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.990
 and their ideas 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.360
 and I think that finally definitive and there the talent of each leaves out of 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.790
 residents this faculty after the tragedy masterfully both the 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.450
 material 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.580
 it's clear 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.230
 and I would be delighted to discover the new singing school people 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:53.230
 bearers of this next visit to bordeaux 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.630
 poutine I am 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.630
 ethias because I'm project manager 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.580
 and 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.100
 we are since 1980 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.100
 planted in the chartrons district 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.460
 our job is to walk a small net on a corner 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.960
 a student later through the surface 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.940
 you are right of work 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.330
 what makes the essence 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:23.430
 artist 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.270
 in order to thwart work 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.300
 we will analyze the composition to score 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.440
 constitutive the Lyonnais have only a hurry to find 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.640
 the star 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.640
 experience creativity 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.960
 I consider our work that is very simple this meaning 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.530
 and that's a chance 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.440
 because a lot of problems because it is 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.870
 great creators of great artists and very beautiful sisters 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.929
 who sometimes 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.210
 not very noble it is the case for example of the first drawings 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.850
 around him 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.100
 but he saw his sales of writing 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.550
 surprise 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.720
 but it can also be the non 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.150
 there will be no target 5 6 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:09.709
 so everyone 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.949
 as many great creators of 30 artists 

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:15.949
 6 in their own way 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:20.729
 forge another evolution of our humanity 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.139
 with ease 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:26.479
 that his men 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:27.939
 of this survey 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.159
 are as important and caribean as much information 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:34.769
 that diabetic patients 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.349
 so will you tell me 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.249
 through all this starts again the work of Charles Carson 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:42.239
 obviously if needed 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.629
 bouchard 5 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.529
 as contraindicated during his lifetime the artist 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:50.539
 so we know for a fact that maintaining it 

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:54.069
 will participate in forging your evolution our humanity 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:56.979
 and something extremely 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:03:00.029
 to nothing 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:02.029
 each person 

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:03.879
 very rare 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.599
 his fair work 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:07.819
 nobody 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.859
 what have tagged 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.079
 I did not make any mistakes 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.669
 and as I stop 

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:19.329
 between abstract art and figurative and blue art therefore taking a little time 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.149
 to keep me busy 

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:24.729
 its impact is extinguished 

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:30.179
 it's a super position of bessan color forms matter 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.909
 if to create a blog where you are alone 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:35.629
 who is life 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.629
 richard and who creates a world often 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:45.559
 thirty firefighters and the same fate of the great artists and each person 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:48.399
 béchard to sète 

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:50.799
 its impact is German 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:53.799
 a bit peculiar that do know by experience 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:57.419
 the broker is very complex 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:58.769
 but it is also 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.450
 which defines the quality of the artist and the quality of our great artists 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.700
 in this case, a great artist
