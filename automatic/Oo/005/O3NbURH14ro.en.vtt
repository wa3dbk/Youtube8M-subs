Roby<00:00:06.359> ami<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.930> next<00:00:07.319> level<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:07.710> virtual

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
Roby ami the next level of virtual

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.280 
Roby ami the next level of virtual
reality<00:00:08.189> gaming<00:00:09.000> yeah<00:00:09.690> that's<00:00:09.900> right<00:00:10.050> it's<00:00:10.230> a

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
reality gaming yeah that's right it's a

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.740 
reality gaming yeah that's right it's a
big<00:00:10.410> piece<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.620> equipment<00:00:11.190> but<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.370> think<00:00:11.610> it

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:11.750 
big piece of equipment but I think it

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.320 
big piece of equipment but I think it
fills<00:00:12.750> a<00:00:13.590> void<00:00:14.309> that<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.610> there<00:00:14.790> right<00:00:14.969> now<00:00:15.150> how

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
fills a void that is there right now how

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.910 
fills a void that is there right now how
do<00:00:15.389> you<00:00:15.450> physically<00:00:15.900> walk<00:00:16.109> around<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:16.830> a

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
do you physically walk around in a

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.349 
do you physically walk around in a
virtual<00:00:17.279> world<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:18.000> solves<00:00:18.300> that

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
virtual world and this solves that

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.890 
virtual world and this solves that
problem

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
problem

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.960 
problem
now<00:00:19.170> we<00:00:19.230> have<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.470> headset<00:00:19.740> like<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.670> rift<00:00:20.850> that

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
now we have a headset like the rift that

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.570 
now we have a headset like the rift that
works<00:00:21.150> really<00:00:21.330> well<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:22.490> tracking<00:00:23.490> devices

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
works really well and tracking devices

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.250 
works really well and tracking devices
have<00:00:24.029> become<00:00:24.090> affordable<00:00:24.480> such<00:00:24.869> as<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.019> Razer

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
have become affordable such as a Razer

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.040 
have become affordable such as a Razer
Hydra<00:00:25.609> King<00:00:26.609> act<00:00:26.760> works<00:00:26.970> well<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.570> this<00:00:27.990> is

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
Hydra King act works well and this is

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.750 
Hydra King act works well and this is
the<00:00:28.199> next<00:00:28.410> step<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.859> takes<00:00:29.099> virtual<00:00:29.519> reality

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
the next step this takes virtual reality

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.970 
the next step this takes virtual reality
to<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.970> next<00:00:30.240> level<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:31.439> allows<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:31.890> to

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
to the next level this allows you to

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.340 
to the next level this allows you to
walk<00:00:32.130> freely<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.759> naturally<00:00:33.110> in<00:00:34.110> your

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
walk freely and naturally in your

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.680 
walk freely and naturally in your
favorite<00:00:34.680> game<00:00:34.920> no<00:00:35.670> more<00:00:35.940> just<00:00:36.270> sitting<00:00:36.540> down

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
favorite game no more just sitting down

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.920 
favorite game no more just sitting down
using<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.350> mouse<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.680> keyboard<00:00:38.690> this<00:00:39.690> gives

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
using a mouse and keyboard this gives

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.360 
using a mouse and keyboard this gives
you<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> true<00:00:40.320> virtual<00:00:40.620> reality<00:00:40.890> experience

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
you the true virtual reality experience

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.220 
you the true virtual reality experience
where<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.550> just<00:00:41.730> walk<00:00:42.329> around<00:00:42.540> or<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.020> run

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
where you just walk around or you run

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.619 
where you just walk around or you run
your<00:00:43.469> jump<00:00:43.770> your<00:00:43.950> crops<00:00:44.450> whatever<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.570> would

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
your jump your crops whatever you would

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.869 
your jump your crops whatever you would
like<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.899> do<00:00:46.050> all<00:00:46.260> within<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.670> could

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
like to do all within that so you could

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.900 
like to do all within that so you could
really<00:00:48.030> moonwalk<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.690> there<00:00:48.890> well<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.579> ideas

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
really moonwalk in there well the ideas

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.389 
really moonwalk in there well the ideas
are<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.149> mimics<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.660> natural<00:00:52.050> gates<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.250> we

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
are the mimics and natural gates so we

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.500 
are the mimics and natural gates so we
will<00:00:53.489> try<00:00:53.699> to<00:00:53.870> do<00:00:54.870> some<00:00:55.110> local<00:00:55.230> ocean<00:00:55.469> surface

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
will try to do some local ocean surface

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.760 
will try to do some local ocean surface
really<00:00:57.510> try<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.670> forget<00:00:59.670> it

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
really try to forget it

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:13.200 
really try to forget it
 you<00:01:01.580> mimic<00:01:01.880> visit<00:01:02.480> your<00:01:02.630> Lobby

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.670 

the<00:01:14.210> rationale<00:01:15.640> so<00:01:16.640> it<00:01:16.759> has<00:01:16.939> no<00:01:17.119> reforms<00:01:17.750> I'm

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
the rationale so it has no reforms I'm

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.230 
the rationale so it has no reforms I'm
guessing<00:01:19.100> this<00:01:19.280> is<00:01:19.340> going<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:19.970> become<00:01:20.210> the

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
guessing this is going to become the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.649 
guessing this is going to become the
next<00:01:20.509> piece<00:01:20.899> of<00:01:21.049> exercise<00:01:21.320> equipment<00:01:21.530> because

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
next piece of exercise equipment because

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.999 
next piece of exercise equipment because
heats<00:01:23.659> are<00:01:23.810> gonna<00:01:23.930> lose<00:01:24.110> so<00:01:24.320> much<00:01:24.439> weight<00:01:24.500> on

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:25.009 
heats are gonna lose so much weight on

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.620 
heats are gonna lose so much weight on
this<00:01:25.189> thing<00:01:25.520> that's<00:01:25.939> what<00:01:26.090> I'm<00:01:26.210> actually<00:01:26.479> got

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
this thing that's what I'm actually got

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.050 
this thing that's what I'm actually got
a<00:01:26.659> quite<00:01:27.259> so<00:01:27.439> maker<00:01:27.619> is<00:01:27.830> from<00:01:28.159> corporations

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
a quite so maker is from corporations

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.550 
a quite so maker is from corporations
the<00:01:29.420> most<00:01:29.570> raw<00:01:29.720> media<00:01:29.929> has<00:01:30.170> covered<00:01:30.380> the

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
the most raw media has covered the

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.190 
the most raw media has covered the
fitness<00:01:30.950> and<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.159> exercise<00:01:31.520> market<00:01:32.200> because

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
fitness and the exercise market because

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.270 
fitness and the exercise market because
people<00:01:33.229> indeed<00:01:33.560> see<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:33.830> potential<00:01:34.130> for

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
people indeed see the potential for

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.179 
people indeed see the potential for
exercise<00:01:35.409> to<00:01:36.409> make<00:01:36.590> fitness<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:37.130> exercise

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
exercise to make fitness and exercise

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.630 
exercise to make fitness and exercise
more<00:01:37.429> fun<00:01:37.909> more<00:01:38.240> engaging<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:38.929> I<00:01:39.679> think<00:01:40.310> it

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
more fun more engaging and I think it

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.249 
more fun more engaging and I think it
has<00:01:40.789> potential<00:01:41.090> beyond<00:01:41.390> gaming<00:01:41.720> exercise

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
has potential beyond gaming exercise

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:44.969 
has potential beyond gaming exercise
fitness<00:01:42.500> but<00:01:43.100> also<00:01:43.130> training<00:01:43.789> simulation

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.220 

we<00:02:29.370> use<00:02:29.550> a<00:02:29.580> Kinect<00:02:29.970> right<00:02:30.150> now<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.570> track<00:02:30.900> the

we use a Kinect right now to track the
walking<00:02:31.590> motion<00:02:31.740> so<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.130> Kinect<00:02:32.430> tracks<00:02:32.760> the

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940

I'd<00:05:22.180> assume<00:05:22.510> you've<00:05:22.750> been<00:05:23.350> in<00:05:23.470> the<00:05:23.560> world<00:05:23.830> of

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
I'd assume you've been in the world of

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.480 
I'd assume you've been in the world of
VR<00:05:24.510> so<00:05:25.510> to<00:05:25.570> speak<00:05:25.840> for<00:05:26.110> a<00:05:26.140> while<00:05:26.230> and<00:05:26.560> yeah<00:05:27.190> and

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
VR so to speak for a while and yeah and

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.980 
VR so to speak for a while and yeah and
this<00:05:27.790> has<00:05:27.970> been<00:05:28.150> a<00:05:28.260> result<00:05:29.260> of<00:05:30.480> my<00:05:31.480> passion

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:31.990 
this has been a result of my passion

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:33.990 
this has been a result of my passion
really<00:05:32.140> my<00:05:32.470> Susan<00:05:33.160> for<00:05:33.280> virtual<00:05:33.550> reality<00:05:33.580> I

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:34.000 
really my Susan for virtual reality I

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.090 
really my Susan for virtual reality I
started<00:05:34.600> focusing<00:05:34.780> on<00:05:35.080> how<00:05:35.470> to<00:05:35.500> solve<00:05:35.919> the

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
started focusing on how to solve the

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.490 
started focusing on how to solve the
problem<00:05:37.000> of<00:05:37.060> locomotion<00:05:37.510> how<00:05:37.870> to<00:05:37.930> be<00:05:38.200> able<00:05:38.290> to

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
problem of locomotion how to be able to

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.000 
problem of locomotion how to be able to
walk<00:05:39.010> around<00:05:39.190> in<00:05:39.640> a<00:05:39.700> virtual<00:05:39.820> world<00:05:40.210> and<00:05:41.010> now

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
walk around in a virtual world and now

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.740 
walk around in a virtual world and now
here<00:05:42.280> we<00:05:42.340> are<00:05:42.370> two<00:05:42.610> years<00:05:42.640> later<00:05:42.820> we<00:05:43.480> came<00:05:43.630> up

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
here we are two years later we came up

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.100 
here we are two years later we came up
with<00:05:43.930> with<00:05:44.200> the<00:05:44.800> Omni<00:05:45.160> which<00:05:45.850> I<00:05:46.000> think<00:05:46.270> solves

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
with with the Omni which I think solves

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.500 
with with the Omni which I think solves
a<00:05:47.200> problem<00:05:47.350> in<00:05:47.710> a<00:05:48.130> way<00:05:48.160> that<00:05:48.520> is<00:05:48.669> affordable

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
a problem in a way that is affordable

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.000 
a problem in a way that is affordable
for<00:05:49.660> consumer<00:05:50.260> it<00:05:50.320> fits<00:05:50.530> in<00:05:50.650> a<00:05:50.710> living<00:05:50.980> room

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
for consumer it fits in a living room

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:54.030 
for consumer it fits in a living room
and<00:05:51.430> above<00:05:52.419> all<00:05:52.600> it<00:05:52.720> just<00:05:52.960> allows<00:05:53.590> you<00:05:53.740> to<00:05:53.860> walk

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
and above all it just allows you to walk

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.920 
and above all it just allows you to walk
freely<00:05:54.370> and<00:05:54.550> naturally<00:05:54.669> in<00:05:55.180> a<00:05:55.419> virtual<00:05:55.780> world

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
freely and naturally in a virtual world

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.750 
freely and naturally in a virtual world
you<00:05:56.080> see<00:05:56.320> that<00:05:56.470> was<00:05:56.590> the<00:05:56.800> I<00:05:57.130> mean<00:05:57.580> it<00:05:57.669> was

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
you see that was the I mean it was

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.610 
you see that was the I mean it was
interesting<00:05:58.180> having<00:05:58.840> used<00:05:59.020> the<00:05:59.140> oculus<00:05:59.590> rift

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
interesting having used the oculus rift

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:02.940 
interesting having used the oculus rift
sitting<00:06:00.310> down<00:06:00.460> with<00:06:00.910> a<00:06:01.210> game<00:06:01.900> controller<00:06:02.380> this

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950 
sitting down with a game controller this

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:04.470 
sitting down with a game controller this
was<00:06:03.160> a<00:06:03.370> completely<00:06:04.150> different<00:06:04.270> experience

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:04.480 
was a completely different experience

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.930 
was a completely different experience
same<00:06:05.320> same<00:06:05.560> product<00:06:06.280> I<00:06:06.310> mean<00:06:06.430> the<00:06:06.490> oculus<00:06:06.850> rift

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940 
same same product I mean the oculus rift

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.720 
same same product I mean the oculus rift
but<00:06:07.120> this<00:06:07.480> transformed<00:06:08.410> the<00:06:09.280> oculus<00:06:09.700> rift

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
but this transformed the oculus rift

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.900 
but this transformed the oculus rift
experience<00:06:10.570> into<00:06:10.930> I<00:06:10.960> think<00:06:11.610> more<00:06:12.610> of<00:06:12.640> what<00:06:12.820> it

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 
experience into I think more of what it

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.290 
experience into I think more of what it
should<00:06:12.940> be<00:06:13.270> yeah<00:06:13.720> because<00:06:13.930> I<00:06:14.200> was<00:06:15.030> immersed<00:06:16.030> I

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
should be yeah because I was immersed I

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.420 
should be yeah because I was immersed I
mean<00:06:16.510> I<00:06:16.570> was<00:06:16.780> more<00:06:17.140> inside<00:06:17.770> the<00:06:18.070> thing<00:06:18.250> that<00:06:18.400> I

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
mean I was more inside the thing that I

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.570 
mean I was more inside the thing that I
thought<00:06:18.790> I<00:06:18.850> was<00:06:19.090> already<00:06:19.620> far<00:06:20.620> inside<00:06:21.100> of<00:06:21.310> when

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
thought I was already far inside of when

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:22.800 
thought I was already far inside of when
I<00:06:21.610> can<00:06:21.790> get<00:06:21.880> up<00:06:21.970> to<00:06:22.060> a<00:06:22.150> bit<00:06:22.330> with<00:06:22.479> the<00:06:22.570> oculus

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
I can get up to a bit with the oculus

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.790 
I can get up to a bit with the oculus
rift<00:06:22.930> because<00:06:23.680> they<00:06:23.800> play<00:06:24.039> to<00:06:24.100> me<00:06:24.340> if<00:06:24.430> I<00:06:24.520> had

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
rift because they play to me if I had

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.189 
rift because they play to me if I had
I<00:06:24.830> had<00:06:25.099> Mineo<00:06:25.669> to<00:06:25.849> move<00:06:26.000> naturally<00:06:26.659> and<00:06:26.930> then

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:27.199 
I had Mineo to move naturally and then

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:29.110 
I had Mineo to move naturally and then
walk<00:06:27.620> or<00:06:27.860> run<00:06:28.069> naturally<00:06:28.610> that<00:06:28.789> that<00:06:29.000> is

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
walk or run naturally that that is

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.969 
walk or run naturally that that is
really<00:06:29.360> what<00:06:29.509> keeps<00:06:29.539> your<00:06:30.139> brain<00:06:30.319> in<00:06:30.919> that

00:06:30.969 --> 00:06:30.979 
really what keeps your brain in that

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:33.129 
really what keeps your brain in that
virtual<00:06:31.639> world<00:06:31.669> instead<00:06:32.509> of<00:06:32.569> oh<00:06:32.840> my<00:06:33.020> I'm

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:33.139 
virtual world instead of oh my I'm

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:34.719 
virtual world instead of oh my I'm
pushing<00:06:33.409> a<00:06:33.470> button<00:06:33.770> that<00:06:33.800> doesn't<00:06:34.430> feel<00:06:34.550> right

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:34.729 
pushing a button that doesn't feel right

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:38.080 
pushing a button that doesn't feel right
yeah<00:06:35.090> it<00:06:35.270> was<00:06:35.300> easier<00:06:35.659> to<00:06:35.930> look<00:06:36.520> exactly<00:06:37.520> where

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
yeah it was easier to look exactly where

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.760 
yeah it was easier to look exactly where
I<00:06:38.120> wanted<00:06:38.449> to<00:06:38.539> shoot<00:06:38.720> rather<00:06:38.990> than<00:06:39.229> having<00:06:39.470> to

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:39.770 
I wanted to shoot rather than having to

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.850 
I wanted to shoot rather than having to
aim<00:06:40.009> control<00:06:40.990> your<00:06:41.990> eye<00:06:42.050> and<00:06:42.319> trying<00:06:42.650> to<00:06:42.740> get

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
aim control your eye and trying to get

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.969 
aim control your eye and trying to get
perfect<00:06:43.580> at<00:06:43.729> hit<00:06:44.389> it<00:06:44.509> I<00:06:44.599> never<00:06:45.110> had<00:06:45.349> a<00:06:45.620> full

00:06:45.969 --> 00:06:45.979 
perfect at hit it I never had a full

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:47.920 
perfect at hit it I never had a full
hand-eye<00:06:46.340> coordination<00:06:46.550> but<00:06:47.060> I<00:06:47.150> know<00:06:47.690> where

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930 
hand-eye coordination but I know where

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:48.460 
hand-eye coordination but I know where
I'm<00:06:48.020> looking

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:48.470 
I'm looking

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:50.439 
I'm looking
yeah<00:06:48.830> that<00:06:49.220> was<00:06:49.310> easier<00:06:49.639> if<00:06:49.909> you<00:06:50.120> want<00:06:50.270> to<00:06:50.330> see

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:50.449 
yeah that was easier if you want to see

00:06:50.449 --> 00:06:52.510 
yeah that was easier if you want to see
