91,000<00:00:36.090> coins<00:00:36.300> at<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> moment<00:00:36.930> but<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.320> course

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
91,000 coins at the moment but of course

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.380 
91,000 coins at the moment but of course
that<00:00:37.680> does<00:00:37.890> look<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.309> bit<00:00:38.340> better<00:00:38.700> than<00:00:39.090> you

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
that does look a bit better than you

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.299 
that does look a bit better than you
know<00:00:39.510> maybe<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.989> should<00:00:40.440> do<00:00:40.620> because<00:00:40.950> we<00:00:41.100> had

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
know maybe it should do because we had

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.889 
know maybe it should do because we had
one<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.730> burnouts<00:00:42.090> already<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.540> our<00:00:42.660> club

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
one of the burnouts already in our club

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.110 
one of the burnouts already in our club
and<00:00:43.110> we<00:00:44.010> simply<00:00:44.370> sold<00:00:44.550> him<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:44.969> looks

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
and we simply sold him on so it looks

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.819 
and we simply sold him on so it looks
like<00:00:45.180> we've<00:00:45.390> made<00:00:45.510> loads<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.050> profit<00:00:46.350> but<00:00:46.530> in

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
like we've made loads of profit but in

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.500 
like we've made loads of profit but in
realism<00:00:47.190> we've<00:00:47.520> probably<00:00:47.760> made<00:00:47.879> about<00:00:48.239> I

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
realism we've probably made about I

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.029 
realism we've probably made about I
think<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.870> 100k<00:00:49.379> profit<00:00:49.680> from<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.890> last

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
think I 100k profit from the last

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.619 
think I 100k profit from the last
episode<00:00:50.250> but<00:00:50.850> that's<00:00:51.030> still<00:00:51.180> pretty<00:00:51.329> good

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
episode but that's still pretty good

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.930 
episode but that's still pretty good
anyway<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.649> can<00:00:52.800> see<00:00:52.949> we're<00:00:53.309> going<00:00:53.430> into<00:00:53.789> a

anyway you can see we're going into a

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.240 
anyway you can see we're going into a
game<00:00:54.239> against<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.199> pretty<00:00:55.559> strong<00:00:55.949> looking

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
so we've got iron Robin stepping up to

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.429 
so we've got iron Robin stepping up to
take<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.430> one<00:01:32.640> will<00:01:33.090> he<00:01:33.299> put<00:01:33.509> it<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.840> let's

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
take this one will he put it in let's

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.440 
take this one will he put it in let's
have<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> look<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.310> course<00:01:35.670> he<00:01:35.790> does<00:01:36.000> bottom

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
have a look of course he does bottom

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.880 
have a look of course he does bottom
left<00:01:36.720> goalkeeper<00:01:37.110> actually<00:01:37.350> goes<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.740> right

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
left goalkeeper actually goes the right

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.560 
left goalkeeper actually goes the right
way<00:01:37.920> but<00:01:38.579> he<00:01:38.729> doesn't<00:01:39.030> get<00:01:39.119> there<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.329> time<00:01:39.420> I

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
way but he doesn't get there in time I

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.149 
way but he doesn't get there in time I
think<00:01:39.810> he<00:01:39.900> reacted<00:01:40.350> after<00:01:40.500> I'd<00:01:40.860> taken<00:01:41.040> the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
think he reacted after I'd taken the

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.980 
think he reacted after I'd taken the
penalty<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:41.850> course<00:01:42.030> he<00:01:42.270> wasn't<00:01:42.479> actually

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
penalty so of course he wasn't actually

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.090 
penalty so of course he wasn't actually
going<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.200> be<00:01:43.259> able<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.530> get<00:01:43.649> there<00:01:43.799> because<00:01:43.920> it

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
going to be able to get there because it

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.249 
going to be able to get there because it
was<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.399> well<00:01:44.610> taken<00:01:45.060> anyway<00:01:45.570> almost<00:01:46.020> score

fix went so well last episode on the
infant<00:02:10.770> burner<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.160> thought<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.459> know<00:02:11.580> what

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
infant burner I thought you know what

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.850 
infant burner I thought you know what
let's<00:02:12.360> give<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.599> another<00:02:12.810> try<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.319> pick<00:02:13.500> up

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
let's give it another try I pick up

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.050 
let's give it another try I pick up
all<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.010> burnouts<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.940> know

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.540 
all the burnouts that you know
reasonably<00:02:15.570> priced<00:02:16.170> between<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:16.770> think<00:02:17.430> it's

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
reasonably priced between I think it's

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.440 
reasonably priced between I think it's
like<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.970> hundred<00:02:18.530> 95k<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.770> about<00:02:19.920> 118<00:02:20.820> k<00:02:21.120> and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
like a hundred 95k and about 118 k and

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.610 
like a hundred 95k and about 118 k and
we're<00:02:21.630> going<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.900> be<00:02:21.960> looking<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.260> sell<00:02:22.470> them

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.650 
on again for that 135 k mark you can see
there's<00:02:25.530> two<00:02:25.680> there<00:02:25.920> for<00:02:26.070> 140<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.450> most

top nothing we can do about that Robbins
actually<00:05:49.890> falling<00:05:50.130> off<00:05:50.220> the<00:05:50.310> pace<00:05:50.490> a<00:05:50.520> little

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
actually falling off the pace a little

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.550 
actually falling off the pace a little
bit<00:05:50.850> he<00:05:51.120> had<00:05:51.240> got<00:05:51.479> i<00:05:51.510> think<00:05:51.780> it<00:05:51.840> was<00:05:51.900> 18<00:05:52.260> goals

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
bit he had got i think it was 18 goals

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.730 
bit he had got i think it was 18 goals
and<00:05:52.740> 13<00:05:52.890> games<00:05:53.370> he's<00:05:53.580> now<00:05:53.729> got<00:05:53.940> 23<00:05:54.810> goals<00:05:55.050> in<00:05:55.229> 24

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740

and 13 games he's now got 23 goals in 24
games<00:05:55.770> so<00:05:56.250> little<00:05:56.580> bit<00:05:56.669> less<00:05:56.850> than<00:05:56.880> one<00:05:57.270> gold

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
games so little bit less than one gold

games so little bit less than one gold
per<00:05:57.720> game<00:05:57.990> was<00:05:58.380> hoping<00:05:58.680> he<00:05:58.740> would<00:05:58.860> continue

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
per game was hoping he would continue

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
really difficult to lose and you can see

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.040 
really difficult to lose and you can see
when<00:06:26.820> goalkeepers<00:06:27.479> are<00:06:27.510> making<00:06:27.750> mistakes

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:29.760 
like this it's even easier he actually

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:31.430 
like this it's even easier he actually
bombed<00:06:30.180> that<00:06:30.419> one<00:06:30.479> into<00:06:30.600> the<00:06:30.900> back<00:06:31.050> of<00:06:31.080> the<00:06:31.260> net
