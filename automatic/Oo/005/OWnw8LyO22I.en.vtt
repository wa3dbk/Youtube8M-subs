cover<00:04:12.690> so<00:04:13.079> when<00:04:13.229> you're<00:04:13.319> playing<00:04:13.470> on<00:04:13.590> the

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
cover so when you're playing on the

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.220 
cover so when you're playing on the
highest<00:04:13.949> difficulty<00:04:14.340> back<00:04:14.970> in

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
highest difficulty back in

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.199 
highest difficulty back in
really<00:04:15.620> frustrating<00:04:16.250> it<00:04:16.400> My<00:04:16.760> partner<00:04:16.940> and<00:04:17.150> I

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
really frustrating it My partner and I

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.819 
really frustrating it My partner and I
probably<00:04:17.449> had<00:04:17.720> to<00:04:17.810> repeat<00:04:18.260> that<00:04:18.410> section<00:04:18.949> 30

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
probably had to repeat that section 30

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.780 
probably had to repeat that section 30
on<00:04:21.829> the<00:04:22.040> highest<00:04:22.280> difficulty

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
on the highest difficulty

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.550 
on the highest difficulty

things<00:06:24.380> that<00:06:24.770> they<00:06:25.040> didn't<00:06:25.460> fix<00:06:25.730> for<00:06:26.090> instance

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:26.450 
things that they didn't fix for instance

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.470 
things that they didn't fix for instance
your<00:06:26.930> teammate<00:06:27.410> AI<00:06:27.680> in<00:06:28.190> single-player<00:06:28.910> or<00:06:29.210> in

your teammate AI in single-player or in

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.930 
your teammate AI in single-player or in
co-op<00:06:29.810> is<00:06:30.080> really<00:06:30.680> not<00:06:30.830> very<00:06:30.860> good<00:06:31.310> he<00:06:31.760> got

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
co-op is really not very good he got

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.730 
co-op is really not very good he got
better<00:06:32.120> in<00:06:32.390> Gears<00:06:32.600> of<00:06:32.720> War<00:06:32.780> 2<00:06:33.140> and<00:06:33.410> especially

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740 
better in Gears of War 2 and especially

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.830 
better in Gears of War 2 and especially

improvements<00:06:36.470> do<00:06:36.590> not<00:06:36.740> carry<00:06:37.010> over<00:06:37.070> this<00:06:37.460> one

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.760 
improvements do not carry over this one

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.400 
improvements do not carry over this one
and<00:06:38.030> that<00:06:38.210> means<00:06:38.420> that<00:06:38.690> your<00:06:38.840> teammates<00:06:39.200> will

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:39.410 
and that means that your teammates will

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:41.230 
and that means that your teammates will
not<00:06:39.590> revive<00:06:39.950> you<00:06:40.160> when<00:06:40.400> you<00:06:40.490> get<00:06:40.610> down<00:06:40.820> they

but<00:06:49.430> one<00:06:50.000> thing<00:06:50.210> I<00:06:50.300> noticed<00:06:50.630> is<00:06:50.840> that<00:06:51.230> in<00:06:51.770> the

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.040 
but one thing I noticed is that in the

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.460 
but one thing I noticed is that in the
area<00:06:52.400> where<00:06:52.760> rain<00:06:53.270> is<00:06:53.300> coming<00:06:53.570> down<00:06:53.720> rain

splashes<00:06:55.100> on<00:06:55.280> the<00:06:55.370> ground<00:06:55.580> but<00:06:55.790> it<00:06:55.850> does<00:06:56.000> not

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150 
splashes on the ground but it does not

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.600 
splashes on the ground but it does not
splash<00:06:56.510> on<00:06:56.720> your<00:06:56.810> characters<00:06:57.290> which<00:06:58.130> takes

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
splash on your characters which takes

splash on your characters which takes
away<00:06:58.850> from<00:06:58.880> the<00:06:59.180> feeling<00:06:59.510> that<00:06:59.600> it's<00:06:59.750> actually

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.110 
away from the feeling that it's actually

completely redone for this I could be

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.140 
completely redone for this I could be
wrong<00:07:10.070> but<00:07:10.130> it<00:07:10.340> seems<00:07:10.370> like<00:07:10.640> a<00:07:10.670> few<00:07:10.820> of<00:07:10.910> the<00:07:11.000> act

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.150 
wrong but it seems like a few of the act

wrong but it seems like a few of the act
1<00:07:11.390> cinematics<00:07:12.020> it's<00:07:12.410> a<00:07:12.470> little<00:07:12.710> faster<00:07:13.040> pace

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.250 
1 cinematics it's a little faster pace

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.920 
1 cinematics it's a little faster pace
than<00:07:13.490> they<00:07:13.640> really<00:07:13.850> should<00:07:14.090> be<00:07:14.240> but<00:07:14.660> my<00:07:14.780> real

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:14.930 
than they really should be but my real

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.930 
than they really should be but my real
problem<00:07:15.200> with<00:07:15.320> the<00:07:15.380> cinematics<00:07:15.860> is<00:07:16.130> a<00:07:16.160> few<00:07:16.910> of

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:16.940 
problem with the cinematics is a few of

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:18.640 
problem with the cinematics is a few of
the<00:07:17.090> minor<00:07:17.300> stranded<00:07:17.930> characters<00:07:18.350> that<00:07:18.560> you

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:18.650 
the minor stranded characters that you

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.200 
the minor stranded characters that you
need<00:07:18.800> in<00:07:19.100> the<00:07:19.220> middle<00:07:19.430> of<00:07:19.580> the<00:07:19.700> game<00:07:19.880> are

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:20.210 
need in the middle of the game are

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.060 
need in the middle of the game are
poorly<00:07:20.540> voiced<00:07:20.960> compared<00:07:21.530> to<00:07:21.650> all<00:07:21.770> the<00:07:21.920> other

poorly voiced compared to all the other

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.950 
poorly voiced compared to all the other
characters<00:07:22.640> this<00:07:23.180> seems<00:07:23.390> to<00:07:23.510> happen<00:07:23.660> because

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 
characters this seems to happen because

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.590 
characters this seems to happen because
they're<00:07:24.410> having<00:07:24.590> two<00:07:25.010> main<00:07:25.190> actors<00:07:25.730> voice<00:07:26.300> the

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 
side characters but those are all really

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.770 
side characters but those are all really
minor<00:07:28.700> complaints<00:07:29.270> and<00:07:29.360> they<00:07:29.480> don't<00:07:29.630> take
