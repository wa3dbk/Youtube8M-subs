00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.500
My name is Joel Diegert. I'm from America.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.500
My name is Damiano Grandesso. I'm Italian.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.000
My name is Pieter Pellens. I'm Belgian.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
My name is Alvaro Collao and I come from Chile.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
And I am Michal Knot. I'm Polish.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.000
We are basically classical musicians, 
but we are always looking for innovation.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Our early days were actually a little bit different.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.500
We started out playing in the streets of Vienna, often at the Opera.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.400
Unfortunately not inside.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.500
For our theatrical expertise, we were very lucky to work with
the fantastic actor and coach, Bernhard Rusch.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.700
We also had to improve our sense of space and balance.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:44.320
For ultimate concentration on stage, 
we've experimented with some meditation techniques.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.000
Feedback is very important for us.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
For this reason we decided to begin recording
our rehearsals for later analysis.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:20.599
We have to be in good shape for our concerts, 
so we have a special Navy SEALS training program.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.900
We would really like to release our first CD this year,

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.739
but in order to do that we need your help to raise the money. 
Please donate.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.100
And then it's...

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.900
SHOWTIME!!
