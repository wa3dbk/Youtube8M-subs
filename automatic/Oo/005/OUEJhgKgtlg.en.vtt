so not only will it read what the water

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.660 
so not only will it read what the water
looks<00:02:48.290> like<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.770> surface<00:02:49.010> temp<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:49.580> the

technology<00:03:13.190> we<00:03:13.640> talked<00:03:13.850> about<00:03:13.970> Wi-Fi<00:03:14.360> sonar

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
technology we talked about Wi-Fi sonar

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.380 
technology we talked about Wi-Fi sonar
in<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:15.980> sonar<00:03:16.310> phone<00:03:16.520> applications<00:03:17.150> but

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
in the sonar phone applications but

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.580 
in the sonar phone applications but
there's<00:03:17.570> another<00:03:17.720> option<00:03:17.989> out<00:03:18.320> there<00:03:18.350> from

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
there's another option out there from

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.340 
there's another option out there from
veksler<00:03:18.920> called<00:03:19.250> the<00:03:19.760> fish<00:03:20.060> phone<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:21.140> what

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
veksler called the fish phone and what

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.330 
veksler called the fish phone and what
this<00:03:21.500> is<00:03:21.770> this<00:03:22.280> is<00:03:22.489> Wi-Fi<00:03:23.350> underwater<00:03:24.350> camera

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
this is this is Wi-Fi underwater camera

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.040 
this is this is Wi-Fi underwater camera
technology<00:03:25.730> so<00:03:26.150> now<00:03:26.270> this<00:03:26.480> system<00:03:26.690> right<00:03:26.989> here

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
technology so now this system right here

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.260 
technology so now this system right here
as<00:03:27.380> you<00:03:27.530> see<00:03:27.739> it<00:03:27.890> is<00:03:28.370> not<00:03:28.700> attached<00:03:29.090> to

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
as you see it is not attached to

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.540 
as you see it is not attached to
anything<00:03:29.570> you<00:03:29.810> see<00:03:30.050> in<00:03:30.170> terms<00:03:30.200> of<00:03:30.620> a<00:03:30.830> monitor

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
anything you see in terms of a monitor

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.979 
anything you see in terms of a monitor
so<00:03:31.730> now<00:03:31.850> I<00:03:31.880> can<00:03:32.120> set<00:03:32.300> this<00:03:32.450> anywhere<00:03:32.810> on<00:03:32.870> my

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
so now I can set this anywhere on my

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:34.660 
so now I can set this anywhere on my
boat<00:03:33.200> out<00:03:33.500> on<00:03:33.920> the<00:03:34.010> ice<00:03:34.160> while<00:03:34.400> I'm<00:03:34.520> ice

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
boat out on the ice while I'm ice

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.090 
boat out on the ice while I'm ice
fishing<00:03:35.120> and<00:03:35.390> it's<00:03:35.750> got<00:03:35.900> a<00:03:35.930> transmitter<00:03:36.560> Wi-Fi

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
fishing and it's got a transmitter Wi-Fi

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.410 
fishing and it's got a transmitter Wi-Fi
box<00:03:37.430> so<00:03:37.640> then<00:03:37.760> it<00:03:37.880> fits

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
box so then it fits

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.530 
box so then it fits
Kitt's<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:38.900> signal<00:03:39.650> from<00:03:40.190> this<00:03:40.400> back<00:03:41.180> to<00:03:41.390> my

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
Kitt's the signal from this back to my

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
it's truly revolutionary and in the boat

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.270 
it's truly revolutionary and in the boat
the<00:03:53.239> same<00:03:53.450> thing<00:03:53.750> both<00:03:54.350> boomer<00:03:54.739> and<00:03:54.860> myself

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
and two buddies on shore can watch what

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.440 
and two buddies on shore can watch what
we're<00:03:58.130> seeing<00:03:58.310> out<00:03:58.459> here<00:03:58.519> under<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:58.940> water<00:03:59.060> so

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
we're seeing out here under the water so

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.260 
we're seeing out here under the water so
this<00:03:59.959> is

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:00.270 
this is

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.120 
this is
cool<00:04:00.570> cutting-edge<00:04:00.990> stuff<00:04:01.290> yeah<00:04:01.590> I<00:04:01.830> tell<00:04:02.040> you

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
cool cutting-edge stuff yeah I tell you

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.650 
cool cutting-edge stuff yeah I tell you
Mac<00:04:02.310> you<00:04:02.490> really<00:04:02.760> hit<00:04:02.910> it<00:04:03.030> on<00:04:03.120> the<00:04:03.180> head<00:04:03.300> with

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
Mac you really hit it on the head with

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.600 
Mac you really hit it on the head with
some<00:04:03.900> of<00:04:03.990> the<00:04:04.080> technology<00:04:04.440> that's<00:04:04.800> out<00:04:05.190> there

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
some of the technology that's out there

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.140 
some of the technology that's out there
I<00:04:05.640> think<00:04:06.240> the<00:04:06.360> key<00:04:06.600> piece<00:04:06.900> that<00:04:06.930> seems<00:04:07.770> to<00:04:08.070> be

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
I think the key piece that seems to be

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.400 
I think the key piece that seems to be
stemming<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:09.210> lot<00:04:09.390> of<00:04:09.540> success<00:04:09.870> out<00:04:10.020> there<00:04:10.080> is

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
stemming a lot of success out there is

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.440 
stemming a lot of success out there is
the<00:04:10.590> word<00:04:10.770> Wi-Fi<00:04:11.460> Brooke<00:04:11.910> because<00:04:12.120> when

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
the word Wi-Fi Brooke because when

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.600 
the word Wi-Fi Brooke because when
you're<00:04:12.570> using<00:04:12.750> Wi-Fi<00:04:13.190> technology<00:04:14.190> versus

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
you're using Wi-Fi technology versus

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.930 
you're using Wi-Fi technology versus
Bluetooth<00:04:15.090> Wi-Fi<00:04:15.720> allows<00:04:16.380> multiple<00:04:17.010> users<00:04:17.910> to

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
Bluetooth Wi-Fi allows multiple users to

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.330 
Bluetooth Wi-Fi allows multiple users to
see<00:04:18.450> what's<00:04:18.750> going<00:04:19.049> on<00:04:19.200> some<00:04:20.010> of<00:04:20.040> the<00:04:20.190> other

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
see what's going on some of the other

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.130 
see what's going on some of the other
ways<00:04:20.520> that<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:20.820> can<00:04:21.090> connect<00:04:21.450> like<00:04:21.660> Bluetooth

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
ways that you can connect like Bluetooth

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.680 
ways that you can connect like Bluetooth

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
maybe one or two Wi-Fi you can get as

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.380 
maybe one or two Wi-Fi you can get as
many<00:04:24.870> devices<00:04:25.380> to<00:04:25.710> this<00:04:25.860> so<00:04:26.460> Matt<00:04:26.820> drops<00:04:27.180> this

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390

two<00:04:36.690> people<00:04:36.930> from<00:04:37.260> shore<00:04:37.950> if<00:04:38.160> we<00:04:38.280> give<00:04:38.460> him<00:04:38.580> the

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
two people from shore if we give him the

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.360 
two people from shore if we give him the
code<00:04:39.300> could<00:04:39.540> connect<00:04:39.930> so<00:04:40.140> it<00:04:40.620> works<00:04:40.890> with<00:04:41.100> all

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370

iOS Android no that's pretty cool and I
guess<00:04:45.180> that's<00:04:45.420> very<00:04:45.600> cutting<00:04:45.870> edge<00:04:45.930> and<00:04:46.140> me<00:04:46.350> as
