yes<00:03:39.239> 25<00:03:39.840> harvesters<00:03:40.670> 223<00:03:41.670> how<00:03:42.180> many<00:03:42.420> more

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
yes 25 harvesters 223 how many more

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.540 
yes 25 harvesters 223 how many more
mistakes<00:03:42.780> will<00:03:43.230> i<00:03:43.260> make<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.770> it<00:03:44.280> looks<00:03:44.489> like

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
mistakes will i make and it looks like

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.890 
mistakes will i make and it looks like
white<00:03:44.850> were<00:03:45.030> actually<00:03:45.360> going<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.540> open<00:03:45.810> up

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
white were actually going to open up

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.590 
white were actually going to open up
with<00:03:46.050> a<00:03:46.080> four-game<00:03:46.940> question<00:03:47.940> is<00:03:48.060> where<00:03:48.420> will

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
with a four-game question is where will
