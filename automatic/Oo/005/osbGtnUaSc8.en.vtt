00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
hello guys and welcome to another

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.110 
hello guys and welcome to another
technical<00:00:12.929> micro<00:00:13.410> dimension<00:00:13.830> here<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.250> this

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
technical micro dimension here and this

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.029 
technical micro dimension here and this
is<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.299> four-way<00:00:15.750> Minecraft<00:00:16.230> intersection<00:00:16.859> I

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
is a four-way Minecraft intersection I

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.130 
is a four-way Minecraft intersection I
recently<00:00:17.730> designed<00:00:18.119> also<00:00:18.750> together<00:00:18.930> with

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
recently designed also together with

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.050 
recently designed also together with
spire<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.710> Kapil<00:00:20.070> is<00:00:20.100> helping<00:00:20.430> me<00:00:20.640> to<00:00:20.850> test

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
spire and Kapil is helping me to test

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.490 
spire and Kapil is helping me to test
out<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.859> yeah<00:00:22.859> it's<00:00:23.070> meant<00:00:23.850> for<00:00:24.269> just<00:00:25.050> my

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
out this and yeah it's meant for just my

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.220 
out this and yeah it's meant for just my
cards<00:00:25.920> yeah<00:00:26.609> complex<00:00:27.180> white<00:00:27.359> card<00:00:27.599> into<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
cards yeah complex white card into the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.120 
cards yeah complex white card into the
station<00:00:29.160> system<00:00:29.580> in<00:00:29.900> your<00:00:30.900> world<00:00:31.470> where<00:00:31.980> you

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
station system in your world where you

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.970 
station system in your world where you
can<00:00:32.369> travel<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.420> each<00:00:33.570> direction<00:00:33.840> yes<00:00:34.710> on<00:00:34.950> a

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
can travel in each direction yes on a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.830 
can travel in each direction yes on a
separate<00:00:35.399> line<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.120> advantage<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.780> that

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
separate line and the advantage of that

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.450 
separate line and the advantage of that
is<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.320> can<00:00:37.469> use<00:00:37.649> these<00:00:37.829> curved<00:00:38.250> power

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
is that you can use these curved power

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.830 
is that you can use these curved power
rails<00:00:38.760> where<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.149> can<00:00:39.300> see<00:00:39.450> Cowboys

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
rails where you can see Cowboys

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.600 
rails where you can see Cowboys
traveling<00:00:40.200> almost<00:00:40.559> twice<00:00:40.800> as<00:00:40.829> fast<00:00:41.219> or<00:00:41.430> pretty

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
traveling almost twice as fast or pretty

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.610 
traveling almost twice as fast or pretty
much<00:00:41.760> twice<00:00:41.969> as<00:00:42.149> fast<00:00:42.360> as<00:00:42.570> on<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> regular<00:00:43.440> power

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
much twice as fast as on a regular power

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.310 
much twice as fast as on a regular power
rail<00:00:43.829> and<00:00:44.460> he<00:00:44.670> turns<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:45.629> these<00:00:45.809> curved<00:00:46.079> rails

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
rail and he turns on these curved rails

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.229 
rail and he turns on these curved rails
but<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.370> only<00:00:47.520> use<00:00:47.789> them<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.120> one

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
but you can only use them in one

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.880 
but you can only use them in one
direction<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.780> have<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.140> have<00:00:49.469> an<00:00:49.710> in

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
direction so you have to have an in

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.369 
direction so you have to have an in
going<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.219> an<00:00:50.309> outgoing<00:00:50.579> line<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.030> boost<00:00:51.390> um

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
going in an outgoing line and boost um

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.090 
going in an outgoing line and boost um
so<00:00:53.750> there<00:00:54.750> comes<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.170> difficulty<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.710> set<00:00:56.010> up

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
so there comes the difficulty to set up

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.670 
so there comes the difficulty to set up
a<00:00:56.190> system<00:00:56.399> where<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.449> yet<00:00:57.809> decide<00:00:58.140> if<00:00:58.530> you

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
a system where you can yet decide if you

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.470 
a system where you can yet decide if you
want<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.890> go<00:00:58.980> left<00:00:59.280> or<00:00:59.520> right<00:00:59.579> or<00:01:00.030> just<00:01:00.300> go

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
want to go left or right or just go

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.520 
want to go left or right or just go
straight<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.050> hit<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.199> four-way

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
straight if you hit a four-way

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.439 
straight if you hit a four-way
intersection<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> easiest<00:01:03.270> I

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
intersection and this is the easiest I

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.609 
intersection and this is the easiest I
came<00:01:03.629> up<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:03.809> so<00:01:04.199> far

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
came up with so far

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.390 
came up with so far
so<00:01:05.150> you<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.360> see<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:07.590> have<00:01:07.619> these<00:01:08.070> different

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
so you can see you have these different

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.250 
so you can see you have these different
colored<00:01:09.030> road<00:01:09.630> blocks<00:01:09.900> here<00:01:10.110> they<00:01:10.229> just

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
colored road blocks here they just

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.590 
colored road blocks here they just
indicate<00:01:10.830> very<00:01:11.040> actual<00:01:11.460> switches<00:01:12.150> are<00:01:12.299> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
indicate very actual switches are the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.750 
indicate very actual switches are the
design<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.200> soul-search<00:01:13.680> room<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.100> well

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
design of the soul-search room is well

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.840 
design of the soul-search room is well
it's<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.330> very<00:01:16.130> furiously<00:01:17.130> guys<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.790> to

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
it's just very furiously guys so to

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.149 
it's just very furiously guys so to
speak<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.420> actually<00:01:19.080> encourage<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.920> just

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
speak and actually encourage you to just

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.730 
speak and actually encourage you to just
yeah<00:01:20.909> just<00:01:20.939> redesign<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.960> looks<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.500> and

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
yeah just redesign the looks of this and

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.289 
yeah just redesign the looks of this and
just<00:01:22.979> send<00:01:23.189> me<00:01:23.340> some<00:01:23.549> suggestions<00:01:23.970> because

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
just send me some suggestions because

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.410 
just send me some suggestions because
you<00:01:24.869> might<00:01:25.049> use<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.409> system<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:25.920> our<00:01:25.979> another

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
you might use the system in our another

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.090 
you might use the system in our another
later<00:01:27.420> on<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.810> our<00:01:27.900> server<00:01:28.229> that's<00:01:28.680> also<00:01:29.009> why

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
later on in our server that's also why

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.410 
later on in our server that's also why
I've<00:01:29.159> been<00:01:29.310> designing<00:01:29.640> on<00:01:29.820> this<00:01:29.970> or<00:01:30.150> we've

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
I've been designing on this or we've

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.550 
I've been designing on this or we've
been<00:01:30.600> working<00:01:30.869> this<00:01:30.990> we've<00:01:31.170> also<00:01:31.380> been

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
been working this we've also been

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.200 
been working this we've also been
working<00:01:31.710> on<00:01:31.920> different<00:01:32.280> systems<00:01:32.670> but<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.030> is

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
working on different systems but this is

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.920 
working on different systems but this is
let's<00:01:33.810> say<00:01:33.990> my<00:01:34.350> suggestion<00:01:34.920> for<00:01:35.040> it<00:01:35.189> and<00:01:35.930> yeah

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
let's say my suggestion for it and yeah

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.109 
let's say my suggestion for it and yeah
the<00:01:37.049> way<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.290> works<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:38.340> hit<00:01:38.520> these<00:01:38.729> notebooks

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
the way it works you hit these notebooks

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.289 
the way it works you hit these notebooks
here<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.920> each<00:01:40.920> note<00:01:41.310> block<00:01:41.610> actually<00:01:41.850> gives

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
here and each note block actually gives

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.359 
here and each note block actually gives
up<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.509> tile<00:01:42.720> entity<00:01:43.140> update<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.680> comparator

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
up a tile entity update to a comparator

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.889 
up a tile entity update to a comparator
over<00:01:44.579> here<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:44.880> let's<00:01:45.090> say<00:01:45.270> if<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.509> hit<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.720> top

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
over here so let's say if I hit the top

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.460 
over here so let's say if I hit the top
one<00:01:46.110> its<00:01:47.210> updates<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.390> comparator<00:01:49.049> which<00:01:49.229> is

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
one its updates this comparator which is

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.999 
one its updates this comparator which is
in<00:01:50.270> currently<00:01:51.270> invalid<00:01:51.750> state<00:01:51.960> because<00:01:52.530> these

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
in currently invalid state because these

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.429 
in currently invalid state because these
colored<00:01:53.610> here's<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.360> quadrants<00:01:55.110> here<00:01:55.229> are

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
colored here's the quadrants here are

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.350 
colored here's the quadrants here are
filled<00:01:55.710> with<00:01:55.799> water<00:01:56.100> so<00:01:56.430> they<00:01:57.060> power<00:01:57.270> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
filled with water so they power the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.179 
filled with water so they power the
comparator<00:01:57.990> but<00:01:58.170> if<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.439> piston<00:01:58.740> redirects

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
comparator but if the piston redirects

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.340 
comparator but if the piston redirects
it<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.520> doesn't<00:02:00.119> update<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.509> comparator<00:02:01.020> but

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
it it doesn't update the comparator but

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.200 
it it doesn't update the comparator but
the<00:02:01.439> note<00:02:01.590> block<00:02:01.860> over<00:02:02.130> here<00:02:02.280> does<00:02:02.610> that's<00:02:03.090> a

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
the note block over here does that's a

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.260 
the note block over here does that's a
pretty<00:02:03.420> cool<00:02:03.630> trick<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:05.040> will<00:02:05.340> yes<00:02:05.939> and

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
pretty cool trick and it will yes and

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.260 
pretty cool trick and it will yes and
trigger<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.170> redstone<00:02:07.500> here<00:02:07.619> which<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.459> the

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
trigger this redstone here which is the

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.869 
trigger this redstone here which is the
updates<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:10.069> all<00:02:11.069> this<00:02:11.190> stuff<00:02:11.340> here<00:02:11.700> and

updates to all this stuff here and

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.520 
updates to all this stuff here and
triggers<00:02:12.840> with

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
triggers with

triggers with
let's<00:02:13.709> align<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.640> Wrights<00:02:14.910> rail<00:02:15.450> which<00:02:15.780> is

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
let's align the Wrights rail which is

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.040 
let's align the Wrights rail which is
over<00:02:16.140> here<00:02:16.170> if<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:17.069> turn<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:18.209> upwards<00:02:18.750> one

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
over here if you turn the upwards one

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.960 
over here if you turn the upwards one
which<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.440> left<00:02:19.709> so<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.130> always<00:02:20.280> see<00:02:20.400> the

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
which is left so you can always see the

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.809 
which is left so you can always see the
bottom<00:02:21.300> loss<00:02:21.600> block<00:02:21.870> turns<00:02:22.500> right<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.490> upper

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
bottom loss block turns right the upper

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:25.670 
bottom loss block turns right the upper
one<00:02:24.150> turns<00:02:24.450> left<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.140> if<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.350> don't<00:02:25.530> press

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
one turns left and if you don't press

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.170 
one turns left and if you don't press
anything<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.160> will<00:02:26.280> just<00:02:26.430> go<00:02:26.610> straight<00:02:26.640> and

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
anything you will just go straight and

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.360 
anything you will just go straight and
you<00:02:28.170> had<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.350> demonstrate<00:02:28.800> this<00:02:28.920> real<00:02:29.130> quick

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
you had to demonstrate this real quick

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.180 
you had to demonstrate this real quick
I'm<00:02:29.610> just<00:02:29.670> going<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.150> write<00:02:30.270> it<00:02:30.300> myself<00:02:30.540> and

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
I'm just going to write it myself and

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.199 
I'm just going to write it myself and
you<00:02:32.190> can<00:02:32.310> also<00:02:32.459> write<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:32.760> with<00:02:32.970> several

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
you can also write it with several

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.520 
you can also write it with several
people<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.690> as<00:02:33.900> long<00:02:34.110> as<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.350> end<00:02:34.440> up

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
people and as long as the end up

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.990 
people and as long as the end up
travelling<00:02:34.950> we're<00:02:35.250> very<00:02:35.459> close<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.940> each

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
travelling we're very close to each

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.750 
travelling we're very close to each
other<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:36.360> perfectly<00:02:36.810> works<00:02:37.489> so<00:02:38.489> let's<00:02:38.640> just

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
other it perfectly works so let's just

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.910 
other it perfectly works so let's just
say<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.360> test<00:02:39.600> it<00:02:39.660> out<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.260> I'm<00:02:40.470> going<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.709> travel

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
say I test it out so I'm going to travel

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.500 
say I test it out so I'm going to travel
straight<00:02:41.280> because<00:02:41.760> I'm<00:02:41.880> doing<00:02:42.090> nothing

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
straight because I'm doing nothing

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.949 
straight because I'm doing nothing
and<00:02:43.670> yeah<00:02:44.670> let's<00:02:44.880> hit<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.270> top<00:02:45.480> one<00:02:45.690> so<00:02:45.870> we

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
and yeah let's hit the top one so we

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.050 
and yeah let's hit the top one so we
should<00:02:46.110> go<00:02:46.260> left<00:02:46.500> you<00:02:46.860> can<00:02:47.640> see<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.910> light

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
should go left you can see the light

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.479 
should go left you can see the light
turns<00:02:48.269> on<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.780> we<00:02:48.870> going<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.080> turn<00:02:49.320> left<00:02:49.530> work

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
turns on and we going to turn left work

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.670 
turns on and we going to turn left work
perfectly<00:02:50.970> bottom<00:02:51.900> one<00:02:52.050> turns<00:02:52.350> your<00:02:52.470> rights

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
perfectly bottom one turns your rights

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.360 
perfectly bottom one turns your rights
so<00:02:52.920> let's<00:02:53.489> go<00:02:53.690> nine<00:02:54.690> turns<00:02:54.900> on<00:02:55.080> turn<00:02:55.800> right<00:02:56.010> and

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
so let's go nine turns on turn right and

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.759 
so let's go nine turns on turn right and
you<00:02:57.330> can<00:02:57.480> do<00:02:57.570> this<00:02:57.690> over<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:58.080> over<00:02:58.140> again<00:02:58.380> now

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
you can do this over and over again now

00:02:58.769 --> 00:02:59.990 
you can do this over and over again now
cover<00:02:59.040> straight<00:02:59.370> behind<00:02:59.550> me<00:02:59.819> and<00:02:59.910> we'll

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
cover straight behind me and we'll

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.270 
cover straight behind me and we'll
probably<00:03:00.209> always<00:03:00.510> go<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.720> same<00:03:00.750> direction

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
probably always go the same direction

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.610 
probably always go the same direction
because<00:03:02.280> yeah<00:03:03.180> the<00:03:03.390> rails<00:03:04.050> are<00:03:04.260> being<00:03:04.410> turned

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
because yeah the rails are being turned

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.640 
because yeah the rails are being turned
for<00:03:04.830> a<00:03:04.860> short<00:03:05.069> moment<00:03:05.220> so<00:03:05.670> and<00:03:06.170> if<00:03:07.170> two<00:03:07.470> people

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
for a short moment so and if two people

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.290 
for a short moment so and if two people
follow<00:03:07.920> up<00:03:08.100> very<00:03:08.610> closely<00:03:08.880> they're<00:03:09.150> always

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
follow up very closely they're always

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.059 
follow up very closely they're always
going<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.600> travel<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.959> same<00:03:10.110> direction<00:03:10.350> it

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
going to travel the same direction it

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.559 
going to travel the same direction it
might<00:03:11.250> be<00:03:11.430> possible<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.850> separate<00:03:12.209> off<00:03:12.390> by

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
might be possible to separate off by

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.990 
might be possible to separate off by
hitting<00:03:13.019> this<00:03:13.200> really<00:03:13.560> late<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:14.310> red<00:03:14.459> one<00:03:14.670> cow

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
hitting this really late the red one cow

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.170 
hitting this really late the red one cow
will<00:03:15.150> try<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.360> hit<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.660> red<00:03:15.810> one<00:03:17.030> rusted<00:03:18.030> right

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
will try to hit the red one rusted right

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.180 
will try to hit the red one rusted right
moment<00:03:18.570> here<00:03:19.019> you<00:03:19.140> can<00:03:19.290> see<00:03:19.470> traveling<00:03:20.010> on<00:03:20.100> the

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
moment here you can see traveling on the

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.880 
moment here you can see traveling on the
Kapusta<00:03:20.519> Reds<00:03:20.790> goes<00:03:20.970> really<00:03:21.180> quick<00:03:21.650> very<00:03:22.650> late

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
Kapusta Reds goes really quick very late

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.210 
Kapusta Reds goes really quick very late
and<00:03:23.130> ah<00:03:24.019> yeah<00:03:25.019> you<00:03:25.470> managed<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:25.799> separate<00:03:26.190> us

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
and ah yeah you managed to separate us

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.420 
and ah yeah you managed to separate us
because<00:03:26.760> I<00:03:27.440> yeah<00:03:28.440> I<00:03:28.650> didn't<00:03:29.010> receive<00:03:29.250> the

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.449 
look at it I never thought about this
what<00:03:43.260> happens<00:03:43.560> if<00:03:43.650> you<00:03:43.739> go<00:03:43.859> the<00:03:43.920> wrong<00:03:44.100> way<00:03:44.160> it

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
what happens if you go the wrong way it

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.670 
what happens if you go the wrong way it
automatically<00:03:45.209> yeah<00:03:45.930> we<00:03:46.200> are<00:03:46.440> being

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
automatically yeah we are being

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.080 
automatically yeah we are being
redirected<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.400> right<00:03:47.549> one<00:03:47.730> it's<00:03:47.850> pretty

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
redirected to the right one it's pretty

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.870 
redirected to the right one it's pretty
neat<00:03:48.299> so<00:03:48.870> yeah<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.440> can<00:03:49.620> see<00:03:49.859> the<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.489> problem

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
neat so yeah you can see the the problem

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.250 
neat so yeah you can see the the problem
with<00:03:51.030> the<00:03:51.120> 4-way<00:03:51.420> intersection<00:03:51.450> is<00:03:52.079> that<00:03:52.230> a

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
with the 4-way intersection is that a

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.710 
with the 4-way intersection is that a
rail<00:03:52.890> will<00:03:53.220> actually<00:03:53.609> not<00:03:53.880> do<00:03:54.060> anything<00:03:54.570> if

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
rail will actually not do anything if

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.949 
rail will actually not do anything if
it's<00:03:54.959> been<00:03:55.280> connected<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.430> four<00:03:57.299> rails<00:03:57.600> on<00:03:57.840> all

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
it's been connected to four rails on all

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.380 
it's been connected to four rails on all
four<00:03:58.200> sides<00:03:58.230> so<00:03:58.769> rail<00:03:59.670> in<00:03:59.850> the<00:03:59.940> middle<00:04:00.150> here

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
four sides so rail in the middle here

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.199 
four sides so rail in the middle here
will<00:04:01.109> not<00:04:01.980> change<00:04:02.280> its<00:04:02.519> state<00:04:02.760> when<00:04:03.090> it's

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
will not change its state when it's

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.900 
will not change its state when it's
being<00:04:03.480> powered<00:04:04.140> by<00:04:04.170> any<00:04:04.470> power<00:04:04.890> sort<00:04:05.250> source

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
being powered by any power sort source

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.660 
being powered by any power sort source
at<00:04:06.150> all<00:04:06.560> because<00:04:07.560> it<00:04:07.829> doesn't<00:04:08.100> know<00:04:08.190> which<00:04:08.459> way

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
at all because it doesn't know which way

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.280 
at all because it doesn't know which way
to<00:04:08.700> connect<00:04:09.090> to<00:04:09.150> so<00:04:09.480> we<00:04:09.870> have<00:04:09.959> a<00:04:10.079> four-way

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
to connect to so we have a four-way

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.539 
to connect to so we have a four-way
intersection<00:04:10.859> you<00:04:10.920> have<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.220> pretty<00:04:11.400> much

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
intersection you have to pretty much

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:15.170 
intersection you have to pretty much
split<00:04:11.970> up<00:04:12.120> all<00:04:12.359> ya<00:04:13.459> changes<00:04:14.459> in<00:04:14.640> state<00:04:14.880> two

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
split up all ya changes in state two

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.390 
split up all ya changes in state two
three<00:04:15.630> ways<00:04:15.840> and<00:04:16.169> that's<00:04:17.010> what<00:04:17.160> was<00:04:17.340> happening

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
three ways and that's what was happening

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.060 
three ways and that's what was happening
here<00:04:17.820> so<00:04:17.940> if<00:04:18.060> you<00:04:18.180> turn<00:04:18.390> right<00:04:18.660> this<00:04:19.410> red<00:04:19.829> rail

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
here so if you turn right this red rail

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.130 
here so if you turn right this red rail
is<00:04:20.250> being<00:04:20.310> changed<00:04:20.760> so<00:04:21.030> that<00:04:21.060> you<00:04:21.359> just<00:04:21.510> go<00:04:21.690> 45

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
is being changed so that you just go 45

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.500 
is being changed so that you just go 45
degree<00:04:22.500> and<00:04:22.620> then<00:04:22.710> 45<00:04:23.010> degree<00:04:23.400> again<00:04:23.610> goes<00:04:24.270> for

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
degree and then 45 degree again goes for

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:25.670 
degree and then 45 degree again goes for
all<00:04:24.630> directions<00:04:24.930> and<00:04:25.289> if<00:04:25.409> you<00:04:25.500> turn<00:04:25.620> left

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
all directions and if you turn left

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.290 
all directions and if you turn left
there's<00:04:26.490> this<00:04:26.669> inner<00:04:26.880> circle

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
there's this inner circle

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.600 
there's this inner circle
give<00:04:27.479> it<00:04:27.629> Jones<00:04:27.870> left<00:04:28.139> and<00:04:28.409> it<00:04:28.889> all<00:04:29.009> almost

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
give it Jones left and it all almost

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.110 
give it Jones left and it all almost
looks<00:04:29.970> like<00:04:30.030> an<00:04:30.210> ornament<00:04:30.449> in<00:04:30.750> my<00:04:30.870> opinion<00:04:31.259> and

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
looks like an ornament in my opinion and

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.640 
looks like an ornament in my opinion and
yeah<00:04:33.120> you<00:04:33.210> will<00:04:33.330> be<00:04:33.449> able<00:04:33.690> to<00:04:33.780> get<00:04:33.900> this<00:04:34.050> little

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
yeah you will be able to get this little

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.640 
yeah you will be able to get this little
system<00:04:34.919> here<00:04:34.979> for<00:04:35.099> vault<00:04:35.340> or<00:04:35.460> not<00:04:35.610> and<00:04:36.650> the

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
system here for vault or not and the

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.589 
system here for vault or not and the
redstone<00:04:38.099> is<00:04:38.220> it's<00:04:38.819> not<00:04:39.000> that<00:04:39.180> complicated

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:39.599 
redstone is it's not that complicated

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:41.719 
redstone is it's not that complicated
but<00:04:40.500> I<00:04:40.710> don't<00:04:40.889> want<00:04:41.069> to<00:04:41.129> make<00:04:41.220> a<00:04:41.280> full-blown

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
but I don't want to make a full-blown

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:43.629 
but I don't want to make a full-blown
tutorial<00:04:42.180> for<00:04:42.330> it<00:04:42.389> now<00:04:42.509> it's<00:04:42.750> just<00:04:43.020> these

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:43.639 
tutorial for it now it's just these

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.390 
tutorial for it now it's just these
little<00:04:44.840> comparator<00:04:45.840> updates<00:04:46.229> with<00:04:46.860> a<00:04:46.889> little

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
little comparator updates with a little

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.010 
little comparator updates with a little
timer<00:04:47.759> that<00:04:48.030> sets<00:04:48.300> the<00:04:48.449> rail<00:04:48.599> for<00:04:48.810> a<00:04:48.840> certain

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
timer that sets the rail for a certain

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.050 
timer that sets the rail for a certain
amount<00:04:49.169> of<00:04:49.379> time<00:04:49.650> and<00:04:49.889> over<00:04:50.729> here<00:04:50.909> they<00:04:51.030> are

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
amount of time and over here they are

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.939 
amount of time and over here they are
just<00:04:51.120> connected<00:04:51.780> with<00:04:52.050> these<00:04:52.229> torches<00:04:52.590> to<00:04:52.860> the

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
just connected with these torches to the

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.980 
just connected with these torches to the
right<00:04:53.099> rails<00:04:53.340> looks<00:04:54.030> very<00:04:54.240> symmetric<00:04:54.750> at<00:04:54.870> all

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
right rails looks very symmetric at all

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:59.240 
right rails looks very symmetric at all
and<00:04:55.550> pretty<00:04:56.550> cool<00:04:56.729> so<00:04:57.599> yeah<00:04:58.560> I<00:04:58.590> hope<00:04:58.919> you<00:04:59.069> like

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
and pretty cool so yeah I hope you like

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.180 
and pretty cool so yeah I hope you like
this<00:04:59.400> I<00:04:59.639> also<00:05:00.509> got<00:05:00.750> the<00:05:00.870> same<00:05:01.020> version<00:05:01.289> with<00:05:01.680> a

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
this I also got the same version with a

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.339 
this I also got the same version with a
three-way<00:05:02.909> intersection<00:05:03.629> only<00:05:04.199> that's

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
three-way intersection only that's

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.499 
three-way intersection only that's
obviously<00:05:04.680> an<00:05:04.860> easier<00:05:05.219> just<00:05:05.849> fly<00:05:06.150> over<00:05:06.360> there

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
obviously an easier just fly over there

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.939 
obviously an easier just fly over there
and<00:05:07.909> this<00:05:08.909> one<00:05:09.150> has<00:05:09.780> just<00:05:10.169> the<00:05:10.289> bigger<00:05:10.469> spacing

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
and this one has just the bigger spacing

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.999 
and this one has just the bigger spacing
so<00:05:11.039> it's<00:05:11.190> exactly<00:05:11.669> the<00:05:11.819> same<00:05:12.000> concept<00:05:12.960> oops

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:14.009 
so it's exactly the same concept oops

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:20.480 
so it's exactly the same concept oops
game-mode<00:05:15.889> one<00:05:16.889> here<00:05:17.819> we<00:05:17.909> go<00:05:18.440> and<00:05:19.440> you<00:05:20.219> see<00:05:20.460> a

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
game-mode one here we go and you see a

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.279 
game-mode one here we go and you see a
three-way<00:05:21.000> intersection<00:05:21.240> is<00:05:21.599> way<00:05:21.840> simpler

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
three-way intersection is way simpler

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:24.260 
three-way intersection is way simpler
because<00:05:22.889> they<00:05:23.159> are<00:05:23.219> wireless<00:05:23.580> options<00:05:23.969> but<00:05:24.180> it

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
because they are wireless options but it

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.149 
because they are wireless options but it
doesn't<00:05:24.479> look<00:05:24.599> as<00:05:24.719> fancy<00:05:24.960> same<00:05:25.680> the<00:05:25.919> same

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
doesn't look as fancy same the same

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.670 
doesn't look as fancy same the same
thing<00:05:26.400> if<00:05:26.580> you<00:05:26.759> hit<00:05:26.909> the<00:05:27.030> button<00:05:27.530> you<00:05:28.530> will

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
thing if you hit the button you will

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.450 
thing if you hit the button you will
either<00:05:29.069> go<00:05:29.900> in<00:05:30.900> this<00:05:31.080> case<00:05:31.289> you<00:05:31.440> will<00:05:31.529> default

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
either go in this case you will default

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.820 
either go in this case you will default
go<00:05:32.669> right<00:05:32.940> and<00:05:33.270> if<00:05:33.659> you<00:05:33.779> hit<00:05:33.900> it<00:05:34.020> go<00:05:34.319> left<00:05:34.590> and

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
go right and if you hit it go left and

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.260 
go right and if you hit it go left and
on<00:05:35.250> the<00:05:35.279> other<00:05:35.430> two<00:05:35.639> directions<00:05:36.060> you<00:05:36.150> were

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
on the other two directions you were

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:37.909 
on the other two directions you were
just<00:05:36.449> on<00:05:36.599> default<00:05:36.930> go<00:05:37.110> straight<00:05:37.469> and<00:05:37.680> if<00:05:37.830> you

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:37.919 
just on default go straight and if you

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.870 
just on default go straight and if you
did<00:05:38.099> go<00:05:38.310> yeah<00:05:39.440> turn<00:05:40.440> around<00:05:40.740> so<00:05:41.009> I<00:05:41.190> left<00:05:41.669> or

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
did go yeah turn around so I left or

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
did go yeah turn around so I left or
either<00:05:42.000> right<00:05:42.270> it<00:05:42.449> depends

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
either right it depends

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.629 
either right it depends
since<00:05:43.469> the<00:05:43.650> three-way<00:05:43.979> intersection<00:05:44.250> is<00:05:44.580> a

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
since the three-way intersection is a

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:47.240 
since the three-way intersection is a
simpler<00:05:45.000> one<00:05:45.229> this<00:05:46.229> also<00:05:46.409> has<00:05:46.650> a<00:05:46.680> reset

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
simpler one this also has a reset

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:50.149 
simpler one this also has a reset
mechanism<00:05:47.789> this<00:05:48.259> both<00:05:49.259> designs<00:05:49.800> will<00:05:49.979> be<00:05:50.069> in

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:50.159 
mechanism this both designs will be in

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:53.510 
mechanism this both designs will be in
the<00:05:50.219> world<00:05:50.340> download<00:05:50.610> and<00:05:51.680> that's<00:05:52.680> it<00:05:52.919> for<00:05:53.400> now

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
the world download and that's it for now

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.640 
the world download and that's it for now
so<00:05:53.880> if<00:05:54.389> you<00:05:54.509> want<00:05:54.539> to<00:05:54.779> just<00:05:55.139> send<00:05:55.380> me<00:05:55.469> some

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
so if you want to just send me some

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.200 
so if you want to just send me some
ideas<00:05:55.979> for<00:05:56.190> how<00:05:56.400> this<00:05:56.550> intersection<00:05:57.090> should

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
ideas for how this intersection should

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.719 
ideas for how this intersection should
look<00:05:57.509> like<00:05:57.539> because<00:05:58.289> this<00:05:58.620> plain<00:05:58.979> old<00:05:59.190> design

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
look like because this plain old design

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.670 
look like because this plain old design
is<00:05:59.879> a<00:05:59.909> pretty<00:06:00.300> boring<00:06:00.509> one<00:06:00.779> but<00:06:01.169> keep<00:06:01.379> in<00:06:01.469> mind

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
is a pretty boring one but keep in mind

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.369 
is a pretty boring one but keep in mind
we<00:06:01.979> may<00:06:02.340> not<00:06:02.580> have<00:06:02.849> any<00:06:03.120> air<00:06:03.629> blocks<00:06:04.050> on<00:06:04.289> the

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:04.379 
we may not have any air blocks on the

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:06.200 
we may not have any air blocks on the
height<00:06:04.590> of<00:06:04.830> the<00:06:04.979> rails<00:06:05.159> because<00:06:05.520> we<00:06:06.000> want<00:06:06.150> to

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
height of the rails because we want to

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:07.309 
height of the rails because we want to
build<00:06:06.270> this<00:06:06.419> in<00:06:06.569> another<00:06:06.750> and<00:06:07.050> we<00:06:07.110> want<00:06:07.259> to

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:07.319 
build this in another and we want to

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:09.950 
build this in another and we want to
avoid<00:06:07.529> Pikmin<00:06:07.979> spawning<00:06:08.300> so<00:06:09.300> actually<00:06:09.690> this

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
avoid Pikmin spawning so actually this

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.480 
avoid Pikmin spawning so actually this
would<00:06:10.139> allow<00:06:10.560> quick<00:06:10.860> mods<00:06:11.069> for<00:06:11.250> spawning

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490 
would allow quick mods for spawning

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.709 
would allow quick mods for spawning
because<00:06:11.819> there<00:06:12.029> are<00:06:12.090> no<00:06:12.180> air<00:06:12.360> blocks<00:06:12.569> over

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:12.719 
because there are no air blocks over

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:14.779 
because there are no air blocks over
here<00:06:12.840> we<00:06:13.259> would<00:06:13.409> have<00:06:13.440> to<00:06:13.710> carpet<00:06:14.129> or<00:06:14.250> put

00:06:14.779 --> 00:06:14.789 
here we would have to carpet or put

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:17.029 
here we would have to carpet or put
anything<00:06:15.029> else<00:06:15.270> like<00:06:15.930> half<00:06:16.139> slabs<00:06:16.409> everywhere

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 
anything else like half slabs everywhere

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:19.550 
anything else like half slabs everywhere
as<00:06:17.250> you<00:06:17.729> saw<00:06:18.029> on<00:06:18.120> the<00:06:18.150> other<00:06:18.240> design<00:06:18.629> kind<00:06:19.500> of

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
as you saw on the other design kind of

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.619 
as you saw on the other design kind of
like<00:06:19.740> one<00:06:19.919> back<00:06:20.279> one<00:06:20.430> more<00:06:20.610> time<00:06:20.669> we've<00:06:21.389> placed

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:21.629 
like one back one more time we've placed

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:24.350 
like one back one more time we've placed
carpets<00:06:22.259> everywhere<00:06:22.800> to<00:06:23.490> prevent<00:06:23.849> you<00:06:24.240> have

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
carpets everywhere to prevent you have

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.869 
carpets everywhere to prevent you have
Pikmin<00:06:24.810> and<00:06:25.139> smarter<00:06:26.129> slime<00:06:26.400> spawning<00:06:26.669> and

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:26.879 
Pikmin and smarter slime spawning and

00:06:26.879 --> 00:06:29.360 
Pikmin and smarter slime spawning and
all<00:06:26.969> this<00:06:27.169> nasty<00:06:28.169> stuff<00:06:28.199> within<00:06:28.740> our<00:06:28.860> system

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:29.370 
all this nasty stuff within our system

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:31.550 
all this nasty stuff within our system
and<00:06:29.550> it<00:06:30.000> also<00:06:30.090> looks<00:06:30.690> pretty<00:06:30.840> decent<00:06:31.169> with<00:06:31.440> the

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 
and it also looks pretty decent with the

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.279 
and it also looks pretty decent with the
carpets<00:06:32.599> yeah<00:06:33.599> that's<00:06:33.990> it

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:34.289 
carpets yeah that's it

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:36.019 
carpets yeah that's it
anything<00:06:34.710> else<00:06:34.800> to<00:06:34.979> say<00:06:35.009> Carol<00:06:35.550> they<00:06:35.789> don't

00:06:36.019 --> 00:06:36.029 
anything else to say Carol they don't

00:06:36.029 --> 00:06:37.519 
anything else to say Carol they don't
forget<00:06:36.120> everything<00:06:36.599> about<00:06:36.690> the<00:06:36.930> system<00:06:37.110> I

00:06:37.519 --> 00:06:37.529 
forget everything about the system I

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:40.580 
forget everything about the system I
think<00:06:38.430> that<00:06:38.550> was<00:06:38.699> all<00:06:38.820> ok<00:06:39.630> dad<00:06:40.169> and<00:06:40.349> thanks
