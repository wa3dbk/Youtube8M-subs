00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.800
 Hello you love our topic today are public transport 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.740
 Teter are often referred to as unhealthy and fat making known 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.339
 Actually, few people actually know 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:13.519
 that's why they are important to our body then they are for example 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.049
 Carrier vital vitamins 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.189
 caught again 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:18.869
 ABB at approx 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.339
 Unverzagt one could not solve it at all 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.339
 There are also differences stuck between the fronts 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.720
 if for example vegetable fats animal fats and so on ounces 4 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.430
 for the kitchen FDP clubs the big difference 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.120
 between refined 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.180
 Rides done 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.170
 and native cold pressed oils 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.749
 not as hot means no 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.749
 what is the difference between these two percent said 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.380
 there are on the one hand 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.760
 Cards with a chip would have been pressed directly after the ruleset 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.250
 then you can not feel comfortable so banks would have 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.170
 For example, kicking Men-Star would change that 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.330
 Odorants and so on 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.429
 who are in the Boers and swimming 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.580
 and maybe not look so nice to move 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.700
 and then maybe nothing good for the durability 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.250
 For example, you get this patient 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.850
 in the supermarket under the name edible oil 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.120
 Kopp percent 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.680
 and so on that are usually not spare 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.200
 from vegetable fats 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.320
 where whole is exactly defined where that comes from 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.910
 merck title 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.100
 is only cold pressed 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.480
 and also had the whole place inside then I like driving 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.440
 like that she's on it 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.360
 Mercedes l 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.140
 and the name extra means that's just off 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.300
 In this case probably never a first quality class was pressed 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.270
 You should pay attention to this if you are a stupid purchase 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.140
 What some of you want to use for salads the best and so on 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.380
 not even a year 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.740
 That's a special more flavorful taste 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.280
 and also the salad 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.440
 lends this malady to the salad 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.280
 For example, here's my personal 7 percent 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.950
 "It's all about mezzo, I think it's great 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.170
 because it's off 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.429
 it is critical Anthony person worried 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.119
 I would be like Lieberknecht 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.730
 that's a bit Kerber the Chancellor 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.459
 in taste as a happy childhood minister 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.749
 and just this 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:17.389
 it's not that expensive 

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:21.919
 there are many points then a special life would go and so on 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:24.419
 but he only has to pay properly 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:27.679
 at the discount store on the other side I have the experience 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.259
 I have Bilgic on it 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:32.629
 where also appear natively 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:35.369
 but it still did not taste much 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:36.630
 what i always do 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.249
 I am glad it will prevent associations 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:42.249
 not just his little bowl 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.559
 Struck 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:47.559
 VeregenÂ® in a cash register 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.219
 whether her club manages he wants it blacksmith 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:01.639
 Dieckmann could find 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:02.999
 Munich 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.229
 I could have done that 

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:07.229
 the picture is beautiful green as well as not binding 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.829
 you just try it 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:13.909
 Theme should also set 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:15.729
 fruity taste 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:20.419
 "Which was also important with olive oil in Dulliken LS carelessly great 

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:22.630
 which one can use so versatile 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.570
 For example, when you just taste the GAK picture under moorings 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:28.069
 Super 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.559
 From now tabarz step off 

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:32.009
 Uli lead 

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:33.659
 in a small bowl 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:34.550
 and something 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.930
 Balsamic vinegar in the duel that investments and prompt and then if you can 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:42.759
 with the cash a little balsamic he 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:46.819
 and he told me about this but I was off the topic we were 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:50.209
 namely actually with the active extra through the areas 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.109
 What you can use for salads and tires in Villingen known cuisine 

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:56.809
 but it broke 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:00.089
 If you think otherwise, this is Corner 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:02.879
 it's just heard 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.889
 this also includes point 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:08.569
 Min Ergic year or any other stuff 

00:04:09.179 --> 00:04:13.009
 she mixes Auxerre one can close her pores for it is not 

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:14.750
 I did not have a consistent picture 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.370
 what is good as we commit 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.470
 Qian King explains Baur 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.029
 In women, for example, he can eat and I quite like to set very healthy 

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:27.069
 and he is even on the back there must also point 

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:31.210
 and has 78 degrees 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.499
 that is, who can I use the FINA without hesitation 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:36.580
 usually 8 percent 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.699
 Soya oil and stuff are good for in the pan 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.729
 So take a good look at her 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:47.050
 Keith to kill some rare animals 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:48.830
 because I am on the judgment 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.160
 I use roofs has already been applied on 8 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:56.090
 I think it changes his taste already negative 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.090
 If I started there right now I would like to advise 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.779
 therefore 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:03.569
 it is always good if you use different oils 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:07.360
 even if my personal picture covers Gescher Uli MLF 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:12.989
 You can also add good pumpkin seed oil to grape seed of Kenya principle 

00:05:12.989 --> 00:05:16.939
 Use numbers because that gives the body in turn other nutrients 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:20.610
 and with that a change will be able to create a change 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.180
 maybe city would get for the clients 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.559
 not be renewed 

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:26.559
 van Basten and animal films 

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:30.229
 because they are also olive oil financing you have in a very different way 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.620
 Zionist glitches readers Wilson spinach also great 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.010
 it just does not work like a child has mistreated and now different 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:40.360
 decided to have lost 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.360
 so do not write in francs right now 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:47.349
 on
