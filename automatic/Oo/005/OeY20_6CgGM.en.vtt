00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.199
 the second home game in this season 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.810
 denied our victoria on sunday 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:20.829
 against the u23 from schalke 04 of course 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:23.739
 in the hope of a victory I hope 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:28.719
 I guess I should think to do 21 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:30.849
 times players in the rows hope that 

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:33.640
 victoria 2 0 win I just think 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.870
 that's what victoria is, at least what i do 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.309
 I've seen very compact stands and 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.180
 That's why I believe that's why 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:41.220
 daughter should 1 teaspoon victoria 2 1 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.140
 for us 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.480
 at temperatures of around 40 degrees 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.399
 Above all, cold drinks helped 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.770
 but on the field it went immediately 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.180
 hot here 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.940
 second minute corner kick viktoria cologne 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.260
 kukielka and the 1 0 by the 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.660
 Defense man already in the Bundesliga 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.390
 At that time Energie Cottbus was playing 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:05.829
 here with this header and with the 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.869
 Prompt guidance for sharing 

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:09.579
 the game against the guests was still considered 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.409
 top game touted both 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:15.490
 teams are still undefeated though 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.409
 Schalke here you can see it harmless 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.719
 you are only thinking ahead 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.850
 where right because no preference 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:24.969
 left nonsense nothing of both 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.869
 just forward that is so little in 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:31.240
 this game against viktoria kÃ¶ln 28 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.929
 minute no repetition of ball 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.289
 this time from the other side 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:41.380
 hoppala an owner an owner of 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.149
 Schalke alexander langlitz the 2 0 for 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.159
 our viktoria after just under half 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.219
 hour ferryman 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:51.819
 here does not break where and langlitz 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:53.939
 with scorer instinct just on the 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:56.619
 wrong side 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.479
 the viktoria also after the tour 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.939
 continue in the fore christian castles 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.459
 great shot and ferryman now first 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:07.020
 Goalkeeper in team two clears up here 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.020
 last moment to the corner 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:13.810
 the opponent completely overwhelmed 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.900
 Fernanda between and a little later 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.790
 one shot the half time score of 20 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.640
 went completely okay 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.500
 Satisfied people were also around 1300 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.720
 spectators in the second half 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.470
 changed little in the gameplay 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:31.450
 free kick viktoria cologne and offered only 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.450
 centimeters past the gate 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.720
 in turn, then times at the 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:40.170
 line 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:43.349
 Thought nice but well done 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.349
 Bad luck 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.520
 the hosts showed in this game 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.680
 Once again your class will look here 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.280
 whimsical looks and instinctively 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.990
 this pass on moussavis bordons 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.720
 and of it 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:02.490
 13:03 to zero a great hit 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.670
 Initiated by our captain Mike 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.500
 whimsical in the open space to aziz 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.870
 bouhaddouz did a few days ago 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.030
 still his injury recovered and 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.160
 makes for a comfortable 3 to 0 here 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.320
 from schalke 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.090
 until this time further below 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.640
 classic best scene 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.640
 this shot that was it 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.130
 then the 78 minutes of play in our 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.240
 enter fund of alexander vogt the 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.240
 this with red from the square 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.910
 the viktoria the last good ten 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.590
 minutes so only to ten and 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.990
 suddenly stuck in the back 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:47.540
 dominik ernst querpass and philip 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:49.460
 TÃ¼rpitz shortens to 3 to 1 90 minutes 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.470
 again, what is going on in the 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:55.670
 back team again the cross pass and 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.130
 again a goal 3 to 2 by manuel 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.830
 Torres is about something for that 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:04.010
 of course, the viktoria had something 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.930
 no 60 seconds later, one with 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.150
 blood on the substitute party can 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.430
 then the power alone gives in front of both 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:15.980
 defender is still a magic trick the 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.820
 madness channel 4 to 2 4 to 2 for the 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.320
 Victorian 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.480
 that is the final point of one 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.060
 Superior performance of our victoria 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.290
 the now with twelve points alone 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.790
 leader 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.790
 and now the voices to the game 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.780
 So it was natural for us 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:42.790
 In this heat, it was incredibly difficult 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.419
 against such an experienced team though 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:58.900
 big whole 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:05:01.029
 ruthlessly 40 degrees 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:09.340
 everyone seen on the tribune set 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:11.499
 what have been in the game, the 1 0 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.840
 that really annoys me that one 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:15.580
 then two gates have gotten because 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:24.069
 someone has I have not earned 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:26.529
 but still in the heat one 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:28.270
 Our chances have made a good play 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:29.979
 very well used again and have that 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:31.750
 then ice cold down to the end 

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:33.039
 Clear where the power a bit 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.479
 you less then let that go 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:36.550
 but in another, everything starts 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.409
 All in all, they deserved to win next week 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.449
 it continues for our victoria 

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:42.699
 wiedenbrÃ¼ck with our great fans in the 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:45.479
 her other points should also be back 

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:45.479
 be retracted
