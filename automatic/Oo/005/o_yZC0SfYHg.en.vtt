00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:02.909
 hello everyone today you have blood 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.060
 watching the movie fell to the stations 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.600
 there are five in this game 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.969
 classes of equipment light tanks medium 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:12.969
 eventually heavy tanks showed Kartli 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:17.460
 at the beginning of the year we have to evaluate the strength 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.460
 allies and opponents 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.779
 in the course of the battle we can follow with the help of 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.779
 map view 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.400
 looking at the state of the tank panel we 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.360
 we can learn from the strength of the tank and 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.360
 damage to him 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.950
 with the players we can communicate using 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.520
 chat 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.050
 In this game there are several cards on 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:45.700
 each card has its own 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.890
 battle tactics 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.760
 often made mistakes of players this and 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.900
 there is one in the open 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.850
 since there are no certain 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.260
 objects of protection to push the enemy 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.270
 the class 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.290
 you must choose your position 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.059
 at the start 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.929
 sometimes well chosen position 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:06.520
 can completely change the course of the battle 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.710
 often have to choose positions there 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.400
 where least allies 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.740
 this case of impact 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.500
 also during the battle you need to beware of ambushes 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.480
 potential 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.820
 since they are better disguised as opposed 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.730
 from other tanks 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.790
 besides scuffles there is still artillery they 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.630
 different from other low tanks 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.970
 durability and powerful tool special 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.590
 sight 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.070
 I'm playing on average tanks now 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.580
 he has good maneuverability 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.310
 high speed 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.829
 despite the fact that it has a rather simple 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.829
 abuse and powerful weapons 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.700
 our first visibility zone 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:55.829
 enemy tank 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.189
 the name of the tank we can define it 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.100
 level of roles with your 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.290
 in this case, what to look at the level 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.360
 above him 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.450
 we do not need to specifically 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.450
 aim at individual modules 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.239
 in the game for dead enemies enough enemies 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:21.979
 about the current situation we do not need 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:23.589
 linger on garey since 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:25.039
 enemy tank discovered on 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:28.089
 tal cost visible at the height of prices 

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:29.969
 the right decision is now a guest 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:31.739
 attack the enemy base with the aim of 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.469
 destroy artillery 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.469
 so that the union it was easier to keep the defense 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:42.259
 we go to the pole to sneak in 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:45.259
 to the rear of the enemy 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.059
 on the game the greatest danger 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:49.709
 represents the potential and 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:50.649
 artillery 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:53.699
 since they have the most powerful guns 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:55.569
 the easiest and most effective way 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.059
 neutralize them is the spiculum capital 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:01.669
 as for medium and heavy tanks there 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:03.429
 two ways to neutralize them 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:06.349
 first way shooting under arable land after which 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.429
 they will not be able to turn and if 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:09.719
 will be able to win 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:12.009
 the second way to damage the guns and 

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:14.059
 nothing they can accept and when 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:15.899
 restoring tools from them 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:19.119
 increase the radius of dispersion of shells 

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:22.119
 and this is not the only weak point of tanks 

00:03:40.679 --> 00:03:44.059
 he, and here, too, is very easy enough 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:46.799
 wait for her shots started 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.089
 and you will have time to neutralize 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:51.929
 since starts recharges in 

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:54.929
 So slow 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.279
 when approaching the base hostility we always 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:05.829
 risking running into defender base you 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:06.979
 will always fall into such 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:09.219
 situations when you do joint exercises 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:12.219
 Xor and on the issue of iron horses 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:14.449
 in such situations 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:16.590
 no need to panic well in early march 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.590
 Copyright 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.790
 here it should be forgotten that 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.620
 rush 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.410
 she saves in many cases a ram better 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.229
 enjoy when you don't have time for 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:31.930
 recharge and you know what 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.770
 superior to adversary format 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.770
 on the other hand 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:40.990
 he 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.229
 in the game there are so-called 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:44.490
 like that 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.300
 they are cheaper to maintain than 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.210
 other tanks 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.139
 but not always more effective 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.740
 premium and tanks are tanks acquired 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.740
 for real money 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.400
 in the game you can win in two ways 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.320
 destroying all tanks or capturing the base 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.559
 cities 

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:14.609
 when seizing someone else's base should 

00:05:14.609 --> 00:05:16.949
 editorial feature of any damage you cause 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:18.169
 damage 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.199
 as when receiving damage and 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:23.169
 drinking glasses capture base 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:24.999
 we want to defeat the first way 

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:27.419
 destroying all enemy tanks because on 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.620
 capture base has no time left 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.500
 notify allies about what you need 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.240
 put enemy capture baku 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.990
 to the enemy you need to turn the marmots 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.199
 meeting date more than the rest 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:44.199
 parts of the flank 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:02.219
 with good achievements you 

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:04.669
 you will be encouraged by medals name 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:07.669
 can brag to your friends 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:18.559
 Do not forget Astafyev that sight 

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:21.759
 it is designed for precision combat 

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:23.960
 with it we can increase 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.499
 hit rate applies 

00:06:26.499 --> 00:06:29.499
 with 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.960
 with 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:18.729
 with 

00:07:18.729 --> 00:07:20.779
 Video prepared specifically for 

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:23.779
 contest year half a year so the rebels 

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:27.900
 Thank you all here for welding attention.
