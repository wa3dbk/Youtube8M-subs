coming to you today in a peach tree so
it's<00:00:07.710> kind<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:07.950> interesting<00:00:08.160> I'm<00:00:08.370> going<00:00:08.400> to

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
it's kind of interesting I'm going to

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:09.830 
it's kind of interesting I'm going to
talk<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:08.730> little<00:00:08.849> bit<00:00:08.970> about<00:00:09.150> pruning<00:00:09.450> today

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
talk a little bit about pruning today

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.020 
talk a little bit about pruning today
and<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.710> difference<00:00:11.010> between<00:00:11.340> using<00:00:11.550> say

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
and the difference between using say

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.480 
and the difference between using say
pruning<00:00:12.660> shears<00:00:12.960> or<00:00:13.320> loppers<00:00:13.830> or<00:00:14.190> even<00:00:14.429> a

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
pruning shears or loppers or even a

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.210 
pruning shears or loppers or even a
pruning<00:00:14.759> saw<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:15.150> some<00:00:15.540> sort<00:00:15.780> you<00:00:16.560> want<00:00:17.010> to<00:00:17.100> see

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
pruning saw of some sort you want to see

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.710 
pruning saw of some sort you want to see
the<00:00:17.340> difference<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.480> what<00:00:18.630> we're

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
the difference and this is what we're

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.870 
the difference and this is what we're
going<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.869> talk<00:00:18.960> about<00:00:19.020> here<00:00:19.320> today<00:00:19.550> so<00:00:20.550> the

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
going to talk about here today so the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.279 
going to talk about here today so the
little<00:00:21.210> pruning<00:00:21.539> shears<00:00:21.779> are<00:00:21.930> really<00:00:22.140> good

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
little pruning shears are really good

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.140 
little pruning shears are really good
for<00:00:22.500> cleaning<00:00:22.890> up<00:00:22.980> these<00:00:23.130> small<00:00:23.310> branches<00:00:23.970> and

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
for cleaning up these small branches and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.640 
for cleaning up these small branches and
things<00:00:24.330> where<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.630> want<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.869> clean<00:00:25.080> clean<00:00:25.410> off

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
things where you want to clean clean off

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:26.870 
things where you want to clean clean off
little<00:00:25.859> suckers<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.400> things<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.640> grow

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
little suckers and things that grow

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.029 
little suckers and things that grow
straight<00:00:27.210> up<00:00:27.240> if<00:00:28.109> we<00:00:28.230> start<00:00:28.470> getting<00:00:28.590> into<00:00:28.800> a

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
straight up if we start getting into a

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.650 
straight up if we start getting into a
little<00:00:29.160> bit<00:00:29.279> bigger<00:00:29.580> branches<00:00:30.179> it<00:00:30.330> might<00:00:30.480> be

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
little bit bigger branches it might be

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.389 
little bit bigger branches it might be
something<00:00:31.019> like<00:00:31.050> maybe<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:31.859> one<00:00:32.070> here

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
something like maybe like this one here

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.490 
something like maybe like this one here
this<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:33.059> little<00:00:33.690> bit<00:00:33.780> bigger<00:00:33.960> branch<00:00:34.260> it's

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
this is a little bit bigger branch it's

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.290 
this is a little bit bigger branch it's
growing<00:00:34.680> straight<00:00:35.100> up<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> limb<00:00:35.730> it<00:00:35.940> doesn't

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
growing straight up on a limb it doesn't

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.630 
growing straight up on a limb it doesn't
have<00:00:36.480> as<00:00:36.690> much<00:00:36.840> value<00:00:36.899> as<00:00:37.440> branches<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> grill

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
have as much value as branches a grill

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.970 
have as much value as branches a grill
horizontally<00:00:39.559> horizontal<00:00:40.559> branches

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
horizontally horizontal branches

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.310 
horizontally horizontal branches
actually<00:00:41.489> give<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.790> little<00:00:42.000> bit<00:00:42.120> better

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
actually give you a little bit better

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.470 
actually give you a little bit better
fruit<00:00:43.320> picking<00:00:43.590> potential<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:45.180> can<00:00:45.300> grow

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
fruit picking potential and you can grow

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.090 
fruit picking potential and you can grow
the<00:00:45.629> branch<00:00:45.840> exactly<00:00:46.410> where<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.649> want<00:00:46.860> them

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
the branch exactly where you want them

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.100 
the branch exactly where you want them
so<00:00:47.520> this<00:00:47.700> bigger<00:00:47.969> branch<00:00:48.300> up<00:00:48.539> here<00:00:48.780> isn't

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
so this bigger branch up here isn't

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.490 
so this bigger branch up here isn't
really<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:50.149> really<00:00:51.149> valuable<00:00:51.539> branch<00:00:52.050> for<00:00:52.379> us

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
really a really valuable branch for us

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.650 
really a really valuable branch for us
so<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.399> would<00:00:53.550> look<00:00:53.730> at<00:00:53.850> maybe<00:00:54.000> using<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.449> pair

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
so we would look at maybe using a pair

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.779 
so we would look at maybe using a pair
of<00:00:54.780> loppers<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.440> long<00:00:55.620> handle<00:00:56.100> loppers<00:00:56.550> and

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
of loppers the long handle loppers and

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.279 
of loppers the long handle loppers and
that<00:00:56.910> would<00:00:57.030> clip<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.480> branch<00:00:57.750> off<00:00:57.960> pretty

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
that would clip that branch off pretty

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.470 
that would clip that branch off pretty
easily<00:00:58.379> you<00:00:59.160> can<00:00:59.280> also<00:00:59.430> use<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> pole<00:01:00.120> offer

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
easily you can also use a pole offer

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.090 
easily you can also use a pole offer
where<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:00.930> can<00:01:01.050> get<00:01:01.170> right<00:01:01.350> up<00:01:01.500> into<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.859> tops

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
where you can get right up into the tops

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.250 
where you can get right up into the tops
of<00:01:02.309> trees<00:01:02.370> extend<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.329> up<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.629> pull<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.049> rope

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
of trees extend it up and pull the rope

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.230 
of trees extend it up and pull the rope
and<00:01:04.500> then<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.010> little<00:01:05.280> Opry<00:01:05.700> unit<00:01:05.939> will<00:01:06.030> cut

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
and then the little Opry unit will cut

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.450 
and then the little Opry unit will cut
the<00:01:06.330> branch<00:01:06.570> off<00:01:06.860> just<00:01:07.860> whenever<00:01:08.159> possible

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
the branch off just whenever possible

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.920 
the branch off just whenever possible
when<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.970> start<00:01:09.240> getting<00:01:09.330> into<00:01:09.630> bigger

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
when you start getting into bigger

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.450 
when you start getting into bigger
branches<00:01:10.500> anything<00:01:10.890> that's<00:01:11.040> bigger<00:01:11.280> than

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
branches anything that's bigger than

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.429 
branches anything that's bigger than
about<00:01:11.580> really<00:01:12.570> three<00:01:12.780> quarters<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.200> an<00:01:13.290> inch

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
about really three quarters of an inch

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.050 
about really three quarters of an inch
you<00:01:14.010> really<00:01:14.280> want<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.520> go<00:01:14.610> into<00:01:14.850> something

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
you really want to go into something

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.390 
you really want to go into something
like<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> handsaw<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.380> these<00:01:16.830> little<00:01:17.040> razor

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
like a handsaw and these little razor

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.749 
like a handsaw and these little razor
tooth<00:01:17.790> saws<00:01:18.150> are<00:01:18.509> readily<00:01:18.840> available<00:01:18.930> from

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
tooth saws are readily available from

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.870 
tooth saws are readily available from
any<00:01:20.759> any<00:01:21.270> garden<00:01:21.990> centers<00:01:22.380> or<00:01:22.880> horticultural

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
any any garden centers or horticultural

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.090 
any any garden centers or horticultural
supply<00:01:24.240> places<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.930> they<00:01:25.320> are<00:01:25.350> razor<00:01:25.890> sharp

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
supply places and they are razor sharp

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.370 
supply places and they are razor sharp
so<00:01:26.580> they're<00:01:26.729> very<00:01:26.880> dangerous<00:01:27.060> very<00:01:27.689> sharp<00:01:28.080> but

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
so they're very dangerous very sharp but

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.710 
so they're very dangerous very sharp but
they<00:01:28.500> do<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.650> really<00:01:28.979> nice<00:01:29.130> job<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.540> these

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
they do a really nice job so on these

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.179 
they do a really nice job so on these
bigger<00:01:30.930> branches<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.560> just<00:01:31.710> want<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:31.950> get<00:01:32.070> in

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
bigger branches you just want to get in

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.160 
bigger branches you just want to get in
and<00:01:32.369> cut<00:01:32.520> them<00:01:32.640> off<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.180> don't<00:01:33.900> want<00:01:34.079> to

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
and cut them off and you don't want to
