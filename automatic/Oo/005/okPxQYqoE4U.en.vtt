00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.760
 the first question 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.910
 I'll do my iphone is a good story. 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.279
 Interesting but I went to Tim's shop. 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.720
 in parkshopping a nice shopping mall 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.720
 here in brasilia 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.660
 well on the day of the 13th launch to 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.509
 the day of December 14 years also at night 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.820
 but when I got to the queue it was huge 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.070
 had several apple celebrities there with 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.500
 your macbooks your ipads sitting in the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.250
 ground from 10 in the morning hours of 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.590
 open mall and after midnight 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.030
 had a lottery album I found that 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.850
 could end another gain 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.039
 unfortunately and after all very great 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.390
 stock was limited and I could not 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:57.089
 I bought the next day and I went 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.629
 same store and had already exhausted the stock 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:04.140
 of the iphones 5 then like my version 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:08.280
 previous iphone 4 era 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.190
 I really wanted to change so I called. 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.040
 In Tim's store by telesales has a 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.520
 surprising post-paid number and there 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.850
 this advantage has been able to buy 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.850
 telesales 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.300
 Another question, shall we go in the video? 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.880
 previous only the iphone 4 had not 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.720
 film and no cover you do not like 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.290
 use 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:38.460
 the web surfer in that video is the only one 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.520
 removed the film that was already old 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.780
 that I was selling and the cover myself 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.880
 I took it because I was making a video 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.700
 so I was going to show those layers that 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.850
 cap all back 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.980
 so I had taken at the time I wore 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.730
 that film because it applies 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.510
 there is nothing dirty it also already has 51 phone 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.430
 on this fifth that cover that 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:03.600
 transparent protects the back and 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.440
 the sides 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:11.459
 I already have a movie here. 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:15.000
 you are seeing here the home button gives 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:18.780
 to see that I already have the film and the 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.860
 back is also there 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.210
 for those who think not only that the girl there 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.220
 in the store 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.880
 in the fair of the imported ones that is much more 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:33.330
 She says that here in this part of the 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.940
 the brushed aluminum and here the glass gives 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:41.550
 these balls that is normal but nothing 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:43.380
 very troublesome, right? 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.090
 but here I do not know if they're giving 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:53.910
 see the film around the camera and 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:57.390
 use flash but always use it and 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.260
 wear hood with side protection 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.710
 Ok, what 's most important for us is the 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:07.650
 next question before your iphone 4 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.030
 of 16 giga and now you buy fone 51 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:15.450
 of 32 gb 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:19.260
 what changed what changed the price changed right? 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:22.830
 he is this version of 32 gig 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.910
 You can see here in the box. 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:30.150
 she is a little more expensive was 2,699 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.310
 the advantage is to the space 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.290
 formerly the iphone 4 it filled with 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.510
 very easy I like to take 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.840
 lots of photos I leave my albums here 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:42.990
 iphone complex and bass a lot of music 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.150
 So it's his ability to 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:52.740
 I was exhausted now, I do not think I 'm with 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:55.170
 8 giga né 8gb here and it's a one for me it's 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.140
 a great difference, not 30, and 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:03.510
 I'm sure it will take longer to fill 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:06.960
 audio files is picture photos 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.760
 ok if you can earn a little money to 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.550
 more to invest in this larger space 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.140
 well worth 16 in my opinion runs out 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.460
 You quickly have to choose 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.859
 priority here you want to keep 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:22.680
 Anything to delete this is annoying then to 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.360
 I do not care much about 32 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:29.940
 most ideal option 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:32.850
 Okay, another question was a good question. 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.430
 the white color because it was 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.940
 charging what was the reason well in the old 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.620
 iphone 4 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:44.290
 It was black, not white, I liked it. 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:49.000
 because a friend of mine had found the color 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:50.530
 more attractive the more youthful color black 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.740
 For me, it 's that sensation. 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.990
 very professional white executive to 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:59.310
 I'm more schooled could have other 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:04.690
 colors and it would be nice to have a blue 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:07.690
 the plane is passing here the blessed 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.880
 Pass you've heard of honey but how not 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.920
 there are only these two colors the black and blue 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.350
 already had the black the white one for me was 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.280
 that's why you get it. 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:21.400
 now the white iphone another question 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:22.960
 another question was worth 2 thousand 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.180
 six hundred and ninety-nine reais 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.040
 telephone 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.520
 I did not change the unit from the 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:33.580
 version of iphone 4 release the 4s have not seen 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:38.110
 much difference there with the emergence of 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:40.960
 iphone 5 the largest screen né that design 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.240
 more attractive for me and 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.560
 Yes it was worth very worth it is a 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.050
 investment 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.620
 if you in a year, for example throw 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.810
 the two years from now launch the iphone 6 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:55.690
 picture that the iphone 5 s 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:57.640
 after 6 you will be able to sell them 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:01.360
 on these sales sites 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:04.030
 in the free market or the building has 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.880
 other sites there is an investment you 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:09.250
 will sell a little more valued 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:12.730
 value is for example iphone 4 sold 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:15.940
 for a thousand reais I bought at the time for 1,699 

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:17.169
 then two years of use of the values 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.510
 or 600 reais 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.960
 so I guess when I go to change 

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:27.070
 it will also be enough 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:29.350
 It is nice for those who want to buy and 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.980
 will also help in the acquisition of 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.980
 next version 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:41.629
 well these were the most 

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:42.769
 interesting that I think I solved 

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:46.879
 reply
