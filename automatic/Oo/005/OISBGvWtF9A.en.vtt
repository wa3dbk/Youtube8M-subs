00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
those kind of things or yeah I probably

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.160 
those kind of things or yeah I probably
messed<00:03:29.280> it<00:03:29.459> up<00:03:29.549> but<00:03:29.730> something<00:03:30.090> like<00:03:30.239> that<00:03:30.450> you

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
messed it up but something like that you

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.839 
messed it up but something like that you
know<00:03:32.450> double<00:03:33.450> pawns<00:03:33.690> as<00:03:33.930> a<00:03:33.959> weakness<00:03:34.200> yes<00:03:34.849> but

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
know double pawns as a weakness yes but

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.420 
know double pawns as a weakness yes but
if<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.540> can't<00:03:36.750> be<00:03:36.930> exploited<00:03:37.560> in<00:03:37.799> hours<00:03:38.129> a<00:03:38.159> week

if it can't be exploited in hours a week
matter<00:03:39.209> of<00:03:39.239> fact<00:03:39.450> that's<00:03:39.660> very<00:03:39.959> strong<00:03:40.549> here

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
matter of fact that's very strong here

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:46.250 
matter of fact that's very strong here
and<00:03:42.739> also<00:03:43.739> on<00:03:44.160> d<00:03:44.370> take<00:03:44.610> c5<00:03:45.090> another<00:03:45.750> option<00:03:46.230> for

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
and also on d take c5 another option for

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.619 
and also on d take c5 another option for

a<00:03:48.660> lot<00:03:48.780> to<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.890> same<00:03:50.190> ideas<00:03:51.000> efore<00:03:52.220> and<00:03:53.220> just

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
a lot to the same ideas efore and just

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.130 
a lot to the same ideas efore and just
explaining<00:03:54.629> the<00:03:54.870> lack<00:03:55.200> of<00:03:55.230> development<00:03:55.760> here

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
explaining the lack of development here

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:02.170 
explaining the lack of development here
and<00:03:58.140> then<00:03:58.319> I<00:03:58.500> feel<00:03:58.739> like<00:03:58.890> after<00:03:59.069> night<00:03:59.370> g<00:03:59.640> 5y

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.670 

and<00:04:55.070> to<00:04:56.070> me<00:04:56.310> this<00:04:56.640> is<00:04:56.750> probably<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:58.430> most

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
and to me this is probably the most

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.100 
and to me this is probably the most
important<00:05:01.680> move<00:05:01.830> of<00:05:02.040> the<00:05:02.160> game<00:05:02.190> here<00:05:02.880> and<00:05:03.110> I

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
important move of the game here and I

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.990 
important move of the game here and I
was<00:05:04.440> missed<00:05:04.770> by<00:05:05.900> Nakamura<00:05:06.900> and<00:05:07.520> if<00:05:08.520> he<00:05:08.760> played

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
was missed by Nakamura and if he played

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.200 
was missed by Nakamura and if he played
this<00:05:09.180> move<00:05:09.450> I<00:05:09.660> felt<00:05:09.960> that<00:05:10.170> he<00:05:10.320> could<00:05:10.350> have

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
this move I felt that he could have

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.230 
this move I felt that he could have
definitely<00:05:12.260> been<00:05:13.260> equal<00:05:13.710> in<00:05:13.920> the<00:05:14.250> game<00:05:14.460> you

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
definitely been equal in the game you

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.630 
definitely been equal in the game you
played<00:05:15.450> b5<00:05:15.960> here<00:05:16.320> which<00:05:16.710> looks<00:05:16.740> like<00:05:17.190> a<00:05:17.220> very

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
played b5 here which looks like a very

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.600 
played b5 here which looks like a very
it<00:05:18.420> actually<00:05:19.200> is<00:05:19.290> a<00:05:19.620> lot<00:05:19.950> of<00:05:19.980> people<00:05:20.100> just<00:05:20.310> play

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
it actually is a lot of people just play

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.530 
it actually is a lot of people just play
d<00:05:20.850> 5<00:05:21.150> is<00:05:21.510> very<00:05:21.780> normal<00:05:21.990> move<00:05:22.670> the<00:05:23.670> problem<00:05:24.240> with

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
d 5 is very normal move the problem with

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.240 
d 5 is very normal move the problem with
d5<00:05:24.810> is<00:05:25.500> that's<00:05:26.040> immediately<00:05:26.480> what<00:05:27.480> does<00:05:27.660> it<00:05:27.810> do

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
d5 is that's immediately what does it do

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.420 
d5 is that's immediately what does it do
if<00:05:29.250> you<00:05:29.430> look<00:05:29.580> at<00:05:29.790> it<00:05:29.900> it<00:05:30.900> allows<00:05:31.050> white<00:05:31.680> to<00:05:31.710> get

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
if you look at it it allows white to get

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.700 
if you look at it it allows white to get
rid<00:05:32.610> of<00:05:32.700> his<00:05:32.880> weakness<00:05:33.300> so<00:05:34.110> you're<00:05:34.320> helping

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
rid of his weakness so you're helping

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.550 
rid of his weakness so you're helping
your<00:05:34.860> opponent<00:05:35.370> which<00:05:35.760> old<00:05:36.240> text<00:05:36.930> old<00:05:37.200> test

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
your opponent which old text old test

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.060 
your opponent which old text old test
man<00:05:37.770> you<00:05:37.920> will<00:05:38.010> tell<00:05:38.250> you<00:05:38.370> don't<00:05:39.060> do<00:05:39.390> it<00:05:40.070> so

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
man you will tell you don't do it so

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.330 
man you will tell you don't do it so
what<00:05:41.430> it<00:05:41.550> does<00:05:41.790> is<00:05:42.150> it<00:05:42.710> helps<00:05:43.710> your<00:05:43.830> opponent

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
what it does is it helps your opponent

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.800

because<00:05:44.460> you<00:05:44.640> can<00:05:44.820> trade<00:05:45.030> off<00:05:45.060> his<00:05:45.390> weakness

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
because you can trade off his weakness

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.600 
because you can trade off his weakness
and<00:05:46.680> then<00:05:47.690> now<00:05:48.690> you<00:05:48.780> have<00:05:49.290> a<00:05:49.320> target<00:05:49.770> on<00:05:50.070> d5

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
and then now you have a target on d5

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.310 
and then now you have a target on d5
because<00:05:50.910> that<00:05:51.090> now<00:05:51.240> your<00:05:51.420> porn<00:05:51.720> base<00:05:52.020> has
