00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.029
 if you love video games you are 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.970
 creative and you feel able to do 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.600
 fly your imagination to be able to develop 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.730
 games but that does exactly one 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.740
 video game developer the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.420
 video game developers produce 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.850
 games for computers consoles 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.710
 internet and mobile phones 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.810
 the work includes the development of 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.780
 new games and updating the already 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.180
 existing a game can take 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:32.309
 several months or even years 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.319
 There are many stages that must be 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.140
 completed before a game is 

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:39.690
 launched to the market since the creation of 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.210
 ideas and characters to program the 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.890
 game and prove that there are several 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.199
 jobs that must be developed in 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.409
 the different stages therefore your 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.809
 work can be for example designer 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.460
 the designer gives the look to the game and is 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.979
 which determines the way it is going to 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.749
 Play designers often use a 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:59.909
 type of programming language that 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:02.670
 control applications to see your ideas 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:04.649
 within a web prototype can be 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.140
 a main content designer 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.910
 technician level 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.040
 artist the artist is the creator of 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.200
 virtual world is the one that invents the 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.870
 characters the objects that appear in 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.910
 the game the scenarios in summary the 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.460
 how it will play among 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.910
 positions as an artist can be a director 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.940
 of art conceptual main artist or 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.910
 modeling animator is what gives life to 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.190
 the objects created by the artist the 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.500
 programmer the programmer is the 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.480
 In charge of creating the code to do 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.210
 run the game if you're a 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.730
 programmer you can get by in six 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.950
 different positions can be the 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.440
 programmer leader the programmer of 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.750
 artificial intelligence the programmer 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.480
 of graphics programmer networks 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.370
 physical programmer verifying that it is not 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.680
 previous physical rules that govern 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.960
 our world the programmer of 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.880
 tools or you can be the programmer 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.110
 of the interface in which the user 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.940
 play if it sounds good no but before you should

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.110
 qualities the first thing is to be good with 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.460
 computers and understand their 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.650
 programming 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.260
 and a logical approach must be vital for 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.120
 solve problems but do not forget that 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.880
 you have to work as a team and a good 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.530
 communication is essential because 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.220
 Many times you must work in 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.990
 stressful and complicated situations 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.880
 On the other hand, you must develop a 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.980
 creative imagination that allows you to be 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.780

 circumstances the attention to 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.400
 Details and patience will be practical 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.250
 that will definitely help you out 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.260
 go ahead and get what you want 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.050
 finally you have to have the will 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.210
 to innovate and learn step by step the 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.030
 industry development will allow you 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.370
 consolidate a wonderful experience and 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.410
 where you can work in costa rica 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.210
 There are several options if you want 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.310
 You can find a company that hires 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.710
 staff regularly among them 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.480
 find fair play lapse another option 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.780
 is to work on independent projects 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.940
 for professional services these are 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.580
 normally paid by time or by 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.620
 projects you can also work from 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.270
 independently creating their own 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.370
 company with colleagues who work in the 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.000
 same ride a business has its 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.790
 advantage 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.040
 but also its disadvantages within 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.750
 the advantages are the ease of 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.570
 agree among the members 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.090
 of the group the freedom of the creation of 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.130
 videogames with novel ideas the 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:35.830
 potential growth in the market 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:38.560
 Costa Rican which is not very well 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.840
 defined and the opportunity to project 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.970
 in an international market however 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.070
 there are also disadvantages that come from the 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.750
 hand for example get other 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:48.490
 companies that want to buy the idea or 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.650
 the development of the video game for their 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.150
 business is a bit difficult even 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.430
 stay stable in the part 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.530
 financial at the beginning is complicated in 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.180
 Costa Rica there is no real support for 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.190
 this industry by the government 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.190
 as it already exists in other countries 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.860
 how long it will last approximately creating a 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.170
 video game this question very relative 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.390
 everything depends on the level of history that 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.670
 you want to create there are projects in the 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:14.530
 It will take you a few months other 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.840
 are video games that will be developed to 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.790
 throughout the year and finally you can 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.799
 have small projects in which 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.900
 will last a few hours since 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:24.640
 will be limited by the client in 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.480
 average developers of 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.640
 video games can 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.400
 work between 30 and 40 hours per week 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.440
 this depends on the position and the project 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.000
 where I'm working if you want 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.070
 Become a developer of 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.780
 videogames you need to take in 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.640
 account all these aspects that 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.470
 we mentioned before so you can 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.540
 decide which side of videogames 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.890
 you want to go it 's important that you take 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.840
 note that the market 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.090
 video games is constantly evolving 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:51.340
 for the technology that is updated every 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.620
 some time to be a developer of 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.470
 videogames implies a great disposition 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:00.510
 and a great passion when there is work 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.510
 cash that is made carelessly
