for<00:00:28.570> the<00:00:28.630> most<00:00:28.810> part<00:00:28.929> I<00:00:29.259> am<00:00:29.289> pretty<00:00:29.710> satisfied

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.860 

supposedly<00:00:33.850> Germans<00:00:34.510> deal<00:00:34.840> however<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:37.510> was

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
supposedly Germans deal however it was

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.160 
supposedly Germans deal however it was
made<00:00:38.860> in<00:00:39.040> China<00:00:39.370> so<00:00:40.090> I<00:00:40.360> know<00:00:40.840> how<00:00:40.990> you'd<00:00:41.140> feel

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
made in China so I know how you'd feel

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:50.010 
made in China so I know how you'd feel
about<00:00:41.410> that<00:00:42.570> now<00:00:45.240> let's<00:00:46.240> say<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:49.420> feeling<00:00:49.690> is

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
about that now let's say the feeling is

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.980 
about that now let's say the feeling is
good<00:00:50.290> I<00:00:50.530> liked<00:00:51.340> holding<00:00:51.490> it<00:00:51.880> it's<00:00:52.630> pretty

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:52.990 
good I liked holding it it's pretty

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.480 
good I liked holding it it's pretty
light<00:00:53.320> and<00:00:55.110> metal<00:00:56.110> is<00:00:56.200> pretty<00:00:56.410> solid<00:00:56.680> in<00:00:57.220> fact

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.490 
light and metal is pretty solid in fact

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.570 
light and metal is pretty solid in fact
this<00:00:57.640> entire<00:00:58.030> thing<00:00:58.360> is<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:59.230> steel<00:00:59.590> I<00:00:59.830> don't

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:00.580 
this entire thing is the steel I don't

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.910 
this entire thing is the steel I don't
necessarily<00:01:01.000> like<00:01:01.540> the<00:01:01.930> handle<00:01:02.530> that<00:01:02.740> much

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
necessarily like the handle that much

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.460 
necessarily like the handle that much
and<00:01:03.310> it's<00:01:04.030> much<00:01:04.479> smaller<00:01:04.839> than<00:01:05.049> I<00:01:05.290> thought

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
and it's much smaller than I thought

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.190 
and it's much smaller than I thought
it'd<00:01:05.680> be<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:07.119> that's<00:01:07.270> not<00:01:07.390> a<00:01:07.450> problem<00:01:07.810> because

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
it'd be but that's not a problem because

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.200 
it'd be but that's not a problem because
this<00:01:08.590> is<00:01:08.859> supposed<00:01:09.070> to<00:01:09.460> resemble<00:01:09.759> a<00:01:09.999> boot

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
this is supposed to resemble a boot

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.810 
this is supposed to resemble a boot
knife<00:01:10.479> and<00:01:10.810> one<00:01:10.960> way<00:01:11.170> or<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.380> other<00:01:11.820> but

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820 
knife and one way or the other but

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.029 
knife and one way or the other but
unlike<00:01:13.240> a<00:01:13.270> boot<00:01:13.539> knife<00:01:13.749> it's<00:01:14.140> only<00:01:14.409> sharp<00:01:14.799> on

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:15.039 
unlike a boot knife it's only sharp on

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:18.239 
unlike a boot knife it's only sharp on
one<00:01:15.369> side<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:17.140> edge<00:01:17.350> isn't<00:01:17.590> sharp<00:01:17.979> at<00:01:18.130> all

00:01:18.239 --> 00:01:18.249 
one side this edge isn't sharp at all

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:20.580 
one side this edge isn't sharp at all
however<00:01:18.670> you<00:01:19.329> can<00:01:19.479> easily<00:01:19.659> fix<00:01:20.109> that<00:01:20.350> if<00:01:20.499> you

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
however you can easily fix that if you

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.969 
however you can easily fix that if you
really<00:01:20.890> want<00:01:21.100> it<00:01:21.280> to<00:01:22.469> however<00:01:23.469> the<00:01:23.560> edge<00:01:23.710> that

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
really want it to however the edge that

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:27.779 
really want it to however the edge that
is<00:01:24.009> sharp<00:01:24.429> is<00:01:24.880> is<00:01:25.200> pretty<00:01:26.200> sharp<00:01:26.499> I<00:01:26.950> came<00:01:27.460> sharp

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
is sharp is is pretty sharp I came sharp

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:29.219

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
out of the box i didn't have to sharpen

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.459 
out of the box i didn't have to sharpen
it<00:01:29.560> or<00:01:29.740> anything<00:01:29.979> like<00:01:30.189> that<00:01:30.399> and<00:01:31.229> i've<00:01:32.229> got<00:01:32.289> a

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:48.999 
little tension involved and this is just

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:51.480 
little tension involved and this is just
right<00:01:49.479> out<00:01:49.689> of<00:01:49.719> the<00:01:49.869> box<00:01:50.079> in<00:01:50.469> fact<00:01:51.159> you<00:01:51.369> can

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
sharpen this much more red I wouldn't

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.989 
sharpen this much more red I wouldn't
surprise<00:01:54.939> me<00:01:54.969> if<00:01:55.299> you<00:01:55.389> get<00:01:55.539> cut<00:01:55.749> hairs<00:01:56.020> with<00:01:56.259> it

00:01:59.989 --> 00:01:59.999 

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.669 

as<00:02:00.999> far<00:02:01.090> as<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.630> rest<00:02:01.810> of<00:02:01.899> the<00:02:01.990> package<00:02:02.409> it

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
as far as the rest of the package it

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.550 
as far as the rest of the package it
came<00:02:02.950> in<00:02:03.159> a<00:02:03.399> small<00:02:04.090> box<00:02:04.389> that<00:02:04.810> looks<00:02:04.959> like<00:02:05.200> this

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.040 

not<00:02:08.560> necessarily<00:02:09.160> small<00:02:09.610> in<00:02:09.819> comparison<00:02:10.050> to

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
not necessarily small in comparison to

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.670 
not necessarily small in comparison to
the<00:02:11.620> knife

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
the knife

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.199 
the knife
I've<00:02:13.680> seen<00:02:13.950> bigger<00:02:14.099> boxes<00:02:14.670> with<00:02:14.879> smaller

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
I've seen bigger boxes with smaller

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:22.240 
I've seen bigger boxes with smaller
things<00:02:15.540> in<00:02:15.780> them<00:02:16.519> and<00:02:17.629> a<00:02:18.629> set<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.170> instructions

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:30.830 

now<00:02:23.250> let's<00:02:23.610> see<00:02:26.300> now<00:02:29.239> along<00:02:30.239> with<00:02:30.269> that<00:02:30.420> came<00:02:30.810> a

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
now let's see now along with that came a

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:38.559 
now let's see now along with that came a
strap<00:02:31.319> and<00:02:35.780> it's<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.959> holster<00:02:37.470> for<00:02:37.739> it<00:02:37.800> and

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
strap and it's the holster for it and

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.300 
strap and it's the holster for it and
it's<00:02:39.569> pretty<00:02:39.900> nice<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.349> holds<00:02:40.650> it<00:02:40.769> in<00:02:40.920> nothing

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
it's pretty nice it holds it in nothing

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.600 
it's pretty nice it holds it in nothing
special<00:02:41.610> though<00:02:42.830> plastic<00:02:43.830> seems<00:02:44.069> pretty<00:02:44.310> hard

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
special though plastic seems pretty hard

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.400 
special though plastic seems pretty hard
and<00:02:44.819> it's<00:02:45.209> not<00:02:45.330> going<00:02:45.480> to<00:02:45.569> fall<00:02:45.750> on<00:02:45.959> you<00:02:46.140> so<00:02:46.349> you

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
and it's not going to fall on you so you

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.289 
and it's not going to fall on you so you
can<00:02:46.709> hold<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.190> like<00:02:47.370> this<00:02:47.400> which<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.150> way<00:02:48.269> I

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
can hold it like this which is the way I

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.280 
can hold it like this which is the way I
did<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.959> the<00:02:49.080> beginning<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.620> video

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
did to the beginning of the video

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.170 
did to the beginning of the video
although<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.349> can<00:02:52.680> hear<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.040> rattle<00:02:53.430> because

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
although you can hear the rattle because

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.089
