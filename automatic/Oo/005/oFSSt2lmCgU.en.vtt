ways that you can start off by making a

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.869 
ways that you can start off by making a
card<00:01:00.739> using<00:01:01.739> an<00:01:01.829> eight<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.070> half<00:01:02.160> by<00:01:02.399> 11<00:01:02.730> piece

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
card using an eight and half by 11 piece

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.119 
card using an eight and half by 11 piece
of<00:01:03.030> paper<00:01:03.270> but<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.019> need<00:01:04.229> more<00:01:04.439> than<00:01:04.500> that<00:01:04.680> so
