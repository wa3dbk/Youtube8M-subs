00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 oh and the viewers and subscribers of the channel with you 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.460
 river this and welcome to 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.469
 creative world with mod taumkraft second 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.870
 and Nikita wondered why many 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.790
 they say that tnt is a dangerous thing and and 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.670
 worth keeping in tanks far 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.699
 far from home or at least in 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.340
 there are no armored tanks then now 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:27.230
 I'll show you how you see and here I am 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.599
 created so to speak productive 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.719
 industrial farm if possible so 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.600
 put it tnt she will be us 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.110
 to produce an awning our tank will 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.469
 explode because you 're more like filters 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.020
 just a filter and aims to 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:48.329
 display only awning in tanks and through 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.149
 some time we'll see purple 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.640
 fireworks and a storm of emotions from different 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.680
 animals for example those sheep because 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.750
 that in this place it will simply be impossible 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.760
 live as you see 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.890
 the tonometer simply shows that in our 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.140
 the atmosphere becomes less and less a visa 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.670
 more and more awning all connected 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.130
 so that here these blocks of diamonds are very 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.720
 fatty how to say so and 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:21.990
 overflow they overwhelm our boilers 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.390
 of which ten is produced in the atmosphere but 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.860
 what happens when all this 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.500
 will reach the maximum 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.000
 there is such badabum that you 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.310
 never seen before 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.290
 just need a little bit of a wait and 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:43.590
 enjoy the show by the way I will need 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:47.390
 creeper egg clipper i'm here a couple of 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:54.229
 creeper who show 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:57.350
 why are you and dangerous for the world take 4 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.920
 creeper more clippers that you so it 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:06.140
 relish looked and it remains only to wait 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:11.740
 and it seems I have gone too far with the awning 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:15.800
 you have one house 2 there and how do you see 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:18.350
 immediately appeared for teng who is water creeper he 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.430
 three times or twice more powerful than mine 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.800
 ordinary creeper 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:27.860
 here we compare here and so explodes here 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:31.580
 awning plus it emits to the atmosphere 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.800
 awning and infects others too like this 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:38.269
 our usual creeper explodes nothing 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.519
 deadly can be restored but if 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.480
 There will be a lot of these creepers and explosions will be 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:46.370
 continue as you saw on the tonometer 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.920
 temp detector just rolls over because 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.019
 that the atmosphere embroidered incredible 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.959
 the amount of awning that in a normal game 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:55.329
 it's probably hard to get, but let's 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.160
 let's continue 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:00.650
 enjoy these explosions and see 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:05.420
 what will happen when it all explodes and 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:08.209
 when you int will just roll off 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.290
 as you see you expressed these 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:16.280
 things like it's starting to spin 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.950
 head cool as you see this one 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.720
 piece sprout is awning like so 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.170
 say i dunno call a goo 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.450
 it generally grows grows grows and when 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:30.440
 grow to a certain point she 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.200
 emits teint into the atmosphere that makes 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.079
 invest even more dumb and 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.150
 unfit for life our pipes all 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.690
 blow up as you see we have here 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:45.150
 even for ten your sheep 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.980
 she is aggressive she tries to eat us 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.040
 not sure how much I don't know how much she is 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:56.040
 Damage if God showed in this version 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:58.530
 minecraft is still impossible to change with 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.629
 We snatched creative but not the essence of how 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.900
 you see here the stand is simple but the maximum 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:06.420
 if you move away in this chang then all 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.420
 a field less well as if normal and if 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.689
 here it is all just Khan here 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.299
 signs appeared 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:17.940
 creepers if they blow one more yet 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:21.030
 will be adjacent to Chang to allocate awning 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.800
 energy in general is also possible this world 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.990
 no longer habitable because 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.080
 this awning will spread and is unlikely 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.940
 can it even stop here 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:35.220
 There is lick ass this you only look 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:37.590
 on them they are living wow I am long 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.650
 fist well let's take a tap 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.490
 mitchek sword to the sword and see how 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:48.320
 powerful and four hits and by the way drop it 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:51.320
 of the crystals I did not know about another explosion 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.320
 proper 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:58.130
 remember children do not joke with an awning 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.130
 because this thing is so dangerous 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:03.010
 if in large quantities that time carries 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.990
 just your whole hut 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:08.870
 lab to shreds 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.390
 on the spot in his place will spawn 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.610
 slugs that will annoy you 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.520
 never hide from ecowool because 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:20.270
 that it will be all over the place well, that there still 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.370
 I think from this video you understand that the awning 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.220
 it's a dangerous thing to be kidding 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.880
 good luck and see you soon in the next 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.880
 videos bye
