but it gets all the corners and then if

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.810 
but it gets all the corners and then if
I<00:01:10.630> want<00:01:10.840> to<00:01:10.899> even<00:01:11.259> more<00:01:11.619> detail<00:01:12.159> what<00:01:12.460> I'll<00:01:12.579> do

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:12.820

is<00:01:13.030> I'll<00:01:13.060> pull<00:01:13.659> the<00:01:13.930> skin<00:01:14.289> back<00:01:14.350> and<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:16.479> way

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
is I'll pull the skin back and that way

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.190 
is I'll pull the skin back and that way
I<00:01:16.719> can<00:01:17.079> get<00:01:17.289> in<00:01:17.560> all<00:01:17.829> the<00:01:18.369> areas<00:01:18.640> within<00:01:19.390> the

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
I can get in all the areas within the

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:28.130 
I can get in all the areas within the
cuticle<00:01:20.829> so<00:01:21.429> I'll<00:01:21.579> have<00:01:21.789> a<00:01:21.820> perfect<00:01:22.630> finish

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.649 

now<00:01:29.140> for<00:01:29.649> bigger<00:01:30.100> surfaces<00:01:30.819> on<00:01:30.939> my<00:01:31.090> hand<00:01:31.390> I

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
now for bigger surfaces on my hand I

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.529 
now for bigger surfaces on my hand I
just<00:01:31.899> use<00:01:32.140> a<00:01:32.170> q-tip<00:01:32.560> I'll<00:01:33.399> dip<00:01:33.759> that<00:01:33.939> in<00:01:34.210> and

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
just use a q-tip I'll dip that in and

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:40.350 
just use a q-tip I'll dip that in and
then<00:01:35.100> I'll<00:01:36.100> clean<00:01:36.429> the<00:01:36.610> bigger<00:01:36.819> surfaces<00:01:39.360> and

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
then I'll clean the bigger surfaces and

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.339 
then I'll clean the bigger surfaces and
that<00:01:41.349> just<00:01:41.619> usually<00:01:41.950> takes<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.429> few<00:01:42.840> yes<00:01:43.840> you<00:01:44.110> do

00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:44.349 
that just usually takes a few yes you do

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:46.889 
that just usually takes a few yes you do
notice<00:01:44.619> my<00:01:45.009> skin<00:01:45.039> is<00:01:45.459> getting<00:01:45.640> dry<00:01:46.119> but<00:01:46.630> that's

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
why after I do my water marble videos I

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.230
