00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.710
 let's golf 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.600
 you are ready for this new video this 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.189
 is a video that everyone expected 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.900
 it's been a while since I stopped playing 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.210
 what is competitive what is the companion that is 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.310
 the mode that you play to make 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.380
 tournaments to win for traveling 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.810
 etcetera etc. was for a long time that 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.820
 you expected me to get back into the game and 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.250
 finally got the chance south entered 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.809
 the ex-colga team joins the team 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.879
 teammate and now we're back 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.890
 reunited playing with luca fridge 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.079
 killer and many other players that 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.760
 they come from the playstation 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.940
 I think this was the most choice 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.800
 just the one to wait to see 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.920
 what happened because practically me 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.329
 I found myself on juan playing alone 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.190
 none of those that were mine 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:59.410
 old acquaintances of old friends who 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.270
 takes a competitive had gone to 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.739
 juan and I found myself alone with 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.610
 these qualifications 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:09.070
 let's say about the cod waw championship 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.220
 found trying to want to return to 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.040
 do complete that I never stopped 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.170
 try to try and I have always remained 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.010
 su juan saying no to adopt 60 does not 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.960
 does nothing without a team I never wanted 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.090
 throw away if I wanted to do it 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.340
 in fact not if I had a guide where I would have 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.950
 did you know they were on stand by or 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.590
 wsa the end I asked Corvia 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.010
 luca fridge all the sub prime players 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.689
 who welcomed me with open arms and 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.820
 we have formed a team of people 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.070
 who formed because I am a 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.140
 last entered and we all know each other 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.850
 we tried the experience together 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.850
 we have been abroad we have traveled 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.220
 we won and we lost and I think 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.770
 that all the problems were 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.270
 of hell are a bit out of date now 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.570
 that we will return to play together or 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.250
 because that climate that was there 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.050
 we say inside hell was not 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.770
 let's say the healthiest one you can 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.979
 to say 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.050
 and now the fact of being divided by 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.550
 have taken different paths or to 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.140
 having both taken breaks 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.570
 because I also go to other players 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.459
 not only of himself brought us to 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.260
 see what we had in the end 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.910
 done in the past in a different way e 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.070
 I am very happy to be part of the 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.180
 team subrime with which I will participate in 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.190
 the other to the world championship co 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.480
 I am happy with this because I would not have 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.490
 wanted to play with people who don't 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.010
 I knew I would have preferred to stay at 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.260
 home and looking at this because though 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.250
 I'm a competitive player all over 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:42.010
 let's not say a profiteer 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.140
 which is not because there is the tournament then it 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.640
 I have to play absolutely if I can 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.070
 play with the people I like 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.360
 play venturi videos with which we say 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.360
 which I know for karina are the only ones 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:54.010
 people I know by sight we are 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.650
 come out and so on and so on 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.330
 people who are not just players 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.040
 so this is also an additional factor 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.680
 who faced me again on the 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.390
 competitive scene I hope these 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.070
 reasons we did understand a little 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.720
 my thought of why I stopped 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.600
 because it offers a given only the public 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.830
 for now a new part will start well 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.750
 on the channel that will also be that of the 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.019
 compendium as soon as we start training 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.549
 to play and I think we will play in 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.930
 a different way will be a much more climate 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.440
 of fun that was what not 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.090
 there was a long time ago it was more a compensation 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.680
 climate of challenge 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.370
 we were all very two players a lot 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.500
 aggressive myself sometimes 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.780
 I took things too exaggerated and 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.340
 so i'm pretty happy with that 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.300
 change that there was also me 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.020
 same in the end not 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:43.690
 with my mates so I think so 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.030
 because in the end what can I tell you we are 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.340
 we have known each other for a long time the fact of shit 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.960
 something with open arms made me 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.820
 also think back to all that 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.230
 let's say it was before when it has 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.250
 traveled together I am very happy to 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.900
 this 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.490
 I hope to start this new phase of the 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.200
 my channel that will be the comrades part 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.150
 instead the public will always be in sight 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.620
 always seen maybe maybe a little bit of 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.970
 buster keel 4 I wouldn't want them holding 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.190
 abandoning because the end is at stake 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.930
 which he likes I hope we will succeed in 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.450
 represent Italy and I hope that there 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.250
 you will follow because obviously yours 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.350
 support is always so beautiful when 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.810
 I used to go to tournaments, I started before 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.519
 start reading the messages what 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:22.360
 he wrote de eccetera et cetera 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:25.240
 and then I think it's also nice we do 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.860
 when you have a person to follow that 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.050
 relates to other players 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.760
 etc. etc. so however there is 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.260
 I would recommend to be happy 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.790
 of this choice of mine then the ascom 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.540
 betis 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.540
 this is a new era
