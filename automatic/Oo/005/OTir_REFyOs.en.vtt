00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.020 
now but what will happen is every two
days<00:01:28.680> which<00:01:29.039> is<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.310> time<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.640> takes<00:01:29.670> for<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
days which is the time it takes for the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.039 
days which is the time it takes for the
inventory<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:31.049> reset<00:01:31.830> every<00:01:32.610> two<00:01:33.030> days<00:01:33.210> his

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
inventory to reset every two days his

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.260 
inventory to reset every two days his
inventory<00:01:34.409> will<00:01:35.070> get<00:01:35.399> better<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.880> better<00:01:35.939> and

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
inventory will get better and better and

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.940 
inventory will get better and better and
better<00:01:36.420> so<00:01:36.780> right<00:01:37.770> now<00:01:37.860> I'm<00:01:37.920> just<00:01:38.159> checking<00:01:39.950> at

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
better so right now I'm just checking at

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.460 
better so right now I'm just checking at
first<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.399> will<00:01:41.490> probably<00:01:42.420> not<00:01:42.960> have<00:01:43.289> the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
first you will probably not have the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.990 
first you will probably not have the
paralyzed<00:01:43.830> enchantment<00:01:44.369> I<00:01:44.429> think<00:01:44.640> it's<00:01:44.759> very

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
paralyzed enchantment I think it's very

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.850 
paralyzed enchantment I think it's very
rare<00:01:45.420> for<00:01:45.869> him<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.110> actually<00:01:46.289> have<00:01:46.709> the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
rare for him to actually have the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.469 
rare for him to actually have the
paralyzed<00:01:47.190> enchantment<00:01:47.759> rate<00:01:48.060> when<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.330> come

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
paralyzed enchantment rate when you come

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.600 
paralyzed enchantment rate when you come
back<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.869> them<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.830> think<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.190> only<00:01:50.310> chance

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
back to them and I think the only chance

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.090 
back to them and I think the only chance
the<00:01:51.060> only<00:01:51.299> reason<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.659> would<00:01:52.140> be<00:01:52.319> would<00:01:52.920> be

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
the only reason that would be would be

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.660 
the only reason that would be would be
because<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.940> your<00:01:54.479> level<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.130> that<00:01:56.130> was<00:01:56.280> just

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
because of your level and that was just

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.230 
because of your level and that was just
a<00:01:56.940> chance<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.810> getting<00:01:58.110> paralyzed<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.610> you

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
a chance of getting paralyzed so you

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.199 
a chance of getting paralyzed so you
want<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.569> wait<00:02:00.799> in<00:02:02.000> to-date<00:02:03.000> intervals<00:02:05.209> I'm

00:02:06.199 --> 00:02:06.209 
want to wait in to-date intervals I'm

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:07.820 
want to wait in to-date intervals I'm
just<00:02:06.360> going<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.569> check<00:02:06.899> if<00:02:07.080> she<00:02:07.259> has<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.560> same

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
just going to check if she has the same

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:25.640 
just going to check if she has the same

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
there there it is the glass maze of

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.430 
there there it is the glass maze of
immobilizing<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:30.270> chance<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.050> paralyze<00:03:31.410> a

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
immobilizing to chance to paralyze a

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.920 
immobilizing to chance to paralyze a
target<00:03:31.830> for<00:03:31.950> four<00:03:32.160> seconds<00:03:32.580> yeah<00:03:33.360> guys<00:03:33.569> so

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
target for four seconds yeah guys so

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.590 
target for four seconds yeah guys so
this<00:03:34.470> is<00:03:34.680> just<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:34.950> proof<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.520> my<00:03:36.239> method

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
this is just the proof that my method

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.660 
this is just the proof that my method
does<00:03:36.780> work<00:03:37.050> and<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:38.070> just<00:03:38.100> want<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.400> say<00:03:38.550> one

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
does work and I just want to say one

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:39.860 
does work and I just want to say one
thing<00:03:38.700> really<00:03:38.970> quickly<00:03:39.330> that<00:03:39.450> this<00:03:39.630> does

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
thing really quickly that this does

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.510 
thing really quickly that this does
revolve<00:03:40.200> around<00:03:40.350> your<00:03:40.709> level<00:03:41.070> so<00:03:41.280> if<00:03:41.370> your

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
revolve around your level so if your

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.009 
revolve around your level so if your
level<00:03:41.790> 10<00:03:42.000> it's<00:03:42.180> going<00:03:42.209> to<00:03:42.360> be<00:03:42.420> way<00:03:42.570> harder<00:03:42.780> to

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
level 10 it's going to be way harder to

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.820 
level 10 it's going to be way harder to
get<00:03:43.200> I<00:03:43.380> was<00:03:43.890> a<00:03:43.920> little<00:03:44.100> like<00:03:44.280> 45<00:03:44.910> during<00:03:45.360> this

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
get I was a little like 45 during this

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.250 
get I was a little like 45 during this
time<00:03:46.830> so<00:03:47.820> it<00:03:48.209> does<00:03:48.360> revolve<00:03:48.630> around<00:03:48.780> that<00:03:48.989> if

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
time so it does revolve around that if

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.990 
time so it does revolve around that if
you<00:03:49.350> guys<00:03:49.440> have<00:03:49.650> any<00:03:49.769> questions<00:03:50.160> please<00:03:50.459> put
