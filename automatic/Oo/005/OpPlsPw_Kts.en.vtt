00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
we're going to splash stick and we're

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.180 
we're going to splash stick and we're
only<00:00:50.840> going<00:00:51.020> to<00:00:51.079> use<00:00:51.199> half<00:00:51.260> of<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:51.770> clay<00:00:51.949> bar

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
this clay bar is pretty hard right now

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.270 
this clay bar is pretty hard right now
is<00:01:17.690> taking<00:01:18.110> it<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:18.530> put<00:01:18.710> it<00:01:18.799> in<00:01:18.890> a<00:01:18.950> bucket<00:01:19.100> of

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
water a soap bucket like you see here

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.700 
water a soap bucket like you see here
and<00:01:21.770> letting<00:01:21.979> absorb<00:01:22.520> for<00:01:22.790> about<00:01:23.380> 5<00:01:24.380> to<00:01:24.409> 10

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
and letting absorb for about 5 to 10

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.020 
and letting absorb for about 5 to 10
minutes<00:01:25.070> this<00:01:25.220> will<00:01:25.400> make<00:01:25.520> it<00:01:25.610> more<00:01:25.729> pliable

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
minutes this will make it more pliable

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.460 
minutes this will make it more pliable
because<00:01:26.750> we're<00:01:26.869> going<00:01:26.960> to<00:01:27.049> actually<00:01:27.259> see<00:01:27.380> if

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
because we're going to actually see if

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
because we're going to actually see if
this<00:01:27.590> into<00:01:27.770> a<00:01:27.830> pancake<00:01:28.070> form<00:01:30.130> puck<00:01:31.130> it's<00:01:31.340> been

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
this into a pancake form puck it's been

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.499 
this into a pancake form puck it's been
in<00:01:31.580> here<00:01:31.729> for<00:01:31.880> about<00:01:32.000> five<00:01:32.240> or<00:01:32.270> ten<00:01:32.479> minutes

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
in here for about five or ten minutes

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.320 
in here for about five or ten minutes
now<00:01:33.470> as<00:01:33.530> you<00:01:33.710> can<00:01:33.860> see<00:01:33.920> it's<00:01:34.700> become<00:01:35.060> pretty

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
now as you can see it's become pretty

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.990 
now as you can see it's become pretty
pliable<00:01:36.130> so<00:01:37.130> now<00:01:37.280> I'm<00:01:37.369> going<00:01:37.520> to<00:01:37.580> go<00:01:37.670> ahead<00:01:37.759> and

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
pliable so now I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.469 
pliable so now I'm going to go ahead and
put<00:01:38.149> this<00:01:38.240> into<00:01:38.420> a<00:01:38.540> pancake<00:01:39.350> form<00:01:39.950> okay<00:01:40.520> now

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
put this into a pancake form okay now

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.389 
put this into a pancake form okay now
our<00:01:41.509> goal<00:01:41.840> here<00:01:42.140> is<00:01:42.320> to<00:01:42.890> flatten<00:01:43.070> it<00:01:43.250> like<00:01:43.310> a

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
our goal here is to flatten it like a

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.919 
our goal here is to flatten it like a
pancake<00:01:43.729> we're<00:01:44.270> going<00:01:44.390> to<00:01:44.450> do<00:01:44.509> a<00:01:44.539> section<00:01:44.840> by

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.139 
can clay by our car you can use our
gloss<00:01:48.590> enhance<00:01:48.890> or<00:01:49.009> quick<00:01:49.160> detailer<00:01:49.580> if<00:01:49.970> you

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
gloss enhance or quick detailer if you

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:51.279 
gloss enhance or quick detailer if you
don't<00:01:50.330> have<00:01:50.509> an<00:01:50.660> area<00:01:50.899> where<00:01:50.929> you<00:01:51.020> can<00:01:51.140> watch

don't have an area where you can watch

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.290 
don't have an area where you can watch
the<00:01:51.470> cars<00:01:51.679> use<00:01:52.009> that<00:01:52.280> as<00:01:52.369> a<00:01:52.399> lubricant<00:01:52.789> but

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.300 
the cars use that as a lubricant but

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.969 
the cars use that as a lubricant but
what's<00:01:53.600> more<00:01:53.780> cost-effective<00:01:54.560> is<00:01:54.649> to<00:01:54.770> do<00:01:54.890> it

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
what's more cost-effective is to do it

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.290 
what's more cost-effective is to do it
with<00:01:55.070> a<00:01:55.100> gloss<00:01:55.310> shampoo<00:01:55.729> in<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:55.910> wash<00:01:56.060> process

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
with a gloss shampoo in the wash process

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.960 
with a gloss shampoo in the wash process

coming out of the paint finish and
that's<00:02:53.180> is<00:02:53.389> really<00:02:53.689> important<00:02:54.170> if<00:02:54.260> we're

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
that's is really important if we're

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.080 
that's is really important if we're
going<00:02:54.469> to<00:02:54.530> whack<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.889> polymer<00:02:55.310> car<00:02:55.519> they

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689 
and this is a very safe way to do it so

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.209 
and this is a very safe way to do it so

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
because you can see down here if we were

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.120 
because you can see down here if we were
to<00:03:40.549> watch<00:03:40.760> this<00:03:40.969> area<00:03:41.150> down<00:03:41.359> here<00:03:42.549> underneath

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
to watch this area down here underneath

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.010
