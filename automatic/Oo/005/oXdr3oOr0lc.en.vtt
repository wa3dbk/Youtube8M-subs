00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.010 
about social stealth which is which is
still<00:01:34.680> relevant<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.700> we<00:01:36.120> feel<00:01:36.540> we're<00:01:36.720> building

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
still relevant so we feel we're building

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.570 
still relevant so we feel we're building
on<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.229> pillars<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.650> expanding<00:01:38.340> them<00:01:38.460> in

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
on the pillars just expanding them in

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.060 
on the pillars just expanding them in
different<00:01:38.700> ways

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.380 

one<00:01:45.070> feedback<00:01:45.310> we<00:01:45.610> got<00:01:45.729> from<00:01:45.790> Assassin's

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
one feedback we got from Assassin's

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.030 
one feedback we got from Assassin's
Creed<00:01:46.540> 3<00:01:46.690> is<00:01:46.900> that<00:01:47.049> the<00:01:47.170> players<00:01:47.650> felt<00:01:47.890> there

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
Creed 3 is that the players felt there

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.010 
Creed 3 is that the players felt there
wasn't<00:01:48.190> as<00:01:48.490> much<00:01:48.520> stealth<00:01:49.360> opportunities

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
wasn't as much stealth opportunities

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.330 
wasn't as much stealth opportunities
anymore<00:01:50.409> so<00:01:50.560> this<00:01:50.680> is<00:01:50.830> one<00:01:50.979> of<00:01:51.100> the<00:01:51.159> key<00:01:51.310> things

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
anymore so this is one of the key things

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.160 
anymore so this is one of the key things
that<00:01:51.610> we've<00:01:51.820> really<00:01:52.060> pushed<00:01:52.270> this<00:01:52.450> we<00:01:52.990> give

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
that we've really pushed this we give

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.570 
that we've really pushed this we give
the<00:01:53.320> player<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.680> option<00:01:54.070> in<00:01:54.159> the<00:01:54.250> world<00:01:54.430> we

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
the player the option in the world we

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.730 
the player the option in the world we
build<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:54.970> missions<00:01:55.330> and<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.630> world<00:01:55.840> in<00:01:56.470> such

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
build the missions and the world in such

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.810 
build the missions and the world in such
a<00:01:56.770> way<00:01:57.009> that<00:01:57.040> there's<00:01:57.400> always<00:01:57.640> the<00:01:57.790> option

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
a way that there's always the option

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.640 
a way that there's always the option
yeah<00:01:58.210> you<00:01:58.270> can<00:01:58.450> go<00:01:58.570> in<00:01:58.750> all<00:01:58.990> action<00:01:59.440> but

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
yeah you can go in all action but

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.810 
yeah you can go in all action but
there's<00:01:59.800> always<00:02:00.009> going<00:02:00.159> to<00:02:00.220> be<00:02:00.280> a<00:02:00.369> stopping

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
there's always going to be a stopping

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.749 
there's always going to be a stopping

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
darts so the three areas that we can

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.960 
darts so the three areas that we can
really<00:02:13.540> push<00:02:13.860> graphics<00:02:14.860> physics<00:02:15.730> and

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
really push graphics physics and

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.600 
really push graphics physics and
connectivity<00:02:16.900> so<00:02:17.739> for<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.040> graphics<00:02:18.400> we<00:02:18.519> have

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
connectivity so for the graphics we have

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.340 
connectivity so for the graphics we have
new<00:02:18.760> lighting<00:02:19.239> systems<00:02:19.630> we<00:02:19.750> have<00:02:19.840> new<00:02:19.959> effects

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
new lighting systems we have new effects

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.229 
new lighting systems we have new effects
the<00:02:20.530> ocean<00:02:20.830> looks<00:02:21.010> incredible<00:02:21.550> we<00:02:22.120> have

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
the ocean looks incredible we have

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.320 
the ocean looks incredible we have
special<00:02:23.070> soft<00:02:24.070> body<00:02:24.340> on<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.730> sales<00:02:25.000> so<00:02:25.239> you

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
special soft body on the sales so you

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.630 
special soft body on the sales so you
can<00:02:25.450> see<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:25.690> sails<00:02:25.930> behave<00:02:26.320> differently<00:02:26.739> for

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
can see the sails behave differently for

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.250 
can see the sails behave differently for
physics<00:02:28.030> this<00:02:28.269> is<00:02:28.420> really<00:02:28.600> relevant<00:02:28.930> for<00:02:29.200> us

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
physics this is really relevant for us

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.960 
physics this is really relevant for us
because<00:02:29.470> we<00:02:29.709> have<00:02:29.860> this<00:02:29.980> huge<00:02:30.280> magnificent

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
because we have this huge magnificent

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.759 
because we have this huge magnificent
ocean<00:02:31.239> simulation<00:02:31.810> that<00:02:31.959> covers<00:02:32.380> our<00:02:32.500> world

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:32.769 
ocean simulation that covers our world

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.250 
ocean simulation that covers our world
and<00:02:32.980> with<00:02:33.489> with<00:02:33.760> next-gen<00:02:34.209> we<00:02:34.360> can<00:02:34.510> do<00:02:35.050> more

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
and with with next-gen we can do more

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.660 
and with with next-gen we can do more
calculations<00:02:35.920> than<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.160> make<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.459> waves

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
calculations than that make the waves

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.820 
calculations than that make the waves
more<00:02:36.970> precise<00:02:37.360> make<00:02:37.630> their<00:02:37.810> gameplay<00:02:38.230> more

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
more precise make their gameplay more

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.590 
more precise make their gameplay more
visceral<00:02:39.250> more<00:02:39.430> intense<00:02:39.760> more<00:02:39.970> accurate<00:02:40.420> and

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
visceral more intense more accurate and

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.820 
visceral more intense more accurate and
also<00:02:40.720> when<00:02:40.959> Edwards<00:02:41.260> swimming<00:02:41.590> through<00:02:41.709> the

also when Edwards swimming through the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.200 
also when Edwards swimming through the
water<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:42.519> can<00:02:42.670> be<00:02:42.819> more<00:02:43.000> accurate<00:02:43.209> and<00:02:43.569> more

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
water it can be more accurate and more

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.120 
water it can be more accurate and more
better<00:02:44.840> with<00:02:45.050> their<00:02:45.260> new<00:02:45.410> physics<00:02:45.800> which<00:02:45.950> also

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
better with their new physics which also

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.910 
better with their new physics which also
works<00:02:46.400> on<00:02:46.580> land<00:02:46.880> with<00:02:47.120> with<00:02:47.450> plant-based
