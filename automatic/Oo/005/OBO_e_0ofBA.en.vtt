00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
be as frequent sorry guys I'm not gonna

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.170 
be as frequent sorry guys I'm not gonna
try<00:01:19.560> but<00:01:19.890> I'm<00:01:20.100> not<00:01:20.370> gonna<00:01:20.460> make<00:01:20.640> any<00:01:20.790> promises

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
try but I'm not gonna make any promises

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.420 
try but I'm not gonna make any promises
but<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.600> his<00:01:21.840> shot<00:01:22.080> in<00:01:22.290> tear<00:01:23.000> this<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:25.430> tad

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
but on his shot in tear this is a tad

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.160 
but on his shot in tear this is a tad
bit<00:01:26.730> thinner<00:01:27.060> than<00:01:27.330> on<00:01:27.600> Zeke's<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.280> think

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
bit thinner than on Zeke's I think

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.450 
bit thinner than on Zeke's I think
Brittany<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.380> oddest<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.950> use<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
Brittany the oddest you use the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.730 
Brittany the oddest you use the
different<00:01:33.450> needle<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:33.990> both<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.230> their<00:01:34.470> hair

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
different needle on both of their hair

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.100 
different needle on both of their hair
so<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.160> think<00:01:35.370> Zeke<00:01:35.760> has<00:01:36.000> more<00:01:36.390> hair<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.930> like

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
so I think Zeke has more hair and like

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.680 
so I think Zeke has more hair and like
to<00:01:37.260> hold<00:01:37.440> and<00:01:37.770> talking<00:01:38.670> says<00:01:38.910> thanks<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.540> just

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
to hold and talking says thanks it just
