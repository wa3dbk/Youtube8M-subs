but you need to craft normal spider food
first<00:00:32.969> anyway<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.110> craft<00:00:34.290> spider<00:00:34.559> food<00:00:34.800> you

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
first anyway so to craft spider food you

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.950 
first anyway so to craft spider food you
just<00:00:35.280> need<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.489> surround<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.940> bit<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.480> raw<00:00:36.690> meat

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960

just need to surround a bit of raw meat
any<00:00:37.559> variety<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:38.460> can<00:00:38.550> have<00:00:38.640> like<00:00:38.820> rotten

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
any variety so you can have like rotten

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.389 
any variety so you can have like rotten
flesh<00:00:39.270> raw<00:00:39.870> beef<00:00:40.079> raw<00:00:40.469> chicken<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:40.950> raw<00:00:41.190> pork

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
flesh raw beef raw chicken and raw pork

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.430 
flesh raw beef raw chicken and raw pork
chop<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:42.149> surround<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.629> by<00:00:42.750> string<00:00:43.110> and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
chop and you surround it by string and

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.080 
chop and you surround it by string and
then<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.649> get<00:00:43.770> some<00:00:43.920> spider<00:00:44.280> food<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.850> I

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
then you get some spider food and I

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.369 
then you get some spider food and I
presume<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.539> basically<00:00:45.840> just<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.200> meat

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
presume it's basically just the meat

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.930 
presume it's basically just the meat
wrapped<00:00:46.710> in<00:00:46.890> string<00:00:47.219> or<00:00:47.370> something<00:00:47.640> like<00:00:47.730> that

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
wrapped in string or something like that

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.670 
wrapped in string or something like that
and<00:00:48.090> then<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.510> can<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.050> give<00:00:49.350> this<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.649> a

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
and then you can just and give this to a

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.830 
and then you can just and give this to a
spider<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.160> all<00:00:50.280> tame<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.700> now<00:00:51.210> all<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.719> these

spider food you can actually go ahead

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.639 
spider food you can actually go ahead
and<00:01:00.239> craft<00:01:00.510> some<00:01:00.660> more<00:01:00.809> advanced<00:01:01.109> spider<00:01:01.440> food

which is golden spider food and you
craft<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.439> just<00:01:04.860> by<00:01:04.979> surrounding<00:01:05.489> the

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
craft this just by surrounding the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.670 
craft this just by surrounding the
spider<00:01:05.880> food<00:01:06.060> where<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.840> gold<00:01:07.080> ingots<00:01:07.439> like

that and then you get some special

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.520 
that and then you get some special
golden<00:01:09.060> spider<00:01:09.390> food<00:01:09.600> we<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.260> pretty<00:01:10.409> much

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
golden spider food we just pretty much

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.830 
golden spider food we just pretty much
this<00:01:10.710> just<00:01:11.040> yellow<00:01:11.340> which<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.760> awesome<00:01:12.450> but

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
this just yellow which is awesome but

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.820 
this just yellow which is awesome but
anyway<00:01:13.080> there<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> difference<00:01:13.770> between

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
anyway there is a difference between

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.649 
anyway there is a difference between
these<00:01:14.040> two<00:01:14.250> one<00:01:14.760> of<00:01:14.880> these<00:01:15.030> will<00:01:15.360> actually

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
these two one of these will actually

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.390 
these two one of these will actually
team<00:01:15.930> spiders<00:01:16.439> more<00:01:16.650> successfully<00:01:17.159> than<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
team spiders more successfully than the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.800 
team spiders more successfully than the
other<00:01:17.549> one<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:18.180> I'll<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.479> give<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:18.689> an

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
other one and I'll just give you an

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.330 
other one and I'll just give you an
example<00:01:19.080> now<00:01:19.259> if<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.650> place<00:01:19.860> down<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.130> spider

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
example now if I place down the spider

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.039 
example now if I place down the spider
to<00:01:20.820> actually<00:01:21.030> tame<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.360> all<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.540> need<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:21.869> do<00:01:21.960> is

to actually tame it all I need to do is

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.480 
to actually tame it all I need to do is
right-click<00:01:22.380> on<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.950> spider<00:01:23.189> with<00:01:23.430> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
right-click on the spider with the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.039 
right-click on the spider with the
spider<00:01:23.729> food<00:01:23.909> like<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.780> can<00:01:24.930> see<00:01:25.020> I

spider food like so and you can see I
right-click<00:01:25.350> with<00:01:25.619> this<00:01:25.740> one<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.100> it<00:01:26.189> didn't

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
right-click with this one and it didn't

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.830

that<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:45.510> can<00:02:45.540> actually<00:02:45.720> climb<00:02:46.080> at<00:02:46.230> walls

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
that you can actually climb at walls

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.750 
that you can actually climb at walls
while<00:02:46.739> you're<00:02:46.860> on<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.010> back<00:02:47.130> of<00:02:47.250> a<00:02:47.310> spider

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
while you're on the back of a spider

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.130 
while you're on the back of a spider
I<00:02:47.880> mean<00:02:48.209> look<00:02:48.360> at<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.720> can<00:02:48.840> just<00:02:48.959> climb

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
I mean look at that you can just climb

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.360 
I mean look at that you can just climb
up<00:02:49.230> blocks<00:02:49.470> everywhere<00:02:49.830> you<00:02:50.040> don't<00:02:50.130> have<00:02:50.280> to

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
up blocks everywhere you don't have to

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.490 
up blocks everywhere you don't have to
jump<00:02:50.610> for<00:02:50.760> anything<00:02:50.940> just<00:02:51.209> insti<00:02:51.930> climbs<00:02:52.260> up

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
jump for anything just insti climbs up

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.229 
jump for anything just insti climbs up
the<00:02:52.590> blocks<00:02:52.830> and<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.519> can't<00:02:53.700> actually<00:02:53.850> jump

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
the blocks and you can't actually jump

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:55.580 
the blocks and you can't actually jump
while<00:02:54.360> you're<00:02:54.480> on<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.569> spider<00:02:54.840> you're<00:02:55.470> only

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
while you're on a spider you're only

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.780 
while you're on a spider you're only
able<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:55.920> actually<00:02:56.190> climb<00:02:56.370> with<00:02:56.549> the<00:02:56.610> block

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
able to actually climb with the block

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.850 
able to actually climb with the block
she<00:02:56.970> can't<00:02:57.150> jump<00:02:57.420> sadly<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:58.380> which<00:02:58.530> is<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.680> bit

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
she can't jump sadly that which is a bit

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.009 
she can't jump sadly that which is a bit
wrong<00:02:59.100> really<00:02:59.489> because<00:02:59.760> spiders<00:03:00.600> can<00:03:00.810> like

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
wrong really because spiders can like

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.630 
wrong really because spiders can like
lunge<00:03:01.260> forward<00:03:01.590> at<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:01.860> while<00:03:02.130> jumping

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
lunge forward at you while jumping

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.400 
lunge forward at you while jumping
oh<00:03:02.730> but<00:03:03.299> sadly<00:03:03.510> you<00:03:03.630> can't<00:03:03.900> do<00:03:04.049> that<00:03:04.200> while

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
oh but sadly you can't do that while

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.199 
oh but sadly you can't do that while
riding<00:03:04.709> on<00:03:04.890> spider<00:03:05.280> back<00:03:05.549> it<00:03:05.940> sounds<00:03:06.150> a<00:03:06.180> bit

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
riding on spider back it sounds a bit

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.210 
riding on spider back it sounds a bit
weird<00:03:06.330> really<00:03:06.810> riding<00:03:07.260> on<00:03:07.410> spider<00:03:07.739> back<00:03:07.950> but

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
weird really riding on spider back but

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.860 
weird really riding on spider back but
yeah<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.700> doesn't<00:03:08.910> able<00:03:09.150> you<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.299> climb<00:03:09.540> stuff

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
yeah it doesn't able you to climb stuff

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.270 
yeah it doesn't able you to climb stuff
like<00:03:10.049> this<00:03:10.140> tree<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:10.440> mean<00:03:10.500> look<00:03:10.769> how<00:03:10.950> awesome

like this tree I mean look how awesome
maze<00:03:11.819> is<00:03:12.360> brilliant<00:03:13.110> I<00:03:13.140> didn't<00:03:13.350> expect<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.709> to

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
maze is brilliant I didn't expect it to

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.430 
maze is brilliant I didn't expect it to
work<00:03:13.830> this<00:03:14.069> well<00:03:14.250> but<00:03:14.400> it<00:03:14.519> really<00:03:14.640> does<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.440> I

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
just fell to the ground and damaged my

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.759

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
all crafted in the same way he just

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.920 
all crafted in the same way he just
changed<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.880> resource<00:03:42.299> you're<00:03:42.510> using<00:03:42.690> to

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
changed the resource you're using to

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.509 
changed the resource you're using to
make<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.230> armor<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:43.769> then<00:03:44.220> once<00:03:44.400> you've<00:03:44.489> got

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
make the armor and then once you've got

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.130 
make the armor and then once you've got
yourself<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.030> armor<00:03:45.299> you<00:03:45.329> can<00:03:45.510> just<00:03:45.690> go<00:03:45.870> up<00:03:45.900> to

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
yourself the armor you can just go up to

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.420 
yourself the armor you can just go up to
the<00:03:46.230> spider<00:03:46.650> you<00:03:46.799> want<00:03:46.920> to<00:03:47.010> actually<00:03:47.100> put<00:03:47.370> it

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
the spider you want to actually put it

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.430 
the spider you want to actually put it
on<00:03:47.519> just<00:03:47.700> shift<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:48.690> right<00:03:48.870> click<00:03:48.930> and<00:03:49.290> then

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
on just shift and right click and then

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.250 
on just shift and right click and then
put<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.799> armor<00:03:50.519> on<00:03:50.640> the<00:03:51.090> spider<00:03:51.390> and<00:03:51.660> again<00:03:51.989> it

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
put the armor on the spider and again it

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.440 
put the armor on the spider and again it
updates<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.799> skin<00:03:53.070> adding<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.790> armor<00:03:54.180> to<00:03:54.209> it

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
updates the skin adding the armor to it

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.349 
updates the skin adding the armor to it
isn't<00:03:54.840> actually<00:03:55.260> like<00:03:55.470> one<00:03:56.310> pixel<00:03:56.670> it<00:03:56.940> just

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
isn't actually like one pixel it just

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:58.789 
isn't actually like one pixel it just
changes<00:03:58.109> the<00:03:58.260> colour<00:03:58.440> of<00:03:58.470> the<00:03:58.590> spider

00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 
changes the colour of the spider

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.440 
changes the colour of the spider
directly<00:03:59.310> I<00:03:59.489> was<00:03:59.790> hoping<00:04:00.000> it'd<00:04:00.120> have<00:04:00.239> like<00:04:00.359> a

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
directly I was hoping it'd have like a

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.090 
directly I was hoping it'd have like a
pixel<00:04:00.810> extra<00:04:01.260> outward<00:04:01.620> so<00:04:01.799> it<00:04:01.859> actually

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
pixel extra outward so it actually

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.440 
pixel extra outward so it actually
looked<00:04:02.280> like<00:04:02.310> it<00:04:02.489> was<00:04:02.579> armor<00:04:02.880> and<00:04:03.000> not<00:04:03.090> just<00:04:03.269> a

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
looked like it was armor and not just a

for<00:05:28.660> that<00:05:28.720> is<00:05:29.050> but<00:05:29.470> look<00:05:29.560> at<00:05:29.650> those<00:05:29.740> legs

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
for that is but look at those legs

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.280 
for that is but look at those legs
scuttling<00:05:30.610> around<00:05:30.730> it's<00:05:31.000> just<00:05:31.150> amazing<00:05:31.720> love

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
scuttling around it's just amazing love

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.080

this<00:05:32.440> mod<00:05:32.680> I<00:05:32.919> mean<00:05:33.070> what's<00:05:33.790> cooler<00:05:34.030> than

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
this mod I mean what's cooler than

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.940 
this mod I mean what's cooler than
riding<00:05:34.360> spider<00:05:34.720> this<00:05:34.930> well<00:05:35.140> riding<00:05:35.560> sheep<00:05:35.770> of

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
riding spider this well riding sheep of

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.740 
riding spider this well riding sheep of
course<00:05:36.160> but<00:05:36.370> there's<00:05:36.880> no<00:05:37.030> mod<00:05:37.360> so<00:05:37.510> that<00:05:37.630> adds

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
course but there's no mod so that adds

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.780 
course but there's no mod so that adds
rideable<00:05:38.229> sheep<00:05:38.470> so<00:05:38.830> can't<00:05:39.430> really<00:05:39.610> do<00:05:39.760> that

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
rideable sheep so can't really do that

rideable sheep so can't really do that
at<00:05:40.060> the<00:05:40.150> moment<00:05:40.330> but<00:05:40.690> there<00:05:40.840> we<00:05:40.930> go<00:05:41.050> so<00:05:41.229> that's

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
at the moment but there we go so that's

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.440 
at the moment but there we go so that's
the<00:05:41.500> rideable<00:05:41.950> spiders<00:05:42.430> mod<00:05:42.640> now<00:05:43.150> there's<00:05:43.330> one

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:46.170 
last thing I actually want to check and
that<00:05:45.100> is<00:05:45.220> whether<00:05:45.460> it'll<00:05:45.610> actually<00:05:45.729> attack

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180
