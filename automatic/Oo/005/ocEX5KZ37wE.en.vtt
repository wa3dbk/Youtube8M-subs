00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 What's the good time to talk to the people? 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.080
 sugar planters facing you 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.780
 for us it was 637 forward with a 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.719
 way forward with gabi but finally 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.610
 I will give tips to complement the 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.580
 content of our poll for 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.949
 Future cities have two blogs as well 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.560
 legal and phone is a website called are 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.420
 paulo just helps to count the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.310
 history of the city that mistreats 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.380
 story with the site is very cool account 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.900
 two fascinating stories about the 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.149
 monuments that existed there are more 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.100
 houses were demolished because 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.350
 some pieces of buildings that was 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.090
 building that has now address are 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.700
 paulo antiguo com.br 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.860
 and the other site that is a site there 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.980
 an urbanist with a very 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.020
 accessible to a layman like me who is a website 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.660
 called cities to whom he has 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.489
 several criticisms of some policies 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.230
 deployed in são paulo and also in 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.260
 some of her hits so it's nice 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.699
 It's just do not get off the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.699
 Example of a master plan of Sao Paulo is good 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.680
 or bad is good is bad not he has one 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.630
 hand he criticizes it has a very 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.810
 side that he said that a big hit 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.430
 And there you are, this helps you understand the 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.979
 how many walks to a site also enough 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.119
 interesting with super language 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.610
 accessible then the two tips remain. 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.210
 related internet camera subject 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.270
 two there maybe it's good I'll go it was mine 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.360
 body is an ex videos site by not want 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.540
 My body is really good and it's a game. 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.250
 called monument goes that I even think 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.100
 that the boy the team remembered that was 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.200
 quoted in the very long do not you maybe 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.030
 This one was not quoted. You need to 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.979
 Vaccinate is also the one with the good 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.200
 I'm doing all week long 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.020
 New did not really care about bars in game. 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.549
 bees the fraud requiring a young man and 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.229
 always always talk this early 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.119
 program then I think that many times 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.079
 instead of talking any shit or 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.079
 just keep quiet 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.690
 but the story of the game is a super game 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.820
 Simple, you wind up quickly. 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.100
 the perspective of the game is 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.780
 constructed in an isometric view that 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.060
 exact perspective right 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.610
 without distortion of lenses and precisely 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.400
 being isometric becomes very easy 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.500
 make jokes like paintings and 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.330
 drawings studies of the west those 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.310
 stair studies that one hour she is 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.950
 down and others to rise and you no longer 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.160
 knows where the platform really is and 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.160
 such 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.060
 then play it is a big one big 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.829
 this is a game of 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.480
 platform you need to bring to 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.909
 character the little girl to walk 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.519
 different and promising different only 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:43.489
 this thing of isometric vision counts the 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.530
 perspective says cheer always is the 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.180
 great weight of the game that is what you have 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.310
 to win to get through and 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.930
 going to the stages is really fun 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.459
 I paid a little bit I do not remember how much 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.200
 but I think two or three dollars is worth 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.970
 worth a game you stand there on the couch 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.470
 do not do or if you like 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.599
 touch game on the ball I have hair 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.269
 generic also with android but have to 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.220
 I watched there with him that was provoking. 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.720
 my wife if I want you to talk 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.730
 that I know that you also played in a 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.650
 game that was highly acclaimed at the time 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.200
 that was released free step 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.750
 recently irna in the xbox that the lingo 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.730
 Dude, I played language only now that 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.650
 world already played I decided to play the limbo 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.659
 of the friend listener limbo 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.629
 But I do not think it's up to you. 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:26.239
 I played here, the guy is the most beautiful thing. 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.939
 so this game is a work of art has 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.340
 a refinement a finish without the baby 

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:34.010
 she is absolutely amazing bequest 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.959
 language as well as the absence of 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.449
 this makes the business more 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.099
 incredible still and so and how it does not 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.900
 How do you start playing the language? 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:46.489
 does not tell you anything, does he not be a 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.889
 boy and his sister disappeared and gustavo 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:50.959
 Aquino then told you I had face 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:53.829
 and that's why I got it. 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.829
 do lots of fun stuff 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.730
 the first thing that takes a vacation face 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.440
 This is a great favor. 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.450
 I 've wanted to talk for a long time already. 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.030
 several times my father is good. 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.010
 your quality days having a game 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.570
 That we miss you first, he was 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.830
 said that was you define the 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.170
 The feeling I have for this game is 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.720
 longing that is gta san andreas 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.520
 and then I went to california now I 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.930
 I visited los angeles san francisco 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.390
 vegas that are exactly the cities 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.670
 portrayed in gta san andreas seppi e 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.960
 one more fringe and also that in the game 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.600
 are the saints 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.210
 sancho i and alley adventures and then when 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.370
 I had the sensation of deja vu luan 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.020
 saints still poor gta5 né 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.060
 At home I've already had it here and drive with 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.740
 these places I did not go to the piano 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.270
 equivalent to the Santa Monica Pier which 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.070
 Are you there in Los Angeles? 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.050
 I already killed the guy, only the giant wheel went well. 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.910
 hence our live glasses is our technique in 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.040
 Head face is awesome there 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.070
 when I came back to the people to play and then I 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.500
 I was looking for a lot and in xbox 360 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.450
 Can you buy it there and see it? 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.340
 you cheap is this is a 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.710
 xbox emulator guy because he before 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.240
 of soccer josé simões 360 and I started 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.680
 already to impose itself in the hole I will not 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.270
 to play a game that is so 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.620
 surpassed after playing currently 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.930
 not after start, I was a little surprised 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.940
 the graphics are not so good and such 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.100
 normal life, fun and expensive is 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:13.960
 awesome as it is the best game 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:16.180
 videogame already done in general is that the 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.520
 gt those who are already investing 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.940
 I really do this in the beginning, I take vacations and 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.140
 play andré is my soccer is quick 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.790
 various toys have even said that 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.800
 here is the max ratings, which is the 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.479
 hell he talks about the second 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.160
 World War II and even said that rather a 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:32.470
 his cool thing and that he would answer 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.330
 of the second total war and five of a 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.460
 more human point of view so in a 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.590
 he tells about battles as 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:41.800
 the entire political and economic organization 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:43.990
 such but it always gives one focused on 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.870
 tell human stories that will happen 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:50.860
 from here then there is a soldier there 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:52.690
 a family and if such and now the 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.419
 time that book here is the foreman 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:56.950
 trophy 1914 europe war also his 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:59.320
 what is the first world war 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.150
 which in fact now completed 100 in July 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.400
 years 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.780
 It's the same style he also tells 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.710
 history of the war on the 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:06.540
 human view 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.520
 only it is focused on the body at the beginning 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.740
 of war is because we usually say 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.320
 the romantic vision and first war 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.730
 was a useless war that did not 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.580
 should have happened that all 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:20.070
 sides were wrong and wrong and such 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.360
 he has a point in this book that he 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.760
 wants to show that it was not a war 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:25.350
 unnecessary as we say today is the 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.210
 first world war the beginning of the era 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.710
 almost an episode of keys like this is the 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.930
 his early bird took a slap in the face of the 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.270
 time beating xavier keys was hit 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.710
 in the 500 km and rock with a little problem 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:36.540
 world war is important because the 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:38.250
 people are in the year is the centenary of 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.420
 war the numbers of the first war 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:41.610
 world bought 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:43.740
 so the second track played by 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.180
 child in Galicia first several others 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.620
 books has a very famous book about the 

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.660
 first war that was also launched 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.460
 in brazil it is the somnambulism that he 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.170
 account of the German point of view of 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:54.480
 war risk he made a miniseries 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.640
 on the first war now okay 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.920
 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.750
 telling the story of the characters of the 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:03.540
 second war where they were in 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.430
 stalin's first speech speaks of stalin 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:09.230
 in favor of chelsea john terry gou de 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.230
 very cool show marketing 

00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:16.520
 so that's it we got to the end very well 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.520
 Kiss of the fat was valid and Aymara. 

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:25.479
 Who will start with the good you esteem? 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:35.409
 your smartphone 

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:40.080
 I will not say that you ask me to be 

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:40.080
 always flawless today you go
