gets confused with the reflective

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.219 
gets confused with the reflective
platters<00:01:28.270> all<00:01:29.270> right<00:01:29.509> see<00:01:29.749> it's<00:01:29.899> not<00:01:30.079> one

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
platters all right see it's not one

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.789 
platters all right see it's not one
focus<00:01:30.709> on<00:01:30.859> it<00:01:30.950> there<00:01:31.189> we<00:01:31.340> go<00:01:31.509> all<00:01:32.509> right<00:01:32.799> this

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
focus on it there we go all right this

focus on it there we go all right this
right<00:01:34.039> here<00:01:34.789> these<00:01:35.450> are<00:01:35.689> of<00:01:35.780> course<00:01:35.959> the

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
right here these are of course the

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.880 
right here these are of course the
platters<00:01:36.649> on<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.700> spindle<00:01:38.319> that<00:01:39.319> right<00:01:39.619> there

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
platters on the spindle that right there

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.339 
platters on the spindle that right there
is<00:01:40.159> the<00:01:40.640> arm<00:01:40.819> and<00:01:41.179> the<00:01:41.359> heads<00:01:41.659> are<00:01:41.929> right<00:01:42.109> up<00:01:42.229> in

00:01:42.339 --> 00:01:42.349 
is the arm and the heads are right up in

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:44.800 
is the arm and the heads are right up in
there<00:01:42.560> this<00:01:43.459> is<00:01:43.640> what<00:01:43.789> move<00:01:43.969> that<00:01:44.299> moves<00:01:44.569> the

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
there this is what move that moves the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.990 
there this is what move that moves the
heads<00:01:45.020> it<00:01:45.200> works<00:01:45.409> like<00:01:45.649> the<00:01:45.920> voice<00:01:46.340> coil<00:01:46.700> on<00:01:46.969> a

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
heads it works like the voice coil on a

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.929 
heads it works like the voice coil on a
speaker<00:01:47.479> it's<00:01:47.750> magnetic<00:01:48.399> alright<00:01:49.399> let's<00:01:49.610> take

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 
speaker it's magnetic alright let's take

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:56.289 
speaker it's magnetic alright let's take
a<00:01:50.000> closer<00:01:50.299> look<00:01:54.069> all<00:01:55.069> right<00:01:55.280> now<00:01:55.549> guess<00:01:56.090> what

a closer look all right now guess what
we're<00:01:56.539> gonna<00:01:56.659> power<00:01:56.989> this<00:01:57.259> hard<00:01:57.500> drive<00:01:57.679> up<00:01:58.069> you

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
we're gonna power this hard drive up you

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.179 
we're gonna power this hard drive up you
ready<00:01:59.179> oh<00:01:59.479> by<00:02:00.409> the<00:02:00.439> way<00:02:00.530> before<00:02:00.619> you<00:02:00.950> power<00:02:01.099> it

ready oh by the way before you power it

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.819 
ready oh by the way before you power it
up<00:02:01.420> look<00:02:02.420> in<00:02:02.539> the<00:02:02.599> heads<00:02:02.810> hi<00:02:03.349> they're

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
up look in the heads hi they're

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
all right now we're going to power this

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:28.860 
all right now we're going to power this
up<00:02:07.909> here<00:02:08.299> we<00:02:08.390> go

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870
