00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.709 
but you can see I got this snap ring one
side<00:00:05.490> of<00:00:05.640> it<00:00:05.759> now<00:00:05.940> is<00:00:06.210> on<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:08.300> outside<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.599> the

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
side of it now is on the outside and the

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.530 
side of it now is on the outside and the
other<00:00:09.750> sides<00:00:10.019> on<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.230> inside<00:00:10.469> so<00:00:11.150> if<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.420> were

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
other sides on the inside so if I were

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.509 
other sides on the inside so if I were
to<00:00:12.660> like<00:00:12.809> push<00:00:13.530> this<00:00:13.710> down<00:00:13.920> there<00:00:14.190> only<00:00:14.340> would

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
to like push this down there only would

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:15.980 
to like push this down there only would
snap<00:00:14.759> back<00:00:14.940> in<00:00:15.059> place<00:00:15.269> and<00:00:15.299> undo<00:00:15.719> everything

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
wedged it up this way and kind of

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.010 
wedged it up this way and kind of
provide<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.399> that's<00:00:35.399> where<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.910> now<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.809> so

now<00:00:37.290> I'm<00:00:37.440> going<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.710> take<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.629> ahead<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.780> pry

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
now I'm going to take this ahead and pry

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.979 
now I'm going to take this ahead and pry
it<00:00:40.170> out<00:00:43.520> get<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.640> whole<00:00:44.820> way<00:00:44.940> out<00:00:45.180> Oh<00:00:45.829> Brown

they don't screw this up since I'm doing
this<00:00:50.129> one-handed<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.700> video<00:00:51.770> but<00:00:52.770> anyway<00:00:53.100> that

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
this one-handed on video but anyway that

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.420 
this one-handed on video but anyway that
took<00:00:54.809> some<00:00:54.960> effort<00:00:55.079> either<00:00:55.590> pair<00:00:55.920> pliers<00:00:56.129> so

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
took some effort either pair pliers so

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.130 
took some effort either pair pliers so
obviously<00:00:56.730> if<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.030> fair<00:00:57.690> snapper<00:00:58.020> in

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
obviously if you have a fair snapper in

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.680 
obviously if you have a fair snapper in
quarters<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.590> be<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.890> ton<00:00:59.280> easier<00:00:59.399> but<00:00:59.789> you<00:01:00.600> know

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
quarters to be a ton easier but you know

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.290 
quarters to be a ton easier but you know
things<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:01.440> two<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.550> half<00:01:02.640> inches<00:01:03.239> in

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
things like two and a half inches in

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.410 
things like two and a half inches in
diameter<00:01:03.570> something<00:01:05.210> also

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
diameter something also

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.280 
diameter something also
OOP<00:01:06.630> there<00:01:06.659> goes<00:01:08.479> fantastic<00:01:09.530> it's<00:01:11.540> 220<00:01:12.540> now<00:01:12.720> so

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
OOP there goes fantastic it's 220 now so

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.050 
OOP there goes fantastic it's 220 now so
that<00:01:14.010> may<00:01:14.189> seem<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.430> it's<00:01:14.670> taken<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.939> long

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
that may seem like it's taken a long

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.969 
that may seem like it's taken a long
time<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.330> get<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.630> where<00:01:15.750> I<00:01:15.810> am<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.380> did<00:01:16.770> daily

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
time to get to where I am I did daily

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.830 
time to get to where I am I did daily
daily<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.430> little<00:01:17.759> bit<00:01:17.880> between<00:01:18.090> stuff<00:01:18.540> but

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
daily a little bit between stuff but

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.870 
daily a little bit between stuff but
yeah<00:01:20.570> doing<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:23.450> race<00:01:24.450> off<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:25.259> inner<00:01:25.409> race

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
yeah doing that race off the inner race

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.260 
yeah doing that race off the inner race
of<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:28.430> don't<00:01:29.430> they<00:01:29.820> take<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.030> long<00:01:30.210> time

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.740 
of that I don't they take a long time
and<00:01:30.750> then<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:31.140> would<00:01:31.680> charge<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:32.040> camera

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
and then I would charge a camera

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.149 
and then I would charge a camera
ourselves<00:01:33.750> being<00:01:34.079> done<00:01:34.229> walls<00:01:34.439> works<00:01:34.829> and

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
ourselves being done walls works and

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.920 
ourselves being done walls works and
everything<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:36.380> anyway<00:01:37.380> that's<00:01:38.479> about<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
everything but anyway that's about the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.700 
everything but anyway that's about the
time<00:01:40.110> it's<00:01:40.320> taking<00:01:40.680> now<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:42.110> care<00:01:43.110> about<00:01:43.320> focus

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
time it's taking now so care about focus

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.609 
time it's taking now so care about focus
but<00:01:43.920> I'm<00:01:44.759> going<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.000> take<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.240> and<00:01:45.689> put<00:01:46.590> it

as<00:02:13.290> Parker<00:02:14.290> CKY<00:02:14.680> said<00:02:15.100> I<00:02:15.130> think<00:02:15.430> you're<00:02:15.640> like

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
as Parker CKY said I think you're like

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.440 
as Parker CKY said I think you're like
now<00:02:16.570> more<00:02:17.230> than<00:02:17.350> half<00:02:17.530> for<00:02:17.770> sure<00:02:18.450> pressing

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
now more than half for sure pressing

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.970 
now more than half for sure pressing
that<00:02:19.510> bearing<00:02:19.810> in<00:02:19.959> is<00:02:20.200> difficult<00:02:20.830> and

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
that bearing in is difficult and

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.110 
that bearing in is difficult and
hopefully<00:02:21.280> I'll<00:02:21.430> be<00:02:21.459> able<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.730> get<00:02:21.850> some<00:02:22.000> video

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
hopefully I'll be able to get some video

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.330 
hopefully I'll be able to get some video
that<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.660> also<00:02:23.110> have<00:02:23.500> to<00:02:23.620> take<00:02:23.739> it<00:02:23.920> somewhere<00:02:24.070> to

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
that I also have to take it somewhere to

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:25.620 
that I also have to take it somewhere to
press<00:02:24.670> it<00:02:24.790> in<00:02:24.880> because<00:02:25.030> you<00:02:25.060> need<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.270> big<00:02:25.390> arbor

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
press it in because you need a big arbor

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.120 
press it in because you need a big arbor
press<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.050> I<00:02:26.170> have<00:02:26.320> it<00:02:26.440> I<00:02:26.590> don't<00:02:26.650> have<00:02:26.890> one<00:02:27.040> at

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
press and I have it I don't have one at

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.340 
press and I have it I don't have one at
home<00:02:27.390> because<00:02:28.390> it's<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.540> big<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:28.900> know<00:02:28.930> unit

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
home because it's a big you know unit

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.020 
home because it's a big you know unit
but<00:02:29.860> maybe<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.160> could<00:02:30.310> take<00:02:30.400> some<00:02:30.580> video<00:02:30.820> when<00:02:31.000> I

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
but maybe I could take some video when I

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.550 
but maybe I could take some video when I
go<00:02:31.239> to<00:02:31.300> work<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:31.660> do<00:02:31.750> it<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.140> do<00:02:32.290> it<00:02:32.320> at<00:02:32.470> work

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
go to work and do it and do it at work

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.890 
go to work and do it and do it at work
it's<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:33.730> Saturday<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:34.180> hopefully<00:02:34.600> no<00:02:34.660> one's

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
it's a Saturday so hopefully no one's

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.930 
it's a Saturday so hopefully no one's
there<00:02:35.080> and<00:02:35.200> everything<00:02:35.580> all<00:02:36.580> right<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:36.760> guess

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
there and everything all right I guess

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.620 
there and everything all right I guess
I'm<00:02:37.090> rambling<00:02:37.870> on<00:02:37.989> but<00:02:38.640> yeah<00:02:39.640> that's<00:02:40.300> what<00:02:40.510> I'm

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
I'm rambling on but yeah that's what I'm

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.810 
I'm rambling on but yeah that's what I'm
planning<00:02:40.810> on<00:02:40.930> doing<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.440> I<00:02:41.650> will<00:02:41.890> like<00:02:42.580> clean

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
planning on doing and I will like clean

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.120 
planning on doing and I will like clean
this<00:02:42.970> piece<00:02:43.270> up<00:02:43.480> a<00:02:43.600> little<00:02:43.810> bit<00:02:43.930> was<00:02:44.140> this<00:02:44.320> the

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
this piece up a little bit was this the

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:54.680 
this piece up a little bit was this the
Dremel<00:02:45.520> and<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:48.900> little<00:02:49.900> brush<00:02:50.410> good<00:02:53.310> yeah

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
Dremel and the little brush good yeah

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.670 
Dremel and the little brush good yeah
things<00:02:55.690> up<00:02:55.870> up<00:02:56.019> as<00:02:56.140> much<00:02:56.320> as<00:02:56.440> I<00:02:56.500> can<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:58.180> then

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
things up up as much as I can and then

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.610 
things up up as much as I can and then
well<00:02:59.680> just<00:03:00.750> after<00:03:01.750> I've<00:03:01.840> come<00:03:02.110> that<00:03:02.260> out<00:03:02.410> I'll

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
well just after I've come that out I'll

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.259 
well just after I've come that out I'll
depressing<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.130> next<00:03:03.310> one<00:03:03.489> but<00:03:03.730> counting

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
depressing the next one but counting

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:05.610 
depressing the next one but counting
this<00:03:04.390> part<00:03:04.630> out<00:03:04.720> is<00:03:04.930> very<00:03:05.260> similar<00:03:05.500> to

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
this part out is very similar to

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.880 
this part out is very similar to
pounding<00:03:05.980> out<00:03:06.100> that<00:03:06.370> oh<00:03:06.630> it's<00:03:07.630> just<00:03:07.959> going<00:03:08.799> to

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
pounding out that oh it's just going to

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.630 
pounding out that oh it's just going to
look<00:03:08.950> like<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.400> bearing<00:03:09.760> instead<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:11.640> that

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
look like the bearing instead of that

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.970 
look like the bearing instead of that
we'll<00:03:13.540> use<00:03:13.570> a<00:03:13.750> bigger<00:03:14.019> diameter<00:03:14.230> piece<00:03:14.799> in

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
we'll use a bigger diameter piece in

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.190 
we'll use a bigger diameter piece in
fact<00:03:15.220> I<00:03:15.489> might<00:03:16.120> just<00:03:16.360> use<00:03:16.480> the<00:03:16.630> old<00:03:16.780> bearing

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
fact I might just use the old bearing

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.259 
fact I might just use the old bearing
and<00:03:17.410> pound<00:03:17.620> on<00:03:17.739> that<00:03:17.830> since<00:03:18.730> it's<00:03:18.940> going<00:03:19.180> to

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
and pound on that since it's going to

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.070 
and pound on that since it's going to
the<00:03:19.330> right<00:03:19.510> size

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
the right size

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.810 
the right size
of<00:03:20.560> course<00:03:20.799> if<00:03:20.980> you're<00:03:21.100> doing<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.459> first<00:03:21.580> one

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
of course if you're doing the first one

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.140 
of course if you're doing the first one
you<00:03:21.910> won't<00:03:22.000> have<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.420> old<00:03:22.540> bearing<00:03:23.790> so<00:03:24.790> you

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
you won't have the old bearing so you

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.520 
you won't have the old bearing so you
don't<00:03:25.390> just<00:03:25.600> use<00:03:25.750> something<00:03:26.049> about<00:03:26.320> the<00:03:26.410> right

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
don't just use something about the right

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.560 
don't just use something about the right
diameter<00:03:26.799> and<00:03:27.220> when<00:03:28.000> you<00:03:28.090> do<00:03:28.180> pressing<00:03:28.510> the

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
diameter and when you do pressing the

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.820 
diameter and when you do pressing the
new<00:03:28.690> one<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:28.959> do<00:03:29.140> when<00:03:29.320> I<00:03:29.350> remember<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:29.709> want

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
new one you do when I remember you want

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.380 
new one you do when I remember you want
to<00:03:29.890> keep<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.280> old<00:03:30.400> bearing<00:03:30.760> around<00:03:31.060> so<00:03:31.360> that

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
to keep the old bearing around so that

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.240 
to keep the old bearing around so that
you<00:03:31.540> can<00:03:31.690> press<00:03:32.049> that<00:03:32.080> use<00:03:32.680> that<00:03:32.860> precedent

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
you can press that use that precedent

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.560 
you can press that use that precedent
but<00:03:33.549> hopefully<00:03:33.910> you'll<00:03:34.060> get<00:03:34.180> to<00:03:34.269> see<00:03:34.420> that

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
but hopefully you'll get to see that

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.519 
but hopefully you'll get to see that
later<00:03:35.370> all<00:03:36.370> right
