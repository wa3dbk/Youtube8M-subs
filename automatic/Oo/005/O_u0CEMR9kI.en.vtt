 agroscience presents agro saints harvest 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:13.190
 greater profits look how nice of 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:17.359
 You will see chiles field how beautiful 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:19.009
 very vigorous plants an agent 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.989
 chilli producer that you are seeing 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:24.259
 right now he realizes what we are 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:26.569
 saying that we put him here that such 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.210
 good morning before anything is good 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:33.079
 here what it takes is brings a base of 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.690
 puig with ro factor and humic acids and 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.640
 also this one we have applied some 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:42.350
 maintenance foliar applications 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:46.190
 which it is basically what this nitro sun 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.640
 Wheat is the 18 August 30 also this 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.620
 ever ex and his adherent and this one then good 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.020
 as you can see that we have 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.270
 applied you are foliated for what 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.820
 it's basically a vegetative development 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.530
 and the truth is I remember you too 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.530
 we made some applications of 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.569
 future also for this kill spores or 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.970
 pathogens so the plant also 

00:01:05.569 --> 00:01:10.580
 go so healthy so pretty so complete 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.460
 how many days will you have of sowing this 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.280
 plant this plant like 30 days three 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.990
 weeks or so you see is the truth 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.240
 very pretty and in general very young 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.760
 all in size so it's very healthy 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.680
 very couple and that also from lozanne to 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.110
 sebas is very much based what is something 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.230
 factor as I repeat you we did a 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.520
 foliar application of half a liter per 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.770
 what is per hectare that are two 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.020
 hectares we are here in the field of 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.690
 Carlos Vergara is the producer no more 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.790
 that same and could not accompany us 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.880
 but it's very interesting what you are 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.970
 commenting in money how much it cost him 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.619
 that put you here per hectare really 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.680
 very very cheap for example the application 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.470
 foliar of what was the nitro sun on 18 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.600
 30 08 nourish from everest that 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.540
 basically we put three of ever ex 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.600
 this what is being a kilo of 1830 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.390
 08 and 1 liter sun with its adherent were 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.239
 but more it placed it as 3 100 70 pesos 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.099
 per hectare 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.440
 370 pesos cheap exactly very cheap 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:18.260
 3 100 70 pesos per hectare and with this 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.209
 result, we are seeing that the 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:23.120
 plant went very well as you are given 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.610
 account let's see at the end of all the 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.880
 process your results but here the 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:32.060
 start the truth what a beautiful field is 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.340
 parejito and in addition to the color this green 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.040
 that we have insisted this green 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.739
 agroscience that really is very noticeable 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.120
 that color that plants have when 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.700
 apply those of gross before you have a 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.650
 different color a more intense green ok 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.480
 that's because of good foundation to good 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.870
 nutrition and it means that the plant 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.150
 is working very well and then this 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.590
 is the result the truth then you 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.450
 I appreciate very much, it gives me great pleasure 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.500
 greet the ocs and grace we are for 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.829
 serve them to gross saint harvest older 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.829
 earnings 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.900
