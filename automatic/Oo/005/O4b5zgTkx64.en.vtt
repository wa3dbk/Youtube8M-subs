00:00:01.499 --> 00:00:05.610
 all of them have also been able to withdraw from this short course for a few years 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.840
 persie part 3 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.099
 I mean whole part 3 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:16.779
 r previous time had putter with legs over over the fit of the head 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.890
 and that was on top of various forms around us 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.849
 that we all unsubscribe there for it is all possible in waxaar 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:25.800
 to create 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.949
 so confess from vandals 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.989
 just a little in this third movie for years 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:33.540
 I want to pay some attention to it 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.620
 open houses day looking around for a league sandwich learning something 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.620
 from Serbia to the day of the media took shape 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.230
 what I also do something about that 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.370
 hardly anything 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.499
 make orchestrations maybe we already have tickets there 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.300
 especially from her clip 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.750
 I the reason that it omits each other a little to the name idea 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.720
 but that's pretty much the conditions of the club, I thought 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.290
 rademaker from dexia clipmaker easily win the way it did in the previous lot 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.250
 countries have shortly said that we determined after a pile of form 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.890
 the position of the eyes 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.690
 7 have animals in this case 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.870
 I flew today we will rarely stop so that 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.520
 so that everyone can get used to it 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.520
 large round eyes this case tipped a very large one 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.500
 and then smaller ones 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.500
 they have a pupil 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.630
 of course hot ticken.nl runs out and on different places 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.450
 their cart 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.610
 we both have the ability to come in view characters yellow 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.000
 what a stupid thing 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.190
 so one upwards 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.620
 do you know a whole lot 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.580
 that still has weird red 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.590
 we can of course also use the adolescent butter 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.449
 that's it entirely because 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:15.449
 with the other traffic in the building 

00:02:15.999 --> 00:02:19.759
 Well let me say try experimenting a bit 

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:22.379
 and I look forward to being able to do everything with paper 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.899
 can of course send the viewer current on all sides 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:30.319
 suppose that they are carjacking with the capel players and to the left 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.569
 then you are automatically inclined to look up at the object next to it 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.359
 looking at concrete steel 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.709
 so in an arena you can do a little more elaborate drawing cork a bit 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:42.909
 play 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.279
 especially to watch 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:48.279
 choose a big nose for this in this case 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.900
 we a well I think this can be a nice snack with the 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.900
 name with a big mustache 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:03.139
 9 to read 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:05.659
 that the from that the aclu 

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.009
 schuttevaer 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:11.079
 anyway draw paper and shape it still has one of it 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:12.899
 fund cigar or something 

00:03:12.899 --> 00:03:16.329
 then do yes we do immediately think then man man man man man stop 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.659
 or male with some big mustache 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:22.659
 that because the bank read a little newspaper 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.319
 why don't I have very big ears 

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:34.009
 how difficult because too 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:59.079
 well the nice thing is the van dyck groninger i through the curve we can get them 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:02.969
 just that way a little to the right for him to watch 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:05.969
 left and for us 

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:09.899
 stabbing cooking format movement v 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.569
 through the net it looks like she's more left and right 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:19.469
 to the right before the end of May already for us 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.919
 make good to nac the gentleman can 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.710
 with that, last week is a little bit on the side of the height 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.229
 well behind big eyes we can do nothing 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.929
 so I think we are ready to fill in the multiple with a marker 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.240
 start with the eyes again this time 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.210
 cycling 

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:04.409
 a big nose 

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:07.409
 with a mustache underneath 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.659
 think this is the original netherlands 

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:54.949
 but as you can see we are full of it I have the left eyebrow of the way 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:58.439
 I have land in the sky as Sweden became that is the fun of the bobbin of course 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:00.889
 they are not real 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:05.409
 and that is just as well as on yes as you never put that on that road 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:06.620
 encounter this way 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.830
 of course they look like sincere people 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.180
 but that is of course all that is simply a complete freedom for you 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.849
 to do what you want 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:17.849
 you are the language not bound countries laws of nature 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.930
 I would say playable too, just enjoy them a bit 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.460
 the movement fights on the side of the head 

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:04.289
 but what I also did not show fame time last week is that it says so 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:07.829
 But after you do the tuk tuk tuk on a drawing with a pen with an ever 

00:07:07.829 --> 00:07:09.180
 stronger colored 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:12.180
 all polder land will be wiped out after a beautiful 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:23.550
 soest 

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:28.039
 by this beautiful the pain or the star opposite as well 

00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:31.589
 6 

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:36.119
 anyway i was the lack of the riders part 3 

00:07:37.149 --> 00:07:40.299
 I look forward to seeing you again next week and next week
