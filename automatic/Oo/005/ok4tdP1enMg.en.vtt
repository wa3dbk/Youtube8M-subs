00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.459 
idiot but you can look at the title for
all<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:32.759> relatively<00:00:33.360> easy<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.350> obtain

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
all that relatively easy to obtain

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.620 
all that relatively easy to obtain
information<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.460> he<00:00:35.670> leaves<00:00:36.149> with<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.390> glist

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
information so he leaves with a glist

ice<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.300> Rotom<00:00:39.660> heat<00:00:39.809> form<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.200> I'm<00:00:40.260> just

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
ice on this Rotom heat form so I'm just

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.200 
ice on this Rotom heat form so I'm just
gonna<00:00:40.469> go<00:00:40.770> for<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:41.040> straight<00:00:41.250> off<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.399> bat<00:00:41.610> yes

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
gonna go for it straight off the bat yes

gonna go for it straight off the bat yes
I<00:00:42.239> switches<00:00:42.600> into<00:00:42.750> latios<00:00:43.290> I'm<00:00:43.530> not<00:00:43.680> quite

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
I switches into latios I'm not quite

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.180 
I switches into latios I'm not quite
sure<00:00:43.890> why<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.690> guess<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:46.020> he<00:00:46.230> expected<00:00:46.950> maybe

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
sure why I guess that he expected maybe

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.100 
sure why I guess that he expected maybe
a<00:00:47.370> willow<00:00:47.730> or<00:00:47.879> something<00:00:48.539> I'm<00:00:48.750> not<00:00:48.899> really

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
a willow or something I'm not really

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.779 
a willow or something I'm not really
sure<00:00:49.230> even<00:00:49.950> if<00:00:50.039> he<00:00:50.129> did<00:00:50.399> he<00:00:50.579> could<00:00:50.700> have

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
sure even if he did he could have

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.430 
sure even if he did he could have
predicted<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.480> Gliscor<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.199> doesn't

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
predicted with Gliscor so it doesn't

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.100 
predicted with Gliscor so it doesn't
make<00:00:52.530> much<00:00:52.710> sense<00:00:52.770> but<00:00:53.280> I'm<00:00:53.879> just<00:00:54.000> gonna<00:00:54.120> go<00:00:54.239> to

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
make much sense but I'm just gonna go to

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.619 
make much sense but I'm just gonna go to
jellicent<00:00:55.590> now<00:00:55.710> predicting<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.309> surf<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.820> it

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
jellicent now predicting the surf and it

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.360 
jellicent now predicting the surf and it
does<00:00:57.870> happen<00:00:58.260> nicely<00:00:58.800> I'm<00:00:58.920> thinking<00:00:59.250> he's

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
does happen nicely I'm thinking he's

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.160 
does happen nicely I'm thinking he's
probably<00:00:59.640> choice<00:01:00.030> which<00:01:00.719> is<00:01:00.809> why<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> decided

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
probably choice which is why I decided

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.229 
probably choice which is why I decided
to<00:01:01.410> stay<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.680> here<00:01:02.100> think<00:01:02.370> he's<00:01:02.640> gonna<00:01:02.850> switch

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
to stay in here think he's gonna switch

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.119 
to stay in here think he's gonna switch
out<00:01:03.480> go<00:01:04.199> into<00:01:04.379> something<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.860> will<00:01:04.979> be

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
out go into something that will be

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.340 
out go into something that will be
susceptible<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.880> white<00:01:06.030> water<00:01:06.270> spout<00:01:06.720> however

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
susceptible to white water spout however

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.740 
susceptible to white water spout however
he<00:01:07.799> he<00:01:08.340> bluffed<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.729> choice<00:01:08.939> item<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:09.510> mean

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
he he bluffed the choice item I mean

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.899 
he he bluffed the choice item I mean
relatively<00:01:10.170> well<00:01:10.439> he<00:01:11.040> makes<00:01:11.189> me<00:01:11.310> think<00:01:11.549> he<00:01:11.700> has

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
relatively well he makes me think he has

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.929 
relatively well he makes me think he has
one<00:01:12.150> anyway<00:01:12.510> and<00:01:12.780> he<00:01:13.439> has<00:01:14.010> expert<00:01:14.430> belt<00:01:14.640> with

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
one anyway and he has expert belt with

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.030 
one anyway and he has expert belt with
thunderbolt<00:01:15.509> which<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.990> terrible<00:01:16.259> because<00:01:16.680> he

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
thunderbolt which is terrible because he

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.490 
thunderbolt which is terrible because he
dint<00:01:17.340> me<00:01:17.670> heavily<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.689> water<00:01:18.930> spout<00:01:19.290> does

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
dint me heavily and water spout does

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.710 
dint me heavily and water spout does
absolutely<00:01:19.830> nothing<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.640> about<00:01:20.759> latios<00:01:21.240> not

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
absolutely nothing to about latios not

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.359 
absolutely nothing to about latios not
good<00:01:21.930> at<00:01:22.020> all<00:01:22.170> so<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.560> would<00:01:22.890> have<00:01:22.979> predict<00:01:23.280> him

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
good at all so I would have predict him

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.550 
good at all so I would have predict him
to<00:01:23.490> tee<00:01:23.640> ball<00:01:23.820> again<00:01:24.180> going<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.049> my<00:01:25.170> Tusken

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
to tee ball again going to my Tusken

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.530 
to tee ball again going to my Tusken
Raider<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:25.950> he<00:01:26.220> actually<00:01:26.460> psychic<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.420> he's

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
Raider and he actually psychic so he's

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.149 
Raider and he actually psychic so he's
making<00:01:27.869> all<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.170> good<00:01:28.350> plays<00:01:28.619> at<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.860> start

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
making all the good plays at the start

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.249 
making all the good plays at the start
of<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> game<00:01:29.460> here<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:29.880> making<00:01:30.720> me<00:01:30.990> look<00:01:31.020> like

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
of the game here and making me look like

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.710 
of the game here and making me look like
a<00:01:31.920> bit<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.340> an<00:01:32.490> idiot<00:01:32.610> just<00:01:33.180> switching<00:01:33.600> into

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
a bit of an idiot just switching into

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.359 
a bit of an idiot just switching into
these<00:01:33.900> moves<00:01:34.200> here<00:01:34.439> which<00:01:34.890> are<00:01:35.040> relatively

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
these moves here which are relatively

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.490 
these moves here which are relatively
obvious<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.180> easy<00:01:36.270> for<00:01:36.570> him<00:01:36.659> to<00:01:36.900> predict<00:01:37.259> so

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
obvious and easy for him to predict so

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.980 
obvious and easy for him to predict so
I'm<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.220> bit<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.549> back<00:01:38.759> foot<00:01:39.090> but<00:01:39.420> hopefully

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
I'm a bit of a back foot but hopefully

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.530 
I'm a bit of a back foot but hopefully
as<00:01:40.170> long<00:01:40.320> as<00:01:40.439> I<00:01:40.500> can<00:01:40.670> you<00:01:41.670> know<00:01:41.759> kill<00:01:42.090> something

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
as long as I can you know kill something

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.120 
as long as I can you know kill something
or<00:01:42.720> get<00:01:43.079> some<00:01:43.229> momentum<00:01:43.350> going<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:44.009> there

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
or get some momentum going and there

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.380 
or get some momentum going and there
should<00:01:44.250> be<00:01:44.340> alright<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:44.759> i<00:01:44.790> go<00:01:45.060> for<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.240> ice

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
should be alright so i go for the ice

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.210 
should be alright so i go for the ice
shard<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.350> don't<00:01:46.409> really<00:01:46.829> want<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:46.979> over

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
shard just I don't really want to over

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.069 
shard just I don't really want to over
predict<00:01:47.520> at<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.759> point<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.210> don't<00:01:48.479> feel<00:01:48.869> like

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
predict at this point I don't feel like

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.569 
predict at this point I don't feel like
I'm<00:01:49.229> in<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.380> position<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.829> do<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.399> just

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
I'm in a position to do so and I just

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.539 
I'm in a position to do so and I just
want<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:50.970> Latino<00:01:51.450> dead<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.020> go<00:01:52.229> for<00:01:52.470> it

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
want that Latino dead so go for it

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.819 
want that Latino dead so go for it
incomes<00:01:53.549> Rotom<00:01:53.939> wash<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.390> see<00:01:54.540> as<00:01:54.720> lefties<00:01:55.290> so

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
incomes Rotom wash I see as lefties so

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.800 
incomes Rotom wash I see as lefties so
I'm<00:01:56.159> thinking<00:01:56.189> he's<00:01:56.759> probably<00:01:57.329> gonna<00:01:57.630> be

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
I'm thinking he's probably gonna be

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.010 
I'm thinking he's probably gonna be
defensive<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.670> predict<00:01:59.670> him<00:01:59.909> to<00:02:00.149> go<00:02:00.420> for<00:02:00.780> like

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
defensive I predict him to go for like

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.230 
defensive I predict him to go for like
the<00:02:01.229> willow<00:02:01.439> or<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.070> hidden<00:02:02.310> power<00:02:02.520> either

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
the willow or the hidden power either

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.300 
the willow or the hidden power either
one<00:02:03.659> jellicent<00:02:04.200> can<00:02:04.380> take<00:02:04.590> like<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:05.009> really

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
one jellicent can take like I really

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.550 
one jellicent can take like I really
don't<00:02:05.490> mind<00:02:05.549> taking<00:02:05.880> either<00:02:06.240> one<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:07.439> was

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
don't mind taking either one and I was

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.719 
don't mind taking either one and I was
pretty<00:02:07.710> sure<00:02:07.890> he<00:02:08.069> wasn't<00:02:08.280> going<00:02:08.520> to

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
pretty sure he wasn't going to

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.369 
pretty sure he wasn't going to
switch<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.330> I'm<00:02:09.599> pretty<00:02:09.780> sure<00:02:10.019> that<00:02:10.170> if<00:02:10.259> you

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
switch and I'm pretty sure that if you

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.449 
switch and I'm pretty sure that if you
went<00:02:10.530> for<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.679> hydro<00:02:10.950> pump<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.250> would<00:02:11.370> be

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
went for the hydro pump that would be

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.890 
went for the hydro pump that would be
great<00:02:11.670> cuz<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:11.879> could<00:02:12.000> heal<00:02:12.209> myself<00:02:12.390> with<00:02:12.659> water

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
great cuz I could heal myself with water

all the willow wisp again both of which
i<00:02:25.530> can<00:02:25.680> take<00:02:25.830> very<00:02:26.099> nicely<00:02:26.340> especially<00:02:26.549> seeing

i can take very nicely especially seeing

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.820 
i can take very nicely especially seeing
as<00:02:27.150> I've<00:02:27.269> pumped<00:02:27.629> max<00:02:27.900> special<00:02:28.290> defense<00:02:28.530> into

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
as I've pumped max special defense into

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.970 
as I've pumped max special defense into
this<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.549> variant<00:02:30.120> of<00:02:30.269> Rotom<00:02:30.629> so<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.170> do<00:02:31.680> take

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
this this variant of Rotom so I do take

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.949 
this this variant of Rotom so I do take
the<00:02:32.099> vaults<00:02:32.310> which<00:02:32.459> beautifully<00:02:33.120> he<00:02:33.450> comes<00:02:33.690> in

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
the vaults which beautifully he comes in

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.289 
the vaults which beautifully he comes in
with<00:02:33.989> Infernape<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.579> be<00:02:35.700> honest<00:02:36.090> I<00:02:36.269> really

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
with Infernape and to be honest I really

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.369 
with Infernape and to be honest I really
don't<00:02:36.930> have<00:02:37.349> anything<00:02:38.150> that's<00:02:39.150> wants<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:40.140> take

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
don't have anything that's wants to take

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.680 
don't have anything that's wants to take
a<00:02:40.620> stone<00:02:40.860> edge<00:02:41.069> so<00:02:41.579> my<00:02:41.700> best<00:02:41.910> bet<00:02:42.030> is<00:02:42.329> to<00:02:42.360> go

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
a stone edge so my best bet is to go

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.050 
a stone edge so my best bet is to go
into<00:02:42.840> jellison<00:02:43.470> as<00:02:43.620> death<00:02:44.129> fodder<00:02:44.430> kind<00:02:44.970> of

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
into jellison as death fodder kind of

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.119 
into jellison as death fodder kind of
scout<00:02:45.329> whether<00:02:45.660> he's<00:02:45.930> banded<00:02:46.530> or<00:02:46.769> perhaps

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
scout whether he's banded or perhaps

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.160 
scout whether he's banded or perhaps
life<00:02:47.730> formed<00:02:48.180> I'm<00:02:48.359> not<00:02:48.569> quite<00:02:48.750> sure<00:02:48.780> at<00:02:49.079> this

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
life formed I'm not quite sure at this

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.500 
life formed I'm not quite sure at this
point<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:49.950> I<00:02:49.980> just<00:02:50.430> kind<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:50.730> like<00:02:50.879> to<00:02:51.000> see<00:02:51.239> and

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
point so I just kind of like to see and

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.119 
point so I just kind of like to see and
gelatin<00:02:51.780> really<00:02:52.200> didn't<00:02:52.470> serve<00:02:52.709> much<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:52.980> a

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
gelatin really didn't serve much of a

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.190 
gelatin really didn't serve much of a
purpose<00:02:53.519> at<00:02:53.640> that<00:02:53.819> stage<00:02:54.480> in<00:02:54.629> the<00:02:54.690> game<00:02:54.720> anyway

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
purpose at that stage in the game anyway

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.170 
purpose at that stage in the game anyway
so<00:02:55.260> it<00:02:55.950> turns<00:02:56.190> out<00:02:56.310> he's<00:02:56.489> life<00:02:56.670> orb<00:02:56.910> which<00:02:57.060> is

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
so it turns out he's life orb which is

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.539 
so it turns out he's life orb which is
fantastic<00:02:57.590> I'm<00:02:58.590> gonna<00:02:58.739> go<00:02:58.890> into<00:03:00.440> teriyaki

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
fantastic I'm gonna go into teriyaki

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.819 
fantastic I'm gonna go into teriyaki
terrakion<00:03:02.549> and<00:03:02.940> I'm<00:03:03.569> going<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:04.049> bluff<00:03:04.799> that

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
I'm scarfed and because of that I'm

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.650 
I'm scarfed and because of that I'm
going<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.349> predict<00:03:07.829> him<00:03:08.099> to<00:03:08.310> switch<00:03:08.660> knowing

that he will probably not want to stay

that he will probably not want to stay
in<00:03:11.579> to<00:03:11.849> take<00:03:11.940> an<00:03:12.120> earthquake<00:03:12.629> and<00:03:12.870> we<00:03:13.019> predict

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
in to take an earthquake and we predict

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.289 
in to take an earthquake and we predict
him<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.650> go<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:13.799> gliscor<00:03:14.489> predicting<00:03:15.180> my

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
him to go to gliscor predicting my

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:16.759 
him to go to gliscor predicting my
earthquake<00:03:15.900> and<00:03:16.109> therefore<00:03:16.440> guard<00:03:16.620> to

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
earthquake and therefore guard to

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.009 
earthquake and therefore guard to
Mamoswine<00:03:17.370> which<00:03:17.790> puts<00:03:18.000> me<00:03:18.150> in<00:03:18.299> a<00:03:18.359> really<00:03:18.389> nice

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
Mamoswine which puts me in a really nice

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.349 
Mamoswine which puts me in a really nice
position<00:03:19.290> here<00:03:19.709> because<00:03:20.190> I'm<00:03:20.370> not<00:03:20.819> only<00:03:21.150> have

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
position here because I'm not only have

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.240 
position here because I'm not only have
I<00:03:21.480> gone<00:03:22.019> for<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.290> over<00:03:22.530> prediction<00:03:23.010> but<00:03:23.130> I've

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
I gone for the over prediction but I've

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.270 
I gone for the over prediction but I've
also<00:03:23.669> put<00:03:24.000> him<00:03:24.209> into<00:03:24.389> a<00:03:24.810> mindset<00:03:25.500> that<00:03:25.680> I<00:03:25.950> will

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
also put him into a mindset that I will

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.520 
also put him into a mindset that I will
probably<00:03:26.579> over<00:03:27.150> predict<00:03:27.480> again<00:03:27.810> which<00:03:28.349> is

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
probably over predict again which is

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.740 
probably over predict again which is
probably<00:03:28.859> why<00:03:29.310> he<00:03:29.519> leaves<00:03:29.760> gliscor<00:03:30.299> in<00:03:30.480> here

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
probably why he leaves gliscor in here

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.229 
probably why he leaves gliscor in here
so<00:03:31.139> by<00:03:31.319> applying<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:32.069> pressure<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:32.790> doing<00:03:33.090> a

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
so by applying that pressure and doing a

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.330 
so by applying that pressure and doing a
relatively<00:03:33.750> aggressive<00:03:34.380> play<00:03:34.680> bringing

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
relatively aggressive play bringing

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.789 
relatively aggressive play bringing
Mamoswine<00:03:35.880> in<00:03:36.030> there<00:03:36.239> it<00:03:37.049> kind<00:03:37.290> of<00:03:37.319> allows<00:03:37.560> me

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
Mamoswine in there it kind of allows me

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.050 
Mamoswine in there it kind of allows me
a<00:03:37.829> footing<00:03:38.220> to<00:03:38.340> just<00:03:38.519> go<00:03:38.669> for<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.910> obvious

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
a footing to just go for the obvious

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.379 
a footing to just go for the obvious
move<00:03:39.450> kill<00:03:39.959> him<00:03:40.079> with<00:03:40.169> icicle<00:03:40.560> crash<00:03:40.769> and

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
move kill him with icicle crash and

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.879 
move kill him with icicle crash and
really<00:03:42.389> just<00:03:42.569> saved<00:03:42.870> me<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.079> lot<00:03:43.169> of<00:03:43.319> trouble<00:03:43.739> by

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
really just saved me a lot of trouble by

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.140 
really just saved me a lot of trouble by
getting<00:03:43.919> rid<00:03:44.220> of<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.459> gliscor<00:03:44.880> that<00:03:45.000> thing

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
getting rid of that gliscor that thing

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.210 
getting rid of that gliscor that thing
was<00:03:45.269> a<00:03:45.299> huge<00:03:45.599> pain<00:03:45.780> in<00:03:45.810> my<00:03:45.930> ass<00:03:46.079> so<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.590> it

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
was a huge pain in my ass so and it

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.920 
was a huge pain in my ass so and it
shows<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.639> you<00:03:47.760> know<00:03:47.880> going<00:03:48.299> for<00:03:48.510> that<00:03:48.599> kind

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
shows that you know going for that kind

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.420 
shows that you know going for that kind
of<00:03:48.959> play<00:03:49.169> style<00:03:49.470> can<00:03:49.650> help<00:03:49.829> you<00:03:49.980> out<00:03:50.069> a<00:03:50.099> lot<00:03:50.340> of

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
of play style can help you out a lot of

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.400 
of play style can help you out a lot of
the<00:03:50.489> time<00:03:50.669> if<00:03:50.940> you're<00:03:51.389> just<00:03:51.660> aggressive<00:03:52.109> with

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:52.410 
the time if you're just aggressive with

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.830 
the time if you're just aggressive with
it<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.709> just<00:03:52.799> go<00:03:53.099> for<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:53.340> so<00:03:53.639> I'm<00:03:54.389> gonna<00:03:54.629> bring

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
it and just go for it so I'm gonna bring

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.080 
it and just go for it so I'm gonna bring
in<00:03:55.019> a<00:03:55.049> Rotom<00:03:55.440> because<00:03:55.919> he's<00:03:56.250> either<00:03:56.519> gonna<00:03:56.819> go

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
in a Rotom because he's either gonna go

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.940 
in a Rotom because he's either gonna go
for<00:03:57.329> a<00:03:57.389> close<00:03:57.599> combat<00:03:57.900> or<00:03:58.169> a<00:03:58.230> stone<00:03:58.500> edge<00:03:58.709> I

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
for a close combat or a stone edge I

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.339 
for a close combat or a stone edge I
really<00:03:59.879> have<00:04:00.060> nothing<00:04:00.419> on<00:04:00.750> my<00:04:00.930> team<00:04:01.139> which

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
really have nothing on my team which

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:03.409 
really have nothing on my team which
wants<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.709> take<00:04:01.889> any<00:04:02.129> one<00:04:02.370> of<00:04:02.430> those<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:02.970> mean<00:04:03.389> I

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:03.419 
wants to take any one of those I mean I

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:05.180 
wants to take any one of those I mean I
could<00:04:03.690> go<00:04:03.870> to<00:04:03.900> yanmega<00:04:04.379> for<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:04.709> close<00:04:04.919> combat

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
could go to yanmega for the close combat

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.520 
could go to yanmega for the close combat
but<00:04:05.519> stone<00:04:05.760> edge<00:04:05.940> was<00:04:06.120> really<00:04:06.449> more<00:04:06.599> likely<00:04:07.079> it

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
but stone edge was really more likely it

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.949 
but stone edge was really more likely it
hits<00:04:07.799> all<00:04:08.040> my<00:04:08.099> pokes<00:04:08.549> for<00:04:09.150> better<00:04:09.690> coverage

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
hits all my pokes for better coverage

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.809 
hits all my pokes for better coverage
than<00:04:10.169> close<00:04:10.500> combat<00:04:10.769> does<00:04:11.129> so<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.609> was

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
than close combat does so it was

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.220 
than close combat does so it was
probably<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.299> most<00:04:12.449> obvious<00:04:12.629> thing<00:04:12.959> to<00:04:12.989> do

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
probably the most obvious thing to do

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.099 
probably the most obvious thing to do
but<00:04:13.709> I'm<00:04:14.129> going<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:14.549> Haxorus<00:04:15.150> thinking<00:04:15.930> he's

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
but I'm going to Haxorus thinking he's

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.470 
but I'm going to Haxorus thinking he's
most<00:04:16.380> likely<00:04:16.470> scarf

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
most likely scarf

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.870 
most likely scarf
and<00:04:17.570> he<00:04:18.410> probably<00:04:18.830> is<00:04:19.190> because<00:04:19.490> that<00:04:19.520> stone

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
and he probably is because that stone

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.340 
and he probably is because that stone
edge<00:04:20.030> probably<00:04:20.510> would<00:04:20.600> have<00:04:20.660> killed<00:04:20.900> me<00:04:21.110> if<00:04:21.140> he

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
edge probably would have killed me if he

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.710 
edge probably would have killed me if he
was<00:04:21.440> a<00:04:21.470> banded<00:04:21.920> one<00:04:22.100> but<00:04:22.640> I'm<00:04:23.060> gonna<00:04:23.210> go<00:04:23.420> for

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
was a banded one but I'm gonna go for

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.300 
was a banded one but I'm gonna go for
the<00:04:23.810> earthquake<00:04:24.470> I'm<00:04:24.620> gonna<00:04:24.770> take<00:04:25.010> the<00:04:25.130> thing

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
the earthquake I'm gonna take the thing

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.400 
the earthquake I'm gonna take the thing
out<00:04:25.540> really<00:04:26.540> no<00:04:26.660> problem<00:04:26.930> when<00:04:27.170> you<00:04:27.260> have<00:04:27.380> a

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
out really no problem when you have a

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.890 
out really no problem when you have a
choice<00:04:27.650> ban<00:04:27.920> on<00:04:28.100> Haxorus<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:28.790> he<00:04:29.630> probably

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
choice ban on Haxorus and he probably

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.380 
choice ban on Haxorus and he probably
thinks<00:04:30.140> I<00:04:30.350> am<00:04:30.500> choice<00:04:30.770> banded<00:04:31.040> but<00:04:31.760> what<00:04:32.210> he

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
thinks I am choice banded but what he

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.150 
thinks I am choice banded but what he
forgets<00:04:32.840> here<00:04:33.140> is<00:04:33.290> something<00:04:33.620> that<00:04:33.740> a<00:04:33.800> lot<00:04:33.860> of

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
forgets here is something that a lot of

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.250 
forgets here is something that a lot of
people<00:04:34.310> tend<00:04:34.880> to<00:04:34.970> forget<00:04:35.060> is<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.930> fact<00:04:36.170> that

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
people tend to forget is the fact that

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.160 
people tend to forget is the fact that
Haxorus<00:04:36.920> has<00:04:37.130> mold<00:04:37.580> breaker<00:04:37.850> which<00:04:38.660> is<00:04:38.960> going

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
Haxorus has mold breaker which is going

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.260 
Haxorus has mold breaker which is going
to<00:04:39.230> play<00:04:39.500> a<00:04:39.530> real<00:04:40.130> massive<00:04:40.640> role<00:04:40.850> here<00:04:41.090> because

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
to play a real massive role here because

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.030 
to play a real massive role here because
he<00:04:41.360> brings<00:04:41.630> and<00:04:41.780> wrote<00:04:41.990> I'm<00:04:42.170> expecting<00:04:42.770> me<00:04:42.890> to

he brings and wrote I'm expecting me to

have to switch out because he has

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.990 
have to switch out because he has

levitate but of course mold breaker is

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.950 
levitate but of course mold breaker is

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
going to break right through that

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.650 
going to break right through that

levitate kill the Rotom with choice ban
an<00:04:50.780> earthquake<00:04:51.200> and<00:04:51.440> that<00:04:51.620> is<00:04:51.800> but<00:04:52.100> I<00:04:52.250> love

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
an earthquake and that is but I love

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.580 
an earthquake and that is but I love
when<00:04:52.880> people<00:04:53.270> forget<00:04:53.540> about<00:04:53.660> it<00:04:53.930> because<00:04:54.440> it

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
when people forget about it because it

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.610 
when people forget about it because it
really<00:04:54.860> is<00:04:55.280> such<00:04:55.700> a<00:04:55.730> potent<00:04:56.270> thing<00:04:56.450> and<00:04:56.660> it

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
really is such a potent thing and it

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.140 
really is such a potent thing and it
really<00:04:57.860> cripples<00:04:58.160> people<00:04:58.730> if<00:04:58.850> they<00:04:58.940> don't

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
really cripples people if they don't

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.300 
really cripples people if they don't
think<00:04:59.360> you<00:04:59.660> know<00:04:59.810> hey<00:05:00.080> this<00:05:00.260> thing<00:05:00.560> has<00:05:00.770> mold

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
think you know hey this thing has mold

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.850 
think you know hey this thing has mold
breaker<00:05:01.400> and<00:05:01.820> they<00:05:02.240> get<00:05:02.420> screwed<00:05:02.720> so<00:05:02.990> in<00:05:03.710> comes

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
breaker and they get screwed so in comes

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.190 
breaker and they get screwed so in comes
in<00:05:04.040> friday<00:05:04.250> at<00:05:04.760> this<00:05:04.910> point<00:05:05.180> yanmega<00:05:05.900> is

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
in friday at this point yanmega is

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.020 
in friday at this point yanmega is
probably<00:05:06.530> the<00:05:06.650> weakest<00:05:07.070> link<00:05:07.280> on<00:05:07.400> my<00:05:07.520> team<00:05:07.790> I

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:08.030 
probably the weakest link on my team I

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.000 
probably the weakest link on my team I
know<00:05:08.300> he's<00:05:08.720> gonna<00:05:08.840> stone<00:05:09.200> edge<00:05:09.410> it<00:05:09.680> has<00:05:09.830> the

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.010 
know he's gonna stone edge it has the

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.710 
know he's gonna stone edge it has the
best<00:05:10.160> coverage<00:05:10.490> on<00:05:10.820> all<00:05:10.970> my<00:05:11.120> guys<00:05:11.360> and<00:05:11.660> I

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
best coverage on all my guys and I

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.530 
best coverage on all my guys and I
really<00:05:12.200> have<00:05:12.350> nothing<00:05:12.590> else<00:05:13.070> to<00:05:13.340> go<00:05:13.550> to<00:05:13.580> so<00:05:14.300> I'm

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
really have nothing else to go to so I'm

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.590 
really have nothing else to go to so I'm
gonna<00:05:14.660> go<00:05:14.840> to<00:05:14.900> yanmega<00:05:15.350> and<00:05:15.710> I<00:05:16.340> die

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
gonna go to yanmega and I die

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.490 
gonna go to yanmega and I die
unfortunately<00:05:17.600> but<00:05:17.630> I<00:05:17.900> mean<00:05:18.170> it<00:05:18.350> wasn't

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
unfortunately but I mean it wasn't

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.290 
unfortunately but I mean it wasn't
really<00:05:18.800> too<00:05:19.460> big<00:05:19.610> of<00:05:19.700> a<00:05:19.760> deal<00:05:19.880> because<00:05:20.090> it

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
really too big of a deal because it

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.390 
really too big of a deal because it
allows<00:05:20.510> me<00:05:20.540> now<00:05:20.840> to<00:05:20.900> go<00:05:21.230> into<00:05:21.500> terrakion

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
allows me now to go into terrakion

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.100 
allows me now to go into terrakion
threaten<00:05:23.210> him<00:05:23.360> out<00:05:23.480> with<00:05:23.750> either<00:05:23.930> the

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
threaten him out with either the

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.930 
threaten him out with either the
earthquake<00:05:24.800> on<00:05:24.830> the<00:05:25.010> stone<00:05:25.220> edge<00:05:25.400> I<00:05:25.580> decided

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
earthquake on the stone edge I decided

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.820 
earthquake on the stone edge I decided
to<00:05:26.030> go<00:05:26.120> for<00:05:26.270> stone<00:05:26.540> edge<00:05:26.720> here<00:05:26.990> simply<00:05:27.800> because

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
to go for stone edge here simply because

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.280 
to go for stone edge here simply because
he<00:05:28.100> still<00:05:28.340> has<00:05:28.550> latios<00:05:29.090> left<00:05:29.390> and<00:05:29.660> i<00:05:29.780> did<00:05:29.810> not

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
he still has latios left and i did not

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.710 
he still has latios left and i did not
want<00:05:30.500> him<00:05:30.740> switching<00:05:31.040> latias<00:05:31.550> in<00:05:31.940> on<00:05:32.210> an

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
want him switching latias in on an

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.750 
want him switching latias in on an
earthquake<00:05:33.260> i<00:05:33.440> could<00:05:33.890> have<00:05:33.980> predicted<00:05:34.250> latios

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
earthquake i could have predicted latios

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.640 
earthquake i could have predicted latios
gone<00:05:34.940> for<00:05:35.150> an<00:05:35.210> accessor<00:05:35.720> but<00:05:36.230> then<00:05:36.350> he<00:05:36.440> still

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
gone for an accessor but then he still

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.380 
gone for an accessor but then he still
has<00:05:36.800> ferrothorn<00:05:37.340> and<00:05:37.580> this<00:05:37.670> infinite<00:05:38.000> could

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
has ferrothorn and this infinite could

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.090 
has ferrothorn and this infinite could
have<00:05:38.480> still<00:05:38.630> stayed<00:05:38.930> in<00:05:39.110> so<00:05:39.530> in<00:05:39.650> all<00:05:39.800> three

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
have still stayed in so in all three

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.830 
have still stayed in so in all three
scenarios<00:05:40.430> dependent<00:05:41.210> on<00:05:41.300> whether<00:05:41.510> Hughton

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:41.840 
scenarios dependent on whether Hughton

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.450 
scenarios dependent on whether Hughton
switching<00:05:42.140> ferrothorn<00:05:42.620> latios<00:05:43.130> on<00:05:43.280> leave

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
switching ferrothorn latios on leave

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.490 
switching ferrothorn latios on leave
infernape<00:05:44.030> in<00:05:44.180> stone<00:05:44.870> edge<00:05:45.020> was<00:05:45.170> probably<00:05:45.410> the

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
infernape in stone edge was probably the

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.110 
infernape in stone edge was probably the
safest<00:05:45.680> move<00:05:46.040> out<00:05:46.250> of<00:05:46.400> those<00:05:46.520> three<00:05:46.760> scenarios

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
safest move out of those three scenarios

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.000 
safest move out of those three scenarios
so<00:05:47.540> I<00:05:47.570> go<00:05:47.810> for<00:05:48.020> it<00:05:48.110> it<00:05:48.380> does<00:05:48.650> kill<00:05:48.890> the

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
so I go for it it does kill the

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.460 
so I go for it it does kill the
infernape<00:05:49.460> which<00:05:49.640> is<00:05:49.790> very<00:05:49.970> nice<00:05:50.210> and<00:05:50.420> at<00:05:51.320> this

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:51.470 
infernape which is very nice and at this

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.890 
infernape which is very nice and at this
point<00:05:51.740> I'm<00:05:51.920> thinking<00:05:52.100> I<00:05:52.540> really<00:05:53.540> need<00:05:53.720> to

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
point I'm thinking I really need to

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.870 
point I'm thinking I really need to
rocky<00:05:54.110> on<00:05:54.410> and<00:05:54.650> I<00:05:54.710> need<00:05:54.950> it<00:05:55.100> to<00:05:55.130> use<00:05:55.370> a<00:05:55.400> fighting

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:55.880 
rocky on and I need it to use a fighting

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.850 
rocky on and I need it to use a fighting
move<00:05:56.090> up<00:05:56.330> to<00:05:56.780> kill<00:05:57.020> this<00:05:57.170> ferrothorn<00:05:57.590> with<00:05:57.830> I

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
move up to kill this ferrothorn with I

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.980 
move up to kill this ferrothorn with I
can't<00:05:58.160> stay<00:05:58.430> in<00:05:58.460> and<00:05:58.850> go<00:05:59.360> for<00:05:59.390> a<00:05:59.600> stone<00:05:59.810> edge

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
can't stay in and go for a stone edge

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.480 
can't stay in and go for a stone edge
because<00:06:00.260> it<00:06:00.380> won't<00:06:00.590> kill<00:06:00.830> it<00:06:01.010> and<00:06:01.280> he'll

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
because it won't kill it and he'll

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.160 
because it won't kill it and he'll
probably<00:06:01.670> just<00:06:01.910> kill<00:06:02.300> me<00:06:02.450> off<00:06:02.570> with<00:06:02.780> adorable

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.170 
probably just kill me off with adorable

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:05.380 
probably just kill me off with adorable
so<00:06:03.440> I<00:06:03.620> go<00:06:03.920> to<00:06:03.950> Haxorus<00:06:04.460> is<00:06:04.580> death<00:06:04.790> water<00:06:05.090> there

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
so I go to Haxorus is death water there

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.050 
so I go to Haxorus is death water there
to<00:06:05.870> take<00:06:06.050> the<00:06:06.200> gyroball<00:06:06.530> and<00:06:06.860> now<00:06:07.370> ferrothorn

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:08.060 
to take the gyroball and now ferrothorn

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:10.150 
to take the gyroball and now ferrothorn
should<00:06:08.570> die<00:06:08.870> here<00:06:09.170> from<00:06:09.380> this<00:06:09.560> secret<00:06:09.890> sword

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
should die here from this secret sword

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.920 
should die here from this secret sword
sacred<00:06:10.820> secret<00:06:11.240> I<00:06:11.330> don't<00:06:11.510> even<00:06:11.630> know<00:06:11.810> which

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:11.930 
sacred secret I don't even know which

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.370 
sacred secret I don't even know which
one<00:06:12.110> is<00:06:12.320> sacred<00:06:13.040> probably<00:06:13.910> and<00:06:14.630> it<00:06:14.960> does<00:06:15.140> kill

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
one is sacred probably and it does kill
