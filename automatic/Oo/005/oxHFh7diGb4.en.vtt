00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
really good this is the packaging that

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.830 
really good this is the packaging that
it<00:01:35.560> came<00:01:35.829> in<00:01:36.070> at<00:01:36.340> the<00:01:36.640> regular<00:01:37.329> clear

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
it came in at the regular clear

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:45.870 
it came in at the regular clear
packaging<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:42.759> does<00:01:43.119> on<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:44.259> picture<00:01:45.070> have<00:01:45.429> a

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
packaging it does on the picture have a

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.139 
packaging it does on the picture have a
body<00:01:46.840> wave<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:47.500> it<00:01:47.710> and<00:01:47.920> that's<00:01:48.909> what<00:01:49.030> i

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
body wave to it and that's what i

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.090 
body wave to it and that's what i
thought<00:01:49.210> was<00:01:49.659> throughout<00:01:50.259> the<00:01:50.469> entire<00:01:50.829> way

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
thought was throughout the entire way

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.929 
thought was throughout the entire way
but<00:01:51.460> it's<00:01:51.640> not<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:53.259> gets<00:01:53.469> a<00:01:53.619> you<00:01:54.280> know<00:01:54.399> a<00:01:54.429> ripple

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
but it's not it gets a you know a ripple

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:56.639 
but it's not it gets a you know a ripple
effect<00:01:54.999> up<00:01:55.420> here<00:01:55.689> but<00:01:55.840> as<00:01:55.960> it<00:01:56.140> gets<00:01:56.289> to<00:01:56.530> the

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
effect up here but as it gets to the

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.870 
effect up here but as it gets to the
bottom<00:01:56.799> it<00:01:57.159> gets<00:01:57.490> a<00:01:57.609> little<00:01:57.759> curly<00:01:58.479> um<00:01:59.880> even

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
bottom it gets a little curly um even

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.520 
bottom it gets a little curly um even
though<00:02:01.060> it's<00:02:01.329> not<00:02:01.509> exactly<00:02:02.049> like<00:02:02.320> the<00:02:02.499> picture

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
though it's not exactly like the picture

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.999 
though it's not exactly like the picture
