you about how to troubleshoot your water

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:04.220 
you about how to troubleshoot your water
heater

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
heater

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.140 
heater
now<00:00:04.529> there's<00:00:04.740> two<00:00:04.890> basic<00:00:05.040> types<00:00:05.700> of<00:00:05.910> water

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
now there's two basic types of water

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.750 
now there's two basic types of water
heater<00:00:06.420> they're<00:00:06.600> in<00:00:06.720> use<00:00:06.990> primarily<00:00:07.649> there<00:00:08.580> is

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
heater they're in use primarily there is

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.150 
heater they're in use primarily there is
this<00:00:09.269> type<00:00:09.570> which<00:00:09.780> is<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:09.960> gas<00:00:10.440> water<00:00:10.800> heater

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
this type which is a gas water heater

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.190 
this type which is a gas water heater
and<00:00:11.400> then<00:00:11.670> there's<00:00:11.880> also<00:00:12.090> an<00:00:12.570> electric<00:00:13.019> water

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
and then there's also an electric water

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.900 
and then there's also an electric water
heater<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:14.040> we're<00:00:14.130> going<00:00:14.250> to<00:00:14.340> talk<00:00:14.460> about<00:00:14.490> the

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
heater so we're going to talk about the

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.460 
heater so we're going to talk about the
gas<00:00:15.089> water<00:00:15.389> heater<00:00:15.690> first<00:00:16.220> if<00:00:17.660> your<00:00:18.660> water<00:00:19.140> if

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
gas water heater first if your water if

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.200 
gas water heater first if your water if
you<00:00:19.890> do<00:00:20.010> not<00:00:20.160> have<00:00:20.400> hot<00:00:20.609> water<00:00:20.640> there<00:00:21.090> are<00:00:21.119> some

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
you do not have hot water there are some

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.240 
you do not have hot water there are some
things<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.810> can<00:00:21.990> check<00:00:22.289> just<00:00:22.619> to<00:00:23.010> make

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
things that you can check just to make

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.700 
things that you can check just to make
sure<00:00:23.279> now<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:23.970> first<00:00:24.300> thing<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.810> we<00:00:25.439> want<00:00:25.470> to

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
sure now the first thing is we want to

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.589 
sure now the first thing is we want to
come<00:00:25.830> over<00:00:25.980> here<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.490> there's<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.300> cover

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
come over here and there's this cover

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.540 
come over here and there's this cover
plate<00:00:27.689> right<00:00:28.140> here<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.560> we<00:00:28.650> can<00:00:28.680> remove<00:00:31.550> now

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
plate right here that we can remove now

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.610 
plate right here that we can remove now
most<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.149> water<00:00:33.329> heaters<00:00:33.750> operate<00:00:34.410> off<00:00:34.590> a

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
most of the water heaters operate off a

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.220 
most of the water heaters operate off a
pilot<00:00:35.100> light<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.520> there<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.510> small<00:00:36.989> window

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
pilot light and there is a small window

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.590 
pilot light and there is a small window
once<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.890> remove<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.399> cover<00:00:38.550> plate<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.390> you

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
once you remove the cover plate that you

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.389 
once you remove the cover plate that you
can<00:00:39.809> look<00:00:39.989> down<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.410> here<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.800> what<00:00:41.280> you

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
can look down in here and what you

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.250 
can look down in here and what you
should<00:00:41.579> see<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.120> see<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.510> glow<00:00:42.809> down<00:00:43.079> in

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
should see is you see a glow down in

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.830 
should see is you see a glow down in
there<00:00:43.440> now<00:00:43.829> if<00:00:44.129> you<00:00:44.250> do<00:00:44.399> not<00:00:44.550> see<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.820> glow<00:00:45.210> then

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
there now if you do not see a glow then

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.450 
there now if you do not see a glow then
that<00:00:46.050> means<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.469> your<00:00:46.710> pilot<00:00:47.039> light<00:00:47.070> has

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
that means that your pilot light has

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.590 
that means that your pilot light has
gone<00:00:47.520> out<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:48.660> particular<00:00:48.960> water<00:00:49.350> heater<00:00:49.710> is

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
gone out this particular water heater is

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.760 
gone out this particular water heater is
equipped<00:00:51.600> with<00:00:51.989> an<00:00:52.530> igniter<00:00:53.719> so<00:00:54.719> if<00:00:55.199> that

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
equipped with an igniter so if that

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.439 
equipped with an igniter so if that
happens<00:00:56.280> then<00:00:56.520> what<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.789> want<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.030> do<00:00:57.149> is<00:00:57.300> you

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
happens then what you want to do is you

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.250 
happens then what you want to do is you
want<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.690> rotate<00:00:58.640> your<00:00:59.640> control<00:01:00.480> knob<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:01.079> the

to the pilot position and the knobs are

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.440 
to the pilot position and the knobs are
clearly<00:01:12.560> marked<00:01:13.560> where<00:01:14.189> it<00:01:14.280> has<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.760> pilot<00:01:15.299> and

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
clearly marked where it has a pilot and

will do you depress the red button and
then<00:01:27.900> what<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.229> want<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.439> do<00:01:28.590> is<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.979> want<00:01:29.220> to

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
then what you want to do is you want to

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.840 
then what you want to do is you want to
snap<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.150> igniter<00:01:31.130> until<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.280> can<00:01:32.430> look<00:01:32.640> down

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
snap the igniter until you can look down

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.060 
snap the igniter until you can look down
in<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> inspection<00:01:33.540> window<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.350> see<00:01:34.829> that

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
in the inspection window and see that

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.789 
in the inspection window and see that
glow<00:01:36.799> now<00:01:37.799> once<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.159> happens<00:01:38.960> then<00:01:39.960> we<00:01:40.590> will

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
glow now once that happens then we will

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.969 
glow now once that happens then we will
rotate<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.869> unit<00:01:42.869> back<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.950> position

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
rotate the unit back to the on position

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.880 
rotate the unit back to the on position
and<00:01:44.970> then<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.689> want<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.960> again<00:01:46.200> check<00:01:46.619> and

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
and then you want to again check and

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.920 
and then you want to again check and
make<00:01:47.220> sure<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.399> your<00:01:47.729> pilot<00:01:48.090> light<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.570> on

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
make sure that your pilot light is on

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.910 
make sure that your pilot light is on
down<00:01:49.229> below<00:01:49.520> once<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.640> do<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.920> particularly

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
down below once you do that particularly
