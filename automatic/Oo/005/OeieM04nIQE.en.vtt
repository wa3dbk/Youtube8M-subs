learning from the mistakes that not only

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.730 
learning from the mistakes that not only
he<00:01:54.270> made<00:01:54.450> but<00:01:54.570> maybe<00:01:54.720> many<00:01:55.020> others<00:01:55.320> have<00:01:55.530> made

he made but maybe many others have made

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.920 
he made but maybe many others have made
and<00:01:56.100> by<00:01:56.640> simply<00:01:56.969> just<00:01:57.119> following<00:01:57.479> simple

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
and by simply just following simple

steps by steps we were able to take take

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.499 
steps by steps we were able to take take
a<00:02:01.259> little<00:02:01.439> bit<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.619> money<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.180> just<00:02:03.180> keep<00:02:03.360> on

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
really take independence and take it

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:51.009 
really take independence and take it
from<00:02:50.720> there

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
from there
