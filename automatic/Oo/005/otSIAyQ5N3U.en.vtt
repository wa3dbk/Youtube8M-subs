00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 on the web we talk a lot about how 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.049
 to live from his art but we did not speak 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.210
 a lot of how to start living 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.460
 of his art and I know when I 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.920
 were finishing my degree and I wanted 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.080
 becoming an artist it was a question that 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.080
 obsessed me how to do this 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.330
 transition between being a thing and being 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.650
 artist and every artist that I 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.529
 meeting and I asked them how 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.650
 did you do it and their answers 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:32.460
 disappointed it was things like I 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:37.280
 remember too long ago where it was 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:41.579
 does it effortlessly where 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.140
 I do not know and I told myself 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.270
 moment that I will never be this 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.100
 artist that I will have an answer to this 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.059
 question is so today I'm going 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.250
 share my answer my story for 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.829
 me the transition between being a student 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.370
 so and artist was done in two 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.800
 steps 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.350
 for starters I went home 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.359
 parents so in the united states when one is 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.820
 at the university often we live on the 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.680
 campus I did that and then I 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.130
 back home I went to my parents' home 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.659
 live with my parents and that's not all 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.860
 like in France in the United States 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.409
 did not consider himself 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.820
 professionals or even not normal for 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.340
 a person in his twenties 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.509
 the guest with his parents so this 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.920
 was not something that I 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.560
 pointed out with my clients that 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.000
 I lived with them I'm not ashamed of 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.110
 did I invite with my parents and 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.700
 I really appreciate the fact that my 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.730
 parents did this to me they told me 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.890
 Free 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:40.420
 house I did not have to pay rent 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:42.640
 for a year and a half and that's during this 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:47.110
 time that I was able to find myself 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:53.110
 a little bit to take the first steps in 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:55.240
 the order I could find my voice 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.320
 of artists a little bit and my voice of 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.840
 marketing 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.180
 the business side is also without 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.760
 worry about too much money too high 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.200
 then after a year and a half it was time 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.710
 of mack kit worry me a little bit 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.260
 more because to have a business there 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.480
 must still understand the money a 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.340
 little bit and so that must be made 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.460
 money a little more vital and 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.680
 I think that the bill of the 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:26.560
 rent each month can help a 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:29.170
 person to understand the money and so 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.320
 it was time and I rented a house 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:36.480
 with my brother and a few friends and that's 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:41.560
 like that I did the second step 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:45.370
 in the transition to a career 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.160
 artist and I know that my way of 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.680
 do it so in two steps will not be 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.360
 everyone's way but 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.910
 I hope my story will help 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.370
 someone still that's going to be 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.860
 useful for someone who is in the process of 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.020
 who wants to make the transition between being 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.020
 something and be an artist
