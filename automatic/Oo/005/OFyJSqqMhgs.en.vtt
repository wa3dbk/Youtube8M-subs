00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
be here on campus and I knew that I had

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.400 
be here on campus and I knew that I had
so<00:00:33.760> many<00:00:33.820> opportunities<00:00:33.940> waiting<00:00:34.630> for<00:00:34.960> me<00:00:35.110> so

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.410 
so many opportunities waiting for me so

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.740 
so many opportunities waiting for me so
that<00:00:35.860> was<00:00:36.010> my<00:00:36.040> kind<00:00:36.580> of<00:00:36.700> first<00:00:36.850> reaction<00:00:37.390> when

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
that was my kind of first reaction when

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.540 
that was my kind of first reaction when
I<00:00:37.810> got<00:00:38.020> here<00:00:38.260> there<00:00:38.800> are<00:00:38.920> a<00:00:38.950> lot<00:00:39.100> of<00:00:39.130> tips<00:00:39.370> that

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
I got here there are a lot of tips that

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.220 
I got here there are a lot of tips that
I<00:00:39.640> could<00:00:39.850> give<00:00:40.030> to<00:00:40.270> making<00:00:40.600> the<00:00:40.780> transition

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
I could give to making the transition

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.360 
I could give to making the transition
smoother<00:00:41.980> I<00:00:42.730> think<00:00:43.180> probably<00:00:43.420> first<00:00:44.020> is<00:00:44.380> to

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
smoother I think probably first is to

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.730 
smoother I think probably first is to
really<00:00:45.850> be<00:00:45.970> aware<00:00:46.480> of<00:00:46.540> the<00:00:47.350> classes<00:00:47.710> that

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:47.740

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
you're taking and really maybe do your

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.770 
you're taking and really maybe do your
