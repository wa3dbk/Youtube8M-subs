00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
alright so now coming in number three

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.720 
alright so now coming in number three
you<00:00:41.000> have<00:00:41.180> the<00:00:41.330> modern<00:00:41.690> warfare<00:00:41.870> 3<00:00:42.220> SMG<00:00:43.220> the<00:00:43.400> PM

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
you have the modern warfare 3 SMG the PM

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.420 
you have the modern warfare 3 SMG the PM
9<00:00:43.970> as<00:00:44.270> mentioned<00:00:45.230> in<00:00:45.320> my<00:00:45.350> Uzi<00:00:45.680> gun<00:00:45.980> evolution

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
9 as mentioned in my Uzi gun evolution

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.700 
9 as mentioned in my Uzi gun evolution
the<00:00:46.580> PM<00:00:46.880> 9<00:00:47.090> is<00:00:47.390> based<00:00:47.630> on<00:00:47.810> the<00:00:47.960> mini<00:00:48.140> uzi<00:00:48.320> which

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
the PM 9 is based on the mini uzi which

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.340 
the PM 9 is based on the mini uzi which
explains<00:00:49.460> why<00:00:49.700> it<00:00:49.760> is<00:00:49.940> such<00:00:50.059> a<00:00:50.120> bad<00:00:50.360> gun<00:00:50.629> with

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
explains why it is such a bad gun with

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.290 
explains why it is such a bad gun with
the<00:00:51.470> very<00:00:51.680> good<00:00:51.920> smgs<00:00:52.580> and<00:00:52.760> modern<00:00:52.970> warfare<00:00:53.090> 3

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
the very good smgs and modern warfare 3

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.160 
the very good smgs and modern warfare 3
like<00:00:53.720> the<00:00:53.840> p90<00:00:54.500> and<00:00:54.710> PP<00:00:55.070> 90<00:00:55.460> the<00:00:55.879> PM<00:00:56.300> 9<00:00:56.540> is<00:00:56.900> by

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
like the p90 and PP 90 the PM 9 is by

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.920 
like the p90 and PP 90 the PM 9 is by
far<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:57.559> worst<00:00:57.920> it<00:00:58.520> has<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:59.000> slowest<00:00:59.540> reload

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
far the worst it has the slowest reload

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.990 
far the worst it has the slowest reload
time<00:01:00.140> and<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.680> highest<00:01:00.920> recoil<00:01:01.489> of<00:01:01.670> all<00:01:01.879> the

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
time and the highest recoil of all the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.689 
time and the highest recoil of all the
SMGs<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:03.290> only<00:01:03.590> way<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:03.860> gun<00:01:04.040> can<00:01:04.220> actually

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
SMGs the only way the gun can actually

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.940 
SMGs the only way the gun can actually
be<00:01:04.820> effective<00:01:05.300> is<00:01:05.449> that<00:01:05.660> very<00:01:06.140> close<00:01:06.410> ranges

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
be effective is that very close ranges

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.040 
be effective is that very close ranges
but<00:01:07.460> even<00:01:07.790> then<00:01:07.970> there's<00:01:08.270> better<00:01:08.540> options

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
but even then there's better options

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.440 
but even then there's better options
than<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.350> PM<00:01:09.590> 9<00:01:09.800> now<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.700> PM<00:01:11.000> 9<00:01:11.149> is<00:01:11.330> yet

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
than the PM 9 now the PM 9 is yet

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.120 
than the PM 9 now the PM 9 is yet
another<00:01:11.570> example<00:01:11.899> of<00:01:12.590> an<00:01:12.710> ineffective

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
another example of an ineffective

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.280 
another example of an ineffective
submachine<00:01:13.880> gun<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:14.509> the<00:01:14.600> call<00:01:14.780> duty<00:01:14.990> series

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
submachine gun and the call duty series

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.410 
submachine gun and the call duty series
due<00:01:15.619> to<00:01:15.740> its<00:01:15.890> lack<00:01:16.160> of<00:01:16.369> ability<00:01:16.610> to<00:01:17.000> kill<00:01:17.390> a

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
due to its lack of ability to kill a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.570 
due to its lack of ability to kill a
medium<00:01:17.810> ranges<00:01:18.229> and<00:01:18.440> really<00:01:19.070> if<00:01:19.250> you<00:01:19.340> want<00:01:19.520> to

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
medium ranges and really if you want to

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.490 
medium ranges and really if you want to
be<00:01:19.670> successful<00:01:19.850> with<00:01:20.420> this<00:01:20.540> gun<00:01:20.780> you<00:01:21.200> need<00:01:21.380> to

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
be successful with this gun you need to

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.650 
be successful with this gun you need to
play<00:01:21.619> it<00:01:21.710> as<00:01:21.920> if<00:01:22.070> it's<00:01:22.220> a<00:01:22.310> shotgun<00:01:22.820> and<00:01:23.030> if<00:01:23.570> you

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
play it as if it's a shotgun and if you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.090 
play it as if it's a shotgun and if you
have<00:01:23.780> to<00:01:23.899> play<00:01:24.110> it<00:01:24.229> like<00:01:24.380> that<00:01:24.590> really<00:01:24.890> you

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
have to play it like that really you

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.820 
have to play it like that really you
might<00:01:25.310> as<00:01:25.460> well<00:01:25.520> just<00:01:25.700> use<00:01:26.000> a<00:01:26.030> shotgun<00:01:26.360> anyway

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
might as well just use a shotgun anyway

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.740 
might as well just use a shotgun anyway
so<00:01:27.830> overall<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.700> uncontrollable<00:01:29.540> recoil

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
so overall the uncontrollable recoil

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.719 
so overall the uncontrollable recoil
combined<00:01:30.500> with<00:01:30.649> it<00:01:30.800> being<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:31.130> clear<00:01:31.460> most

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
combined with it being the clear most

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.480 
combined with it being the clear most
useless<00:01:32.210> gun<00:01:32.539> and<00:01:32.810> model<00:01:33.289> record<00:01:33.590> three<00:01:33.890> puts

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
useless gun and model record three puts

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.310 
useless gun and model record three puts
it<00:01:34.610> at<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.820> number<00:01:35.090> three<00:01:35.390> worst<00:01:35.690> gun<00:01:36.020> and

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
it at the number three worst gun and

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.390 
it at the number three worst gun and
call<00:01:36.590> duty<00:01:36.830> history<00:01:41.770> alright<00:01:42.770> so<00:01:42.950> now<00:01:43.070> coming

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
call duty history alright so now coming

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.070 
call duty history alright so now coming
in<00:01:43.490> at<00:01:43.610> number<00:01:43.700> two<00:01:44.060> I<00:01:44.270> am<00:01:44.330> once<00:01:44.900> again

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
in at number two I am once again

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.200 
in at number two I am once again
combining<00:01:45.680> this<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:46.130> do<00:01:46.220> three<00:01:46.580> black<00:01:46.909> ops

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
combining this and do three black ops

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.420 
combining this and do three black ops
funds<00:01:47.510> and<00:01:47.780> in<00:01:48.140> this<00:01:48.320> case<00:01:48.590> it's<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.070> three

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
funds and in this case it's the three

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.460 
funds and in this case it's the three
black<00:01:49.700> ops<00:01:50.000> exclusive<00:01:50.689> submachine<00:01:51.260> guns

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
black ops exclusive submachine guns

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.370 
black ops exclusive submachine guns
those<00:01:52.130> being<00:01:52.400> the<00:01:52.549> mac<00:01:52.760> 11<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.659> comparison

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
those being the mac 11 the comparison

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.609 
those being the mac 11 the comparison
the<00:01:54.890> PM<00:01:55.220> 63<00:01:55.909> so<00:01:56.720> to<00:01:56.780> start<00:01:56.869> off<00:01:57.170> with<00:01:57.320> a<00:01:57.409> mac-11

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
the PM 63 so to start off with a mac-11

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.890 
the PM 63 so to start off with a mac-11
probably<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.670> best<00:01:58.909> of<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.150> three<00:01:59.479> has<00:01:59.720> some

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
probably the best of the three has some

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.570 
probably the best of the three has some
pretty<00:02:00.110> good<00:02:00.290> features<00:02:00.710> such<00:02:00.950> as<00:02:00.979> low<00:02:01.340> recoil

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
pretty good features such as low recoil

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.690 
pretty good features such as low recoil
in<00:02:02.150> fast<00:02:02.600> reload<00:02:03.020> time<00:02:03.259> however<00:02:04.070> it<00:02:04.430> belongs

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
in fast reload time however it belongs

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.670 
in fast reload time however it belongs
in<00:02:04.880> this<00:02:04.970> list<00:02:05.299> since<00:02:05.840> it's<00:02:06.049> basically<00:02:06.590> a

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
in this list since it's basically a

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.370 
in this list since it's basically a
useless<00:02:07.040> gun<00:02:07.400> to<00:02:07.520> use<00:02:07.720> recents<00:02:08.720> mean<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.200> has<00:02:09.350> a

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
useless gun to use recents mean it has a

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.320 
useless gun to use recents mean it has a
high<00:02:09.709> rate<00:02:09.950> of<00:02:09.979> fire<00:02:10.130> but<00:02:10.880> with<00:02:10.940> only<00:02:11.209> a

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
20-round magazine size forcing you to

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.509 
20-round magazine size forcing you to
reload<00:02:14.390> basically<00:02:14.900> after<00:02:15.019> every<00:02:15.530> kill<00:02:15.799> with

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519

this being the situation double kills

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.590 
this being the situation double kills
are<00:02:18.560> nearly<00:02:18.829> impossible<00:02:18.980> as<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:20.299> will<00:02:20.420> most

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
are nearly impossible as you will most

are nearly impossible as you will most

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
on the body but I think the thing that

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.930 
on the body but I think the thing that
we<00:04:40.110> all<00:04:40.320> know<00:04:40.560> as<00:04:40.740> to<00:04:40.919> why<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.130> dragon<00:04:41.640> off<00:04:41.730> is

we all know as to why the dragon off is
so<00:04:42.120> bad<00:04:42.360> and<00:04:42.600> why<00:04:43.110> we<00:04:43.290> hate<00:04:43.440> use<00:04:43.650> it<00:04:43.830> so<00:04:44.010> much<00:04:44.190> is

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
so bad and why we hate use it so much is

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.400 
so bad and why we hate use it so much is
the<00:04:44.880> fact<00:04:45.150> that<00:04:45.270> if<00:04:45.419> you<00:04:45.540> don't<00:04:45.870> kill<00:04:46.140> with<00:04:46.290> the

the fact that if you don't kill with the
