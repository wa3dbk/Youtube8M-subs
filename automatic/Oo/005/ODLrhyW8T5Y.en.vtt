00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160

write<00:04:07.920> this<00:04:08.069> way<00:04:08.250> it's<00:04:08.519> easier<00:04:09.030> because<00:04:09.209> I

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
write this way it's easier because I

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.150 
write this way it's easier because I
have<00:04:09.720> big<00:04:09.870> writing<00:04:10.079> I<00:04:10.230> can't<00:04:10.739> write<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.100> other

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.000 
have big writing I can't write the other
way<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:12.480> if<00:04:12.600> something<00:04:12.870> is<00:04:12.959> truly<00:04:13.410> important

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
way and if something is truly important

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.129 
way and if something is truly important
I<00:04:14.130> write<00:04:14.639> it<00:04:14.819> on<00:04:15.000> this<00:04:15.420> side<00:04:15.660> of<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:15.959> paper

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.060 
I write it on this side of the paper
like<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.739> put<00:04:17.340> this<00:04:17.430> line<00:04:17.700> and<00:04:17.880> it<00:04:17.970> comes<00:04:18.150> blank

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
like I put this line and it comes blank

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.560 
like I put this line and it comes blank
so<00:04:20.070> I<00:04:20.100> split<00:04:20.459> it<00:04:20.489> in<00:04:20.639> half<00:04:20.700> so<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.150> have<00:04:21.329> my<00:04:21.419> meal

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
so I split it in half so I have my meal

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.290 
so I split it in half so I have my meal
plan<00:04:21.750> on<00:04:21.989> one<00:04:22.140> side<00:04:22.380> every<00:04:23.340> single<00:04:23.610> day<00:04:23.789> and<00:04:24.150> on

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
plan on one side every single day and on

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.820 
plan on one side every single day and on
this<00:04:24.419> side<00:04:24.630> if<00:04:24.780> something's<00:04:25.169> super<00:04:25.440> important

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
this side if something's super important
