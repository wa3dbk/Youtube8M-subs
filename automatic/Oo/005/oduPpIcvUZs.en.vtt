00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360 
you will have to draw something like

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.530 
you will have to draw something like
this<00:00:24.960> with<00:00:25.800> cardboard<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.670> once<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.330> cut<00:00:27.510> it

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:27.540 
this with cardboard and once you cut it

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.160 
this with cardboard and once you cut it
out

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
out

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.550 
out
you'll<00:00:28.950> get<00:00:29.190> something<00:00:29.460> like<00:00:29.760> this<00:00:30.350> make<00:00:31.350> sure

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
you'll get something like this make sure

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.720 
you'll get something like this make sure
it's<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.890> right<00:00:32.040> size<00:00:32.640> for<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:33.420> soak<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.730> you

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
it's the right size for a soak and you

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.930 
it's the right size for a soak and you
have<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.150> crack<00:00:36.450> not<00:00:36.990> crack<00:00:39.410> make<00:00:40.410> it<00:00:40.559> just

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
have to crack not crack make it just

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.310 
have to crack not crack make it just
damaged<00:00:42.080> so<00:00:43.080> you<00:00:43.170> get<00:00:44.030> a<00:00:45.030> little<00:00:45.660> light

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
damaged so you get a little light

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:58.100 
damaged so you get a little light
texture<00:00:55.910> when<00:00:56.910> you're<00:00:57.030> finished<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.780> you

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
texture when you're finished and you

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.270 
texture when you're finished and you
want<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.470> put<00:00:58.860> some<00:00:59.040> glue<00:00:59.370> on<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.170> shiny<00:01:01.280> sides

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
want to put some glue on the shiny sides

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.020 
want to put some glue on the shiny sides
so<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.750> will<00:01:03.960> just<00:01:04.140> look<00:01:04.410> better<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:05.220> but

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
so it will just look better here but

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.210 
so it will just look better here but
make<00:01:06.300> sure<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:06.750> really<00:01:07.320> good<00:01:07.440> Lucas

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
make sure it's really good Lucas

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:17.810 
make sure it's really good Lucas
otherwise<00:01:08.790> produce<00:01:09.540> not

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.440 

and<00:01:18.900> then<00:01:19.900> you<00:01:19.990> put<00:01:20.200> ISM<00:01:20.500> oh<00:01:21.180> yeah<00:01:22.180> make<00:01:22.420> sure

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
and then you put ISM oh yeah make sure

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.620 
and then you put ISM oh yeah make sure
it's<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:23.170> right<00:01:23.320> size

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.030 

and<00:01:30.290> then<00:01:31.040> you<00:01:31.159> have<00:01:31.310> to<00:01:31.460> cut<00:01:31.700> out<00:01:32.470> our<00:01:33.470> student

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
and then you have to cut out our student

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:41.289 
and then you have to cut out our student
needs

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:49.149 

and<00:01:42.770> just<00:01:43.770> fold<00:01:44.429> it<00:01:44.670> over<00:01:46.729> their<00:01:47.729> car<00:01:48.270> folds

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
and just fold it over their car folds

and just fold it over their car folds
like<00:01:50.159> this

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.430 

make<00:02:08.009> sure<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.489> doesn't<00:02:08.910> break<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.509> it's

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
make sure that doesn't break and it's

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.490 
make sure that doesn't break and it's
fits<00:02:10.769> well<00:02:11.039> on<00:02:11.340> ice<00:02:11.580> walk<00:02:11.819> this<00:02:12.780> will<00:02:13.110> be<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.290> bit

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
fits well on ice walk this will be a bit

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.740 
fits well on ice walk this will be a bit
busy<00:02:13.800> if<00:02:14.099> it<00:02:14.190> doesn't<00:02:14.519> fit

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.800 

they<00:02:19.500> do<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.040> same<00:02:20.250> with<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.940> second<00:02:21.630> piece

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.119 

make<00:03:07.470> sure<00:03:08.000> we<00:03:09.000> get<00:03:09.209> between<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:10.349> soup<00:03:10.680> parts

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.120 

and<00:03:26.280> then<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:26.610> blew<00:03:27.140> second<00:03:28.140> for<00:03:28.319> the<00:03:28.920> first

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.240 

in<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:08.730> movie<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.300> joke<00:04:09.720> is<00:04:09.960> just<00:04:10.290> really<00:04:10.920> pale

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
the original color of the armor just

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.860 
the original color of the armor just
doesn't<00:04:19.860> look<00:04:20.040> right<00:04:20.720> as<00:04:21.720> Lego<00:04:22.230> minifigure<00:04:23.870> at

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
doesn't look right as Lego minifigure at

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.780 
doesn't look right as Lego minifigure at
the<00:04:25.020> ends<00:04:25.290> of<00:04:25.350> this<00:04:25.560> part<00:04:25.890> you<00:04:26.100> will<00:04:26.280> just<00:04:26.550> see

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
the ends of this part you will just see

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.830 
the ends of this part you will just see
kind<00:04:27.090> of<00:04:27.840> how<00:04:28.080> you<00:04:28.260> should<00:04:28.610> could<00:04:29.610> do<00:04:30.450> it<00:04:30.630> with

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
kind of how you should could do it with

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.749 
kind of how you should could do it with
shades<00:04:31.680> so<00:04:32.070> it<00:04:32.130> gets<00:04:32.490> more<00:04:32.790> down

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
shades so it gets more down

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:39.760 
shades so it gets more down
so<00:04:35.830> you<00:04:36.830> basically<00:04:37.279> want<00:04:37.520> to<00:04:37.849> put<00:04:38.469> black<00:04:39.469> paint

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
so you basically want to put black paint

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.390 
so you basically want to put black paint
at<00:04:40.069> the<00:04:40.279> sides<00:04:40.520> of<00:04:40.789> the<00:04:40.999> second<00:04:41.479> piece<00:04:41.689> and<00:04:42.400> in

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
at the sides of the second piece and in

00:04:43.400 --> 00:05:35.279 
at the sides of the second piece and in
the<00:04:43.490> middle<00:04:43.729> of<00:04:43.789> it

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:39.580 

like<00:05:36.289> this<00:05:36.999> what's<00:05:37.999> not<00:05:38.300> really<00:05:38.659> clear<00:05:39.050> what<00:05:39.529> I

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
like this what's not really clear what I

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:45.939 
like this what's not really clear what I
mean<00:05:39.919> in<00:05:40.819> CT<00:05:41.979> but<00:05:42.979> I<00:05:43.490> will<00:05:44.029> show<00:05:44.240> you<00:05:44.300> now<00:05:44.949> for

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:45.949 
mean in CT but I will show you now for

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:50.439 
mean in CT but I will show you now for
this<00:05:46.960> so<00:05:47.960> what<00:05:48.289> it<00:05:48.590> should<00:05:48.889> look<00:05:49.099> like<00:05:49.310> this

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:50.449 
this so what it should look like this

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:51.890 
this so what it should look like this
other<00:05:50.719> this

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
other this

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:58.400 
other this
so<00:05:52.320> finally<00:05:52.889> you<00:05:53.160> have<00:05:56.419> and<00:05:57.419> you<00:05:57.570> feel<00:05:57.810> a

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:58.410 
so finally you have and you feel a

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.150 
so finally you have and you feel a
little<00:05:58.680> bit<00:05:58.830> clay<00:05:59.840> on<00:06:00.840> it<00:06:00.900> and<00:06:01.440> you<00:06:01.680> put<00:06:01.740> it<00:06:01.979> on

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
little bit clay on it and you put it on

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.990 
little bit clay on it and you put it on

I<00:06:03.199> wouldn't<00:06:04.199> use<00:06:04.260> glue<00:06:04.949> because<00:06:05.370> it's<00:06:05.550> just

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
I wouldn't use glue because it's just

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:10.189 
I wouldn't use glue because it's just
kind<00:06:06.240> of<00:06:06.360> a<00:06:06.419> waste<00:06:06.690> of<00:06:07.110> level<00:06:07.650> I<00:06:07.889> think<00:06:08.340> and<00:06:09.199> it

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
kind of a waste of level I think and it

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.909 
kind of a waste of level I think and it
will<00:06:10.380> look<00:06:10.560> like<00:06:10.590> this<00:06:11.040> and<00:06:11.370> you<00:06:11.720> could<00:06:12.919> fold

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
will look like this and you could fold

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:22.820 
will look like this and you could fold
it<00:06:14.100> a<00:06:14.130> little<00:06:14.430> bit<00:06:16.580> and<00:06:18.620> here<00:06:19.620> you<00:06:19.740> are<00:06:21.830> making

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
it a little bit and here you are making

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:26.390 
it a little bit and here you are making
this<00:06:23.040> costs<00:06:23.760> something<00:06:24.570> like<00:06:24.810> a<00:06:25.139> half-hour<00:06:25.919> or

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
this costs something like a half-hour or

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:41.020 
this costs something like a half-hour or
Houston<00:06:27.210> or<00:06:27.690> hour<00:06:28.040> but<00:06:29.040> not<00:06:29.639> really<00:06:30.120> that<00:06:30.840> much

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:41.030 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:43.090
