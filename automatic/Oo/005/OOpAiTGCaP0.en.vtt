00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.410
 Hi, I'm the good doctor and this is 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.750
 clear medicine our medicine channel 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.840
 on the internet in clear medicine we are going to 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.189
 explain in a simple and concise way 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.110
 different aspects of medicine that 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.270
 you can not understand clearly 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:27.730
 today we are going to talk about diseases 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.370
 of the thyroid but what is the gland 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.950
 thyroid where is how is it 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.200
 because some nodules are good others 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.670
 not because sometimes it is operated and sometimes it 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.050
 give the medical treatment we are going to 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.540
 explain first where is the 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.080
 Thyroid gland thyroid gland 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:47.200
 it is a single gland with a kind of 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:49.300
 Butterfly shape that has both wings 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.739
 that we call lobes joined by a 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.110
 bridge that would be the body of the 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.600
 butterfly and we have it here located 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.510
 above the trachea 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.149
 the thyroid gland can have 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.239
 different types of diseases of the 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.640
 most common and benign are nodules 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.110
 these nodules remember that you have to do 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.330
 follow-up because they can be 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.600
 indicative of some malignant disease 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.750
 the thyroid nodules are a group of 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.800
 cells that are going to form in one of 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.770
 the two lobes or in both these 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.380
 nodules can be bags full of 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.270
 fluid that we call cysts or can 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.050
 be nodules behave 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.240
 different 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.190
 some of these nodules are going to produce 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.290
 hormones let's talk about nodules 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.360
 hot and others are not going to do 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.830
 absolutely nothing and you're going to hear that 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.340
 your doctor tells you that you have a nodule 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.950
 cold 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.520
 these nodules can have a 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.039
 follow-up or being punctured or make a 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.460
 much more specific diagnosis and 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.109
 have the need to remove the 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.170
 symptoms that appear with these nodules 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:02:01.170
 they are colorful but usually 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.119
 that you notice the patient is a nodule a 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.369
 little bump on the neck in this area that 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.539
 I have commented on the butterfly and go to her 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.819
 GP 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.410
 steele palpate the neck and determine 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.530
 If you have to go to the specialist doctor 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.480
 in this case the endocrine or not once 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.489
 that you get to the endocrine he is going to 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.829
 request different tests between them 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.900
 they are a hormonal profile to see 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.390
 how are your hormones that produce 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.079
 the thyroid gland an ultrasound 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.290
 cervical to see how that nodule is 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:33.690
 size that has where it is located and 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.480
 once with that he will decide if he continues 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.459
 testing or not between that decision 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.150
 and among those tests that you are going to request 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.310
 in the future they are from clicking on the 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.440
 nodule from puncturing the cyst that 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.970
 you can have until you make a 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.150
 scintigraphy or 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.470
 or a cervical region scanner if you 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.680
 doctor at the end decides that he should 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.080
 undergo surgery 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.760
 between the surgeon and the endocrine go to 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.980
 determine if what you have to do is 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.810
 remove half of the gland or the 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.610
 whole gland that's going to function 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.610
 of different factors that you have 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.920
 Unique nodes that have 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.110
 characteristics that are bad or that 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.300
 nodules appear in the two nooses of 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.130
 the butterfly that I have told you before 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.350
 the surgery has to be done through 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.230
 of the neck with a level incision 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.760
 cervical incision your surgeon 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.910
 will try to make it more aesthetic 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:31.150
 possible but remember that the important 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.950
 is to properly remove the gland 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.750
 the surgical intervention is not 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.269
 free of complications the two 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.370
 fundamentals that they will explain to you in 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.519
 the surgeon's office are the 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.069
 next one that can bleed because 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.110
 many blood vessels appear to this 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.420
 level of the neck and they are irrigating 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.510
 who are feeding the gland 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.859
 thyroid and the second is the injury of a 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.329
 nerve that is going to start to sound 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.299
 when they tell you what the nerve is 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:01.030
 recurrent larynx or this nerve is 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:03.220
 responsible for moving your vocal cords the 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.709
 injury of the same can go from a 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:09.489
 aphonia to a paralysis whereby 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:11.840
 surgery is a very technical surgery 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.970
 but necessary 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.709
 after surgery and when you leave 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.109
 home you are going to give some recommendations 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.329
 about wound care you can 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.799
 check our video about care 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.600
 of the wounds to make them more 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:25.699
 simple and much clearer but 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.590
 basically it consists of washing the 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.110
 wound with water and with neutral soap and in 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.910
 avoid sun exposure during 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.280
 minus six months 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.410
 and this has been clear medicine with the 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.500
 good doctor I hope this video has 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.210
 solved the doubts that you had for 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.430
 course at no time of this 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.380
 explanation replace the advice of 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.150
 your specialist doctor trusting 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.710
 your criterion remember that you can

 that many are possible and necessary
