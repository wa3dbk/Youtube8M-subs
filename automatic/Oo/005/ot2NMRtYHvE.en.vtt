hi<00:00:05.410> it's<00:00:05.710> Chuck<00:00:06.040> that<00:00:06.250> dig<00:00:06.670> and<00:00:07.090> today<00:00:07.390> we're

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.540 
hi it's Chuck that dig and today we're

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.049 
hi it's Chuck that dig and today we're
going<00:00:07.660> to<00:00:07.720> build<00:00:07.990> tiny<00:00:08.440> terrariums<00:00:09.129> because

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:10.059 
going to build tiny terrariums because

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:11.640 
going to build tiny terrariums because
often<00:00:10.509> we<00:00:10.629> have<00:00:10.780> something<00:00:11.139> around<00:00:11.320> the<00:00:11.469> house

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.650 
often we have something around the house

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.759 
often we have something around the house
and<00:00:12.039> that<00:00:12.549> could<00:00:12.759> be<00:00:12.940> a<00:00:12.969> jar<00:00:13.539> this<00:00:14.259> is<00:00:14.320> just<00:00:14.650> a

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:14.769 
and that could be a jar this is just a

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.120 
and that could be a jar this is just a
simple<00:00:15.280> mason<00:00:15.789> jar<00:00:16.059> it<00:00:16.330> could<00:00:17.080> be<00:00:17.260> a<00:00:17.439> vase<00:00:17.859> that

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
simple mason jar it could be a vase that

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.669 
simple mason jar it could be a vase that
you<00:00:18.400> have<00:00:18.640> that<00:00:19.119> you<00:00:19.300> found<00:00:19.570> a<00:00:19.720> lid<00:00:19.960> for<00:00:20.289> which

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:20.679 
you have that you found a lid for which

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:22.259 
you have that you found a lid for which
is<00:00:20.859> what<00:00:21.009> I've<00:00:21.160> done<00:00:21.189> here<00:00:21.670> just<00:00:21.970> found<00:00:22.150> a

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:22.269 
is what I've done here just found a

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:24.960 
is what I've done here just found a
great<00:00:22.480> jar<00:00:22.779> where<00:00:23.500> this<00:00:23.650> lid<00:00:23.949> can<00:00:24.130> go<00:00:24.339> on<00:00:24.550> it<00:00:24.789> or

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970 
great jar where this lid can go on it or

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.089 
great jar where this lid can go on it or
it<00:00:25.689> can<00:00:25.810> be<00:00:25.960> a<00:00:25.990> tiny<00:00:26.259> terrarium<00:00:26.859> that<00:00:26.890> are

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
it can be a tiny terrarium that are

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:28.919 
it can be a tiny terrarium that are
available<00:00:27.730> all<00:00:27.939> sorts<00:00:28.240> of<00:00:28.300> things<00:00:28.570> that<00:00:28.750> can

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:28.929 
available all sorts of things that can

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.549 
available all sorts of things that can
be<00:00:28.960> available<00:00:29.529> at<00:00:30.490> a<00:00:30.550> store<00:00:31.060> so<00:00:31.810> the<00:00:31.960> idea<00:00:32.289> is

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 
be available at a store so the idea is

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:34.920 
be available at a store so the idea is
again<00:00:32.829> with<00:00:33.399> anything<00:00:34.030> tiny<00:00:34.329> you<00:00:34.539> got<00:00:34.660> to<00:00:34.780> keep

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
again with anything tiny you got to keep

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.049 
again with anything tiny you got to keep
it<00:00:35.110> tiny<00:00:35.350> so<00:00:35.739> you<00:00:35.770> don't<00:00:36.039> crowd<00:00:36.340> it<00:00:36.579> out<00:00:36.760> you

00:00:37.049 --> 00:00:37.059 
it tiny so you don't crowd it out you

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.720 
it tiny so you don't crowd it out you
don't<00:00:37.210> want<00:00:37.390> to<00:00:37.899> you'll<00:00:38.800> fill<00:00:39.129> up<00:00:39.160> your<00:00:39.309> whole

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
don't want to you'll fill up your whole

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.510 
don't want to you'll fill up your whole
jar<00:00:40.180> with<00:00:40.510> something<00:00:40.930> growing<00:00:41.260> so<00:00:42.010> what<00:00:42.370> we're

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
jar with something growing so what we're

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.889 
jar with something growing so what we're
going<00:00:42.640> to<00:00:42.670> do<00:00:42.850> is<00:00:43.030> I'm<00:00:43.239> going<00:00:43.329> to<00:00:43.480> just<00:00:43.570> this

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
going to do is I'm going to just this

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.990 
going to do is I'm going to just this
one's<00:00:44.079> easier<00:00:44.379> for<00:00:44.649> me<00:00:44.739> to<00:00:44.770> show<00:00:44.890> you<00:00:45.100> so<00:00:45.789> we're

one's easier for me to show you so we're

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.180 
one's easier for me to show you so we're
going<00:00:46.180> to<00:00:46.300> build<00:00:46.600> this<00:00:47.170> terrarium<00:00:47.770> in<00:00:47.980> this

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
going to build this terrarium in this

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.479 
going to build this terrarium in this
jar<00:00:48.550> we're<00:00:48.940> just<00:00:49.120> going<00:00:49.329> to<00:00:49.390> add<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.980> rocks<00:00:51.250> to

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
jar we're just going to add the rocks to

00:00:51.489 --> 00:01:01.799 
jar we're just going to add the rocks to
the<00:00:51.519> bottom<00:00:59.039> and<00:01:00.039> I'd<00:01:00.280> say<00:01:00.550> just<00:01:00.789> about<00:01:00.940> well

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
the bottom and I'd say just about well

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:05.850 
the bottom and I'd say just about well
maybe<00:01:02.230> a<00:01:02.320> little<00:01:02.559> more<00:01:04.439> we're<00:01:05.439> then<00:01:05.590> going<00:01:05.770> to

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
maybe a little more we're then going to

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.710 
maybe a little more we're then going to
add<00:01:06.070> our<00:01:06.100> little<00:01:06.610> secret<00:01:06.970> here<00:01:07.060> at<00:01:07.210> dig<00:01:07.450> which

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
add our little secret here at dig which

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.539 
add our little secret here at dig which
is<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:08.110> bland<00:01:08.320> scape<00:01:08.650> fabric<00:01:09.189> and<00:01:09.400> we're

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
is the bland scape fabric and we're

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.460 
is the bland scape fabric and we're
going<00:01:09.670> to<00:01:09.729> just<00:01:09.939> what<00:01:10.630> this<00:01:10.780> is<00:01:10.990> doing<00:01:11.290> we're

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
going to just what this is doing we're

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.719 
going to just what this is doing we're
cutting<00:01:11.890> it<00:01:12.009> so<00:01:12.189> it<00:01:12.280> doesn't<00:01:12.610> show<00:01:14.490> making<00:01:15.490> a

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
cutting it so it doesn't show making a

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.899 
cutting it so it doesn't show making a
circle<00:01:16.180> that<00:01:16.329> goes<00:01:16.390> on<00:01:16.689> top<00:01:16.930> of<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.170> gravel

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
circle that goes on top of the gravel

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.060 
circle that goes on top of the gravel
what<00:01:18.909> this<00:01:19.150> is<00:01:19.360> doing<00:01:19.600> again<00:01:20.229> is<00:01:20.439> keeping<00:01:20.979> the

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
what this is doing again is keeping the

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.149 
what this is doing again is keeping the
gravel<00:01:21.460> clean<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:23.049> again<00:01:23.409> you<00:01:23.560> don't<00:01:23.770> want<00:01:23.920> it

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
gravel clean and again you don't want it

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.850 
gravel clean and again you don't want it
to<00:01:24.280> show<00:01:24.490> from<00:01:24.729> the<00:01:24.880> side<00:01:25.380> so<00:01:26.380> it's<00:01:26.530> just<00:01:26.650> like

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
to show from the side so it's just like

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.770 
to show from the side so it's just like
that<00:01:27.159> because<00:01:27.759> when<00:01:27.939> you<00:01:28.030> put<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.360> mud<00:01:28.570> on<00:01:28.750> it

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
that because when you put the mud on it

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:37.679 
that because when you put the mud on it
or<00:01:29.140> the<00:01:29.380> dirt<00:01:31.799> like<00:01:32.799> so<00:01:34.140> pressing<00:01:35.140> that<00:01:35.320> in<00:01:36.689> you

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:37.689 
or the dirt like so pressing that in you

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.230 
or the dirt like so pressing that in you
don't<00:01:37.899> see<00:01:38.079> your<00:01:38.200> fabric<00:01:38.740> yet<00:01:39.009> it<00:01:39.280> has<00:01:39.729> kept

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
don't see your fabric yet it has kept

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.260 
don't see your fabric yet it has kept
this<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.750> stone<00:01:41.110> clean<00:01:41.530> from<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.070> fabric<00:01:42.310> the

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
this the stone clean from the fabric the

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.240 
this the stone clean from the fabric the
problem<00:01:43.780> with<00:01:43.930> building<00:01:44.200> a<00:01:44.469> small<00:01:44.799> one

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
problem with building a small one

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.580 
problem with building a small one
not<00:01:46.240> that<00:01:46.420> it's<00:01:46.540> a<00:01:46.630> problem<00:01:46.840> is<00:01:47.049> just<00:01:47.079> finding

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
not that it's a problem is just finding

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.920 
not that it's a problem is just finding
plants<00:01:47.950> that<00:01:48.159> are<00:01:48.280> that<00:01:48.460> small<00:01:48.850> because<00:01:49.750> you

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
plants that are that small because you

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.870 
plants that are that small because you
can<00:01:50.110> get<00:01:50.320> four<00:01:50.619> inch<00:01:50.799> pots<00:01:51.130> and<00:01:51.490> everything

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
can get four inch pots and everything

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.899 
can get four inch pots and everything
but<00:01:52.090> it's<00:01:52.210> hard<00:01:52.479> to<00:01:52.689> then<00:01:52.899> take<00:01:53.439> away

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
but it's hard to then take away

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.880 
but it's hard to then take away
something<00:01:54.909> a<00:01:55.299> plant<00:01:55.750> that<00:01:55.869> was<00:01:56.110> in<00:01:56.259> a<00:01:56.350> planter

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
something a plant that was in a planter

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.109 
something a plant that was in a planter
this<00:01:57.310> size

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
this size

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:00.660 
this size
so<00:01:58.479> these<00:01:58.659> biddies<00:01:59.079> come<00:01:59.409> in<00:01:59.560> just<00:01:59.770> just

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
so these biddies come in just just

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:03.149 
so these biddies come in just just
terrific<00:02:01.299> Lee<00:02:01.659> we're<00:02:02.200> going<00:02:02.469> to<00:02:02.590> build<00:02:02.770> a<00:02:02.890> nest

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
terrific Lee we're going to build a nest

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.270 
terrific Lee we're going to build a nest
in<00:02:03.490> here<00:02:03.909> and<00:02:04.119> I<00:02:04.960> mean<00:02:05.170> a<00:02:05.200> nest<00:02:05.560> by<00:02:05.770> pushing<00:02:06.039> the
