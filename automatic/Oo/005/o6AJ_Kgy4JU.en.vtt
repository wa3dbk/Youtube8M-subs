00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
the theme of the day whether it's

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.469

whatever<00:01:21.750> that<00:01:21.929> is<00:01:22.220> we<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.369> that<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:23.819> about

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
whatever that is we do that for about

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.149 
whatever that is we do that for about
20-30<00:01:24.600> minutes<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.140> then<00:01:25.259> look<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.770> join<00:01:26.039> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159

better than a day before yes you're
coming<00:02:35.440> in<00:02:35.560> right<00:02:42.060> yeah<00:02:43.060> it<00:02:43.390> was<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.570> 64<00:02:44.290> off

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
coming in right yeah it was a 64 off

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.800 
coming in right yeah it was a 64 off
basically<00:02:44.770> offense<00:02:45.340> vs.<00:02:45.580> defense<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:46.720> know

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
basically offense vs. defense you know

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.360 
basically offense vs. defense you know
they<00:02:46.930> had<00:02:47.050> four<00:02:47.230> defenders<00:02:47.590> kind<00:02:47.890> of<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.220> back

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
they had four defenders kind of the back

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.610 
they had four defenders kind of the back
for<00:02:48.640> going<00:02:49.330> against<00:02:49.630> six<00:02:50.020> attackers<00:02:50.290> two

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
for going against six attackers two

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.960 
for going against six attackers two
forwards<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.070> four<00:02:51.250> midfielders<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.880> I

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
forwards and four midfielders and I

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.500 
forwards and four midfielders and I
think<00:02:52.959> that<00:02:53.110> drill<00:02:53.320> is<00:02:53.440> mainly<00:02:53.650> for<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:55.120> guys

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
think that drill is mainly for the guys

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.630 
think that drill is mainly for the guys
in<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.750> back<00:02:55.870> for<00:02:56.110> you<00:02:56.770> know<00:02:56.890> shifting<00:02:57.489> and

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
in the back for you know shifting and

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.250 
in the back for you know shifting and
moving<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:58.120> covering<00:02:58.840> for<00:02:59.020> each<00:02:59.050> other

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
moving and covering for each other

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.080 
moving and covering for each other
because<00:02:59.920> obviously<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.520> attacking<00:03:00.880> guys

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
because obviously the attacking guys

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.430 
because obviously the attacking guys
have<00:03:01.330> six<00:03:01.540> players<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:02.020> so<00:03:02.110> they're<00:03:02.260> going<00:03:02.350> to

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
have six players and so they're going to

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.690 
have six players and so they're going to
be<00:03:02.530> able<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.770> break<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.310> four<00:03:03.520> guys<00:03:03.640> down

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
be able to break the four guys down

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.490 
be able to break the four guys down
sometimes<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:04.870> it's<00:03:04.959> all<00:03:05.080> about<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:05.470> know

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
sometimes and it's all about you know

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.830 
sometimes and it's all about you know
the<00:03:05.709> different<00:03:05.980> types<00:03:06.100> of<00:03:06.220> reactions<00:03:06.520> and<00:03:06.910> in

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
the different types of reactions and in

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.160 
the different types of reactions and in
covering<00:03:08.320> for<00:03:08.500> each<00:03:08.560> other<00:03:08.709> in<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:08.980> defense

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
covering for each other in the defense

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.170 
covering for each other in the defense
you<00:03:11.170> know<00:03:11.260> I<00:03:11.290> think<00:03:11.380> in<00:03:11.650> today's<00:03:11.769> session<00:03:12.430> the

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
you know I think in today's session the

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.660 
you know I think in today's session the
most<00:03:13.420> fun<00:03:13.690> was<00:03:13.840> when<00:03:13.900> we<00:03:14.110> did<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.950> 44<00:03:15.519> plus

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
most fun was when we did the the 44 plus

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.880 
most fun was when we did the the 44 plus
one<00:03:16.000> just<00:03:16.959> because<00:03:17.110> it's<00:03:17.230> quick<00:03:17.470> it's<00:03:17.709> a<00:03:17.739> lot

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
one just because it's quick it's a lot

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.630 
one just because it's quick it's a lot
of<00:03:18.010> shots<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.320> tempo<00:03:20.739> is<00:03:20.769> just<00:03:21.160> it's

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
of shots and the tempo is just it's

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:41.190 
of shots and the tempo is just it's
nonstop<00:03:22.150> it's<00:03:22.360> back<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:22.690> forth<00:03:39.959> that's<00:03:40.959> the

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
nonstop it's back and forth that's the

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.050 
nonstop it's back and forth that's the
pretty<00:03:42.070> much<00:03:42.250> I<00:03:42.400> guess<00:03:42.430> you<00:03:42.670> could<00:03:42.700> say<00:03:42.940> the

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
pretty much I guess you could say the

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.910 
pretty much I guess you could say the
culmination<00:03:43.450> of<00:03:43.690> all<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.080> things<00:03:44.440> we<00:03:44.620> work<00:03:44.769> on
