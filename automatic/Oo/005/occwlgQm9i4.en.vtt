00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.480
 Hello together I would like to give you the 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.300
 diagnostic mode of the prius plus 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.660
 imagine 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.590
 and that's how you do it 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.850
 vehicle 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:39.210
 So the brake is pushing power button 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:45.040
 presses the whole system starts after that 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:50.010
 hold set button pressed and the light 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.010
 stand light on and off three times 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:59.580
 13 15 release the display stop button 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.549
 on the screen then appears the 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:07.150
 the diagnostic mode here is everything 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:10.689
 okay otherwise here is the error message from 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.960
 vehicle is displayed that is 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:16.060
 Reset max page come also use 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:21.700
 I can clarify that to you afterwards memory 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:25.510
 clinic that is a little delete though 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.270
 that would not really make it possible 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.290
 I also let stand so first 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:34.320
 page that is relatively easy to press 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.210
 Here you can see the speed control 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.050
 that's the current exact one 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:47.080
 speed where you are traveling 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:52.060
 on the display is on the display 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:55.150
 about five kilometers an hour higher than that 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.909
 speed on the jakobsweg display so 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:03.909
 that this speed is real 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:08.799
 pkb this is the place brake and read 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:10.360
 I often have to leave gaps so you can 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.019
 brake control the set 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:20.270
 switch how the hell that is 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:26.990
 reverse gear and 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:29.510
 is often build up and park park is her 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.990
 on you can see the individual components 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.980
 test 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.020
 with this clause come the 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.840
 Check that speaker hears that 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.390
 you then there will be the individual 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.840
 speaker if you have to do it 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.830
 individually controlled and so they hearken 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.290
 a speaker 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:54.350
 Perfect is the camera works 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:57.380
 not it would be if I come down here 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:01.070
 device or an iphone or something 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:05.060
 Connect one sees here the 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:07.030
 connection to that is everything in this 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.130
 program there is a second 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.100
 second mode program I now 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:15.200
 explain later going to the law to 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.990
 Disable the whole time there 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.220
 press again or the power button 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.550
 Turn off the vehicle and everything is 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.850
 path 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:30.100
 ok and continue to show next video 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.100
 I give you the second service mode
