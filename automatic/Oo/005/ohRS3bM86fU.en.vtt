00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
this place is unique because I think the

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.350 
this place is unique because I think the
palace<00:03:06.990> was<00:03:07.230> built<00:03:07.590> with<00:03:08.460> a<00:03:08.490> lot<00:03:08.760> of<00:03:08.790> us<00:03:09.090> to

palace was built with a lot of us to

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.040 
palace was built with a lot of us to
behind<00:03:09.660> it<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:11.210> there<00:03:12.210> is<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.390> configuration

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
behind it and there is a configuration

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.190 
behind it and there is a configuration
of<00:03:13.830> magnetic<00:03:14.370> fields<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.150> forests<00:03:15.870> and

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
of magnetic fields and forests and

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.440 
of magnetic fields and forests and
energies<00:03:16.800> there<00:03:17.430> anything<00:03:17.640> make<00:03:18.000> this<00:03:18.240> so

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
energies there anything make this so

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.360 
energies there anything make this so
special<00:03:18.720> I<00:03:19.230> don't<00:03:19.650> think<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:19.920> was<00:03:20.010> by<00:03:20.220> accident

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
special I don't think it was by accident

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.420 
special I don't think it was by accident
I<00:03:20.910> think<00:03:21.810> there<00:03:22.470> must<00:03:22.650> have<00:03:22.800> been<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:23.100> science

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430
