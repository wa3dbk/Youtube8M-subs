chilled<00:06:10.410> cooled<00:06:11.190> down<00:06:11.400> on<00:06:11.610> that<00:06:11.700> a<00:06:11.760> bit<00:06:12.000> once

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
chilled cooled down on that a bit once

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:14.120 
chilled cooled down on that a bit once
they<00:06:12.330> realized<00:06:12.660> first<00:06:12.870> this<00:06:13.320> kid<00:06:13.530> might<00:06:13.740> take

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 
maybe and also made a bit envious the

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:24.170

that's supposed to come out to be a

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.310 
that's supposed to come out to be a
rookie<00:06:26.700> and<00:06:26.970> as<00:06:27.300> well<00:06:27.510> as<00:06:27.660> Chris<00:06:27.870> Johnson's

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
rookie and as well as Chris Johnson's

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.030 
rookie and as well as Chris Johnson's
been<00:06:28.560> doing<00:06:29.070> there<00:06:29.250> twice<00:06:29.490> myself<00:06:31.040> we're

today yeah did you kind of get a feeling

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:02.589 
today yeah did you kind of get a feeling
for<00:07:01.460> that<00:07:01.610> last<00:07:01.819> night<00:07:02.030> when<00:07:02.150> you<00:07:02.240> talk<00:07:02.449> to

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:02.599 
for that last night when you talk to

00:07:02.599 --> 00:07:04.600 
for that last night when you talk to
them<00:07:02.719> I<00:07:02.930> mean<00:07:03.349> he's<00:07:03.469> not<00:07:03.680> a<00:07:03.740> cocky<00:07:04.189> kid<00:07:04.370> he's<00:07:04.580> a

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610 
them I mean he's not a cocky kid he's a

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:06.369 
them I mean he's not a cocky kid he's a
nice<00:07:05.030> kid<00:07:05.060> confident<00:07:05.990> though<00:07:06.080> he's<00:07:06.349> very

00:07:06.369 --> 00:07:06.379 
nice kid confident though he's very

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:08.020 
nice kid confident though he's very
confident<00:07:07.129> you<00:07:07.250> know<00:07:07.310> what<00:07:07.430> he<00:07:07.669> should<00:07:07.699> be

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.030 
confident you know what he should be

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:13.100 
confident you know what he should be
because<00:07:08.479> he<00:07:08.599> throws<00:07:08.780> it<00:07:08.990> great

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:13.110 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:18.930 

see<00:07:14.110> from<00:07:14.350> behind<00:07:14.590> the<00:07:14.800> approach<00:07:15.570> how<00:07:16.570> far<00:07:17.940> to

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:18.940 
see from behind the approach how far to

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.120 
see from behind the approach how far to
the<00:07:19.030> left<00:07:19.060> he<00:07:19.480> is<00:07:19.690> right<00:07:20.470> against<00:07:20.860> the<00:07:20.920> ball

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:21.130 
the left he is right against the ball

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.220 
the left he is right against the ball
return<00:07:21.310> it<00:07:21.670> will<00:07:21.790> closely<00:07:22.450> monitor<00:07:22.630> that

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:23.230 
return it will closely monitor that

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.930 
return it will closely monitor that
coming<00:07:23.620> up<00:07:23.680> the<00:07:23.800> final<00:07:24.130> when<00:07:24.520> he<00:07:24.610> gets<00:07:24.760> in<00:07:24.880> the

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:24.940 
coming up the final when he gets in the

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.000 
coming up the final when he gets in the
finals<00:07:25.090> I<00:07:25.540> mean<00:07:25.870> he's<00:07:26.140> out<00:07:26.350> of<00:07:26.500> Lane<00:07:26.680> already

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:27.010 
finals I mean he's out of Lane already

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.560 
finals I mean he's out of Lane already
yeah<00:07:27.250> that<00:07:27.640> ball<00:07:27.790> does<00:07:27.970> push<00:07:28.150> down<00:07:28.330> the<00:07:28.450> lane

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:28.570 
yeah that ball does push down the lane

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:30.810 
yeah that ball does push down the lane
he's<00:07:28.810> got<00:07:28.990> to<00:07:29.080> make<00:07:29.170> a<00:07:29.230> change<00:07:29.560> and<00:07:30.550> I<00:07:30.790> think

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:30.820 
he's got to make a change and I think

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.340 
he's got to make a change and I think
the<00:07:31.090> change<00:07:31.330> he's<00:07:31.450> gonna<00:07:31.570> have<00:07:31.720> to<00:07:31.810> make<00:07:31.960> us<00:07:32.110> to

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:32.350 
the change he's gonna have to make us to

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.200 
the change he's gonna have to make us to
a<00:07:32.410> weaker<00:07:32.830> or<00:07:33.190> less<00:07:33.400> aggressive<00:07:33.820> bowling<00:07:34.060> man

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:34.210 
a weaker or less aggressive bowling man

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.660 
a weaker or less aggressive bowling man
