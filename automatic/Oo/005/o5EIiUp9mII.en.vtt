of<00:05:18.909> blur<00:05:19.060> it<00:05:19.180> a<00:05:19.210> little<00:05:19.360> bit<00:05:19.570> um<00:05:21.180> so<00:05:22.180> I<00:05:22.210> don't

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
of blur it a little bit um so I don't

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:23.810 
of blur it a little bit um so I don't
know<00:05:22.479> the<00:05:22.630> colors<00:05:22.960> all<00:05:23.199> the<00:05:23.349> way<00:05:23.470> through

honestly<00:05:24.820> I<00:05:24.940> don't<00:05:25.180> know<00:05:25.300> think<00:05:25.539> it<00:05:25.630> makes<00:05:25.750> a

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
honestly I don't know think it makes a

honestly I don't know think it makes a
difference<00:05:26.050> I<00:05:26.470> think<00:05:26.680> you'll<00:05:26.800> still<00:05:26.979> get<00:05:27.099> the

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:27.190 
difference I think you'll still get the

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.510 
difference I think you'll still get the
same<00:05:27.220> color<00:05:27.669> payoff<00:05:28.080> but<00:05:29.099> if<00:05:30.099> you<00:05:30.250> want<00:05:30.400> those

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
same color payoff but if you want those

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.129 
same color payoff but if you want those
