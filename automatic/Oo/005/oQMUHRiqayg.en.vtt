00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.570
 hello to all my friends windows phone italia 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.860
 I'm Alessandro and you can see the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:18.910
 our video proof of 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:22.960
 of windows 10 technical nobil 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:27.570
 preview with spartan then in this 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:30.130
 moment is in action and the new entry that 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.739
 is part of our ranks by few 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.040
 Nicolo days that I tried for us 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:38.470
 spartan project and it is showing us 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.019
 a roundup of actions then this is 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:44.290
 how it looks like you can see 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:47.320
 we have this interface 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:52.210
 rather minimal he goes rather 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:55.239
 sent and shows you the key already 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.390
 share the share button that does 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:03.010
 see a series of options for 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.019
 share the web page in that 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.040
 moment displayed then we have the 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:11.020
 new find on the page we found 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.299
 both for small capital letters and words 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:18.810
 inter is still quite enough 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.700
 quite as before we then have the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.420
 possibility to print integrated print 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.549
 in the browser 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.329
 we have the option and print 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:31.210
 how xps is to print in pdf 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.039
 naturally nicolò had no press 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.090
 nicolò active moment for that not 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.710
 we have a chance to see more 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.749
 these are the standard settings like 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.229
 you can see very comfortable do not open 

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:46.149
 another page we have this bar that 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.319
 this bar appears on the right 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:52.210
 shows us all the possibilities we have 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:53.679
 the ability to disable flash 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.369
 player activate it 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:02:03.429
 we have so many possibilities this is 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:04.899
 feedback for reports that do not 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.539
 should be more active then in the 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.940
 final version we have the 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.550
 possibility to customize with 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:15.569
 onenote practically here is a note of 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:19.000
 onenote in which it gives us the possibility 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.160
 precisely to create a note on the page 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.140
 itself 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.490
 surface 3 or on facebook 3 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.730
 of course we can also use the 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:32.590
 pen to do this kind of operations 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.470
 delete all now nicola is there 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.420
 showing some operations 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.980
 what he told me unfortunately not 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.110
 I still managed to update the 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.910
 my bild is making me a little crazy 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.500
 from this point of view 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.910
 now I have also written another note 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.440
 nicolò told me that it is extremely 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:54.720
 fast even if it still lacks features 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.580
 which also shares with dvd 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.890
 has very few options we can 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:05.850
 capturing the onenote screen is one 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.610
 of the larger integrations than 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.360
 we have from this point of view 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.550
 now nicolò has taken a lot of time 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.170
 from the notes 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.150
 we return to the bar settings 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.610
 favorite deactivate t mobile a lot 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.040
 simply or we have the management of 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.450
 favorites as you can see here too 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:33.080
 here we find the type of icon of the 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:34.830
 folder reading list history 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.530
 and downloads 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.810
 as you can see the beautiful thing of 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.940
 spartan is the fact of having this 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.580
 interface with menus that don't work 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:49.549
 cover the current screen but go to 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:53.750
 integrate very absolutely thing 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.750
 a lot of shape from my point of view 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:00.630
 then now lets us see some 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.120
 speed let's go on windows phone italy 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:06.330
 like seeing a rocket while being one 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:11.940
 technical preview technique and yet being 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:16.049
 a site still a sit sorry ap browser 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:18.590
 still under advanced development 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.590
 Let's check 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:28.800
 here here maybe he had some problems 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:33.230
 it failed here we are now 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.670
 let's try to create another card 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:37.140
 management of multiple cards this va well ce 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:43.500
 we also had it before 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:45.900
 obviously but it shows us a bit of 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.850
 animation here 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.470
 add all the cards close duplicate 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.470
 card shown in a new window 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:05:03.350
 ok let's see what we propose here we are 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:06.740
 here, this is the blog 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:13.910
 we switched to column center windows 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:17.440
 in a flash we also switched to a 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.440
 another type of view 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.510
 these are obviously the dark topics 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.910
 is dedicated above all who wants 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:31.520
 consume less battery then on 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.520
 portable or smartphone 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:39.120
 here there is also the style of writing is 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:42.300
 still question just if spartan 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:46.440
 will it have extensions or not I sincerely 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:49.500
 I hope so because although these can 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:52.040
 also be a burden on the browser 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:55.200
 same for navigation 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:06:00.500
 many times they give that little something extra 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:03.570
 which may be may be necessary 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:08.040
 how to see here we have the integration 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:09.660
 with cortana in spartan unfortunately not 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.300
 everything still works however you can 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:15.330
 see something is not looking for the weather 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.930
 seems to still work fine at 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.520
 silvio berlusconi asks cortana 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:21.750
 we have this option integrated into the 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.360
 browser 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.250
 silvio berlusconi comes to us all this 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:30.510
 we don't want to do political propaganda 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:36.110
 we are not in fact seen that the first thing 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:36.110
 that came to mind here 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:47.880
 what gives cortana ok you can see 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.880
 everything works very well 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.980
 thank you nicolato for having us 

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:56.770
 done this great favor is having us 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.810
 provided this brief test of spartan 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:02.220
 which however gives us an idea of the steps in 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:04.270
 ahead of the new engine the new engine 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.850
 integrated into spartan new ones 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:10.330
 possibility even if it will be to discover 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:11.110
 over time and calmly its true ones 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.420
 potentiality 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:16.260
 greetings to all and sign up 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.260
 alternate hello
