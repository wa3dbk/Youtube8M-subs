00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:50.450 
manual and that seems about right from

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.720 
manual and that seems about right from
the<00:00:50.540> amount<00:00:50.660> of<00:00:50.780> time<00:00:50.960> in<00:00:51.170> the<00:00:51.260> air<00:00:51.730> the

double-a batteries in the base and it

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.569 
double-a batteries in the base and it
takes<00:00:58.250> about<00:00:58.340> 15<00:00:59.059> minutes<00:00:59.090> to<00:00:59.570> charge<00:00:59.719> up<00:01:00.579> it's

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
takes about 15 minutes to charge up it's

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.630 
takes about 15 minutes to charge up it's
pretty<00:01:01.820> good<00:01:02.140> what<00:01:03.140> you<00:01:03.260> get<00:01:03.440> when<00:01:04.159> flying<00:01:04.430> is

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
pretty good what you get when flying is

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.059 
pretty good what you get when flying is
something<00:01:04.939> which<00:01:05.089> is<00:01:05.680> very<00:01:06.680> serene

00:01:07.059 --> 00:01:07.069 
something which is very serene

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:08.919 
something which is very serene
especially<00:01:07.549> on<00:01:07.670> a<00:01:07.700> nice<00:01:07.850> calm<00:01:08.149> day<00:01:08.179> like<00:01:08.780> today

00:01:08.919 --> 00:01:08.929

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:11.949 
especially on a nice calm day like today
and<00:01:09.319> a<00:01:09.380> nice<00:01:09.530> big<00:01:09.799> open<00:01:10.729> field<00:01:10.999> now<00:01:11.810> these

00:01:11.949 --> 00:01:11.959 
and a nice big open field now these

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:13.449 
and a nice big open field now these
don't<00:01:12.200> come<00:01:12.439> around<00:01:12.590> too<00:01:12.799> often<00:01:12.979> where<00:01:13.189> I<00:01:13.219> live

00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:13.459 
don't come around too often where I live

00:01:13.459 --> 00:01:14.679 
don't come around too often where I live
so<00:01:13.490> this<00:01:13.789> is<00:01:13.909> the<00:01:13.999> first<00:01:14.179> time<00:01:14.359> I<00:01:14.389> really

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
so this is the first time I really

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.050 
so this is the first time I really
headed<00:01:14.899> out<00:01:15.020> flying<00:01:15.319> and<00:01:15.560> being<00:01:16.130> able<00:01:16.219> to<00:01:16.399> last

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
headed out flying and being able to last

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.399 
headed out flying and being able to last
longer<00:01:17.329> than<00:01:17.569> one<00:01:17.719> battery<00:01:18.020> charge<00:01:18.049> before

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
longer than one battery charge before

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.260 
longer than one battery charge before
crashing<00:01:18.889> to<00:01:18.979> think<00:01:19.189> and<00:01:19.459> having<00:01:19.880> to<00:01:19.999> repair

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270

stick<00:02:06.349> control<00:02:06.799> the<00:02:07.179> elephant's<00:02:08.179> and<00:02:08.479> the

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
stick control the elephant's and the

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.620 
stick control the elephant's and the
throttle<00:02:09.890> or<00:02:10.429> you<00:02:10.610> can<00:02:10.759> have<00:02:11.000> it<00:02:11.330> set<00:02:11.480> up<00:02:11.600> like

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
throttle or you can have it set up like

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.300 
throttle or you can have it set up like
I<00:02:11.900> have<00:02:12.080> here<00:02:12.260> with<00:02:12.410> a<00:02:12.440> separate<00:02:12.980> throttle

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
I have here with a separate throttle

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.030 
I have here with a separate throttle
stick<00:02:13.520> a<00:02:14.300> and<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.320> elephant's<00:02:15.740> and<00:02:15.980> the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
stick a and the elephant's and the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.570 
stick a and the elephant's and the
radicand

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
radicand

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.830 
radicand
just<00:02:17.580> on<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:17.820> side<00:02:18.030> there<00:02:18.210> just<00:02:18.450> seems<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.810> be

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
just on that side there just seems to be

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.480 
just on that side there just seems to be
a<00:02:19.050> bit<00:02:19.200> more<00:02:19.320> natural<00:02:19.680> when<00:02:19.830> I'm<00:02:19.950> flying<00:02:20.190> so<00:02:20.460> I

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
a bit more natural when I'm flying so I

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.790 
a bit more natural when I'm flying so I
can<00:02:20.640> keep<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.330> throttle<00:02:21.480> steady<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.020> just<00:02:22.170> it

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
can keep the throttle steady and just it

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.280 
can keep the throttle steady and just it
cuts<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.040> trailer<00:02:23.250> on<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.370> controls<00:02:24.290> the

antenna - now pull out and get in the
way<00:02:31.400> it's<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.660> fairly<00:02:33.660> simple<00:02:33.960> to<00:02:34.050> fly<00:02:34.230> I've

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
way it's a fairly simple to fly I've

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.260 
way it's a fairly simple to fly I've
been<00:02:34.770> you<00:02:35.400> know<00:02:35.460> practicing<00:02:35.880> now<00:02:35.940> for<00:02:36.120> about

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
been you know practicing now for about

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.780 
been you know practicing now for about
10<00:02:36.480> or<00:02:36.510> 15<00:02:36.690> minutes<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.320> managed<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.400> get<00:02:38.670> some

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
10 or 15 minutes and managed to get some

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:39.890 
10 or 15 minutes and managed to get some
good<00:02:38.850> circuits<00:02:39.330> it's<00:02:39.450> getting<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.660> little<00:02:39.810> bit

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
good circuits it's getting a little bit

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.980 
good circuits it's getting a little bit
windy<00:02:40.050> so<00:02:40.470> hopefully<00:02:41.010> I<00:02:41.070> can<00:02:41.160> get<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.180> charged

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
windy so hopefully I can get it charged

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.780 
windy so hopefully I can get it charged
up<00:02:43.170> and<00:02:43.350> in<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.530> air<00:02:43.740> and<00:02:44.310> see<00:02:44.490> if<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:44.640> can

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
up and in the air and see if I can

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.080 
up and in the air and see if I can
balance<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.120> camera<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.450> take<00:02:45.570> some<00:02:45.720> shots

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
balance the camera and take some shots

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.520 
balance the camera and take some shots
it<00:02:48.090> might<00:02:48.240> be<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.390> little<00:02:48.510> bit<00:02:48.720> hard<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.990> see<00:02:49.170> out

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
it might be a little bit hard to see out

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.990 
it might be a little bit hard to see out
in<00:02:49.709> this<00:02:49.830> light<00:02:50.010> here<00:02:50.220> but<00:02:50.250> we've<00:02:50.580> got<00:02:50.700> now<00:02:50.880> is

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
in this light here but we've got now is

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.699 
in this light here but we've got now is
the<00:02:51.180> little<00:02:51.540> charging<00:02:51.870> LED<00:02:52.140> is<00:02:52.230> flashing<00:02:52.260> at

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
the little charging LED is flashing at

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.949 
the little charging LED is flashing at
me<00:02:52.740> that<00:02:53.490> pretty<00:02:53.700> much<00:02:53.820> tells<00:02:54.060> me<00:02:54.270> the<00:02:54.570> battery

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
me that pretty much tells me the battery

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.199 
me that pretty much tells me the battery
is<00:02:55.110> ready<00:02:55.260> to<00:02:55.440> plug<00:02:55.650> into<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.860> plane<00:02:56.070> so<00:02:57.030> what

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
is ready to plug into the plane so what

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:02.510 
is ready to plug into the plane so what
we've<00:02:57.330> got<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:59.660> just<00:03:00.660> a<00:03:00.840> little<00:03:01.520> lightweight

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
we've got is just a little lightweight

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.120 
we've got is just a little lightweight
lithium<00:03:02.700> polymer<00:03:03.000> battery<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.840> a<00:03:04.650> small

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
lithium polymer battery and a small

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.930 
lithium polymer battery and a small
connector<00:03:05.540> that<00:03:06.540> in<00:03:06.690> there<00:03:07.430> which<00:03:08.430> connects

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
connector that in there which connects

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.160 
connector that in there which connects
to<00:03:09.709> the<00:03:11.209> power<00:03:12.209> supply<00:03:12.360> there<00:03:12.750> on<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.959> plane

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
to the power supply there on the plane

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.080 
to the power supply there on the plane
why<00:03:13.740> it's<00:03:13.860> charged<00:03:14.220> yeah<00:03:14.550> plug<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:14.970> battery

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
why it's charged yeah plug the battery

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.840 
why it's charged yeah plug the battery
in<00:03:15.420> turn<00:03:16.380> on<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.530> controller<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:17.160> they

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
in turn on the controller and they

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.120 
in turn on the controller and they
synchronize<00:03:18.360> with<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.900> controls<00:03:19.230> but<00:03:19.440> if<00:03:19.980> you

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
synchronize with the controls but if you

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.770 
synchronize with the controls but if you
hold<00:03:20.250> them<00:03:20.370> close<00:03:20.489> together<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:21.239> you're<00:03:21.660> good

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
hold them close together and you're good

00:03:21.780 --> 00:07:15.510 
hold them close together and you're good
to<00:03:21.870> go

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.860 

you<00:07:16.520> can<00:07:16.790> tell<00:07:17.330> me<00:07:17.480> this<00:07:17.690> guy<00:07:17.900> from<00:07:18.530> me
