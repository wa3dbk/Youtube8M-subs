but celebrations weren't perhaps as wild
as<00:03:55.180> I<00:03:55.269> thought<00:03:55.479> there<00:03:55.690> might<00:03:55.840> be<00:03:55.870> because

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290

i think halftime I thought we'd

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:03.990 
i think halftime I thought we'd
celebrate<00:04:01.359> more<00:04:01.810> our<00:04:02.079> time<00:04:02.349> but<00:04:02.620> I'll<00:04:02.829> see<00:04:03.099> you
