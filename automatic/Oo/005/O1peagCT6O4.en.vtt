 offer more power options in the 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:17.040
 line 5 thousand a new line the line 500 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.040
 with tractors of 65 and 75 hp 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.000

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.490
 arrive in the compact versions being 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.549

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.070
 brazil in this category comes standard with

 gearbox and super reducer 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.970
 professional and other news 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.950
 as the new panel with digital clock

 led rear lights and a new 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.179
 brake system 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.759
 I think it's one of the main 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.720
 characteristics is the saw is to hear the 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.340
 client 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.789
 I think that was the focus on those 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.399
 products and has had a lot of 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.159
 These details keep the issue of 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.470
 comfort of the operator the question of having 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.250
 feature on the machine for different 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.660
 applications that it will be submitted and 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.459
 besides this new series 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.530
 the agrale also presented another 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:14.310
 tractor to complete its 5 thousand line 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.830
 the 105 105-horsepower 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.810
 turbine power that arrives equipped 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.160
 with the tilting hood and a better 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.989
 ergonomics for the operator and thus 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.050
 It's worth it because we're going from 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:31.260
 to what the distributor who is the 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.910
 you need and then the market demand 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.390
 we are presenting exactly 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:40.190
 what is needed today for the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.190
 distributor and for the market 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:47.049
 more than 50% of tractor sales in the 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.090
 Brazil is between the ranks of 75 to 110 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.900
 horsepower so the grid 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:56.139
 launches 500 and 65 series 500 tractors 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:00.099

 5000 tractor of 105 horsepower 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.989
 since 1994 there is no record of 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.150
 increase in income and now with these 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.900

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.519
 products 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.840

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:14.530

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.900
