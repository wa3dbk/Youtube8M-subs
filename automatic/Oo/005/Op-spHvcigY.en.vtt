minecraft<00:00:04.080> minecart<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.770> calculator<00:00:05.250> it<00:00:05.819> is

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:06.890 
minecraft minecart to calculator it is

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.990 
minecraft minecart to calculator it is
probably<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.010> simplest<00:00:08.309> I've<00:00:08.550> seen<00:00:08.760> quite<00:00:08.910> a

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
probably the simplest I've seen quite a

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.450 
probably the simplest I've seen quite a
few<00:00:09.030> on<00:00:09.300> youtube<00:00:09.719> but<00:00:10.050> they're<00:00:10.740> all<00:00:10.920> quite

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
few on youtube but they're all quite

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.680 
few on youtube but they're all quite
congregates<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.059> they<00:00:12.120> will<00:00:12.240> use<00:00:12.389> redstone

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
congregates and they will use redstone

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.169 
congregates and they will use redstone
everything<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:14.250> don't<00:00:14.429> like<00:00:14.610> regeton<00:00:14.969> very

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
everything and I don't like regeton very

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.080 
everything and I don't like regeton very
much<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.660> so<00:00:16.250> yes<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.609> much<00:00:17.820> more

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
much and so yes this is a much more

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.510 
much and so yes this is a much more
simple<00:00:18.480> design<00:00:19.140> uses<00:00:19.890> no<00:00:20.039> Reds<00:00:20.220> in<00:00:20.340> blocks

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
simple design uses no Reds in blocks

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.160 
simple design uses no Reds in blocks
over<00:00:20.840> so<00:00:21.859> what<00:00:22.859> it<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.840> these<00:00:24.840> are<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
over so what it is is these are the

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.290 
over so what it is is these are the
outputs<00:00:25.320> down<00:00:25.769> here<00:00:26.010> if<00:00:26.220> there's<00:00:26.820> mine<00:00:27.000> cart

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
outputs down here if there's mine cart

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.560 
outputs down here if there's mine cart
in<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:28.230> position<00:00:28.410> there<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> one<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.090> put

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
in that position there is a one I put

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.700 
in that position there is a one I put
something<00:00:30.840> down<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:32.009> rolls<00:00:32.250> up<00:00:32.369> there<00:00:33.710> and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
something down to it rolls up there and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.430 
something down to it rolls up there and
it<00:00:34.860> rolls<00:00:35.070> into<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.309> one<00:00:35.460> position<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.270> that

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
it rolls into the one position so that

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.680 
it rolls into the one position so that
counts<00:00:37.440> as<00:00:37.680> one<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:39.090> fits<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.510> 2

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
counts as one and that fits in the 2

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.869 
counts as one and that fits in the 2
position<00:00:39.899> is<00:00:40.410> two<00:00:40.860> and<00:00:41.219> then<00:00:41.370> 4<00:00:41.700> 8<00:00:42.600> 16<00:00:42.989> 32<00:00:43.320> and

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 
position is two and then 4 8 16 32 and

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.350 
position is two and then 4 8 16 32 and
then<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.000> goes<00:00:45.120> up<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.510> 4<00:00:45.750> million<00:00:46.530> one<00:00:46.890> hundred

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
then it goes up to 4 million one hundred

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.970 
then it goes up to 4 million one hundred
4204<00:00:50.180> very<00:00:51.180> big<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.379> by<00:00:52.559> far<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.800> biggest

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
4204 very big it is by far the biggest

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.930 
4204 very big it is by far the biggest
on<00:00:53.489> YouTube<00:00:54.449> well<00:00:55.050> but<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.219> one<00:00:56.399> I've<00:00:56.550> seen<00:00:56.789> in

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
on YouTube well but the one I've seen in

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.689 
on YouTube well but the one I've seen in
the<00:00:57.030> rain<00:00:57.980> so<00:00:58.980> what<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.280> do<00:00:59.370> at<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.609> moment

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
the rain so what you do at the moment

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.250 
the rain so what you do at the moment
there's<00:00:59.940> nothing<00:01:00.180> in<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.359> output<00:01:00.660> section<00:01:00.870> so

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
there's nothing in the output section so

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.660 
there's nothing in the output section so
the<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.739> zero<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.789> what<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.780> do<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.280> 0<00:01:05.280> plus<00:01:05.489> 1

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
the is zero so what you do is 0 plus 1

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.910 
the is zero so what you do is 0 plus 1
so<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.119> use<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.390> add<00:01:06.510> one<00:01:06.750> station<00:01:07.140> thought

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
so you use the add one station thought

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.550 
so you use the add one station thought
oh<00:01:07.950> my<00:01:08.130> god<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.610> add<00:01:08.909> one<00:01:10.369> rolls<00:01:11.369> down<00:01:11.670> there

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
oh my god that add one rolls down there

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.580 
oh my god that add one rolls down there
so<00:01:13.560> 0<00:01:13.830> plus<00:01:13.860> one<00:01:14.189> equals<00:01:14.670> one<00:01:14.909> obviously<00:01:15.780> but

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
so 0 plus one equals one obviously but

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:24.140 
so 0 plus one equals one obviously but
now<00:01:16.830> if<00:01:17.310> i<00:01:17.490> add<00:01:18.530> one<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:20.159> one<00:01:22.670> they<00:01:23.670> rolls<00:01:23.909> down

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
now if i add one to one they rolls down

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:42.980 
now if i add one to one they rolls down
there<00:01:24.330> oh<00:01:27.680> sorry<00:01:30.170> bait<00:01:31.170> I'll<00:01:31.470> do<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:31.950> again

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:02:04.530 

so<00:01:43.990> one<00:01:51.270> add<00:01:52.410> one<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:03.520> rolls<00:02:03.820> up<00:02:04.030> there<00:02:04.270> to

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
so one add one that rolls up there to

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.310 
so one add one that rolls up there to
the<00:02:04.570> add<00:02:04.720> to<00:02:04.930> section<00:02:05.410> falls<00:02:06.160> down<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:07.630> rolls

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
the add to section falls down and rolls

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.420 
the add to section falls down and rolls
it's<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.489> two<00:02:09.670> so<00:02:10.209> one<00:02:10.450> plus<00:02:10.600> one<00:02:10.750> makes<00:02:11.260> two<00:02:11.440> and

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
it's a two so one plus one makes two and

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:23.820 
it's a two so one plus one makes two and
then<00:02:12.970> I<00:02:14.459> can<00:02:15.459> do<00:02:15.670> try<00:02:16.540> add<00:02:16.780> two<00:02:17.200> to<00:02:17.260> two<00:02:22.830> that

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
then I can do try add two to two that

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.699 
then I can do try add two to two that
one<00:02:24.100> goes<00:02:24.550> to<00:02:25.090> bin<00:02:25.840> if<00:02:26.140> you<00:02:26.260> don't<00:02:26.440> need<00:02:26.590> it

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
one goes to bin if you don't need it

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.310 
one goes to bin if you don't need it
that<00:02:26.860> goes<00:02:27.040> out<00:02:27.190> for<00:02:27.430> section<00:02:27.880> this<00:02:28.570> spin<00:02:28.959> here

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
that goes out for section this spin here

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.449 
that goes out for section this spin here
is<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:30.310> knob<00:02:31.209> bit<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:32.200> don't<00:02:32.380> need<00:02:32.500> that<00:02:32.560> you

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
is a knob bit you don't need that you

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.860 
is a knob bit you don't need that you
know<00:02:33.520> you<00:02:33.910> can<00:02:34.060> just<00:02:34.090> block<00:02:34.330> that<00:02:34.510> if<00:02:34.720> you

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
know you can just block that if you

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.120 
know you can just block that if you
don't<00:02:35.170> want<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.350> lose<00:02:35.530> your<00:02:35.680> mind<00:02:35.800> collapse

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
don't want to lose your mind collapse

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.130 
don't want to lose your mind collapse
but<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:36.610> have<00:02:36.910> unlimited<00:02:37.090> supply<00:02:37.660> of<00:02:37.690> them<00:02:37.989> so

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
but I have unlimited supply of them so

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.410 
but I have unlimited supply of them so
doesn't<00:02:38.380> matter<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:39.670> this<00:02:39.790> one<00:02:39.940> anyway<00:02:40.150> goes

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
doesn't matter so this one anyway goes

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.449 
doesn't matter so this one anyway goes
down<00:02:40.660> to<00:02:40.780> here<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.110> then<00:02:41.170> you've<00:02:41.799> got<00:02:41.980> four

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
down to here and then you've got four

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:45.509 
down to here and then you've got four
tickets<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.360> because<00:02:43.630> fall<00:02:43.840> and<00:02:44.519> basically

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:45.519 
tickets to because fall and basically

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.240 
tickets to because fall and basically
it's<00:02:45.880> same<00:02:46.269> design<00:02:46.600> /<00:02:47.019> throughout<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.040> whole

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
it's same design / throughout the whole

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.590 
it's same design / throughout the whole
thing<00:02:50.580> repeated<00:02:51.580> quite<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.820> long<00:02:52.180> number<00:02:52.420> of

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
thing repeated quite a long number of

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.460 
thing repeated quite a long number of

+ 4 million 10 93,000 won a nice 4000
dream<00:03:12.840> therefore<00:03:13.700> it<00:03:14.840> is<00:03:15.840> too<00:03:16.830> big<00:03:17.129> because

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
dream therefore it is too big because

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.430 
dream therefore it is too big because
that<00:03:17.670> goes<00:03:17.879> to<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.120> bin<00:03:18.360> all<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.049> way<00:03:19.200> down

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
that goes to the bin all the way down

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.229 
that goes to the bin all the way down
there<00:03:19.650> but<00:03:20.159> this<00:03:20.310> one<00:03:20.340> goes<00:03:20.610> the<00:03:20.760> overflow

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
there but this one goes the overflow

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.500 
there but this one goes the overflow
section<00:03:21.720> as<00:03:22.159> it<00:03:23.159> is<00:03:23.340> double<00:03:23.700> that<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:24.180> flow<00:03:24.480> is

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
section as it is double that the flow is

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.479 
section as it is double that the flow is
double<00:03:24.959> what<00:03:24.989> that<00:03:25.290> number<00:03:25.409> is<00:03:25.620> but<00:03:26.129> it<00:03:26.280> could

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
double what that number is but it could

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.039 
double what that number is but it could
be<00:03:26.610> more<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.060> so<00:03:27.480> I<00:03:27.720> just<00:03:28.079> put<00:03:28.140> overflowed<00:03:28.680> and

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
be more and so I just put overflowed and

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.520 
be more and so I just put overflowed and
if<00:03:31.049> you<00:03:31.170> want<00:03:31.349> to<00:03:31.409> do<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.799> number<00:03:32.190> other<00:03:32.489> than<00:03:32.640> a

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
if you want to do a number other than a

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.869 
if you want to do a number other than a
number<00:03:34.530> double<00:03:35.069> the<00:03:35.190> previous<00:03:35.370> number<00:03:35.730> like

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
number double the previous number like

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.979 
number double the previous number like
let's<00:03:36.150> say<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.360> wanted<00:03:36.599> to<00:03:36.720> do<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.319> number<00:03:37.590> 31

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
let's say you wanted to do the number 31

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.900 
let's say you wanted to do the number 31
31<00:03:39.989> I<00:03:40.500> know<00:03:40.799> from<00:03:41.129> experience<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.959> 16<00:03:42.959> plus<00:03:43.910> 8

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
31 I know from experience is 16 plus 8

00:03:44.910 --> 00:04:01.520 
31 I know from experience is 16 plus 8
plus<00:03:46.010> 4<00:03:47.010> plus<00:03:54.530> 2

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:09.630 

plus<00:04:02.530> one<00:04:04.260> that<00:04:05.260> shows<00:04:05.500> a<00:04:05.530> number<00:04:05.709> 31<00:04:07.680> it's<00:04:08.680> you

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
plus one that shows a number 31 it's you

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.520 
plus one that shows a number 31 it's you
can<00:04:09.760> add<00:04:09.850> part<00:04:10.060> with<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.240> calculator<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:11.020> think

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
can add part with the calculator I think

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.949 
can add part with the calculator I think
it<00:04:11.650> does<00:04:11.770> so<00:04:14.280> then<00:04:15.359> because<00:04:16.359> basically<00:04:16.600> all

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
it does so then because basically all

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.479 
it does so then because basically all
the<00:04:17.079> numbers<00:04:17.470> previous<00:04:17.890> to<00:04:18.010> a<00:04:18.040> number<00:04:18.250> add<00:04:18.370> up

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
the numbers previous to a number add up

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.430 
the numbers previous to a number add up
to<00:04:18.640> one<00:04:18.820> less<00:04:19.090> than<00:04:19.329> that<00:04:19.450> number<00:04:19.630> but<00:04:20.200> I<00:04:20.290> can

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
to one less than that number but I can

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.440 
to one less than that number but I can
prove<00:04:20.650> this<00:04:21.780> by<00:04:22.780> adding<00:04:22.900> one<00:04:23.260> to<00:04:23.530> that<00:04:24.370> 231<00:04:24.970> we

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
prove this by adding one to that 231 we

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.720 
prove this by adding one to that 231 we
should<00:04:25.660> make<00:04:25.690> those<00:04:25.960> two<00:04:26.260> so<00:04:26.560> i'll<00:04:27.370> go<00:04:27.550> and

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
should make those two so i'll go and

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.210 
should make those two so i'll go and
bond<00:04:27.970> to<00:04:28.120> it<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:29.710> this<00:04:29.830> will<00:04:29.950> start<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.190> chain

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
bond to it and this will start a chain

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.150 
bond to it and this will start a chain
reaction<00:04:30.460> going<00:04:31.290> that<00:04:32.290> goes<00:04:32.470> the<00:04:32.740> mountain

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
reaction going that goes the mountain

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.600 
reaction going that goes the mountain
goats<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.520> bin<00:04:33.730> down<00:04:34.270> go<00:04:34.540> to<00:04:34.600> add<00:04:34.780> to<00:04:34.990> section

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
goats the bin down go to add to section

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.840 
goats the bin down go to add to section
now<00:04:36.610> it<00:04:36.669> falls<00:04:36.910> down<00:04:37.090> that<00:04:38.190> mountain<00:04:39.190> goes<00:04:39.340> to

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
now it falls down that mountain goes to

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.090 
now it falls down that mountain goes to
the<00:04:39.940> ad<00:04:40.060> to<00:04:40.720> section<00:04:41.200> that<00:04:41.350> goes<00:04:41.530> to<00:04:41.740> add<00:04:41.830> 4

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
the ad to section that goes to add 4

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:47.130 
the ad to section that goes to add 4
section<00:04:42.550> that<00:04:43.360> foods<00:04:43.600> done<00:04:43.840> man<00:04:44.080> and<00:04:46.140> this

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:47.140 
section that foods done man and this

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.210 
section that foods done man and this
will<00:04:47.650> keep<00:04:48.100> repeating<00:04:48.580> itself<00:04:49.020> until<00:04:50.100> it<00:04:51.100> is

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
will keep repeating itself until it is

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:58.650 
will keep repeating itself until it is
done<00:04:53.910> so<00:04:54.910> then<00:04:55.090> it's<00:04:55.390> adding<00:04:55.690> 8<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:57.600> yeah<00:04:58.600> you

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
done so then it's adding 8 and yeah you

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.320 
done so then it's adding 8 and yeah you
can<00:04:59.050> see<00:04:59.260> these<00:04:59.380> are<00:04:59.440> being<00:05:00.010> emptied<00:05:03.150> it<00:05:04.150> is<00:05:04.300> a

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
can see these are being emptied it is a

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.360 
can see these are being emptied it is a
little<00:05:04.510> bit<00:05:04.720> slow<00:05:04.960> I<00:05:05.229> mean<00:05:05.410> obviously<00:05:05.650> your

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
little bit slow I mean obviously your

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.000 
little bit slow I mean obviously your
normal<00:05:06.640> calculator<00:05:07.090> would<00:05:07.240> be<00:05:07.390> a<00:05:07.419> lot<00:05:07.570> faster

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
normal calculator would be a lot faster

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.380 
normal calculator would be a lot faster
but<00:05:09.010> then<00:05:09.160> it<00:05:09.340> is<00:05:09.490> a<00:05:09.520> computer's<00:05:10.210> our

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
but then it is a computer's our

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.960 
but then it is a computer's our
calculator<00:05:10.810> within<00:05:11.169> their<00:05:11.350> computer<00:05:12.220> so

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:12.970 
calculator within their computer so

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.860 
calculator within their computer so
within<00:05:13.870> the<00:05:14.050> game<00:05:14.490> within<00:05:15.490> a<00:05:15.700> computer<00:05:15.880> so

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
within the game within a computer so

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.900 
within the game within a computer so
let's<00:05:17.080> see<00:05:17.229> so<00:05:17.560> 31<00:05:18.010> plus<00:05:18.310> one<00:05:18.490> makes<00:05:18.640> 32<00:05:19.060> and

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
let's see so 31 plus one makes 32 and

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.270 
let's see so 31 plus one makes 32 and
this<00:05:21.910> were<00:05:22.510> all<00:05:23.140> the<00:05:23.350> way<00:05:23.440> along<00:05:23.560> matter<00:05:24.100> how

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
this were all the way along matter how

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.710 
this were all the way along matter how
many<00:05:24.370> numbers<00:05:24.729> there<00:05:24.880> are<00:05:25.030> obviously<00:05:25.600> will

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
many numbers there are obviously will

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.810 
many numbers there are obviously will
take<00:05:25.840> longer<00:05:26.050> more<00:05:26.440> numbers<00:05:26.710> there<00:05:26.860> are<00:05:26.950> but

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 
take longer more numbers there are but

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.610 
take longer more numbers there are but
it<00:05:27.970> will<00:05:28.060> work<00:05:28.240> will<00:05:28.390> wait<00:05:28.510> along<00:05:28.840> all<00:05:29.350> along

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
it will work will wait along all along

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.340 
it will work will wait along all along
and<00:05:29.890> it<00:05:30.130> is<00:05:30.479> it's<00:05:31.479> pretty<00:05:31.690> cool<00:05:31.840> think<00:05:32.140> taking

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
and it is it's pretty cool think taking

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.140 
and it is it's pretty cool think taking
quite<00:05:32.590> a<00:05:32.650> long<00:05:32.770> time<00:05:32.800> to<00:05:33.220> build<00:05:33.370> iono

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
quite a long time to build iono

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:35.790 
quite a long time to build iono
