00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.530
 hello, I'm frames , new manager, today 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.460
 I 'll explain a little how 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.960
 the products work 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.960
 they are wood stoves 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.420
 double combustion has a system that 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.910
 they burn all the gases and all the smoke does not 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.820
 long smell 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.010
 they are more effective than another type of 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.840
 systems here I will show you the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.180
 inside of the fire box of the 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.020
 multifunction this is one of the first 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.020
 products that we made 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.960
 fire is inside 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.640
 in the first stage all the 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.840
 line 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.120
 and the smoke when it goes in the direction towards 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.790
 the print output that is on this to 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.670
 this height is mixed with air 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.739
 secondary that enters by the sides and 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.350
 comes out through these holes when mixed with 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.900
 the secondary air is generated the second 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.019
 combustion this means that it turns on 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.570
 fire the smoke for this reason do not largan 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:10.270
 smell and the performance is higher because 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.540
 we get performance from the heat of the fire 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.080
 of wood and fire generated by the 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.940
 smoke in the second combustion 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.400
 this model that is the first thing that 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:24.210
 we did can come with the optional 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.760
 serpentine the serpentine can heat 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.490
 water for this other accessory that is a 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.200
 hot water tank an intermediate hot water tank 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.840
 then while having the stove 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.760
 on hot water can generate 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.130
 The hot water tank is a closed circuit 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.370
 that comes the water from the thermostat passes 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.110
 by the serpentine and by thermosyphon 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.620
 circulate generating hot water for use 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.580
 domestic 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.870
 the great difference of the fire box 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:54.690
 of combustion new that is that it is made 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:58.090
 completely with refractory bricks 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:00.220
 this gives it greater caloric inertia and makes 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.890
 that the combustion temperature is 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.370
 greater whereby the combustion 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:11.020
 secondary is this system more complete 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:14.980
 it is said to be ecological because 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:17.739
 emits less carbon monoxide 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.870
 we did some tests in the inti and gave 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.730
 we are four times below the 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.930
 Canadian emissions standard 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.200
 carbon monoxide this is very good 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.450
 they can feel the issue of 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.530
 of wood heating is ecological 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.530
 because it 's a fuel 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.350
 that is sustainable renewable can not 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.400
 forest and can generate energy with 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.610
 wood in a sustainable way 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.459
 this is the primary entry regulator 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.220
 is the regulator between the primary that 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.620
 enter here above the glass and that 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.349
 It also serves to clean it 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.120
 glass is a glass ceramic of origin 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.819
 German in the only thing imported from the 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.790
 stove that can hold up to 750 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.790
 degrees does not break with the heat 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:11.410
 and it is the safest thing for this 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.090
 type of stoves has a cord of the 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.020
 door has a ceramic fiber cord 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:21.630
 which also supports more than 800 degrees and 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.670
 which makes the door close better 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.800
 this that the sheet metal against the sheet if not 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.220
 touch the cord against the front this 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.410
 It makes it watertight although it is not 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.730
 essential that air does not enter because 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.810
 a combustion has to always enter 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.110
 air 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.440
 this stove with oven without burners if 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.239
 can be used to cook on the lid or 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.610
 to bake in the same fire box 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:49.390
 once the fire is consumed the 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:53.190
 embers are put to one side 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.560
 and it can work like a mud oven 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.340
 a source is left if it is going to be done 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.170
 meat or chicken or something that carries more 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.720
 cooking time can be given ember if 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.450
 you're going to make pizzas or some more cooking 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.820
 You can quickly get it out completely 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:12.650
 you're not going to work very well 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.650
 by thermal inertia you keep 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.250
 basically this is the operation of 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.250
 the multifunction
