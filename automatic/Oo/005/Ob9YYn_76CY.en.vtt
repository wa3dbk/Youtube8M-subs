00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.980 
I'm gonna do that is I'm not using
medication<00:00:11.010> this<00:00:11.130> time<00:00:11.400> I'm<00:00:12.269> using<00:00:12.450> some

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
medication this time I'm using some

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.450 
medication this time I'm using some
table<00:00:13.440> salt<00:00:13.759> and<00:00:14.759> I'm<00:00:14.910> gonna<00:00:15.000> take<00:00:15.330> tank<00:00:15.960> water

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
table salt and I'm gonna take tank water

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.859 
table salt and I'm gonna take tank water
30<00:00:17.460> liters<00:00:17.910> I'm<00:00:18.180> gonna<00:00:18.330> put<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.600> into<00:00:18.690> my

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
30 liters I'm gonna put it into my

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.509 
30 liters I'm gonna put it into my
bucket<00:00:19.080> I'm<00:00:20.039> gonna<00:00:20.250> add<00:00:20.460> salt<00:00:21.359> at<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:22.380> dosage<00:00:23.279> of

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
bucket I'm gonna add salt at a dosage of

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.349 
bucket I'm gonna add salt at a dosage of
10<00:00:24.029> grams<00:00:24.330> per<00:00:24.689> liter<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.140> water<00:00:25.350> so<00:00:25.830> by<00:00:26.359> 250

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
10 grams per liter of water so by 250

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.210 
10 grams per liter of water so by 250
grams<00:00:27.630> depending<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.410> much<00:00:28.590> water<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.920> take<00:00:29.099> it

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
grams depending so much water I take it

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.870 
grams depending so much water I take it
exactly<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:30.260> what<00:00:31.260> that<00:00:31.470> does<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:32.640> it's

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
exactly and what that does is it's

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.979 
exactly and what that does is it's
called<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.360> salt<00:00:34.320> dip<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.540> basically<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.840> high

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
called a salt dip and basically the high

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.340 
called a salt dip and basically the high
concentration<00:00:37.260> of<00:00:37.739> salt<00:00:38.780> kills<00:00:39.780> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
concentration of salt kills the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.889 
concentration of salt kills the
pathogens<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:44.090> so<00:00:45.090> much<00:00:45.420> like<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.780> would

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
pathogens that so much like you would

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.920 
pathogens that so much like you would
take<00:00:46.110> saltwater<00:00:46.890> fish<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.610> mean<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.030> fresh<00:00:48.629> water

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
take saltwater fish I mean I fresh water

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.279 
take saltwater fish I mean I fresh water
dip<00:00:49.610> because<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.879> pathogens<00:00:51.329> on<00:00:51.539> them<00:00:51.750> they

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
dip because the pathogens on them they

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.830 
dip because the pathogens on them they
can't<00:00:52.590> stand<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.399> fresh<00:00:53.789> water<00:00:54.059> it's<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
can't stand the fresh water it's the

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.959 
can't stand the fresh water it's the
same<00:00:55.050> thing<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.829> pathogens<00:00:56.309> can't<00:00:56.610> stand

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
same thing but the pathogens can't stand

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.770 
same thing but the pathogens can't stand
the<00:00:57.750> saltwater<00:00:58.520> so<00:00:59.520> leave<00:00:59.789> them<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.090> my<00:01:00.120> bucket

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the saltwater so leave them in my bucket

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.840 
the saltwater so leave them in my bucket

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
them all to the feeding corner and just

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.070 
them all to the feeding corner and just
scooping<00:01:20.759> them<00:01:20.850> up<00:01:20.970> as<00:01:21.330> many<00:01:21.630> other<00:01:21.780> thing<00:01:21.960> as

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080

I can so I call most of the guys in here
doesn't<00:01:26.820> maybe<00:01:27.080> five<00:01:28.080> fish<00:01:28.350> five<00:01:28.920> fish<00:01:29.130> less

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
doesn't maybe five fish five fish less

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.730 
doesn't maybe five fish five fish less
than<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.579> think<00:01:29.930> this<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.170> most<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.500> can<00:01:31.619> get

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
than I think this is the most I can get

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.929 
than I think this is the most I can get
a<00:01:31.799> minute<00:01:32.130> because<00:01:32.430> they're<00:01:32.759> playing<00:01:34.909> so<00:01:35.909> I

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
a minute because they're playing so I

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.520 
a minute because they're playing so I
got<00:01:36.150> them<00:01:36.270> all<00:01:36.420> they're<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.049> here

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
got them all they're in here

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.410 
got them all they're in here
the<00:01:37.710> Moody<00:01:38.009> was<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.220> last<00:01:38.430> one<00:01:38.549> to<00:01:38.759> go<00:01:38.850> in<00:01:38.970> so

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
the Moody was the last one to go in so

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.280 
the Moody was the last one to go in so
he's<00:01:39.750> one<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.140> washed<00:01:40.380> flashes<00:01:41.119> CERN's

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
he's one of the washed flashes CERN's

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.260 
he's one of the washed flashes CERN's
that's<00:01:43.290> fine<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:44.189> he's<00:01:44.520> flashing<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.060> most

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
that's fine but he's flashing the most

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.600 
that's fine but he's flashing the most
so<00:01:45.649> what's<00:01:46.649> going<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.829> happen<00:01:47.159> I'm<00:01:47.250> gonna<00:01:47.430> put

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
so what's going to happen I'm gonna put

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.950 
so what's going to happen I'm gonna put
the<00:01:47.670> rest<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.970> them<00:01:48.090> back<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.299> maybe<00:01:48.750> in<00:01:48.869> the

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
the rest of them back in maybe in the

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.340 
the rest of them back in maybe in the
next<00:01:49.110> ten<00:01:49.409> minutes<00:01:49.549> they<00:01:50.549> all<00:01:50.700> seem<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:50.970> be

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
next ten minutes they all seem to be

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.370 
next ten minutes they all seem to be
doing<00:01:52.350> okay<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:52.829> here<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.990> actually<00:01:54.990> took

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
doing okay in here so I actually took

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.560 
doing okay in here so I actually took
the<00:01:55.560> opportunity<00:01:55.710> washed<00:01:56.549> all<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:56.969> fish<00:01:57.390> were

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
the opportunity washed all the fish were

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.179 
the opportunity washed all the fish were
out<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.380> had<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.530> move<00:01:58.770> some<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.130> rocks

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
out and I had to move some of the rocks

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.620 
out and I had to move some of the rocks
to<00:01:59.520> catch<00:01:59.729> them<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:01.130> do<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> bit<00:02:02.369> of<00:02:02.630> aquascaping
