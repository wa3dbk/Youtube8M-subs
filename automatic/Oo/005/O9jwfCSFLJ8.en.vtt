00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.750
 hello everyone with you android android 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.349
 today wanted to talk to a simulator like 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.150
 called emergency death racing 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.130
 2015 we have to understand lamborghini 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.930
 if I'm not mistaken in us present 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.020
 a certain number of cars that we 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.939
 we can use ourselves but they 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.019
 open only in rows we 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.420
 determine a certain distance then 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.760
 there is so much like we ride 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.880
 kilometers on the first car as well 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.020
 see there are quite a few here therefore 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.460
 will protect you 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.020
 can you open all the others 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.090
 cars so let's go 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.640
 directly to the race itself choose 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.710
 haul car click a drive 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.559
 available three modes free my madrid 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.390
 question ride around the city cuts off fashion 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.010
 it's just certain areas need 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.000
 overcome yes do not take and go on 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.140
 fashion traffic 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.100
 but as you understood it just appear 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.370
 car and others that will 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.080
 get to ride the streets of this city 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.900
 here is our car control 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.950
 left and right gas brake can change 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.930
 the camera is doing more and more 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.530
 than fly no show areas of ours 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.360
 speed 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.340
 automatic transmission and we can like this 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.930
 here to drive and what I liked 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.560
 enough to cool physics like this 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.240
 we can fly we go around the city and funny 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.790
 in the fact that our car is deformed when 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.939
 in touch with excellent objects here 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.900
 watch your watches die and not yet 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.299
 still not hit 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.189
 let's try to drive like this 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.320
 here let's say make it different here 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.350
 slides there which we can with you for 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.399
 them and under shelter code trick here so masha 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.110
 fluorine will crash and fall so here 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.759
 look small we deform not like 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.740
 our car yes you see 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.909
 real so to speak in real time 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.560
 there is a deformation of our car 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.320
 the city itself is certainly not very well made 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.299
 I'll tell you, and as you can see, even when we 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.229
 going to texture nectar manifested 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.860
 quietly gradually denunciation she ride 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.520
 fun 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:11.910
 give food sounds modes there so 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.370
 here let's say the mode so kachek cartoon 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.670
 maybe we're just driving yes that's certain 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:20.310
 you just have to carry them 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.010
 reached went so bumm move 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.210
 and in the last mode who are here 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.370
 present this mode mode mode a 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:31.350
 traffic mod and than a will be just protection 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.270
 car you see now you will see 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.980
 catch up q we can crash into them like this 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.140
 ducks ride like a tank in that sense 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.360
 certainly not realistic so you can 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.400
 bump just demolish them like that 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.200
 that's the way but our car is on the track 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.360
 of course, gradually the idea is formed 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.310
 cool interesting simulator such 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.730
 for it is worse for relax I think myself 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.810
 this 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.580
 and the more so very cool done that 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.370
 the rest of the world is open after 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.990
 cool for a certain distance to on 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.300
 our cars in this sense of course 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.220
 Home game will not drag here 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.400
 let's move on to the pros and cons given 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.580
 the game plus is like an apple like me 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.050
 I think as a surveyor that we are to us 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.140
 we crash our car is deformed 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.630
 it is of course very twist already broke 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.720
 the whole car is quite comfortable 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.870
 management is quite a large number 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.360
 cars minus of course something that is very 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.570
 stupidly made the city itself yes what that 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.730
 it is not clear what and how I understand the city 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.459
 only one therefore it too I consider 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.810
 pull the flaw well come on now this 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.170
 directly to the overall assessment I 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.150
 I put this game three-plus now with 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.800
 you was andrew there before promises you 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.610
 I liked this city 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.650
 curled new 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.650
 and play all bye see you soon
