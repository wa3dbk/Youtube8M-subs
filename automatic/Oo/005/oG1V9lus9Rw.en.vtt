 on 12 and 13 June there will be a referendum I could vote against the rules 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.120
 which led to the privatization of drinking water 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.499

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.470
 and nobody can own 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.340

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.990
 privatize drinking water 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.450
 it means making it a commodity 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.920
 that is, subject it to market laws 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.920
 is the ultimate goal of the market is known 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.740

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.820

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.220
 voting yes to the second question 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.800

 bill 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.050
 voting yes to both questions 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.050
 prevent the water from becoming a commodity 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.070
 voting is a simple gesture 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.970

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.090
