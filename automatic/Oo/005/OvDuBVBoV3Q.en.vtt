but let me just first talk about why

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.389 
but let me just first talk about why
coffee<00:00:36.180> can<00:00:36.719> be<00:00:36.960> good<00:00:37.170> for<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:37.800> then<00:00:38.129> also

one<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.520> biggest<00:00:41.910> reasons<00:00:42.300> why<00:00:42.360> coffee<00:00:42.840> is

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
one of the biggest reasons why coffee is

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.569 
one of the biggest reasons why coffee is
beneficial<00:00:43.710> is<00:00:43.770> because<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:44.190> contains

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
beneficial is because it contains

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.290 
beneficial is because it contains
massive<00:00:45.289> amounts<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.399> antioxidants<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:48.210> you

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
massive amounts of antioxidants and you

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.250 
massive amounts of antioxidants and you
know<00:00:48.420> one<00:00:48.660> of<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.809> things<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.170> we're

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
know one of the things that we're

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.770 
know one of the things that we're
exposed<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:50.039> all<00:00:50.640> around<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.180> world<00:00:51.360> today<00:00:51.510> is

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
exposed to all around the world today is

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.010 
exposed to all around the world today is
this<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.649> large<00:00:52.949> levels<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.520> toxicity<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.570> so

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
this is large levels of toxicity and so

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.619 
this is large levels of toxicity and so
antioxidants<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.129> really<00:00:56.430> help<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.030> slow

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
antioxidants can really help and slow

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.510 
antioxidants can really help and slow
the<00:00:57.780> aging<00:00:57.989> process<00:00:58.260> they<00:00:58.980> can<00:00:59.039> help<00:00:59.309> protect

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
the aging process they can help protect

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.040 
the aging process they can help protect
yourselves<00:01:00.030> against<00:01:00.239> free<00:01:00.449> radical<00:01:00.840> damage

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
yourselves against free radical damage

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.619 
yourselves against free radical damage
and<00:01:01.379> coffee<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.309> actually<00:01:02.489> one<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.059> five

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
and coffee is actually one of the five

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.590 
and coffee is actually one of the five
highest<00:01:04.559> foods<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.360> antioxidants<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
highest foods in antioxidants in the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.140 
highest foods in antioxidants in the
world<00:01:06.810> today<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.200> again<00:01:07.409> coffee<00:01:08.150> incredible

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150

world today so again coffee incredible
in<00:01:09.240> terms<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.570> its<00:01:09.689> antioxidants<00:01:10.439> also<00:01:10.670> coffee

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
in terms of its antioxidants also coffee

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.840 
in terms of its antioxidants also coffee
increases<00:01:12.570> circulation<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.740> can<00:01:14.130> stimulate

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
increases circulation and can stimulate

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.520 
increases circulation and can stimulate
the<00:01:15.030> liver<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.720> actually<00:01:16.080> has<00:01:16.259> maybe

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
the liver so it can actually has maybe

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.219 
the liver so it can actually has maybe
some<00:01:16.770> supportive<00:01:17.280> benefits<00:01:17.729> for<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.939> liver

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
some supportive benefits for the liver

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:20.450 
some supportive benefits for the liver
increases<00:01:19.229> circulation<00:01:19.409> it's<00:01:20.040> been<00:01:20.159> shown<00:01:20.310> to

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
increases circulation it's been shown to

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.550 
increases circulation it's been shown to
improve<00:01:20.759> overall<00:01:21.270> exercise<00:01:21.750> it's<00:01:22.259> been<00:01:22.380> shown

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
improve overall exercise it's been shown

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.240 
improve overall exercise it's been shown
to<00:01:22.710> increase<00:01:23.210> blood<00:01:24.210> flow<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.170> brain<00:01:25.380> so

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
to increase blood flow to the brain so

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.100 
to increase blood flow to the brain so
for<00:01:26.549> those<00:01:26.670> reasons<00:01:26.820> because<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.840> massive

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
for those reasons because of the massive

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.929 
for those reasons because of the massive
amount<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.530> antioxidants<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.460> increase

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
amount of antioxidants and the increase

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.359 
amount of antioxidants and the increase
in<00:01:29.970> circulation<00:01:30.600> that's<00:01:31.409> where<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.770> benefits

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
in circulation that's where the benefits

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.819 
in circulation that's where the benefits

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
really the main issue with coffee is

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.840 
really the main issue with coffee is
that<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.590> will<00:02:19.770> burn<00:02:20.070> out<00:02:20.280> your<00:02:20.430> adrenal

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850

glands<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.120> think<00:02:21.300> about<00:02:21.480> this<00:02:21.660> do<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.200> think

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
glands and think about this do you think

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.820 
glands and think about this do you think
you<00:02:22.740> were<00:02:22.860> created<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.780> rely<00:02:24.780> on<00:02:24.830> stimulants

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
you were created to rely on stimulants

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:26.870 
you were created to rely on stimulants
all<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.130> time<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.460> that's<00:02:26.520> really<00:02:26.700> what

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
all the time and that's really what

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.270 
all the time and that's really what
caffeine<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.510> it's<00:02:27.720> a<00:02:27.810> stimulant<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:29.010> doing

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
caffeine is it's a stimulant so doing

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.880 
caffeine is it's a stimulant so doing
large<00:02:29.580> amounts<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.060> caffeine<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.810> not<00:02:30.840> good<00:02:31.680> at

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
large amounts of caffeine is not good at
