any way accept the fact that I did order

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.439 
any way accept the fact that I did order
a<00:01:00.270> khaki<00:01:00.809> color<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.070> can<00:01:02.219> see<00:01:02.300> to<00:01:03.300> my

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
way of thinking anyway that this hat is

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.090 
way of thinking anyway that this hat is
brown<00:01:05.750> but<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.840> was<00:01:06.960> clearly<00:01:07.260> marked<00:01:07.530> khaki

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
I think the headband is just a little

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.460 
I think the headband is just a little
bit<00:02:57.710> wider<00:02:58.100> than<00:02:58.340> your<00:02:58.730> normal<00:02:58.940> or<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.840> the

than your typical Fedora um but that's a

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.100 
than your typical Fedora um but that's a
good<00:03:06.980> thing<00:03:07.160> for<00:03:07.340> me<00:03:07.520> because<00:03:08.030> it<00:03:08.660> keeps<00:03:08.870> it
