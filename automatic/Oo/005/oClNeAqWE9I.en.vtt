in<00:00:53.160> aluminium<00:00:53.719> because<00:00:54.719> our<00:00:54.870> minions<00:00:55.230> like

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
in aluminium because our minions like

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.720 
in aluminium because our minions like
one<00:00:55.620> of<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.739> easiest<00:00:55.980> managed<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.370> work<00:00:56.520> with

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
one of the easiest managed to work with

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.410 
one of the easiest managed to work with
you<00:00:57.120> have<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.360> use<00:00:57.480> too<00:00:57.660> much<00:00:57.980> brute<00:00:58.980> force<00:00:59.420> so

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
you have to use too much brute force so

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.240 
you have to use too much brute force so
i<00:01:00.449> was<00:01:00.750> going<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.960> kill<00:01:01.500> another<00:01:01.710> aluminium

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
i was going to kill another aluminium

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.500 
i was going to kill another aluminium
shape<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.270> then<00:01:03.619> finish<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.650> basically<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.479> i

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
shape and then finish it basically so i

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.940 
shape and then finish it basically so i
guess<00:01:06.840> i<00:01:06.960> could<00:01:07.020> show<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.320> guys<00:01:07.500> would<00:01:07.860> have

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
guess i could show you guys would have

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.630 
guess i could show you guys would have
done<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.310> far<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:09.260> was<00:01:10.260> thinking<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.680> one<00:01:11.610> other

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
done so far I was thinking and one other

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.690 
done so far I was thinking and one other
thing<00:01:11.850> I'm<00:01:12.030> doing<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.770> he's<00:01:13.770> got<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.010> mechanical

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
thing I'm doing is he's got a mechanical

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.080 
thing I'm doing is he's got a mechanical
arm<00:01:14.820> so<00:01:15.150> you<00:01:15.210> could<00:01:15.330> keep<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.780> mind<00:01:15.960> like

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
arm so you could keep that in mind like

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.600 
arm so you could keep that in mind like
like<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.330> you're<00:01:18.479> making<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.049> arm<00:01:19.610> there's

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
like if you're making the arm there's

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.760 
like if you're making the arm there's
only<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.000> certain<00:01:21.210> amount<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.780> can<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.650> know

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
only a certain amount you can you know

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.880 
only a certain amount you can you know
make<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.310> without<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.820> stunned<00:01:24.570> me<00:01:24.890> not

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
make it without it stunned me not

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.580 
make it without it stunned me not
working<00:01:26.340> because<00:01:26.840> he's<00:01:27.840> got<00:01:28.020> too<00:01:28.170> much<00:01:28.229> metal

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
working because he's got too much metal

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.260 
working because he's got too much metal
on<00:01:28.799> his<00:01:28.920> arms<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.369> stuff<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:29.939> can't

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
on his arms and stuff so you can't

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.719 
on his arms and stuff so you can't
really<00:01:30.329> have<00:01:31.259> anything<00:01:31.439> with<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.829> same<00:01:32.100> where

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
really have anything with the same where

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.850 
really have anything with the same where
you<00:01:32.820> could<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.299> i'll<00:01:33.420> just<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:34.320> extremely

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
would have minimal movement like you

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.200 
would have minimal movement like you
talking<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.979> our<00:01:38.070> palms<00:01:38.340> metal<00:01:38.729> so<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.090> will

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
talking to our palms metal so you will

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.520 
talking to our palms metal so you will
be<00:01:39.240> able<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.450> move<00:01:39.540> your<00:01:39.689> tongue<00:01:39.840> like<00:01:40.350> that

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530

going to be
the<00:01:54.470> shoulder<00:01:55.210> these<00:01:56.210> bits<00:01:56.420> here<00:01:59.590> so<00:02:00.590> that's

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:00.770 
the shoulder these bits here so that's

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.070 
the shoulder these bits here so that's
the<00:02:01.220> shot<00:02:01.400> bit<00:02:01.670> they<00:02:02.060> got<00:02:02.210> like<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.510> spikes<00:02:02.840> on

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
the shot bit they got like the spikes on

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.860 
the shot bit they got like the spikes on
a<00:02:03.700> kind<00:02:04.700> of<00:02:04.790> hard<00:02:04.970> to<00:02:05.060> tell<00:02:05.150> because<00:02:05.510> I've<00:02:05.690> only

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
a kind of hard to tell because I've only

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.570 
a kind of hard to tell because I've only
got<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.170> pieces<00:02:06.590> cut<00:02:06.830> out<00:02:06.979> to<00:02:07.190> other<00:02:07.340> nearly

put them together have i anyway so yeah
this<00:02:10.789> is<00:02:10.970> another<00:02:11.209> bit<00:02:11.390> and<00:02:11.570> they'll

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
this is another bit and they'll

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.130 
this is another bit and they'll
basically<00:02:13.660> sit<00:02:14.709> formal<00:02:15.709> with<00:02:15.980> each<00:02:16.100> other<00:02:17.140> get

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
basically sit formal with each other get

00:05:31.359 --> 00:05:31.369 
so I've just got to kind of figure out a

00:05:31.369 --> 00:05:32.889 
so I've just got to kind of figure out a
way<00:05:31.519> to<00:05:31.579> have<00:05:31.819> them<00:05:31.939> stuck<00:05:32.209> on<00:05:32.360> each<00:05:32.479> knuckle

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:32.899 
way to have them stuck on each knuckle

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:35.439 
way to have them stuck on each knuckle
cuz<00:05:33.469> I'll<00:05:33.559> senior<00:05:33.889> like<00:05:34.009> maybe<00:05:34.879> a<00:05:34.999> bit<00:05:35.360> of

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:35.449 
cuz I'll senior like maybe a bit of

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:36.909 
cuz I'll senior like maybe a bit of
sheet<00:05:35.629> metal<00:05:35.749> and<00:05:35.989> then<00:05:36.139> then<00:05:36.319> stuck<00:05:36.589> on<00:05:36.739> top

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
sheet metal and then then stuck on top

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:38.859 
sheet metal and then then stuck on top
of<00:05:37.039> it<00:05:37.159> but<00:05:37.579> then<00:05:37.759> without<00:05:38.059> or<00:05:38.300> move<00:05:38.479> at<00:05:38.629> once

00:05:38.859 --> 00:05:38.869 
of it but then without or move at once

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:42.369 
of it but then without or move at once
which<00:05:39.379> can<00:05:39.649> it<00:05:40.309> would<00:05:40.489> work<00:05:40.639> but<00:05:41.050> maybe<00:05:42.050> just<00:05:42.289> a

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:42.379 
which can it would work but maybe just a

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:44.109 
which can it would work but maybe just a
little<00:05:42.469> bit<00:05:42.589> sankar<00:05:43.369> so<00:05:43.610> can<00:05:43.819> move<00:05:43.939> each

00:05:44.109 --> 00:05:44.119 
little bit sankar so can move each

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:45.759 
little bit sankar so can move each
knuckle<00:05:44.389> can<00:05:44.629> move<00:05:44.779> separately<00:05:45.050> with<00:05:45.409> my<00:05:45.529> hand

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:45.769 
knuckle can move separately with my hand

00:05:45.769 --> 00:05:52.749 
knuckle can move separately with my hand
a<00:05:46.389> bit<00:05:47.389> of<00:05:47.509> star<00:05:48.409> oh<00:05:48.739> yeah<00:05:49.159> that's<00:05:49.369> that<00:05:50.110> is<00:05:51.759> and

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:52.759 
a bit of star oh yeah that's that is and
