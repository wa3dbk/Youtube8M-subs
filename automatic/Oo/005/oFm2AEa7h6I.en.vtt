00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.710
 good guys if you want to learn how to do 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.849
 these cookies stay to watch the video 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:18.060
 the ingredients that we are going to need 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:21.600
 they will be butter a handbag 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.150
 brown sugar vanilla essence 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.189
 white sugar an egg and yeast 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.680
 The first thing we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:33.010
 catch a cup in my case is a cup of 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.090
 coffee and let's take two full 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.070
 above flour 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.960
 for the moment maybe after 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.110
 we need more but at the moment we are going to 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.380
 throw only two after we're going to take a 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.630
 teaspoon of yeast me in my case 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.200
 I use the royal and we are going to integrate it 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.200
 All very well 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.140
 once everything is mixed let's take 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.810
 another bowl and with the same cup as before 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.170
 let's also fill it up 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.750
 butter we throw it after we go to 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.700
 pour half a cup of white sugar and one 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.700
 whole cup of brown sugar 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.970
 and we will beat everything right so 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.970
 that is completely integrated 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.390
 once we have it with this texture 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.130
 creamy let's add the egg and 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.840
 we are going to beat everything again until 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.840
 is with a more liquid texture 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.670
 then we are going to add the 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.920
 vanilla essence that more or less to 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.540
 taste as you see I give it a spoonful 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.540
 and we are going to remove again 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.780
 Once our mix is ​​ready we will 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.659
 take a sieve or a sieve 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.170
 hairnet and we will add little by little 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:01.590
 the mixture of flour and yeast to our 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.390
 liquid mixture remember that you have to 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.090
 go adding little by little so you do not 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.340
 form lumps and what to sift is 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.120
 optional but I like to do it 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:19.379
 to make it look more spongy and more 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:22.620
 delicious once we have this mixture 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.269
 thicker bud of ávila than as I have 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.160
 said previous so that I stay like this 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.560
 having to add one more cup of 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.739
 flour 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.230
 we are going to throw you last ema 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.930
 names that is also a little to likes and 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.329
 I ended up throwing the whole bag 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.090
 and we're going to mix everything up very well 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.569
 that are integrated and have all the mass 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.749
 quite 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:48.870
 amount of magnetto and finally we go 

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:51.930
 to take a tray from the oven and let's 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.299
 preheat the oven to 175 degrees and 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.849
 helping us with two spoons or hands 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.799
 if we do not let them off so keep them 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.530
 well washed 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:03.209
 let's go putting the mixture in 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.799
 little circles in the tray is not necessary 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.590
 that the a planet because once in the 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:12.050
 oven are going down so we're going to 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.850
 put dough spheres in the tray 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.470
 along each tray leaving a 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.910
 some space between them because they 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.910
 they make great in the oven 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.240
 Once the oven is ready we will 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.790
 put them inside we are going to leave you 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.710
 about 10 minutes or so until 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.710
 see that they are golden above 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.440
 once out of the tray we are going to 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.560
 let them cool down a bit because as 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.270
 You see they are pretty soft but they 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.660
 hardens at once cold so no 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:04.050
 nothing happens and in the meantime I will go 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:08.340
 making another tray and putting it in the 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.530
 oven and all this is mixed has 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.510
 given to me for three whole trays and 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.459
 by the way if you are going to use a 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.200
 tray of these like mine put a 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:20.040
 paper underneath because if you do not look at what 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:23.040
 Passes stays stuck once they are hard 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.740
 and it costs life to take them out and they break and 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:27.990
 marie so look how pretty leaves the 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.540
 tray so if you do not want to give that 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.790
 joy to your mother rather a 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.560
 disgust puts of a paper of coheed of 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.380
 kitchen downstairs as you see in this 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.780
 tray and you will see how well they take off 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.200
 See if you can catch up with 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.200
 hand 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.819
 and finally he saw me also as I have 

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:54.529
 said before to make another tray I made 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:54.529
 2 giant cookies 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.260
