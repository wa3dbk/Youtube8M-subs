Yosemite<00:04:42.020> Valley<00:04:43.060> oven<00:04:44.060> chef

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.170 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.680 

we're<00:04:59.170> hoping<00:04:59.560> to<00:04:59.830> capture<00:05:00.270> that<00:05:01.270> that

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
we're hoping to capture that that

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.950 
we're hoping to capture that that
fleeting<00:05:02.560> moment<00:05:03.100> when<00:05:03.880> nature<00:05:04.330> kind<00:05:04.810> of

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
fleeting moment when nature kind of

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.450 
fleeting moment when nature kind of
comes<00:05:05.140> together<00:05:05.320> and<00:05:05.770> produces<00:05:06.280> something

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
comes together and produces something

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.020 
comes together and produces something
spectacular<00:05:07.390> I<00:05:07.930> think<00:05:08.440> if<00:05:09.340> the<00:05:09.610> sunlight

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
spectacular I think if the sunlight

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.940 
spectacular I think if the sunlight
cooperates<00:05:10.630> and<00:05:10.930> the<00:05:10.990> clouds<00:05:11.230> don't<00:05:11.500> come<00:05:11.770> in

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
cooperates and the clouds don't come in

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.740 
cooperates and the clouds don't come in
we<00:05:12.160> could<00:05:12.370> we<00:05:12.880> could<00:05:13.030> have<00:05:13.150> something<00:05:13.420> that'll

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
we could we could have something that'll

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.050 
we could we could have something that'll
be<00:05:13.960> really<00:05:14.170> special<00:05:14.790> trying<00:05:15.790> to<00:05:15.910> photograph

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
be really special trying to photograph

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.880 
be really special trying to photograph

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
year you know the changing water flow

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.320 
year you know the changing water flow
from<00:05:25.540> the<00:05:25.690> snowpack<00:05:26.080> and<00:05:26.320> the<00:05:26.380> temperature

from the snowpack and the temperature
only<00:05:28.330> occurs<00:05:28.660> in<00:05:28.840> February<00:05:29.350> for<00:05:30.040> two-week

year<00:05:34.540> it<00:05:35.080> depends<00:05:35.770> on<00:05:35.890> if<00:05:36.010> there's<00:05:36.220> water

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
year it depends on if there's water

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.000 
year it depends on if there's water
flowing<00:05:37.000> if<00:05:37.150> you've<00:05:37.960> got<00:05:38.080> a<00:05:38.110> nice<00:05:38.320> clear<00:05:38.680> sky

if you have any clouds or any fog you
won't<00:05:42.730> get<00:05:42.940> this<00:05:43.140> so<00:05:44.140> you<00:05:44.200> may<00:05:44.410> miss<00:05:44.620> it<00:05:44.770> for

as<00:05:47.770> a<00:05:47.830> photographer<00:05:48.400> you<00:05:48.490> learn<00:05:48.640> more<00:05:48.820> about

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
as a photographer you learn more about

as a photographer you learn more about
weather<00:05:50.350> than<00:05:50.800> anything<00:05:51.760> else<00:05:52.060> and<00:05:52.360> just

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
weather than anything else and just

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.240 
weather than anything else and just
looking<00:05:53.020> at<00:05:53.110> this<00:05:53.350> I'm<00:05:53.620> hoping<00:05:53.830> that<00:05:54.130> it

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
looking at this I'm hoping that it

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.940 
looking at this I'm hoping that it
doesn't<00:05:54.810> you<00:05:55.810> know<00:05:55.900> get<00:05:56.110> any<00:05:56.260> more<00:05:56.440> occluded

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:56.950 
doesn't you know get any more occluded

Capitan that light source will will

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.770 
Capitan that light source will will
start<00:06:08.890> to<00:06:09.190> shrink<00:06:09.370> in<00:06:09.730> and<00:06:09.970> just<00:06:10.210> hit<00:06:10.420> the<00:06:10.570> fire

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
start to shrink in and just hit the fire

water to glow yellow orange red makes it

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.490 
water to glow yellow orange red makes it
look<00:06:17.140> like<00:06:17.290> lava<00:06:17.530> that<00:06:18.300> makes<00:06:19.300> the<00:06:20.290> picture

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:20.500 
look like lava that makes the picture

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.530 
look like lava that makes the picture
very<00:06:20.860> especially<00:06:21.460> if<00:06:21.550> you<00:06:21.670> can<00:06:21.880> take<00:06:22.240> a<00:06:22.270> good

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
very especially if you can take a good

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.840 
very especially if you can take a good
pictures<00:06:22.930> because<00:06:23.680> is<00:06:23.890> that<00:06:23.950> nothing<00:06:24.520> to<00:06:24.700> do

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
pictures because is that nothing to do

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.700 
pictures because is that nothing to do
with<00:06:25.060> your<00:06:25.270> technique<00:06:25.690> or<00:06:26.080> with<00:06:26.350> anything

with your technique or with anything

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.050 
with your technique or with anything
it's<00:06:27.040> just

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:31.060 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:35.550 

well<00:06:31.569> the<00:06:32.229> luck<00:06:33.449> you<00:06:34.449> sit<00:06:34.690> here<00:06:34.960> and<00:06:35.110> you<00:06:35.259> watch

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
well the luck you sit here and you watch

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.879 
well the luck you sit here and you watch
this<00:06:35.919> gray<00:06:36.400> and<00:06:36.850> silver<00:06:37.210> and<00:06:37.690> white<00:06:38.319> and

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889 
this gray and silver and white and

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:42.930 
this gray and silver and white and
pretty<00:06:39.250> soon<00:06:39.550> a<00:06:40.110> little<00:06:41.110> pink<00:06:41.380> comes<00:06:41.680> up<00:06:41.949> and

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
pretty soon a little pink comes up and

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.089 
pretty soon a little pink comes up and
then<00:06:43.120> it<00:06:43.150> gets<00:06:43.389> redder<00:06:43.690> and<00:06:44.020> redder<00:06:44.080> and<00:06:44.860> it's

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:45.099 
then it gets redder and redder and it's

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:48.480 
then it gets redder and redder and it's
it<00:06:45.880> lights<00:06:46.120> up<00:06:46.330> like<00:06:46.949> like<00:06:47.949> someone<00:06:48.310> put

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:48.490 
it lights up like like someone put

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.640 
it lights up like like someone put
makeup<00:06:48.699> on<00:06:49.000> it<00:06:49.210> I<00:06:49.360> mean<00:06:50.169> obviously<00:06:50.289> there's

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:50.650 
makeup on it I mean obviously there's

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:52.559 
makeup on it I mean obviously there's
the<00:06:50.710> photography<00:06:51.310> aspect<00:06:51.460> and<00:06:52.030> then<00:06:52.389> there's

00:06:52.559 --> 00:06:52.569 
the photography aspect and then there's

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:54.059 
the photography aspect and then there's
people<00:06:52.720> who<00:06:52.930> like<00:06:52.960> Yosemite<00:06:53.800> and<00:06:53.889> if<00:06:53.979> you

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:54.069 
people who like Yosemite and if you

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:55.620 
people who like Yosemite and if you
happen<00:06:54.340> to<00:06:54.370> like<00:06:54.610> both<00:06:54.849> of<00:06:54.880> things<00:06:55.270> then

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:55.630 
happen to like both of things then

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.900 
happen to like both of things then
that's<00:06:56.500> probably<00:06:56.680> why<00:06:57.039> you<00:06:57.400> want<00:06:57.610> to<00:06:57.729> keep

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:57.910 
that's probably why you want to keep

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.059 
that's probably why you want to keep
trying<00:06:58.300> to<00:06:58.479> come<00:06:58.660> back<00:06:58.840> I'm<00:06:59.470> sure<00:06:59.710> many<00:06:59.919> of

00:07:00.059 --> 00:07:00.069 
trying to come back I'm sure many of
