g'day<00:00:01.170> folks<00:00:01.380> well<00:00:02.250> the<00:00:02.460> amplifier<00:00:02.909> seems<00:00:03.210> to

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
g'day folks well the amplifier seems to

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.099 
g'day folks well the amplifier seems to
have<00:00:03.389> sorted<00:00:03.720> itself<00:00:03.870> out<00:00:05.420> it's<00:00:06.420> working<00:00:06.629> it

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
have sorted itself out it's working it

potentiometers<00:00:13.049> are<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.200> bit<00:00:13.410> sad<00:00:13.650> but<00:00:13.950> they

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
potentiometers are a bit sad but they

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.400 
potentiometers are a bit sad but they
still<00:00:14.309> work<00:00:14.630> there's<00:00:15.630> no<00:00:15.750> carbon<00:00:16.199> film

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410

when it's cold bit of heat coming off
the<00:00:30.029> tubes<00:00:30.330> but<00:00:30.599> I<00:00:30.869> don't<00:00:31.529> know<00:00:31.619> maybe<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
the tubes but I don't know maybe the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.770 
the tubes but I don't know maybe the
heaters<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:32.969> those<00:00:33.090> are<00:00:33.239> supposed<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.600> glow

heaters and those are supposed to glow

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.280 
heaters and those are supposed to glow
pretty<00:00:34.079> hot<00:00:35.000> and<00:00:36.000> it's<00:00:36.149> notice<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.570> some<00:00:37.200> of

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
pretty hot and it's notice and some of

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.020 
pretty hot and it's notice and some of
them<00:00:37.380> are<00:00:37.440> duller<00:00:37.680> than<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.040> others<00:00:38.309> although

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
them are duller than the others although

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:51.620 
them are duller than the others although
at<00:00:39.120> least<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.390> output<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.870> working

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.920 

oh<00:00:52.310> it's<00:00:53.310> pretty<00:00:53.490> well<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:54.420> likes<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:54.840> your

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
oh it's pretty well it likes for your

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.750 
oh it's pretty well it likes for your
factory<00:00:55.320> I'm<00:00:56.010> flying<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.400> on<00:00:56.490> something

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
factory I'm flying it on something

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.230 
factory I'm flying it on something
that's<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.390> lot<00:00:58.140> older<00:00:58.380> than<00:00:58.410> fear<00:00:58.680> factory

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.240 
that's a lot older than fear factory

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.360 
that's a lot older than fear factory
that's<00:01:00.240> really<00:01:00.510> cool<00:01:01.040> that's<00:01:02.040> only<00:01:02.190> one

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
that's really cool that's only one

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.340 
that's really cool that's only one
speaker<00:01:02.700> I<00:01:02.850> do<00:01:02.940> have<00:01:03.270> two<00:01:03.540> outputs<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.199> don't

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
speaker I do have two outputs I don't

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.870 
speaker I do have two outputs I don't
know<00:01:04.470> if<00:01:04.530> it's<00:01:04.680> still<00:01:04.860> mono<00:01:05.100> channel<00:01:05.580> 2

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
know if it's still mono channel 2

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.230 
know if it's still mono channel 2
speaker<00:01:06.420> or<00:01:06.860> actual<00:01:07.860> stereo<00:01:08.370> output<00:01:08.910> because

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
speaker or actual stereo output because

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.870 
speaker or actual stereo output because
there's<00:01:09.420> two<00:01:09.800> audio<00:01:10.800> transformers<00:01:11.520> there<00:01:11.730> but

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
there's two audio transformers there but

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.850 
there's two audio transformers there but
it<00:01:12.690> does<00:01:12.900> work<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.290> just<00:01:13.440> want<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.620> get<00:01:13.680> rid<00:01:13.830> of

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
it does work I just want to get rid of

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.440 
it does work I just want to get rid of
the<00:01:13.950> background<00:01:14.100> hiss<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.880> I'm<00:01:15.090> guessing

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the background hiss and I'm guessing

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.270 
the background hiss and I'm guessing
these<00:01:15.540> old<00:01:15.780> carbon<00:01:16.200> film<00:01:16.440> resistors<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:16.980> caps

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
these old carbon film resistors and caps

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.550 
these old carbon film resistors and caps
and<00:01:17.520> things<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.390> go<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.780> mean<00:01:19.320> those

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
and things have to go I mean those

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.630 
and things have to go I mean those
electrolytics<00:01:20.490> didn't<00:01:20.880> test<00:01:21.090> up<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.420> best<00:01:21.630> so

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
electrolytics didn't test up the best so

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.219 
electrolytics didn't test up the best so
yeah<00:01:23.640> before<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.090> toasts<00:01:24.540> anything<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.050> should

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
yeah before it toasts anything I should

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.200 
yeah before it toasts anything I should
really<00:01:25.440> replace<00:01:26.310> all<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.550> stuff<00:01:26.970> but<00:01:27.119> at

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
really replace all that stuff but at

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.400 
really replace all that stuff but at
least<00:01:27.300> I<00:01:27.479> know<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.840> pull<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.110> off<00:01:28.260> the

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
least I know I can pull this off the

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.280 
least I know I can pull this off the
back<00:01:28.590> panel<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.690> build<00:01:30.690> a<00:01:30.810> proper<00:01:31.050> housing

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
back panel and build a proper housing

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.590 
back panel and build a proper housing
for<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.830> that'll<00:01:32.790> just<00:01:32.940> leave<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.300> the<00:01:33.420> back

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
for it that'll just leave it on the back

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.650 
for it that'll just leave it on the back
panel<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.080> build<00:01:34.229> around<00:01:34.380> it<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:35.520> don't<00:01:36.330> know<00:01:36.420> I

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
panel and build around it I don't know I

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.460 
panel and build around it I don't know I
might<00:01:37.440> mounted<00:01:37.830> on<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> piece<00:01:38.190> of

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
might mounted on a piece of

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.770 
might mounted on a piece of
fire-retardant<00:01:40.610> quarter-inch<00:01:41.610> thick<00:01:41.780> PVC

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780

fire-retardant quarter-inch thick PVC
sheet<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:44.280> came<00:01:44.460> out<00:01:44.490> of<00:01:44.670> an<00:01:44.759> old<00:01:44.820> switching

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
sheet and came out of an old switching

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.249 
sheet and came out of an old switching
panel<00:01:45.900> it<00:01:46.080> was<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.229> anti<00:01:47.130> arc<00:01:47.580> flash<00:01:47.850> panel<00:01:48.300> but

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
panel it was a anti arc flash panel but

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.469 
panel it was a anti arc flash panel but
I've<00:01:49.380> got<00:01:49.500> some<00:01:49.650> nice<00:01:49.940> panels<00:01:50.940> made<00:01:51.150> out<00:01:51.360> of

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
I've got some nice panels made out of

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.900 
I've got some nice panels made out of
that<00:01:51.570> stuff<00:01:51.840> so<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.470> might<00:01:53.220> use<00:01:53.460> that<00:01:53.640> just<00:01:53.790> a

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
that stuff so I might use that just a

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.230 
that stuff so I might use that just a
gray<00:01:54.119> background<00:01:54.330> for<00:01:54.869> everything<00:01:56.090> not<00:01:57.090> sure

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
gray background for everything not sure

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.790 
gray background for everything not sure
if<00:01:57.360> i'll<00:01:57.450> keep<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.810> original<00:01:58.170> speaker<00:01:58.470> but<00:01:58.770> i

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
if i'll keep the original speaker but i

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.440 
if i'll keep the original speaker but i
might<00:01:59.039> just<00:01:59.250> put<00:01:59.580> a<00:01:59.610> couple<00:01:59.819> of<00:02:00.000> generic

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
might just put a couple of generic

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.529 
might just put a couple of generic
six-by-nine<00:02:01.170> s<00:02:01.530> or<00:02:01.619> something<00:02:01.979> 4<00:02:02.880> ohm<00:02:03.119> that's

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
six-by-nine s or something 4 ohm that's

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.139 
six-by-nine s or something 4 ohm that's
