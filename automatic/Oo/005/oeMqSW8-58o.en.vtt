00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
smaller because I don't think there's a

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.370 
smaller because I don't think there's a
lot<00:01:55.330> in<00:01:55.360> his<00:01:55.690> range<00:01:56.130> bevery<00:01:57.130> reads<00:01:57.460> into<00:01:57.729> a<00:01:57.760> a

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
lot in his range bevery reads into a a

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.230 
lot in his range bevery reads into a a
bet<00:01:59.380> that<00:01:59.409> he<00:01:59.620> check<00:01:59.830> raises<00:02:00.280> wide<00:02:00.760> I<00:02:00.790> think

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
bet that he check raises wide I think

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.350 
bet that he check raises wide I think
would<00:02:01.330> be<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:01.479> smaller<00:02:01.840> bat<00:02:02.140> and<00:02:03.090> then<00:02:04.090> we'd<00:02:04.270> be

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
would be a smaller bat and then we'd be

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.399 
would be a smaller bat and then we'd be
cramming<00:02:04.600> on<00:02:04.780> him<00:02:04.900> because<00:02:05.020> we've<00:02:05.170> got<00:02:05.320> to

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
cramming on him because we've got to

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:06.750 
cramming on him because we've got to
open<00:02:05.500> ended<00:02:05.770> with<00:02:05.890> me<00:02:06.040> over<00:02:06.370> card<00:02:06.580> and

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
open ended with me over card and

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.639 
open ended with me over card and
potentially<00:02:07.570> some<00:02:07.750> chance<00:02:07.990> that<00:02:08.050> he<00:02:08.229> folds

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
potentially some chance that he folds

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.280 
potentially some chance that he folds
and<00:02:09.239> occasionally<00:02:10.239> he<00:02:10.360> has<00:02:10.450> a<00:02:10.479> club<00:02:10.840> draw<00:02:11.049> with

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
and occasionally he has a club draw with

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.170 
and occasionally he has a club draw with
over<00:02:11.590> cards<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:12.099> my<00:02:12.190> ace<00:02:12.400> high<00:02:12.610> is<00:02:12.670> actually

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
over cards and my ace high is actually

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.899 
over cards and my ace high is actually
good<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:15.069> just<00:02:15.280> don't<00:02:15.430> think<00:02:15.670> there's<00:02:15.849> a

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
good and I just don't think there's a

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.390 
good and I just don't think there's a
lot<00:02:16.060> of<00:02:16.120> good<00:02:16.620> pairs<00:02:17.620> there<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.069> are<00:02:18.159> checked

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
lot of good pairs there that are checked

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.210 
lot of good pairs there that are checked
shelving<00:02:18.670> on<00:02:18.760> us<00:02:18.940> so<00:02:19.260> he's<00:02:20.260> gonna<00:02:20.470> shove<00:02:20.950> most

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
shelving on us so he's gonna shove most

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.840 
shelving on us so he's gonna shove most
of<00:02:21.340> his<00:02:21.430> pairs<00:02:21.640> preflop

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.700 

so<00:02:25.850> we'd<00:02:26.060> be<00:02:26.210> pretty<00:02:26.840> comfortable<00:02:27.380> getting<00:02:27.560> it

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
so we'd be pretty comfortable getting it

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.170 
so we'd be pretty comfortable getting it
in<00:02:27.830> in<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.040> spot<00:02:28.250> see<00:02:28.640> I<00:02:28.700> haven't<00:02:28.940> made<00:02:29.150> a

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
in in that spot see I haven't made a

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.450 
in in that spot see I haven't made a
