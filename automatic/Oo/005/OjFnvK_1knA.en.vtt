00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
that watch the video yesterday I

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.760 
that watch the video yesterday I
actually<00:01:43.539> did<00:01:43.869> have<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.140> Super<00:01:44.409> Bowl<00:01:44.469> was<00:01:44.679> the

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
actually did have the Super Bowl was the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.020 
actually did have the Super Bowl was the
last<00:01:44.920> game<00:01:45.219> in<00:01:45.399> there<00:01:45.549> that's<00:01:45.759> why<00:01:45.880> it<00:01:45.939> was

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
last game in there that's why it was

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.999 
last game in there that's why it was
called<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.240> playoff<00:01:46.630> run<00:01:46.960> but<00:01:47.710> I<00:01:47.740> guess

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
called the playoff run but I guess

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.739 
called the playoff run but I guess
whenever<00:01:48.219> I<00:01:48.369> showed<00:01:48.640> my<00:01:48.789> record<00:01:49.299> that<00:01:49.659> was

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:49.749 
whenever I showed my record that was

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:51.809 
whenever I showed my record that was
prior<00:01:50.079> to<00:01:50.109> playing<00:01:50.499> the<00:01:50.679> Super<00:01:50.950> Bowl<00:01:50.979> and<00:01:51.340> I

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
prior to playing the Super Bowl and I

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.459 
prior to playing the Super Bowl and I
didn't<00:01:52.090> want<00:01:52.210> to<00:01:52.299> give<00:01:52.450> it<00:01:52.539> away<00:01:52.600> so<00:01:52.810> I<00:01:53.020> figured

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
didn't want to give it away so I figured

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.770 
didn't want to give it away so I figured
you<00:01:53.710> know<00:01:53.889> i<00:01:54.009> posted<00:01:54.789> prior<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.240> that<00:01:55.389> and<00:01:55.600> i

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
you know i posted prior to that and i

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.120 
you know i posted prior to that and i
think<00:01:56.020> they<00:01:56.109> might<00:01:56.259> have<00:01:56.289> labeled<00:01:56.920> it<00:01:56.979> under

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
think they might have labeled it under

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.929 
think they might have labeled it under
which<00:01:58.090> my<00:01:58.270> call<00:01:58.450> it<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:59.549> wild<00:02:00.549> card<00:02:00.789> or

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
which my call it the wild card or

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:01.859 
which my call it the wild card or

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869 
something even though i had the

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:03.539 
something even though i had the
wild-card<00:02:02.200> berth<00:02:02.590> or<00:02:03.009> whatever<00:02:03.249> the<00:02:03.429> heck

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
wild-card berth or whatever the heck

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.669
