00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.839
 good question 

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:41.679

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:43.559
 I see frankly we can 

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:46.289
 largely ways to stay in this business 

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:49.399
 for the moment this agreement is not because I'm sensitive does that your 

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:52.559
 frapru German family launched it's really that you have the capabilities 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:55.559

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:00.669
 very clean 

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:04.589
 but unfortunately the phone is also very useful 

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:06.589
 welcomed per year 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:09.020
 the bottom part of bringing things up 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.020
 not like in the green 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.849
 a cat 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.359

 the laureate allo let's go 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:45.590
 it is linked to the handing over of the keys 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.939
 everyone has a mobile phone in their hands for example 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:52.099
 the decline in demand 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:55.350
 on the other hand a little shame because I have not at all last who came out 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.860

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.080
