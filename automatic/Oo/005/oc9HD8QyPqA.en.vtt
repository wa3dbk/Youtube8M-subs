those randomized lights there is one on
each<00:00:21.359> side<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.810> block<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.410> they<00:00:22.710> just

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
each side of a block and they just

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.960 
each side of a block and they just
randomly<00:00:23.449> go<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.689> bursts<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.730> there's<00:00:26.730> my

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970

entire thing and do it again as you see
I<00:00:44.250> just<00:00:44.550> turned<00:00:44.879> off<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.210> lights<00:00:45.420> their<00:00:46.760> light

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.020 
I just turned off the lights their light
switches<00:00:48.120> over<00:00:48.719> here<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:50.550> switch<00:00:50.789> for

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
switches over here and the switch for

video tutorial on this and show all of

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:30.039 
video tutorial on this and show all of
my<00:02:23.480> wiring<00:02:25.660> just<00:02:26.660> have<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:28.720> generator<00:02:29.720> down

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:30.049 
my wiring just have a generator down

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.979 
my wiring just have a generator down
here<00:02:30.410> or<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:31.780> pulse<00:02:32.780> generator<00:02:33.350> that<00:02:34.040> runs

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
here or a pulse generator that runs

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.390 
here or a pulse generator that runs
everything<00:02:36.880> actually<00:02:37.880> that's<00:02:38.360> why<00:02:38.750> I<00:02:39.400> have

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
everything actually that's why I have

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.180 
everything actually that's why I have

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
separate generator up here running the

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.970 
separate generator up here running the
lights<00:02:48.400> that's<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.670> lot<00:02:49.820> faster<00:02:50.120> and<00:02:50.739> it's<00:02:51.739> more

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
lights that's a lot faster and it's more

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.620 
lights that's a lot faster and it's more
