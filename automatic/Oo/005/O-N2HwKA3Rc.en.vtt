we're gonna run we're gonna design what

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.719 
we're gonna run we're gonna design what
we<00:01:11.420> call<00:01:11.570> a<00:01:11.600> state<00:01:12.200> string<00:01:12.470> your<00:01:12.590> state<00:01:12.860> power

we call a state string your state power

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.120 
we call a state string your state power
cable<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:14.810> what<00:01:15.590> this<00:01:15.680> is<00:01:15.830> is<00:01:15.920> we're<00:01:16.010> gonna

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
cable and what this is is we're gonna

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.219 
cable and what this is is we're gonna
have<00:01:16.190> a<00:01:16.310> stitch<00:01:16.700> recording<00:01:17.090> between<00:01:17.229> Park

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
cable between each on these plus so we

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.890 
cable between each on these plus so we
can<00:01:21.440> lay<00:01:21.590> a<00:01:21.620> lay<00:01:21.979> on<00:01:22.159> top<00:01:22.340> of<00:01:22.460> a<00:01:22.550> trusty<00:01:22.940> rig<00:01:23.210> did

plug<00:02:06.530> there's<00:02:07.430> always<00:02:07.640> gonna<00:02:07.850> be<00:02:07.939> a<00:02:08.479> brass<00:02:09.080> end

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
plug there's always gonna be a brass end

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.309 
plug there's always gonna be a brass end
and<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.580> rule<00:02:10.759> of<00:02:10.849> thumb<00:02:11.090> is<00:02:11.299> black<00:02:11.840> is<00:02:12.049> brass

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
and the rule of thumb is black is brass

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.979 
and the rule of thumb is black is brass
always<00:02:12.950> so<00:02:13.129> that<00:02:13.250> means<00:02:13.489> that<00:02:14.239> you're<00:02:14.930> gonna

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
always so that means that you're gonna

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.879 
always so that means that you're gonna
put<00:02:15.319> in<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:16.760> black<00:02:17.299> or<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.599> hots<00:02:17.870> into<00:02:18.799> the

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:18.889 
put in the black or the hots into the

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.159 
put in the black or the hots into the
brass<00:02:19.099> we<00:02:19.579> can<00:02:19.700> also<00:02:19.849> see<00:02:20.209> here<00:02:20.569> that<00:02:21.019> we<00:02:21.139> have

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:21.169 
brass we can also see here that we have

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:22.309 
brass we can also see here that we have
a<00:02:21.319> brass<00:02:21.620> screw

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
a brass screw

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:28.610 
a brass screw
so<00:02:22.980> black<00:02:23.370> is<00:02:23.549> brash<00:02:23.760> always<00:02:27.319> that's<00:02:28.319> very

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
so black is brash always that's very

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.089 
so black is brash always that's very
cool<00:02:30.109> so<00:02:31.109> I'm<00:02:31.230> gonna<00:02:31.379> go<00:02:31.500> ahead<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.709> get<00:02:31.920> mine

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
that I was going to get one more box

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.929 
that I was going to get one more box
which<00:02:40.319> is<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.500> last<00:02:40.739> box<00:02:41.010> he's<00:02:41.730> actually

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
which is the last box he's actually

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:43.490 
which is the last box he's actually
beating<00:02:42.629> me<00:02:42.720> too<00:02:42.900> because<00:02:43.019> he's<00:02:43.200> done<00:02:43.379> this

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
beating me too because he's done this

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.949 
beating me too because he's done this
before<00:02:43.560> I<00:02:44.099> got<00:02:44.790> my<00:02:45.000> first<00:02:45.030> one<00:02:45.510> done<00:02:45.870> and

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
before I got my first one done and
