 stunning by the music the colors and 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.580
 designing it a little bit the fiddling is with 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.590
 a comparator of iron ingots a 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.690
 glass panel and a pressure plate

 and we have this pedestal that is for step 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.109
 for let's put this here 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.429

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.899
 the little things these weapons and here we have 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.780
 Touch puddles I'll stay here where we put

 comes with colors or here comes all the 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.960
 data of each thing this to build or 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.539
 so whatever it is here we can change the 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.880
 music here to the same one comes because it comes from 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:04.619
