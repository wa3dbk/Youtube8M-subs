00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.220
 for breeding is best to use 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.800
 cuttings 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.870
 green summer or lignified winter 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.420
 harvest them during trimming bushes 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.310
 at the end of September at the beginning of October for 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.199
 cuttings use the middle portion of 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.840
 lada worn summer shoots of fruit 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.359
 arrows or shoots that are cut but 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.890
 replacement knot harvested cuttings 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.480
 day soaked in water 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.429
 disinfected in a solution of iron 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.740
 sulphate is necessarily dried and 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.750
 label storing cuttings in refrigerators 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.270
 cellars or cellars at 0 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.370
 + 2 under plastic wrap on 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.450
 cuttings with a sharp knife make cuts 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.820
 bottom straight 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.829
 5 millimeters from the lower kidney top 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.289
 inclined one to two centimeters higher 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.420
 the upper kidney and the slope is done from 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.550
 buds on the lower end of the stalk 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.559
 with a needle or a knife I do three four reins 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.610
 three centimeters long release i only 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.770
 the bark is blue 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.690
 in the soil of the furrows will grow 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.710
 extra roots at the end of January 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.840
 early February 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.670
 take out the cuttings and within two days 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.920
 soaked in a warm settled or 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.590
 snow water that is changed daily 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.740
 then for one day kept in the stimulator 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.740
 root formation 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.340
 transparent is used for germination 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.520
 0.5 liters plastic cup 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.260
 his day with an awl I make three four holes 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.050
 down so she pours a mixture of leaf 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.500
 humus and land in the ratio of one to 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.320
 to one 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.420
 layer two two and a half centimeters on 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.880
 ground in the center of the glass set 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.080
 a hollow cylinder with a diameter of 30 millimeters and 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.240
 100 millimeters high 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.280
 the space between the walls of the glass and 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.979
 the cylinder is filled with earth which 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.710
 condense and water the cylinder is filled 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.340
 washed and calcined river sand of his 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.780
 watered 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.780
 and the cylinder is pulled out 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.310
 in the center of the sand at the club 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.920
 four centimeters a hole is made 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.750
 shell diameter of 1 centimeter in 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.750
 hole insert stalk of sand 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.130
 watered on top poured sand next 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.740
 cover with clear plastic 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.030
 a bottle with a poor neck cut off 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.030
 the bottle remains open 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.220
 cuttings watered 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.140
 water in a volume of 30 milliliters each 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.269
 day or every other day depending on 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.250
 dry air in the room when 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.440
 roots wake up to the walls of the glass and 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:22.650
 four five leaves of the bottle are formed 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.230
 remove the second option in plastic 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.870
 a bottle without a throat in the bottom make a hole 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.209
 and pour drainage then six eight 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.549
 spoons of soil mixture and tilt is put 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.890
 cutting so that its upper peephole was 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.840
 flush with the cut of the bottle after that 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.090
 sprinkle old moistened steamed 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.069
 sawdust put on the window sill from 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.140
 windows covered with plastic disposable 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.180
 a glass of his take off when the escape 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.610
 the tariff stops 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.530
 seedlings are conducted from the bottom through the pallet and 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.900
 just pour half a centimeter of water and 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.819
 hold no more seedlings in a bottle 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.890
 15 minutes third method 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.840
 the cuttings are placed in a plastic bag 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.090
 on the bottom of which put a piece of wet 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.220
 foam rubber cuttings heels rest against 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.379
 foam and package sent to the cabinet 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.180
 after about ten days begin 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.040
 check the appearance of Colas and even 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.079
 tiny one two millimeter 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.640
 rootlets then cuttings are planted 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.280
 plastic cup as in the first embodiment 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.109
 This method allows you to advance 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.810
 choose sprouted cuttings and thereby 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.400
 save space on the windowsill roots 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.370
 most actively formed when 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.959
 temperature of 20-25 degrees for this 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.910
 glass with cuttings on a tray 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.799
 set by the sun window above 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.380
 heaters inside the bottle 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.930
 preferably maintain a temperature of 12 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.239
 18 degrees thanks to this root 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.250
 the cutting system is growing faster than 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.680
 Escape and development of seedlings strongly 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.870
 accelerates in late April early May 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.510
 seedlings transplanted into a larger container 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.870
 sizes of 23 liters and grow in 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.870
 greenhouse
