00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.340
 I'm going to show you how to use the equipment 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.930
 to check the ph the chlorine the 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:10.970
 alkalinity and acid demands 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.100
 comes with a table for demand 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:16.790
 acid can also be used to make 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:20.290
 the white background you put the 'card there and 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.290
 is going to give you a good white background 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:24.410
 you do not have to play very well you have 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.380
 to put it a foot away inside 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.570
 of the water and bring it back up 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.880
 these marked lines are for chlorine and 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.980
 this is for the ph 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.980
 I'm going to check the chlorine level 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.570
 I'm going to put 5 drops of solution one 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.059
 you can see the chlorine level is low 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.800
 being there for a minute is going to give me the 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:57.929
 combined level of chlorine free chlorine 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.460
 it's important because it's the chlorine that 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.800
 stay in your pool and kill the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.379
 bacterium you can increase the level of 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.690
 chlorine by increasing chemicals I'm going to check 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.539
 the ph level adds a drop of 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.200
 solution 4 which is a neutralizer of 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:16.740
 chlorine I'm going to stir a little bit I'm going 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.729
 increase 5 drops of solution 2 I'm going to 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.729
 move it a little 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.850
 you see that the ph on 7-8 right now we are going to 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.520
 use solution 3 for acid demand 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.860
 I'm going to put the drops and count them here 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.340
 are two drops I take two drops to 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.890
 get 7.4 ph that's how you get 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.840
 the demand for acid increase drops and 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.670
 count until the color changes to 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.210
 get 7.4 beat now it's important 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.340
 know how many gallons are in your pool 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.730
 I have a video that shows how to calculate 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.730
 this 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:02.570
 this pool has 14,000 so the 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:05.229
 graph says I should put a quarter 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.229
 of acid 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.060
 It is very important to keep your ph in a 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.060
 ideal level for chlorine to work 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.060
 effectively 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:27.580
 Do not let the ph get too low if it is 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:31.390
 lower than 7.2 will cause corrosion and 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.319
 stains put all as to bring the ph 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.319
 up again 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.700
 now let's check the alkalinity 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.470
 let's put a drop of solution 4 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.200
 to neutralize chlorine 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.610
 now we increase two drops of solution 5 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.610
 and we move it a little bit 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.580
 let's put drops of solution three and 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:02.430
 count them 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.430
 until the water is clear 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.300
 I take 8 drops solution 3 so the 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.750
 alkalinity in this pool is 80 parts 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.060
 per million have to check chlorine and ph 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.000
 once a week and check the 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.980
 alkalinity once a month 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.980
 ph chlorine check once a week
