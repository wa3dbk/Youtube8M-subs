00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.470
 little bit of flour 25 grams of 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.840
 butter and a pinch of salt with these 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:41.630
 ingredients let's make some rich 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.630
 potato and bacon cakes 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.190
 first of all let's cook the potato 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:53.089
 as you see we have peeled it and we have 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.360
 cut into squares we add a 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.580
 pinch of salt 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.300
 and we cover water in the coverings of the 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.610
 Water 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.610
 and we will know about 20 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.430
 we are going to take them out of the 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.710
 but we slip them very well 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:19.479
 there is no water left and we rest them 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.479
 with a fork the cakes 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.150
 Now we have put some oil 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.130
 olive in the pan and there we add the 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.619
 chopped chive well 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.619
 and we will cut it about 3 minutes 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.090
 already with kids that really onion 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.090
 we add the bacon 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.930
 we give some doors 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.930
 and we retire later 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.570
 here we have the potato that the vine like 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.460
 you see we've already heard very well with the 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.680
 fork and now we can add the 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.490
 sofrito that we have done with the bacon and 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.430
 the onion 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.080
 we put with the sofrito 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.080
 and crazy we will mix very well 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.120
 we add change the parsley 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.550
 the fine minced 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.540
 you see 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.540
 and finally 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:23.239
 a pinch of salt pepper do not add 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:27.489
 more because the bacon has its point 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.489
 of salt for this we mix it very well 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.600
 we already have everything well mixed now 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:40.390
 let's divide the mass into about 8 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.390
 or 10 balls to make them 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.690
 Y 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.120
 we already have the balls made now 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.549
 let's listen little by little with the 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.549
 hands to make the cakes 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:00.490
 already formed the cakes as you see the 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.850
 cover with plastic wrap and we put 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:06.460
 refrigerator we will leave them about 15 20 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.960
 minutes to cool down a bit that 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.960
 harden before frying 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.400
 we have everything ready as you see 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.420

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.150
 put in the pan 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.850
 now we are passing the cakes by the 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.430
 flour we passed on both sides and in 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.540
 when we have hot butter 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.540
 we fry them 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.510
 there we have the first four for 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.130
 we will let them be granted 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.830
 when we are where we will give them the 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:45.320
 back and when we made the 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.320
 We will get important apart from the order 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.849
 and already with the cuts on the plate we 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.590

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.379
