00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.480
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.980
 today's training of harmony 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.360
 Frankfurt on the grounds of 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.220
 commerzbank arena 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.140
 the harmony he is currently the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.910
 table pretty high up and there 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.130
 we thought we would take the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.640
 players now just a little closer 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.640
 under the microscope 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.080
 Eintracht Frankfurt 1 500 years old 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.650
 Every player may come and play 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.559
 go 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.750
 Currently, the adresses are 27 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.000
 players committed 13 of them 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.430
 new additions to the captain of the team 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.910
 Today we have something more accurate 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.910
 viewed 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.780
 The Swiss has been playing since July 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.580
 2009 was eintracht frankfurt and has 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.860
 his club already a few goals 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.230
 given this season he joined 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.950
 on the second day of play once against 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.140
 hoffenheim 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.540
 but what characterizes the young club 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.010
 captain from maybe he sounds 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.270
 loudest under the team shower 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.910
 So I'm not under the shower 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.770
 loudest singh I can not 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:27.070
 That's why I leave it all but me 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.500
 do think that women human that 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.540
 captain here as well as the little ones 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.880
 to lead boys and there one 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.229
 to be help position so I'm 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.650
 Although still young but I still see myself 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.600
 nice to know that older players with 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.460
 schwegler is 25 years old 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.320
 not to the oldest players yet he 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.450
 is experienced in this area because 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.759
 after all, he started his professional football 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.950
 Career at the tender age of 16 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.350
 in his homeland switzerland 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.730
 nevertheless, he is playing by some 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.620
 still upset 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.510
 Drinks a little tension is always there 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.540
 and 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.090
 especially if you are back home 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.700
 plays in front of full house and there you 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.740
 Tension always there in the first place 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.360
 line is also happy because of that 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.160
 really something special 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.830
 on sunday the harmony must be at home 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.720
 against the hamburger sv ran there of 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.200
 captain because already an idea like that 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.700
 could run out of play 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.360
 you can not do much with forecasts 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.150
 to begin 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.770
 before the leverkusen game also have 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.250
 Not many a forecast on us 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.830
 set 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.020
 so sometimes there not to like 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.760
 expect but we we try 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.210
 to retrieve the performance of the last 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.250
 weeks 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.900
 and then I think it will be back 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:42.070
 nice game we are curious 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.050
 that 's it from the training of 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.700
 Eintracht Frankfurt and we had today 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.710
 the possibility of the captain pirmin 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.180
 to get to know schwegler a bit better 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.010
 I'm curious who we next week 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.010
 in front of the lens until then bye
