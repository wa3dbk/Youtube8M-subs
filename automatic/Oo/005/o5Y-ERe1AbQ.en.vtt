00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
to cut this out now all the way along so

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.439 
to cut this out now all the way along so
that<00:00:54.720> the<00:00:55.530> frame<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:55.860> sit<00:00:56.640> down<00:00:56.850> on<00:00:57.089> the<00:00:57.210> brick

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449

so<00:02:53.489> I'll<00:02:53.849> build<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.239> entire

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
so I'll build the entire

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.510 
so I'll build the entire
door<00:02:55.060> opening<00:02:55.510> mechanism<00:02:56.140> while<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.280> doors

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
door opening mechanism while the doors

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:05.400 
door opening mechanism while the doors
sitting<00:02:57.880> in<00:02:58.000> position<00:03:03.420> I've<00:03:04.420> temporarily

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
sitting in position I've temporarily

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.360 
sitting in position I've temporarily
clamped<00:03:06.220> these<00:03:07.470> brackets<00:03:08.470> in<00:03:08.650> place<00:03:08.680> here

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
clamped these brackets in place here

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.700 
clamped these brackets in place here
with<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.180> nuts<00:03:10.390> welded<00:03:10.900> on<00:03:10.990> the<00:03:11.110> back<00:03:11.290> of<00:03:11.500> them

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
with the nuts welded on the back of them

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.320 
with the nuts welded on the back of them
and<00:03:12.240> that's<00:03:13.240> what<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.510> rollers<00:03:13.900> will<00:03:14.080> be

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
and that's what the rollers will be

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:20.270 
and that's what the rollers will be
bolted<00:03:16.330> into<00:03:17.640> they're<00:03:18.900> making<00:03:19.900> those

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
bolted into they're making those

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.030 
bolted into they're making those
mounting<00:03:21.280> bracket<00:03:22.180> nuts<00:03:22.540> 2<00:03:23.080> inches<00:03:23.380> away<00:03:23.560> from

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
mounting bracket nuts 2 inches away from

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.190 
mounting bracket nuts 2 inches away from
this<00:03:24.520> steel<00:03:24.880> gives<00:03:25.600> me<00:03:25.750> just<00:03:25.990> enough

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
this steel gives me just enough

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:35.310 
this steel gives me just enough
clearance<00:03:26.770> so<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.190> roller<00:03:27.400> doesn't<00:03:27.850> rub<00:03:34.320> okay

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
clearance so the roller doesn't rub okay

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.780 
clearance so the roller doesn't rub okay
now<00:03:35.500> it's<00:03:35.680> time<00:03:35.770> to<00:03:35.950> work<00:03:36.190> on<00:03:36.370> the<00:03:36.550> roller

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
now it's time to work on the roller

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.650 
now it's time to work on the roller
track<00:03:41.010> so<00:03:42.010> this<00:03:42.220> is<00:03:42.370> how<00:03:42.550> the<00:03:42.610> roller<00:03:43.270> track

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
track so this is how the roller track

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.160 
track so this is how the roller track
will<00:03:43.900> mount<00:03:44.190> and<00:03:45.240> this<00:03:46.240> will<00:03:46.390> be<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.690> roller

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
will mount and this will be the roller

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.250 
will mount and this will be the roller
action<00:03:47.830> here<00:03:48.220> so<00:03:49.030> I'm<00:03:49.420> just<00:03:49.540> gonna<00:03:49.630> cut<00:03:50.020> this

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
action here so I'm just gonna cut this

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.550 
action here so I'm just gonna cut this
above<00:03:51.130> the<00:03:51.670> top<00:03:51.910> roller<00:03:52.240> and<00:03:55.050> then<00:03:56.050> I<00:03:56.080> can<00:03:56.380> go

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
above the top roller and then I can go

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.100 
above the top roller and then I can go
and<00:03:56.800> mount<00:03:57.550> these<00:03:57.790> pieces<00:03:58.150> onto<00:03:58.600> the<00:03:58.930> door

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
and mount these pieces onto the door

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.710 
and mount these pieces onto the door
frame<00:04:00.060> I've<00:04:01.060> clamped<00:04:02.070> these<00:04:03.070> rails<00:04:03.720> against

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
frame I've clamped these rails against

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:10.830 
frame I've clamped these rails against
the<00:04:04.780> rollers<00:04:06.870> and<00:04:07.870> at<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.320> bottom<00:04:08.590> I<00:04:09.480> put<00:04:10.480> a

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
the base of the furnace frame there okay

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.060 
the base of the furnace frame there okay
I've<00:04:28.390> just<00:04:28.450> about<00:04:28.960> finished<00:04:29.380> welding<00:04:29.830> stuff

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
I've just about finished welding stuff

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.370 
I've just about finished welding stuff
onto<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.550> door<00:04:30.760> frame<00:04:31.120> but<00:04:31.720> there's<00:04:31.930> two<00:04:32.200> more

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
onto the door frame but there's two more

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.030 
onto the door frame but there's two more
things<00:04:32.440> to<00:04:32.830> do<00:04:33.070> yet<00:04:33.340> in<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:35.320> center<00:04:35.680> of<00:04:35.830> the

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
things to do yet in the center of the

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.640 
things to do yet in the center of the
door<00:04:36.610> frame<00:04:36.940> on<00:04:37.120> the<00:04:37.240> top<00:04:37.480> I've<00:04:37.750> welded<00:04:38.140> a<00:04:38.380> tab

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650

and<00:04:38.950> drilled<00:04:39.790> a<00:04:39.880> hole<00:04:39.910> in<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:40.480> end<00:04:40.630> of<00:04:40.780> it

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
and drilled a hole in the end of it

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.970 
and drilled a hole in the end of it
there<00:04:41.140> and<00:04:42.060> that's<00:04:43.060> for<00:04:43.390> the<00:04:43.480> cable<00:04:43.960> that<00:04:44.890> will

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
there and that's for the cable that will

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.920 
there and that's for the cable that will
be<00:04:45.130> used<00:04:45.340> to<00:04:45.510> lift<00:04:46.510> the<00:04:46.690> door<00:04:46.930> up<00:04:48.780> now<00:04:49.780> I'll

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
be used to lift the door up now I'll

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.840 
be used to lift the door up now I'll
show<00:04:50.200> the<00:04:51.240> method<00:04:52.240> I'm<00:04:52.360> going<00:04:52.390> to<00:04:52.630> use<00:04:52.900> for<00:04:53.320> the

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
show the method I'm going to use for the

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.240 
show the method I'm going to use for the
door<00:04:54.850> opening<00:04:55.330> mechanism<00:04:55.900> with<00:04:56.800> the<00:04:56.830> foot

pneumatic cylinders that are intended
for<00:06:03.110> door<00:06:04.110> closers<00:06:04.770> so<00:06:05.520> that<00:06:05.790> the<00:06:05.910> foot<00:06:06.210> will

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
for door closers so that the foot will

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.190 
for door closers so that the foot will
go<00:06:06.420> here<00:06:07.020> and<00:06:07.230> it'll<00:06:07.890> push<00:06:08.190> the<00:06:08.810> believer<00:06:09.810> down

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
go here and it'll push the believer down

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.010 
go here and it'll push the believer down
and<00:06:10.590> then<00:06:11.160> release<00:06:11.550> slowly<00:06:11.750> and<00:06:12.750> there's<00:06:12.930> an

and then release slowly and there's an

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.410 
and then release slowly and there's an
adjustment<00:06:13.470> on<00:06:13.710> the<00:06:13.920> end<00:06:14.070> here<00:06:14.400> so<00:06:14.640> I<00:06:15.150> can

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.420 
adjustment on the end here so I can

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.810 
adjustment on the end here so I can
adjust<00:06:15.720> the<00:06:15.960> time<00:06:16.260> that<00:06:16.890> it<00:06:17.010> takes<00:06:17.220> to<00:06:17.460> release

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:17.820 
adjust the time that it takes to release

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.210 
adjust the time that it takes to release
to<00:06:18.720> ensure<00:06:19.020> that<00:06:19.050> the<00:06:19.320> furnace<00:06:19.650> door<00:06:19.680> doesn't

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
to ensure that the furnace door doesn't

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.600 
to ensure that the furnace door doesn't
slam<00:06:20.580> but<00:06:21.090> that<00:06:21.270> it<00:06:21.360> closes<00:06:21.570> slowly<00:06:22.280> so<00:06:23.280> the

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
slam but that it closes slowly so the

first<00:06:23.850> thing<00:06:24.000> I'm<00:06:24.090> going<00:06:24.270> to<00:06:24.360> do<00:06:24.570> is<00:06:24.720> I'm<00:06:24.840> going

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:24.960 
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.880 
first thing I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:06:25.020> weld<00:06:25.290> an<00:06:25.620> additional<00:06:26.840> length<00:06:27.840> of<00:06:28.200> bar<00:06:28.500> on

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890 
to weld an additional length of bar on

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.950 
to weld an additional length of bar on
to<00:06:29.100> this<00:06:29.280> because<00:06:29.820> right<00:06:30.120> now<00:06:30.390> it<00:06:30.540> only<00:06:30.630> has

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
to this because right now it only has

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.350 
to this because right now it only has
about<00:06:31.140> 1/8<00:06:31.590> inch<00:06:31.620> throw<00:06:32.370> and<00:06:32.700> that's<00:06:33.120> not

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
about 1/8 inch throw and that's not

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.180 
about 1/8 inch throw and that's not
enough<00:06:33.690> I<00:06:33.930> want<00:06:34.260> to<00:06:34.380> be<00:06:34.500> able<00:06:34.560> to<00:06:34.710> open<00:06:34.920> the

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
enough I want to be able to open the

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.590 
enough I want to be able to open the
furnace<00:06:35.490> door<00:06:35.520> a<00:06:35.730> little<00:06:35.910> bit<00:06:36.060> more<00:06:36.420> than

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:36.600 
furnace door a little bit more than

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:44.990 
furnace door a little bit more than
eight<00:06:36.780> inches<00:06:37.140> if<00:06:37.320> I<00:06:37.470> need<00:06:37.710> to<00:06:43.340> okay<00:06:44.340> so<00:06:44.790> that's

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
eight inches if I need to okay so that's

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.690 
eight inches if I need to okay so that's
what<00:06:45.210> it<00:06:45.300> winds<00:06:45.510> up<00:06:45.690> looking<00:06:46.080> like<00:06:49.640> now<00:06:50.640> the

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:50.700 
what it winds up looking like now the

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.490 
what it winds up looking like now the
next<00:06:51.120> thing<00:06:51.270> I've<00:06:51.420> done<00:06:51.630> is<00:06:51.840> I<00:06:51.990> filled<00:06:52.350> the

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500 
next thing I've done is I filled the

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:56.170 
next thing I've done is I filled the
counterweight<00:06:53.450> cavity<00:06:54.450> up<00:06:54.630> with<00:06:54.840> scrap<00:06:55.200> lead

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:56.180 
counterweight cavity up with scrap lead

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.850 
counterweight cavity up with scrap lead
until<00:06:57.180> it's<00:06:57.390> just<00:06:57.750> about<00:06:58.020> equal<00:06:58.320> the<00:06:58.680> weight

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
until it's just about equal the weight

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.490 
until it's just about equal the weight
of<00:06:59.010> the<00:06:59.130> door<00:06:59.370> and<00:06:59.730> now<00:07:00.540> I<00:07:00.570> can<00:07:00.930> lift<00:07:01.110> the<00:07:01.290> door

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 
of the door and now I can lift the door

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:09.800 
of the door and now I can lift the door
up<00:07:01.560> with<00:07:02.040> a<00:07:02.070> couple<00:07:02.430> of<00:07:02.520> fingers<00:07:02.760> quite<00:07:03.390> easily

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:09.810 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.870 

so<00:07:10.380> I'll<00:07:10.560> just<00:07:10.800> try<00:07:11.010> it<00:07:11.160> out<00:07:11.340> here<00:07:11.580> and<00:07:11.730> make

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 
so I'll just try it out here and make

nice<00:07:15.480> position<00:07:16.020> this<00:07:16.139> is<00:07:16.290> exactly<00:07:16.770> where<00:07:17.010> I

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.040 
nice position this is exactly where I

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:25.040
