 introduction and 360 degree view 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.360
 nikon has the 143 by now 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.250
 third edition of the top model of the 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.100

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.779
 in comparison to its predecessor 142, nikon 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.550
 doing a great deal of hand and hand 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.260
 dispensed with an electronic viewfinder 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.130
 These two can, however, be 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.200
 upgrade 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.239
 nikon is therefore opting for a more flexible solution 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.790
 the overall concept is also new 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.570
 bildsensor because at the 1 3 comes a 13 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.920
 2 x 8 8 mm model with 8 10 2 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.810
 megapixel for use 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.600
 the sensor public can be 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.210
 between iso 160 and iso 12.800 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.860
 adjust how the extremely fast working 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.380
 the mirrorless system camera at the 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.880
 Series image up to 59 images per 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.350
 seconds can be saved 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.850
 this speed will be added 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.710
 achieved before focusing 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.270
 should autofocus continuously 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.620
 but you can still work 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.490
 very fast 20 pictures per second 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.559
 to save 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.270
 autofocus works with both the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.240
 phase detection and the contrast 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.220
 The camera has the total amount of recognition 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.360
 171 focus miÃŸfelder 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.380
 Videos can with 60 full frames per 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.600
 second in full hd resolution 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.280
 a stereomicrophone is held 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.990
 is responsible for the sound recording 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.130
 also can be an external 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.530

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.759
 This also applies to a flash unit that 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.409
 just like an electronic one 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.179
 viewfinder over the accessory shoe with the 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.340

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:31.590
 as a photo program, the pse moh are the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.630
 a fully automatic at the best moment 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.740

 In addition, the pictures can with 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.369
 various filter effects provided 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.289
 become 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.350
 together with the stabilized kit 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:46.469
 objective 1 nikkor vr 10 to 30 mm power 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.359
 drives around like the nikon 1 4304 104 grams 

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:49.469
 pictures and videos will be on the 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:50.609
 smaller micro SD memory card 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.520
 filed 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:56.090
 the wlan can use the nikon 1 43 wirelessly 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.679
 communicate with a mobile device

 place next to this introductory video 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:01.319
 we give you the camera another

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.999
 in it, for example, they experience this 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.359
 to equip the image stabilizer and 

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:08.359
