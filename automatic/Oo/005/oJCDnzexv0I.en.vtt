00:07:55.149 --> 00:07:57.059 
Gaslight Nuria and lots of you guys
commented<00:07:56.050> on<00:07:56.139> the<00:07:56.259> previous<00:07:56.589> episode<00:07:57.039> that

00:07:57.059 --> 00:07:57.069 
commented on the previous episode that

00:07:57.069 --> 00:08:00.509 
commented on the previous episode that
the<00:07:57.339> game<00:07:57.550> pay<00:07:57.789> was<00:07:58.569> a<00:07:58.599> bit<00:07:59.080> blurry<00:07:59.589> and<00:08:00.159> I

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:00.519 
the game pay was a bit blurry and I

00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:03.360 
the game pay was a bit blurry and I
looked<00:08:00.759> into<00:08:00.999> it<00:08:01.300> and<00:08:01.539> my<00:08:02.259> capture<00:08:02.949> card<00:08:02.979> was

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:03.370 
looked into it and my capture card was

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.600 
looked into it and my capture card was
in<00:08:03.610> the<00:08:03.639> wrong<00:08:04.050> resolution<00:08:05.050> so<00:08:05.709> now<00:08:05.949> I<00:08:06.219> think

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:06.610 
in the wrong resolution so now I think

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:09.059 
in the wrong resolution so now I think
it<00:08:06.849> will<00:08:07.029> be<00:08:07.209> much<00:08:07.599> clearer<00:08:08.019> much<00:08:08.499> better<00:08:08.769> the

00:08:09.059 --> 00:08:09.069 
it will be much clearer much better the

00:08:09.069 --> 00:08:12.659 
it will be much clearer much better the
gameplay<00:08:09.490> looks<00:08:09.669> a<00:08:09.969> much<00:08:10.209> smoother
