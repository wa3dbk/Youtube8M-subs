00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.480
 of the authors the architects of the panda desert are the same ones they have 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.419
 drawn by 500 true the study 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:14.259
 in the fiat design group 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.509
 I really motivated to 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:18.989
 boys men women 

00:00:18.989 --> 00:00:23.780
 nikon a great attention to the development of the value area 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.730
 not only symbolic but also 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.730
 experiences of fiat design 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.940
 the flor flower 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.750
 lot extraction 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.430
 ugo foscolo 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.430
 1 instruction 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.840
 on the front axle of the new panda there are 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.350
 there is an emblem are not the mustaches that stand out on the body colors 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.030
 but it is an emblem that supports the logo 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.680
 and that is right d do from the bumper 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.190
 it is an element that has always been a substance robustness 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.540
 he fits right into the ghetto - we know the bonnet and bumper 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.070
 per cell the new model 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.890
 % advance and asks for the rules and the attention to safety 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.850
 of the pedestrian 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.810
 therefore the volume of the front of the new panda is strictly a volume 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.020
 bound 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.090
 to the sturdiness that to the safety of those who travel more on foot 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.130
 and therefore it is this vercelli whisker that makes one an emblem 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.270
 do this I want to marry you positive 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.560
 new model without being a sea frieze a year by technical dividing 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.560
 two components 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.160
 apple app store 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.440
 youtube 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.360
 simone 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.760
 I am very pleased that two of the elements we worked on most 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.510
 have taken great care of those who follow us 

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:15.569
 it's definitely this window 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.779
 also called in third technical jargon 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:19.909
 % 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:22.679
 if you have become more refined 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:26.350
 and the word that if embedded in the side us 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.500
 it really hits me emin pride it starts 

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:35.370
 and in fact it is precisely the glass part that subtracts some space from the lantern 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.180
 and this he does where the lantern is not needed 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.559
 practically nothing if on the side 

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:44.299
 also creating a stack up and dynamic that really works 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.439
 although that the panda with regards to the 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:50.129
 the dynamic performance 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.549
 so it's really a chin that we wanted 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.749
 creates resumes of the panda youtube say old reflex title the current 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:02.040
 because in fact the new panda is a successful anchor model 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:06.409
 where connet this new realization of loves to perfect we have for 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:07.979
 register the elements you already have 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.849
 they were considered useful 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:11.489
 and is made 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.560
 then the setting the frame as it is said between the 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.219
 lighting the door 

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:21.430
 and instead on the dashboard there are even some anecdotes to mention 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:22.699
 linked to the 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:24.339
 how to create a space 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:29.539
 open update as it is called face of love to the purse or any 

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:30.689
 other object 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:32.779
 also of considerable size la 

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:35.859
 where it was thought there was no room for anything 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.609
 because we say we know how much I hate the bridge was occupied by the systems 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.459
 active safety like the quarrels 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.789
 epidemic I kept the worth the closed compartment closed drawer below 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.159
 a certain height 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.349
 the old e 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.979
 on the top we have made this into this beautiful space king 

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:57.339
 I update that it is one of the many panda holders 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.679
 which also surrounded by a frame 

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:04.729
 which contains all the functions related to the purpose windjvu vat work that desainer 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:05.939
 have done d 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:07.969
 image enhancement 

00:04:07.969 --> 00:04:11.749
 and of reading the immediate function therefore a car that su sara sta 

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:13.509
 even more easily than that 

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:14.479
 current 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:17.239
 eh already spot apple 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.239
 fotolog 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.030
 here is the very attention classroom who lives the author is one of the factors 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.509
 and design communication 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:40.059
 that we want to give to this new realization 

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:44.499
 a car that contains the details and teachings of Italian design 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:47.560
 of the most authoritative signatures and that is that of working 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.059
 we always say with the intelligence of the product even in his 

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:55.089
 function to educate customers bring it to read the beauty even in the 

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:57.610
 things that are not scream that not 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.990

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:05.259
 objective to have profits 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:08.560
 then the bridge which is the object we always have in front of us when 

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:09.639
 we drive 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:13.289
 and already communicates this attention that designers have given to life 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.289
 and the on-board functions of the car 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:20.930
 there is nothing transcendental, nothing that upsets the audiences but everything is at 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.319
 his place and above all this dignity is a remarkable use value 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:28.699
 and this gratifies us many we hope the clientele sky 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.910
 we confirm it the rest of the inhabited area is a game 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:35.839
 medical daniele act as 

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:40.909

 its substance its mechanics 

00:05:43.939 --> 00:05:45.599
 and his wife 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:49.340
 we say aptitude to carry out all the mobility functions
