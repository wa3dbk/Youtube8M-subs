let's<00:02:43.650> say<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.670> know<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:45.150> big<00:02:45.870> problem

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
let's say you know a big problem

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.340 
let's say you know a big problem
especially<00:02:46.500> with<00:02:46.920> iPhones<00:02:47.370> is<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:48.540> after<00:02:48.930> a

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
especially with iPhones is that after a

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:50.870 
especially with iPhones is that after a
while<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.860> battery<00:02:50.040> starts<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.730> degrade

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
while the battery starts to degrade

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.930 
while the battery starts to degrade
because<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:52.230> either<00:02:52.680> heat<00:02:53.100> problems<00:02:53.610> exert

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
because of either heat problems exert

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.030 
because of either heat problems exert
cetera<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.660> we<00:02:55.080> all<00:02:55.170> know<00:02:55.350> the<00:02:55.500> iphone<00:02:55.830> has<00:02:56.010> a

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
cetera and we all know the iphone has a

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.920 
cetera and we all know the iphone has a
big<00:02:56.280> key<00:02:56.520> chrome<00:02:56.820> from<00:02:57.570> time<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.900> time

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
big key chrome from time to time

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.350 
big key chrome from time to time
depending<00:02:58.380> on<00:02:58.709> what<00:02:58.890> your<00:02:59.040> phone<00:02:59.250> is<00:02:59.459> or<00:03:00.090> which

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
depending on what your phone is or which

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.070 
depending on what your phone is or which
model<00:03:00.959> you<00:03:01.080> have<00:03:01.320> now<00:03:02.010> this<00:03:02.370> would<00:03:02.550> basically

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
model you have now this would basically

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.270 
model you have now this would basically
eliminate<00:03:04.080> them<00:03:04.320> because<00:03:04.770> you'd<00:03:04.950> be<00:03:05.100> able<00:03:05.160> to

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
eliminate them because you'd be able to

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.890 
eliminate them because you'd be able to
change<00:03:05.520> out<00:03:05.790> your<00:03:05.820> battery<00:03:06.270> not<00:03:06.450> only<00:03:06.720> that

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
change out your battery not only that

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.290 
change out your battery not only that
but<00:03:07.170> instead<00:03:07.950> of<00:03:08.070> just<00:03:08.190> a<00:03:08.370> small<00:03:08.670> battery<00:03:09.030> here

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
but instead of just a small battery here

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.540 
but instead of just a small battery here
you<00:03:09.750> be<00:03:09.959> able<00:03:10.050> to<00:03:10.709> upgrade<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:11.160> a<00:03:11.340> bigger

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
you be able to upgrade to a bigger

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.940 
you be able to upgrade to a bigger
battery<00:03:11.940> of<00:03:12.360> course<00:03:13.080> it<00:03:13.290> would<00:03:13.380> cost<00:03:13.620> you

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
battery of course it would cost you

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.130 
battery of course it would cost you
certain<00:03:14.370> parts<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:14.910> stuff<00:03:15.030> that<00:03:15.930> you'd<00:03:16.110> have

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
certain parts and stuff that you'd have

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.090 
certain parts and stuff that you'd have
to<00:03:16.470> take<00:03:16.770> off<00:03:16.950> in<00:03:17.190> order<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.489> do<00:03:17.700> that<00:03:19.010> so<00:03:20.010> as

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
to take off in order to do that so as

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.050 
to take off in order to do that so as
you<00:03:20.160> could<00:03:20.400> probably<00:03:20.459> see<00:03:20.760> right<00:03:20.880> here

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
you could probably see right here

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.780 
you could probably see right here
instead<00:03:21.630> of<00:03:21.780> what<00:03:21.930> they<00:03:22.080> have<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:22.530> instep<00:03:23.250> the

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
instead of what they have the instep the

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.610 
instead of what they have the instep the
apps<00:03:24.030> were<00:03:24.450> they<00:03:24.660> basically<00:03:24.989> have<00:03:25.260> block

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
apps were they basically have block

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.620 
apps were they basically have block
store<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:26.220> this<00:03:26.700> will<00:03:26.850> allow<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.390> buy

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
store and this will allow you to buy

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.800 
store and this will allow you to buy
upgrade<00:03:28.380> part<00:03:28.890> 6<00:03:29.280> etcetera<00:03:29.580> so<00:03:30.090> as<00:03:30.720> you

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
upgrade part 6 etcetera so as you

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.330 
upgrade part 6 etcetera so as you
probably<00:03:31.110> see<00:03:31.290> here<00:03:31.560> you've<00:03:31.769> got<00:03:31.980> just<00:03:32.190> the

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
probably see here you've got just the

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.370 
probably see here you've got just the
touch<00:03:32.580> screen<00:03:32.730> you've<00:03:33.630> got<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.870> touchscreen

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
touch screen you've got a touchscreen

with<00:03:34.739> three<00:03:34.980> button<00:03:35.310> and<00:03:35.580> then<00:03:35.700> you've<00:03:35.820> got

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
with three button and then you've got

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.850 
with three button and then you've got
just<00:03:36.239> a<00:03:36.420> standard<00:03:36.810> display<00:03:37.049> screen<00:03:37.560> with<00:03:37.739> your

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
just a standard display screen with your

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.660 
just a standard display screen with your

probably<00:03:41.910> see<00:03:42.150> here<00:03:42.450> how<00:03:42.720> it<00:03:42.870> has<00:03:43.049> a<00:03:43.440> bigger

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
probably see here how it has a bigger

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:48.190 
probably see here how it has a bigger
battery<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:45.330> larger<00:03:46.110> speaker<00:03:46.650> with<00:03:47.070> minimal

I'm going to mute it but it basically

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.029 
I'm going to mute it but it basically
goes<00:05:32.909> over<00:05:33.539> the<00:05:33.719> basic<00:05:34.139> fundamentals<00:05:34.319> about

00:05:35.029 --> 00:05:35.039 
goes over the basic fundamentals about

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:39.050 
goes over the basic fundamentals about
this<00:05:35.509> so<00:05:36.509> as<00:05:36.840> you<00:05:36.870> probably<00:05:37.199> see<00:05:37.440> here<00:05:38.060> like

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
this so as you probably see here like

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.559 
this so as you probably see here like
they<00:05:39.270> give<00:05:39.449> an<00:05:39.569> example<00:05:39.870> on<00:05:40.259> the<00:05:40.440> camera<00:05:40.860> the

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:41.569 
they give an example on the camera the

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:46.010 
they give an example on the camera the
lens<00:05:42.569> was<00:05:43.440> broken<00:05:43.800> on<00:05:43.949> the<00:05:44.099> phone<00:05:44.370> the<00:05:45.180> board

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
lens was broken on the phone the board

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.990 
lens was broken on the phone the board
was<00:05:46.139> broken<00:05:46.560> on<00:05:46.650> that<00:05:46.860> phone<00:05:47.130> there<00:05:47.460> was<00:05:47.669> a

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
was broken on that phone there was a

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.850 
was broken on that phone there was a
problem<00:05:48.330> with<00:05:48.569> the<00:05:48.680> storage<00:05:51.139> so<00:05:52.139> it<00:05:52.440> basically

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
problem with the storage so it basically

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.740 
problem with the storage so it basically
just<00:05:53.430> goes<00:05:53.639> over<00:05:53.909> everything<00:05:54.449> wrong<00:05:54.719> with

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
just goes over everything wrong with

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.309 
just goes over everything wrong with
current<00:05:55.289> phones<00:05:55.500> and<00:05:55.740> everything<00:05:55.800> and<00:05:57.139> it's<00:05:58.139> a

00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 
current phones and everything and it's a

00:05:58.319 --> 00:06:01.519 
current phones and everything and it's a
really<00:05:58.680> really<00:05:59.370> good<00:05:59.669> idea<00:06:00.150> I<00:06:00.449> must<00:06:00.960> say<00:06:01.199> it

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:01.529 
really really good idea I must say it

00:06:01.529 --> 00:06:03.620 
really really good idea I must say it
definitely<00:06:02.370> is<00:06:02.580> probably<00:06:03.090> one<00:06:03.240> of<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:03.419> best

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:03.630 
definitely is probably one of the best

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.890 
definitely is probably one of the best
ideas<00:06:04.110> ever<00:06:04.319> now<00:06:05.009> there<00:06:05.550> was<00:06:05.819> an<00:06:05.969> idea<00:06:06.240> similar

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
ideas ever now there was an idea similar

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.519 
ideas ever now there was an idea similar
to<00:06:07.110> this<00:06:07.259> with<00:06:07.529> laptops<00:06:08.130> in<00:06:08.340> the<00:06:08.460> past

00:06:09.519 --> 00:06:09.529 
to this with laptops in the past

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:11.689 
to this with laptops in the past
although<00:06:10.529> I<00:06:10.560> don't<00:06:10.949> believe<00:06:11.159> it<00:06:11.370> was<00:06:11.520> ever

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:11.699 
although I don't believe it was ever

00:06:11.699 --> 00:06:14.589 
although I don't believe it was ever
crowdfunded<00:06:12.479> so<00:06:12.690> it<00:06:12.810> didn't<00:06:13.020> really<00:06:13.080> go<00:06:13.289> far<00:06:13.710> i

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:14.599 
crowdfunded so it didn't really go far i

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.659 
crowdfunded so it didn't really go far i
I've<00:06:15.599> never<00:06:15.659> really<00:06:16.380> seen<00:06:16.889> much<00:06:17.069> of<00:06:17.130> the<00:06:17.370> idea

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
I've never really seen much of the idea

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:20.209 
I've never really seen much of the idea
since<00:06:17.969> then<00:06:18.270> and<00:06:18.569> I<00:06:18.840> personally<00:06:19.560> had<00:06:19.949> a

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:20.219 
since then and I personally had a

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:22.939 
since then and I personally had a
similar<00:06:20.759> idea<00:06:20.940> in<00:06:21.479> the<00:06:21.960> past<00:06:22.259> but<00:06:22.620> not<00:06:22.770> her

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:22.949 
similar idea in the past but not her

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:25.450 
similar idea in the past but not her
phones<00:06:23.250> it<00:06:23.520> was<00:06:23.610> more<00:06:23.940> meant<00:06:24.120> for<00:06:24.300> like

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
phones it was more meant for like

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.339 
phones it was more meant for like
smaller<00:06:26.460> devices<00:06:26.909> like<00:06:27.389> cameras<00:06:28.050> and<00:06:28.259> stuff

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:28.349 
smaller devices like cameras and stuff

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:31.249 
smaller devices like cameras and stuff
like<00:06:28.560> that<00:06:28.620> never<00:06:29.520> really<00:06:29.819> thought<00:06:30.750> of<00:06:30.810> it<00:06:31.020> for

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 
like that never really thought of it for

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:34.209 
like that never really thought of it for
phones<00:06:31.500> or<00:06:31.740> laptops<00:06:31.860> or<00:06:32.340> anything<00:06:32.639> like<00:06:32.669> that

00:06:34.209 --> 00:06:34.219 
phones or laptops or anything like that

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:37.070 
phones or laptops or anything like that
but<00:06:35.240> again<00:06:36.240> I<00:06:36.449> definitely<00:06:36.479> recommend

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 
but again I definitely recommend

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.469 
but again I definitely recommend
checking<00:06:37.409> these<00:06:37.710> guys<00:06:37.919> out<00:06:38.250> it's<00:06:39.149> probably

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 
checking these guys out it's probably

00:06:39.479 --> 00:06:40.850 
checking these guys out it's probably
one<00:06:39.750> of<00:06:39.779> the<00:06:39.930> better<00:06:40.080> ideas<00:06:40.560> I

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
one of the better ideas I

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.540 
one of the better ideas I
seen<00:06:41.129> this<00:06:41.849> year<00:06:42.330> or<00:06:42.569> pretty<00:06:43.349> much<00:06:43.379> ever<00:06:43.800> in<00:06:44.250> my

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
seen this year or pretty much ever in my

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.629 
seen this year or pretty much ever in my
experience<00:06:45.120> with<00:06:45.300> tech<00:06:45.509> um<00:06:45.810> I<00:06:46.710> personally

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 
experience with tech um I personally

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:51.559 
experience with tech um I personally
think<00:06:48.180> this<00:06:48.780> could<00:06:49.080> go<00:06:49.319> far<00:06:49.740> I<00:06:50.400> think<00:06:51.240> it<00:06:51.419> can

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:51.569 
think this could go far I think it can

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:54.830 
think this could go far I think it can
work<00:06:51.599> well<00:06:52.819> now<00:06:53.819> I've<00:06:54.030> seen<00:06:54.060> it<00:06:54.240> quite<00:06:54.569> a<00:06:54.629> few

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 
work well now I've seen it quite a few

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.589 
work well now I've seen it quite a few
comments<00:06:55.110> out<00:06:55.469> on<00:06:55.680> this<00:06:55.949> so<00:06:56.159> far<00:06:56.430> saying<00:06:56.849> well

00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 
comments out on this so far saying well

00:06:57.599 --> 00:07:00.980 
comments out on this so far saying well
if<00:06:57.930> you<00:06:58.050> drop<00:06:58.289> it<00:06:58.500> it'll<00:06:58.740> fall<00:06:58.979> apart<00:06:59.840> the<00:07:00.840> way

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 
if you drop it it'll fall apart the way

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:06.409 
if you drop it it'll fall apart the way
it's<00:07:01.199> designed<00:07:01.469> it<00:07:02.750> won't<00:07:04.969> the<00:07:05.969> way<00:07:06.180> it's

00:07:06.409 --> 00:07:06.419 
it's designed it won't the way it's

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:08.990 
it's designed it won't the way it's
pretty<00:07:07.169> much<00:07:07.259> set<00:07:07.620> up<00:07:07.800> it<00:07:08.129> should<00:07:08.189> work

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 
pretty much set up it should work

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.270 
pretty much set up it should work
properly<00:07:09.629> because<00:07:10.409> the<00:07:10.770> way<00:07:10.889> the<00:07:11.069> leads

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:11.280 
properly because the way the leads

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.179 
properly because the way the leads
worked<00:07:11.610> out<00:07:11.819> when<00:07:12.090> he<00:07:12.330> showed<00:07:12.599> the<00:07:13.259> basic<00:07:13.830> idea

00:07:14.179 --> 00:07:14.189 
worked out when he showed the basic idea

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:19.670 
worked out when he showed the basic idea
of<00:07:14.310> the<00:07:15.229> board<00:07:17.240> each<00:07:18.240> board<00:07:18.779> has<00:07:19.110> a<00:07:19.139> set<00:07:19.590> amount

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 
of the board each board has a set amount

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.279 
of the board each board has a set amount
of<00:07:19.830> leads<00:07:20.129> and<00:07:20.449> those<00:07:21.449> leisure<00:07:21.779> centres

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:22.289 
of leads and those leisure centres

00:07:22.289 --> 00:07:25.070 
of leads and those leisure centres
correspond<00:07:23.120> correctly<00:07:24.120> no<00:07:24.300> matter<00:07:24.509> how<00:07:25.020> you

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 
correspond correctly no matter how you

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.990 
correspond correctly no matter how you
put<00:07:25.770> this<00:07:26.340> together<00:07:26.599> so<00:07:27.949> honestly<00:07:28.949> it<00:07:29.279> could

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 
put this together so honestly it could

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.990 
put this together so honestly it could
work<00:07:30.270> it<00:07:30.810> probably<00:07:31.560> will<00:07:31.710> work<00:07:31.979> and<00:07:32.250> it'll

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:33.000 
work it probably will work and it'll

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.649 
work it probably will work and it'll
definitely<00:07:33.419> reach<00:07:34.020> it<00:07:35.389> considering<00:07:36.389> it's<00:07:36.509> got

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:36.659 
definitely reach it considering it's got

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:38.209 
definitely reach it considering it's got
over<00:07:36.930> a<00:07:36.960> month<00:07:37.229> left<00:07:37.439> and<00:07:37.740> it's<00:07:37.860> already<00:07:38.159> at

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:40.590 
ninety-five percent support in just

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:44.420 
ninety-five percent support in just
about<00:07:40.919> a<00:07:40.979> week<00:07:41.569> this<00:07:42.569> may<00:07:42.930> work<00:07:43.620> out<00:07:43.830> to<00:07:44.069> be<00:07:44.219> one

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:44.430 
about a week this may work out to be one
