00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
like the little iron dagger just because

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.020 
like the little iron dagger just because
they<00:01:10.860> take<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.189> least<00:01:11.369> amount<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.760> supplies

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.679 
they take the least amount of supplies
and<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.630> get<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.990> same<00:01:13.020> amount<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.770> level<00:01:14.310> up

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
and you get the same amount of level up

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.240 
and you get the same amount of level up
skill<00:01:15.689> experience<00:01:15.720> every<00:01:16.530> time<00:01:16.560> which<00:01:17.100> you

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
could track there in the bottom right so

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.530 
could track there in the bottom right so
you<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.369> just<00:01:20.580> get<00:01:20.790> tons<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.150> supplies<00:01:21.420> and

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
you'll get the same level of skill

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.480 
you'll get the same level of skill
experience<00:01:26.880> as<00:01:27.420> you<00:01:27.509> would<00:01:27.659> if<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.840> made<00:01:28.110> a

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
experience as you would if you made a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.620 
experience as you would if you made a
bunch<00:01:29.490> of<00:01:29.670> high<00:01:30.060> level<00:01:30.390> things<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:32.630> pretty

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
bunch of high level things so pretty

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.319 
bunch of high level things so pretty
simple<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.020> see<00:01:34.200> my<00:01:34.500> smithing<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.340> already<00:01:35.610> 57

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
simple you see my smithing is already 57

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.700 
simple you see my smithing is already 57
and<00:01:36.780> I've<00:01:37.020> never<00:01:37.229> really<00:01:37.530> done<00:01:37.560> anything

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
and I've never really done anything

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.469 
and I've never really done anything
other<00:01:38.400> than<00:01:38.520> make<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> ton<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.030> these<00:01:39.240> little

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
other than make a ton of these little

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:42.020 
other than make a ton of these little
daggers<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.020> whatnot<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:40.530> you<00:01:41.460> see<00:01:41.640> how<00:01:41.850> fast

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
daggers and whatnot so you see how fast

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.600 
daggers and whatnot so you see how fast
it's<00:01:42.329> going<00:01:42.420> up<00:01:42.720> there<00:01:42.899> in<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.110> bottom<00:01:43.229> right

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
it's going up there in the bottom right

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:48.050 
it's going up there in the bottom right
it's<00:01:44.610> just<00:01:44.820> crazy<00:01:46.130> if<00:01:47.130> they<00:01:47.670> run<00:01:47.880> out<00:01:47.939> of

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
it's just crazy if they run out of

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.109 
it's just crazy if they run out of
supplies<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.600> there<00:01:48.990> aren't<00:01:49.140> much<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.829> make

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
supplies and there aren't much to make

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.960 
supplies and there aren't much to make
usually<00:01:51.119> waiting<00:01:51.659> 48<00:01:52.200> hours<00:01:52.560> or<00:01:52.829> sleeping<00:01:53.700> for

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
usually waiting 48 hours or sleeping for

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.609 
usually waiting 48 hours or sleeping for
two<00:01:54.000> days<00:01:54.329> or<00:01:54.689> leaving<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:55.020> town<00:01:55.200> doing<00:01:55.470> a

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
two days or leaving the town doing a

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.859 
two days or leaving the town doing a
couple<00:01:55.920> cuesta<00:01:56.310> coming<00:01:56.549> back<00:01:56.840> they'll<00:01:57.840> be

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
couple cuesta coming back they'll be

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.330 
couple cuesta coming back they'll be
resupplied<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:59.659> you<00:02:00.659> probably<00:02:00.899> only<00:02:01.890> be<00:02:02.070> able

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
resupplied so you probably only be able

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.209 
resupplied so you probably only be able
to<00:02:02.430> get<00:02:02.579> about<00:02:02.759> 20<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.659> 25<00:02:04.170> skill<00:02:04.740> points<00:02:05.070> up

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
to get about 20 to 25 skill points up

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.419 
to get about 20 to 25 skill points up
each<00:02:05.610> time<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:06.530> that<00:02:07.530> would<00:02:07.740> only<00:02:07.920> mean<00:02:08.310> you

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
each time but that would only mean you

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.029 
each time but that would only mean you
have<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.640> do<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.849> about<00:02:09.030> four<00:02:09.300> times<00:02:09.330> so<00:02:10.020> it's<00:02:10.950> a

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
have to do it about four times so it's a

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.370 
have to do it about four times so it's a
very<00:02:11.069> easy<00:02:11.310> way<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.730> get<00:02:11.970> your<00:02:12.090> smithing<00:02:12.390> up

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
very easy way to get your smithing up

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.410 
very easy way to get your smithing up

and then once you start to raise your
smithing<00:02:15.660> up<00:02:15.930> hopefully<00:02:16.200> you'll<00:02:16.470> level<00:02:16.680> up

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
smithing up hopefully you'll level up

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.520 
smithing up hopefully you'll level up
once<00:02:17.100> or<00:02:17.280> twice<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:18.600> in<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.810> level<00:02:19.080> up<00:02:19.200> screen
