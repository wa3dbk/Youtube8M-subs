in the last two videos we created

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.040 
in the last two videos we created
ourselves<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.250> window<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.449> game<00:00:24.660> panel

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
ourselves a window and the game panel

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.960 
ourselves a window and the game panel
class<00:00:25.789> which<00:00:26.789> handles<00:00:27.210> all<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.570> our<00:00:28.699> game<00:00:29.699> loop

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
class which handles all of our game loop

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.850 
class which handles all of our game loop
and<00:00:30.890> drawing<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.099> stuff<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:33.469> in<00:00:34.469> this<00:00:34.710> video

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
and drawing and stuff so in this video

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.720 
and drawing and stuff so in this video
we're<00:00:35.280> actually<00:00:35.370> gonna<00:00:35.579> be<00:00:35.700> creating<00:00:37.730> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
we're actually gonna be creating the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.560 
we're actually gonna be creating the
game<00:00:38.969> state<00:00:39.329> manager<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:40.730> what<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:41.910> does<00:00:42.180> is

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
game state manager and what this does is

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.389 
game state manager and what this does is
it<00:00:43.020> manages<00:00:43.469> all<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.710> states<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.219> if<00:00:44.309> you're

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
it manages all the states so if you're

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.069 
it manages all the states so if you're
in<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.550> PAS<00:00:44.730> state<00:00:45.090> it's<00:00:45.210> gonna<00:00:45.360> update<00:00:45.600> and

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
in the PAS state it's gonna update and

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.740 
in the PAS state it's gonna update and
draw<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.559> pause<00:00:46.890> state<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.430> check<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:48.450> key

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
draw the pause state and check for key

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.600 
draw the pause state and check for key
presses<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.260> pause<00:00:49.469> date<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.950> if<00:00:50.430> you're

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
presses in the pause date and if you're

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.290 
presses in the pause date and if you're
in<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.629> level<00:00:52.020> 1<00:00:52.050> state<00:00:52.500> per<00:00:52.800> se<00:00:53.059> we<00:00:54.059> would<00:00:54.180> be

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
in the level 1 state per se we would be

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.270 
in the level 1 state per se we would be
updating<00:00:54.719> all<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.870> enemies<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.039> player

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
updating all the enemies and the player

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.450 
updating all the enemies and the player
in<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.879> state<00:00:57.410> so<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.469> get<00:00:58.590> started<00:00:58.710> let's

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
in that state so to get started let's

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.779 
in that state so to get started let's
just<00:00:59.760> create<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.000> class<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:01.789> create

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
just create that class and create

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.880 
just create that class and create
ourselves<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.270> constructor<00:01:03.719> public<00:01:04.589> game

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
ourselves a constructor public game

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.480 
ourselves a constructor public game
state<00:01:05.159> manager<00:01:05.930> manager<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.369> we're<00:01:08.369> gonna

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
state manager manager and we're gonna

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.460 
state manager manager and we're gonna
need<00:01:08.670> 4<00:01:08.970> different<00:01:09.119> methods<00:01:09.540> public<00:01:10.290> void

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
need 4 different methods public void

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:19.219 
need 4 different methods public void
tick<00:01:12.560> and<00:01:14.390> public<00:01:15.390> void<00:01:17.240> draw<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.720> that's

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
tick and public void draw and that's

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.910 
tick and public void draw and that's
going<00:01:19.409> to<00:01:19.470> take<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.330> graphics<00:01:21.830> object

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.069 

public<00:01:25.939> void<00:01:28.220> key<00:01:29.220> pressed<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.960> these<00:01:30.960> are

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
public void key pressed and these are

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.170 
public void key pressed and these are
actually<00:01:31.290> two<00:01:31.320> taken<00:01:31.650> integers<00:01:32.130> you'll<00:01:32.970> see

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
actually two taken integers you'll see

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.580 
actually two taken integers you'll see
why<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.630> little<00:01:33.840> bit<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.200> key<00:01:35.159> released

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
why in a little bit and key released

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.889 
why in a little bit and key released
into<00:01:37.590> K<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:39.200> that's<00:01:40.200> that's<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.100> for<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:42.750> game

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
into K so that's that's it for the game

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.600 
into K so that's that's it for the game
state<00:01:43.140> manager<00:01:43.500> right<00:01:43.649> now<00:01:43.799> let's<00:01:44.369> go<00:01:44.490> back

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
state manager right now let's go back

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.950 
state manager right now let's go back
into<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.820> game<00:01:44.970> panel<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.420> create<00:01:45.659> an<00:01:45.810> object

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
into the game panel and create an object

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.530 
into the game panel and create an object
of<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.820> so<00:01:47.820> private<00:01:48.299> game<00:01:49.009> state<00:01:50.540> manager

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
of this so private game state manager

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.060 
of this so private game state manager
GSM<00:01:52.549> alright<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:54.649> then<00:01:55.649> your<00:01:55.829> let's

we're going to call these methods that
are<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.310> game<00:02:11.459> state<00:02:11.700> manager<00:02:12.150> and<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260

pressed so I said it was integer we just

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.920 
pressed so I said it was integer we just
do<00:02:34.739> eat<00:02:34.980> get<00:02:35.340> key<00:02:35.609> code<00:02:35.909> so<00:02:36.659> that<00:02:36.689> we<00:02:36.870> don't

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
do eat get key code so that we don't

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.390 
do eat get key code so that we don't
have<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.260> pass<00:02:37.439> we<00:02:37.709> don't<00:02:37.859> have<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:40.129> use<00:02:41.129> key

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
have to pass we don't have to use key

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.080 
have to pass we don't have to use key
events<00:02:41.790> it's<00:02:42.120> just<00:02:42.389> a<00:02:42.450> little<00:02:42.569> bit<00:02:42.750> easier

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
events it's just a little bit easier

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:51.409 
events it's just a little bit easier
either<00:02:45.090> get<00:02:45.480> key<00:02:45.689> code<00:02:49.760> now<00:02:50.760> we<00:02:50.849> aren't<00:02:51.209> gonna

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:51.419 
either get key code now we aren't gonna

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:53.179 
either get key code now we aren't gonna
use<00:02:51.689> the<00:02:51.900> key<00:02:52.079> type<00:02:52.290> 2<00:02:52.439> method<00:02:52.739> because<00:02:52.980> that's

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:53.189 
use the key type 2 method because that's

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.159 
use the key type 2 method because that's
not<00:02:53.489> really<00:02:53.760> useful<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.209> us<00:02:54.329> right<00:02:54.480> now<00:02:54.540> oh<00:02:54.810> and

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:55.169 
not really useful to us right now oh and

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:57.319 
not really useful to us right now oh and
also<00:02:55.409> in<00:02:55.709> the<00:02:55.799> paint<00:02:56.010> component<00:02:56.519> we're<00:02:57.209> just

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:57.329 
also in the paint component we're just

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.659 
also in the paint component we're just
going<00:02:57.450> to<00:02:57.480> do<00:02:57.599> G<00:02:57.870> dot<00:02:58.049> clear<00:02:58.700> rect<00:03:01.340> zero<00:03:02.340> zero

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:02.669 
going to do G dot clear rect zero zero

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:04.849 
going to do G dot clear rect zero zero
with<00:03:02.879> height<00:03:03.150> so<00:03:03.810> basically<00:03:04.200> it'll<00:03:04.439> clear<00:03:04.709> the

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
with height so basically it'll clear the

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.020 
with height so basically it'll clear the
whole<00:03:05.040> screen<00:03:05.340> before<00:03:05.790> drawing<00:03:06.150> in<00:03:06.359> the<00:03:06.450> next

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
whole screen before drawing in the next

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.860 
whole screen before drawing in the next
layer<00:03:11.150> so<00:03:12.150> yeah<00:03:12.239> that's<00:03:12.389> it<00:03:12.480> for<00:03:12.629> the<00:03:12.689> game

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
layer so yeah that's it for the game

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.500 
layer so yeah that's it for the game
panel<00:03:13.530> we<00:03:14.340> pretty<00:03:14.579> much<00:03:14.760> won't<00:03:14.969> have<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.359> even

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
panel we pretty much won't have to even

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.000 
panel we pretty much won't have to even
change<00:03:15.780> this<00:03:16.079> throughout<00:03:16.409> the<00:03:16.620> rest<00:03:16.799> of<00:03:16.950> the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
change this throughout the rest of the

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.189 
change this throughout the rest of the
series<00:03:17.219> I<00:03:17.400> don't<00:03:17.549> think<00:03:17.699> so<00:03:18.449> let's<00:03:18.989> actually

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:19.199 
series I don't think so let's actually

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.509 
series I don't think so let's actually
we're<00:03:19.590> actually<00:03:19.709> going<00:03:19.949> to<00:03:20.040> create<00:03:20.220> another

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
we're actually going to create another

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.849 
we're actually going to create another
class<00:03:20.819> and<00:03:21.299> we're<00:03:22.109> gonna<00:03:22.199> call<00:03:22.440> this<00:03:22.470> game

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
class and we're gonna call this game

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:23.390 
class and we're gonna call this game
state

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
state

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.059 
state
now<00:03:23.849> this<00:03:24.419> gamestate<00:03:24.930> class<00:03:24.959> is<00:03:25.500> going<00:03:25.829> to<00:03:25.949> be

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
now this gamestate class is going to be

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.789 
now this gamestate class is going to be
an<00:03:26.220> abstract<00:03:26.760> class<00:03:27.169> so<00:03:28.169> basically<00:03:28.590> what<00:03:28.769> that

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
an abstract class so basically what that

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.129 
an abstract class so basically what that
means<00:03:28.919> is<00:03:29.250> we<00:03:29.459> cannot<00:03:29.760> create<00:03:30.299> an<00:03:30.569> instance<00:03:31.019> of

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
means is we cannot create an instance of

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.140 
means is we cannot create an instance of
this<00:03:31.290> class<00:03:31.349> we<00:03:31.709> can<00:03:31.829> only<00:03:31.949> create<00:03:32.220> instances

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
this class we can only create instances

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.229 
this class we can only create instances
of<00:03:33.299> classes<00:03:33.780> that<00:03:33.810> inherit<00:03:35.060> from<00:03:36.060> this

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
of classes that inherit from this

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.080 
of classes that inherit from this
gamestate<00:03:36.720> class<00:03:36.949> so<00:03:37.949> to<00:03:38.340> get<00:03:38.519> started<00:03:38.639> we're

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
gamestate class so to get started we're

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.849 
gamestate class so to get started we're
going<00:03:39.209> to<00:03:39.269> create<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.629> protected<00:03:40.379> variable

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
going to create a protected variable

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.899 
going to create a protected variable
game<00:03:41.459> state<00:03:41.760> manager<00:03:42.769> GSM<00:03:43.769> and<00:03:43.979> we're<00:03:44.819> gonna

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
game state manager GSM and we're gonna

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.259 
game state manager GSM and we're gonna
have<00:03:45.209> ourselves<00:03:45.540> a<00:03:46.139> protected<00:03:47.269> constructor

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
have ourselves a protected constructor

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.640 
have ourselves a protected constructor
game<00:03:48.989> state<00:03:50.870> and<00:03:51.870> this<00:03:51.989> is<00:03:52.109> going<00:03:52.199> to<00:03:52.259> take<00:03:52.500> in

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
game state and this is going to take in

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.869 
game state and this is going to take in
a<00:03:52.739> game<00:03:52.769> state<00:03:53.840> manager<00:03:54.840> GSM<00:03:55.799> and<00:03:56.099> what<00:03:56.759> it's

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
a game state manager GSM and what it's

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.509 
a game state manager GSM and what it's
going<00:03:56.909> to<00:03:57.060> do<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.509> it's<00:03:57.659> going<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:57.870> say<00:03:58.519> this

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
going to do is it's going to say this

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.759 
going to do is it's going to say this
gsm<00:04:00.329> equal<00:04:00.599> gsm<00:04:01.049> and<00:04:02.479> then<00:04:03.479> in<00:04:04.409> here<00:04:04.620> i'm<00:04:04.680> going

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
gsm equal gsm and then in here i'm going

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.439 
gsm equal gsm and then in here i'm going
to<00:04:04.829> have<00:04:04.979> a<00:04:05.280> bunch<00:04:05.549> of<00:04:05.729> methods<00:04:06.199> public

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:08.449 
to have a bunch of methods public

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:12.499 
to have a bunch of methods public
abstract<00:04:09.449> void<00:04:10.109> in<00:04:10.829> it<00:04:11.069> now<00:04:12.030> in<00:04:12.209> here<00:04:12.389> we're

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:12.509 
abstract void in it now in here we're

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:17.839 
abstract void in it now in here we're
actually<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.840> call<00:04:13.099> in<00:04:14.099> it<00:04:14.750> a<00:04:15.889> public<00:04:16.889> abstract

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
actually to call in it a public abstract

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:20.759 
actually to call in it a public abstract
void<00:04:19.130> tick

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
void tick

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.320 
void tick
so<00:04:21.280> all<00:04:22.060> of<00:04:22.120> these<00:04:22.449> methods<00:04:23.050> right<00:04:23.440> here<00:04:24.330> are

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
so all of these methods right here are

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.469 
so all of these methods right here are
going<00:04:25.569> to<00:04:25.660> be<00:04:25.720> required<00:04:26.789> not<00:04:27.789> necessarily

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
going to be required not necessarily

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.409 
going to be required not necessarily
used<00:04:28.810> in<00:04:29.020> every<00:04:29.229> single<00:04:29.430> state<00:04:30.430> but<00:04:30.910> required

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
used in every single state but required

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.110 
used in every single state but required
in<00:04:32.289> every<00:04:32.590> single<00:04:32.740> state<00:04:33.009> so<00:04:33.250> we<00:04:33.490> can<00:04:33.729> use<00:04:33.970> them

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
in every single state so we can use them

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.960 
in every single state so we can use them
if<00:04:34.210> we<00:04:34.330> need<00:04:34.479> to<00:04:37.440> now<00:04:38.440> if<00:04:38.590> we<00:04:38.710> want<00:04:38.889> to<00:04:38.979> later<00:04:39.280> we

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
if we need to now if we want to later we

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.260 
if we need to now if we want to later we
can<00:04:40.120> always<00:04:40.330> add<00:04:40.569> in<00:04:41.039> mouse<00:04:42.060> listeners<00:04:43.060> as

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
can always add in mouse listeners as

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.879 
can always add in mouse listeners as
well<00:04:43.539> and<00:04:43.840> we'll<00:04:43.990> have<00:04:44.139> to<00:04:44.289> change<00:04:44.530> that<00:04:44.710> in

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:44.889 
well and we'll have to change that in

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.670 
well and we'll have to change that in
every<00:04:45.190> single<00:04:45.490> one<00:04:45.580> but<00:04:46.229> we<00:04:47.229> won't<00:04:47.410> do<00:04:47.560> that

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
every single one but we won't do that

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.670 
every single one but we won't do that
right<00:04:47.740> now<00:04:48.130> I<00:04:49.050> don't<00:04:50.050> think<00:04:50.199> we're<00:04:50.319> gonna<00:04:50.440> need

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
right now I don't think we're gonna need

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.770 
right now I don't think we're gonna need
that<00:04:50.949> actually<00:04:54.090> so<00:04:55.090> yeah<00:04:55.210> that's<00:04:55.389> it<00:04:55.539> for<00:04:55.569> the

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
that actually so yeah that's it for the

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.890 
that actually so yeah that's it for the
game<00:04:55.960> state<00:04:56.259> manager<00:04:57.159> and<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:58.479> gamestate

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
game state manager and the gamestate

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.719 
game state manager and the gamestate
class<00:04:58.960> now<00:04:59.770> in<00:04:59.919> the<00:05:00.009> game<00:05:00.159> state<00:05:00.370> manager

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729 
class now in the game state manager

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:02.820 
class now in the game state manager
we're<00:05:01.060> just<00:05:01.240> going<00:05:01.360> to<00:05:01.419> create<00:05:01.599> ourselves<00:05:01.960> a

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
we're just going to create ourselves a

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:08.309 
we're just going to create ourselves a
private<00:05:03.370> stack<00:05:04.229> of<00:05:05.229> game<00:05:05.620> States<00:05:06.990> game<00:05:07.990> State

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:08.319 
private stack of game States game State

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:12.689 
private stack of game States game State
and<00:05:08.880> we<00:05:09.880> will<00:05:10.030> just<00:05:10.240> call<00:05:10.419> this<00:05:10.479> states<00:05:11.310> now<00:05:12.310> in

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
and we will just call this states now in

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:15.059 
and we will just call this states now in
the<00:05:13.120> constructor<00:05:13.720> basically<00:05:14.409> we're<00:05:14.949> gonna

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:15.069 
the constructor basically we're gonna

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:19.499 
the constructor basically we're gonna
initialize<00:05:15.819> this<00:05:17.639> so<00:05:18.639> a<00:05:18.669> stack<00:05:19.090> of<00:05:19.120> game

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:19.509 
initialize this so a stack of game

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:25.550 
initialize this so a stack of game
states<00:05:20.940> okay

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.520 

equals<00:05:26.560> new<00:05:26.740> stack<00:05:27.039> my<00:05:27.550> bad<00:05:27.759> new<00:05:28.509> stack<00:05:28.840> all

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
equals new stack my bad new stack all

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.279 
equals new stack my bad new stack all
right<00:05:29.710> so<00:05:30.250> what<00:05:30.969> we're<00:05:31.030> gonna<00:05:31.120> do<00:05:31.360> is<00:05:31.690> we're

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
right so what we're gonna do is we're

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:37.170 
right so what we're gonna do is we're
gonna<00:05:32.349> do<00:05:32.530> States<00:05:32.830> dot<00:05:33.759> peek<00:05:35.070> dot<00:05:36.070> tick<00:05:36.610> so

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
gonna do States dot peek dot tick so

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.439 
gonna do States dot peek dot tick so
basically<00:05:38.340> it's<00:05:39.340> gonna<00:05:39.460> look<00:05:39.699> at<00:05:39.820> the<00:05:39.940> top<00:05:40.180> of

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
basically it's gonna look at the top of

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:42.779 
basically it's gonna look at the top of
the<00:05:40.599> stack<00:05:40.930> so<00:05:41.289> whatever<00:05:41.560> state<00:05:42.159> we<00:05:42.310> add<00:05:42.520> we

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
the stack so whatever state we add we

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:43.800 
the stack so whatever state we add we
pushed<00:05:43.120> onto<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:43.449> stack

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
pushed onto the stack

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:48.060 
pushed onto the stack
delayed<00:05:44.620> it<00:05:45.449> like<00:05:46.449> the<00:05:46.570> last<00:05:46.750> the<00:05:47.409> last<00:05:47.620> one<00:05:47.860> we

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:48.070 
delayed it like the last the last one we

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.469 
delayed it like the last the last one we
pushed<00:05:48.340> onto<00:05:48.580> the<00:05:48.729> stack<00:05:48.789> and<00:05:49.180> it's<00:05:49.300> going<00:05:49.419> to

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
pushed onto the stack and it's going to

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.570 
pushed onto the stack and it's going to
update<00:05:49.599> that<00:05:49.750> so<00:05:49.990> if<00:05:50.110> we<00:05:50.139> push<00:05:50.440> on<00:05:50.590> a<00:05:50.770> pause

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
update that so if we push on a pause

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.640 
update that so if we push on a pause
state<00:05:52.270> it's<00:05:52.690> gonna<00:05:52.810> be<00:05:52.960> updating<00:05:53.289> that<00:05:53.319> and<00:05:53.590> we

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:53.650 
state it's gonna be updating that and we

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.499 
state it's gonna be updating that and we
can<00:05:53.770> just<00:05:53.889> pop<00:05:54.159> it<00:05:54.340> off<00:05:54.460> and<00:05:54.520> go<00:05:54.940> back<00:05:55.180> to<00:05:55.419> the

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:55.509 
can just pop it off and go back to the

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:59.010 
can just pop it off and go back to the
other<00:05:55.659> state<00:05:55.960> it's<00:05:56.139> really<00:05:56.469> him<00:05:57.750> you'll<00:05:58.750> see

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
other state it's really him you'll see

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.580 
other state it's really him you'll see
how<00:05:59.319> that<00:05:59.650> works<00:06:00.539> later<00:06:01.539> on<00:06:01.810> once<00:06:02.139> we<00:06:02.259> start

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
how that works later on once we start

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.469 
how that works later on once we start
actually<00:06:02.889> getting<00:06:03.250> into<00:06:03.669> the<00:06:03.789> game<00:06:04.060> itself

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 
actually getting into the game itself

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.219 
actually getting into the game itself
he<00:06:07.479> pressed<00:06:07.780> Kay<00:06:08.259> and<00:06:09.659> one<00:06:10.659> more

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
he pressed Kay and one more

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:16.890 
he pressed Kay and one more
he<00:06:11.469> released<00:06:11.819> so<00:06:13.590> I'm<00:06:14.590> actually<00:06:14.800> not<00:06:15.009> gonna<00:06:15.900> go

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
he released so I'm actually not gonna go

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.219 
he released so I'm actually not gonna go
into<00:06:17.940> making<00:06:18.940> another<00:06:19.240> state<00:06:19.569> this<00:06:19.960> is<00:06:20.110> all

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:20.229 
into making another state this is all

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:21.809 
into making another state this is all
we're<00:06:20.349> gonna<00:06:20.440> do<00:06:20.680> for<00:06:21.009> the<00:06:21.099> video<00:06:21.310> but<00:06:21.370> I'll<00:06:21.639> go

00:06:21.809 --> 00:06:21.819 
we're gonna do for the video but I'll go

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:23.730 
we're gonna do for the video but I'll go
over<00:06:22.030> a<00:06:22.060> recap<00:06:22.479> so<00:06:23.020> basically<00:06:23.319> be<00:06:23.380> paid<00:06:23.590> of<00:06:23.680> the

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
over a recap so basically be paid of the

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.890 
over a recap so basically be paid of the
game<00:06:23.949> state<00:06:24.190> manager<00:06:24.639> and<00:06:24.819> that<00:06:25.300> manages<00:06:25.810> all

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:25.900 
game state manager and that manages all

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.749 
game state manager and that manages all
the<00:06:25.960> states<00:06:26.319> in<00:06:26.500> the<00:06:26.560> game<00:06:26.800> and<00:06:27.009> updates

00:06:27.749 --> 00:06:27.759 
the states in the game and updates

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.969 
the states in the game and updates
whichever<00:06:28.120> one<00:06:28.330> is<00:06:28.599> currently<00:06:29.349> on<00:06:29.500> the<00:06:29.620> top<00:06:29.830> of

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:29.979 
whichever one is currently on the top of

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:33.209 
whichever one is currently on the top of
the<00:06:30.130> stack<00:06:30.400> and<00:06:31.110> we<00:06:32.110> implemented<00:06:32.440> that<00:06:32.770> into

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:33.219 
the stack and we implemented that into

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:34.320 
the stack and we implemented that into
the<00:06:33.460> game<00:06:33.789> State

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
the game State

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.119 
the game State
or<00:06:34.509> the<00:06:34.930> game<00:06:35.080> panel<00:06:35.470> class<00:06:36.180> so<00:06:37.180> it's<00:06:37.360> calling

00:06:38.119 --> 00:06:38.129 
or the game panel class so it's calling

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:40.830 
or the game panel class so it's calling
inside<00:06:39.129> these<00:06:39.340> methods<00:06:39.789> and<00:06:39.940> then<00:06:40.479> we<00:06:40.599> created

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
inside these methods and then we created

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.909 
inside these methods and then we created
a<00:06:40.930> game<00:06:41.080> state<00:06:43.050> abstract<00:06:44.050> class<00:06:44.319> which<00:06:44.590> we<00:06:44.740> can

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 
a game state abstract class which we can

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:47.760 
a game state abstract class which we can
create<00:06:45.490> subclasses<00:06:46.150> awful<00:06:46.659> so<00:06:47.289> we'll<00:06:47.470> create

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
create subclasses awful so we'll create

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.369 
create subclasses awful so we'll create
classes<00:06:48.370> like<00:06:48.550> a<00:06:48.759> class<00:06:49.479> called<00:06:49.720> menu<00:06:50.080> state

00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:50.379 
classes like a class called menu state

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:53.249 
classes like a class called menu state
and<00:06:50.590> we'll<00:06:50.740> have<00:06:50.919> it<00:06:51.159> extend<00:06:51.789> game<00:06:52.690> state<00:06:53.020> and

00:06:53.249 --> 00:06:53.259 
and we'll have it extend game state and

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:56.219 
and we'll have it extend game state and
it'll<00:06:53.740> have<00:06:53.889> all<00:06:53.919> of<00:06:54.190> these<00:06:54.430> methods<00:06:54.940> and<00:06:55.229> of

00:06:56.219 --> 00:06:56.229 
it'll have all of these methods and of

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:58.290 
it'll have all of these methods and of
this<00:06:56.800> variable<00:06:57.430> these<00:06:57.490> variables<00:06:58.000> and<00:06:58.120> stuff

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:58.300 
this variable these variables and stuff

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.270 
this variable these variables and stuff
so<00:06:59.259> that's<00:06:59.440> that's<00:06:59.680> really<00:06:59.800> it<00:07:00.039> for<00:07:00.190> this

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 
so that's that's really it for this

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.249 
so that's that's really it for this
