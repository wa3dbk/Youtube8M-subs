but<00:01:49.259> one<00:01:49.469> thing<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.770> have<00:01:49.859> noticed<00:01:50.069> is<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.429> now

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
but one thing I have noticed is that now

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.669 
but one thing I have noticed is that now
have<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.240> keep<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.569> tripod<00:01:51.959> a<00:01:52.170> little<00:01:52.590> bit

00:01:52.669 --> 00:01:52.679 
have to keep the tripod a little bit

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.830 
have to keep the tripod a little bit
further<00:01:53.069> away<00:01:53.280> because<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.000> dense<00:01:54.209> is<00:01:54.359> not<00:01:54.599> as

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
further away because the dense is not as

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.499 
further away because the dense is not as
wide<00:01:55.140> compared<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.130> samsung<00:01:56.729> galaxy<00:01:56.759> s6
