difference<00:00:37.620> there's<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.309> few<00:00:38.700> things

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
difference there's a few things

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.170 
difference there's a few things
aesthetically<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:41.010> boxes<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:41.790> will

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
aesthetically on the boxes that you will

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.119 
aesthetically on the boxes that you will
notice<00:00:42.600> are<00:00:42.840> different<00:00:43.260> we're<00:00:43.620> talking<00:00:43.980> like

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
notice are different we're talking like

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.000 
notice are different we're talking like
millimeters<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.270> difference<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.260> e<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.710> maybe

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
millimeters in difference the e is maybe

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.310 
millimeters in difference the e is maybe
designed<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.760> little<00:00:48.120> bit<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.480> resemble<00:00:49.079> what

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
designed a little bit to resemble what

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.290 
designed a little bit to resemble what
the<00:00:49.500> Xbox<00:00:50.100> one<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.520> going<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.910> look<00:00:51.120> like

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
the Xbox one is going to look like

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.750 
the Xbox one is going to look like
aesthetically<00:00:52.079> other<00:00:52.379> than<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.460> you're<00:00:53.730> not

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
aesthetically other than that you're not

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.250 
aesthetically other than that you're not
going<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.030> find<00:00:54.300> any<00:00:54.510> difference<00:00:54.870> they've

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
going to find any difference they've

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.619 
going to find any difference they've
taken<00:00:55.590> out<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> usb<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:56.879> this<00:00:57.059> one<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.480> get

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
taken out a usb on this one so you get

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.869 
taken out a usb on this one so you get
four<00:00:57.960> ports<00:00:58.379> instead<00:00:58.739> of<00:00:58.829> five<00:00:59.129> compared<00:00:59.789> to

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
four ports instead of five compared to

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.299 
four ports instead of five compared to
this<00:01:00.059> guy<00:01:00.300> on<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.690> bottom<00:01:01.440> there's<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.129> little

this guy on the bottom there's a little
port<00:01:02.760> for<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.300> for<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.930> hard<00:01:04.170> drive<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.619> you

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
port for the for the hard drive and you

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.280 
port for the for the hard drive and you
can<00:01:04.739> access<00:01:05.250> fairly<00:01:05.700> easily<00:01:05.939> you<00:01:06.540> pop<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:07.020> in

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
can access fairly easily you pop this in

that's arguably an inferior box it turns

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.600 
that's arguably an inferior box it turns
out<00:03:27.150> this<00:03:27.750> is<00:03:27.960> a<00:03:27.990> lot<00:03:28.320> cheaper<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.980> make<00:03:29.310> than

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
out this is a lot cheaper to make than

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.870 
out this is a lot cheaper to make than
the<00:03:29.900> 360s<00:03:30.900> so<00:03:31.650> that's<00:03:31.980> what's<00:03:32.310> happening

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
the 360s so that's what's happening

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.750 
the 360s so that's what's happening
you're<00:03:33.300> getting<00:03:33.630> a<00:03:33.810> console<00:03:34.710> for<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.430> same

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
you're getting a console for the same

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.700 
you're getting a console for the same
price<00:03:36.120> as<00:03:36.150> what<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:36.600> paid<00:03:36.810> last<00:03:37.050> time<00:03:37.290> but<00:03:37.650> it

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.710 
price as what you paid last time but it

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.220 
price as what you paid last time but it
costs<00:03:38.130> Microsoft<00:03:38.700> a<00:03:38.940> little<00:03:39.450> less<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.810> make<00:03:40.020> it

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
costs Microsoft a little less to make it

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.140 
costs Microsoft a little less to make it
so<00:03:40.560> that's<00:03:40.770> what's<00:03:41.040> going<00:03:41.370> on<00:03:41.520> here<00:03:41.580> I<00:03:41.790> guess

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
so that's what's going on here I guess

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.360 
so that's what's going on here I guess
eventually<00:03:42.300> the<00:03:42.870> S<00:03:43.020> will<00:03:43.260> go<00:03:43.410> away<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:44.010> we'll

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
eventually the S will go away and we'll

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.420 
eventually the S will go away and we'll
only<00:03:44.610> be<00:03:44.820> left<00:03:45.060> with<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.300> e<00:03:45.330> but<00:03:46.320> for<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.190> time

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
only be left with the e but for the time

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.630 
only be left with the e but for the time
