hi fast and welcome to that article ick

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:09.430 
hi fast and welcome to that article ick
if<00:00:07.040> this<00:00:07.819> is<00:00:07.970> your<00:00:08.120> first<00:00:08.420> time<00:00:08.750> with<00:00:08.929> acrylics

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
if this is your first time with acrylics

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.009 
if this is your first time with acrylics
you<00:00:09.980> can<00:00:10.219> achieve<00:00:10.580> results<00:00:10.610> close<00:00:11.360> to<00:00:11.600> this<00:00:11.750> if

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
you can achieve results close to this if

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.170 
you can achieve results close to this if
you<00:00:12.290> just<00:00:12.470> follow<00:00:12.769> the<00:00:13.370> step<00:00:13.670> by<00:00:13.700> step<00:00:14.150> guide

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:14.180 
you just follow the step by step guide

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.689 
you just follow the step by step guide
you<00:00:15.080> really<00:00:15.470> will<00:00:15.559> be<00:00:15.590> able<00:00:15.800> to<00:00:15.920> get<00:00:16.099> it<00:00:16.309> there

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
you really will be able to get it there

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.000 
you really will be able to get it there
very<00:00:17.090> simple<00:00:17.630> principles<00:00:18.199> you've<00:00:18.650> just<00:00:18.859> got

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.010 
very simple principles you've just got

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.560 
very simple principles you've just got
to<00:00:19.039> follow<00:00:19.250> them<00:00:19.490> a<00:00:19.699> little<00:00:20.180> bit<00:00:20.330> at<00:00:20.480> a<00:00:20.539> time

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
to follow them a little bit at a time

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.750 
to follow them a little bit at a time
this<00:00:21.410> is<00:00:21.560> what<00:00:21.710> we're<00:00:21.830> going<00:00:21.920> to<00:00:21.980> achieve<00:00:22.100> from

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
this is what we're going to achieve from

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.060 
this is what we're going to achieve from
this<00:00:22.940> painting<00:00:23.240> it's<00:00:24.020> a<00:00:24.080> very<00:00:24.320> simple<00:00:24.619> still

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.070 
this painting it's a very simple still

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.700 
this painting it's a very simple still
live<00:00:25.279> setup<00:00:25.640> but<00:00:26.420> it<00:00:26.539> looks<00:00:27.050> at<00:00:27.170> a<00:00:27.199> lot<00:00:27.470> of<00:00:27.619> the

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
live setup but it looks at a lot of the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.490 
live setup but it looks at a lot of the
principles<00:00:27.980> used<00:00:28.789> in<00:00:29.000> painting<00:00:29.570> a<00:00:29.810> lot<00:00:30.380> of

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
principles used in painting a lot of

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.220 
principles used in painting a lot of
different<00:00:30.830> elements<00:00:31.310> all<00:00:31.430> working<00:00:31.970> together

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
different elements all working together

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.380 
different elements all working together
so<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.680> idea<00:00:34.010> is<00:00:34.100> a<00:00:34.129> negative<00:00:34.699> space<00:00:35.000> which

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
so the idea is a negative space which

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.389 
so the idea is a negative space which
are<00:00:35.570> really<00:00:35.780> helpful<00:00:36.140> for<00:00:36.620> you<00:00:36.770> to<00:00:36.890> be<00:00:37.010> able<00:00:37.160> to

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:37.399 
are really helpful for you to be able to

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.940 
are really helpful for you to be able to
draw<00:00:38.030> things<00:00:38.329> more<00:00:38.600> accurately<00:00:39.140> you'll<00:00:39.770> see

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
draw things more accurately you'll see

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.549 
draw things more accurately you'll see
here<00:00:40.250> in<00:00:40.520> the<00:00:40.670> handle<00:00:40.910> and<00:00:41.450> this<00:00:41.989> little<00:00:42.200> shape

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
here in the handle and this little shape

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.569 
here in the handle and this little shape
here<00:00:42.920> the<00:00:43.910> idea<00:00:44.300> of<00:00:44.600> perspective<00:00:45.079> and<00:00:45.860> giving

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
here the idea of perspective and giving

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.910 
here the idea of perspective and giving
your<00:00:46.730> viewer<00:00:47.059> an<00:00:47.239> idea<00:00:47.600> of<00:00:47.739> relationships<00:00:48.739> and

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
your viewer an idea of relationships and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.819 
your viewer an idea of relationships and
sizes<00:00:49.460> is<00:00:49.820> used<00:00:50.239> with<00:00:50.390> overlap<00:00:50.960> so<00:00:51.500> how<00:00:51.680> we've

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
sizes is used with overlap so how we've

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.069 
sizes is used with overlap so how we've
got<00:00:52.010> lemon<00:00:52.370> placed<00:00:53.030> in<00:00:53.239> front<00:00:53.450> of<00:00:53.719> the<00:00:53.840> jug

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
got lemon placed in front of the jug

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.380 
got lemon placed in front of the jug
here<00:00:54.399> so<00:00:55.399> the<00:00:55.520> method<00:00:55.850> that<00:00:55.879> I'm<00:00:56.149> going<00:00:56.360> to

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
here so the method that I'm going to

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.930 
here so the method that I'm going to
talk<00:00:56.960> through<00:00:56.989> in<00:00:57.410> this<00:00:57.530> painting<00:00:57.800> is<00:00:58.340> using<00:00:58.850> a

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
talk through in this painting is using a

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.910 
talk through in this painting is using a
very<00:00:59.120> limited<00:00:59.420> palette<00:00:59.870> to<00:01:00.110> start<00:01:00.170> with<00:01:00.620> and

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
very limited palette to start with and

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.910 
very limited palette to start with and
then<00:01:01.129> slowly<00:01:01.550> introducing<00:01:02.510> colors<00:01:02.960> as<00:01:03.590> we<00:01:03.770> get

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
then slowly introducing colors as we get

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.060 
then slowly introducing colors as we get
further<00:01:04.159> along<00:01:05.000> closer<00:01:05.390> to<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:05.719> finish

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
further along closer to the finish

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.739 
further along closer to the finish
however<00:01:07.070> and<00:01:07.369> you<00:01:07.399> get<00:01:07.700> more<00:01:08.029> adept<00:01:08.569> at

00:01:08.739 --> 00:01:08.749 
however and you get more adept at

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:10.809 
however and you get more adept at
painting<00:01:09.200> and<00:01:09.380> more<00:01:09.529> used<00:01:09.829> to<00:01:09.950> it<00:01:10.039> you<00:01:10.579> can<00:01:10.729> of

00:01:10.809 --> 00:01:10.819 
painting and more used to it you can of

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:13.090 
painting and more used to it you can of
course<00:01:10.850> start<00:01:11.420> with<00:01:11.689> a<00:01:11.749> full<00:01:12.020> range<00:01:12.319> of<00:01:12.469> colors

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
course start with a full range of colors

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.669 
course start with a full range of colors
to<00:01:13.340> start<00:01:13.670> with<00:01:13.939> and<00:01:14.179> it<00:01:15.020> will<00:01:15.200> be<00:01:15.319> quicker

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679 
to start with and it will be quicker

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.399 
to start with and it will be quicker
than<00:01:16.219> your<00:01:16.310> first<00:01:16.639> one<00:01:16.939> as<00:01:17.630> with<00:01:17.869> everything

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
than your first one as with everything

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.889 
than your first one as with everything
is<00:01:18.619> always<00:01:18.859> better<00:01:19.159> to<00:01:19.249> kind<00:01:20.029> of<00:01:20.060> start<00:01:20.479> slowly

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
is always better to kind of start slowly

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.219 
is always better to kind of start slowly
creep<00:01:21.770> up<00:01:22.039> on<00:01:22.219> it<00:01:22.429> so<00:01:23.029> we<00:01:23.179> don't<00:01:23.389> have<00:01:23.630> hundreds

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.629 
gonna block in our painting this is just
looking<00:01:55.159> at<00:01:55.459> the<00:01:55.609> masses<00:01:56.329> of<00:01:56.599> the<00:01:56.869> drawing<00:01:57.380> as

00:01:57.629 --> 00:01:57.639 
looking at the masses of the drawing as

00:01:57.639 --> 00:02:00.370 
looking at the masses of the drawing as
in<00:01:58.639> what<00:01:58.999> is<00:01:59.149> a<00:01:59.179> tight<00:01:59.450> area<00:01:59.749> and<00:02:00.079> what<00:02:00.229> is<00:02:00.349> a

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
in what is a tight area and what is a

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.089 
in what is a tight area and what is a
dark<00:02:00.709> area<00:02:01.090> this<00:02:02.090> has<00:02:02.239> been<00:02:02.479> shown<00:02:03.380> here<00:02:03.409> from

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:04.099 
dark area this has been shown here from

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:06.669 
dark area this has been shown here from
using<00:02:04.309> one<00:02:04.700> single<00:02:05.090> light<00:02:05.569> source<00:02:05.599> this<00:02:06.529> is

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
using one single light source this is

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.320 
using one single light source this is
very<00:02:06.950> effective<00:02:07.130> when<00:02:07.729> you're<00:02:07.909> painting

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
very effective when you're painting

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.150 
very effective when you're painting
because<00:02:08.959> it<00:02:09.050> really<00:02:09.470> helps<00:02:09.920> to<00:02:09.950> give<00:02:10.130> the

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
because it really helps to give the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.429 
because it really helps to give the
illusion<00:02:10.280> of<00:02:10.849> depth<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:11.810> that's<00:02:12.079> one<00:02:12.290> of<00:02:12.379> the

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:12.439 
illusion of depth and that's one of the

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.259 
illusion of depth and that's one of the
trickiest<00:02:12.860> things<00:02:13.189> to<00:02:13.400> get<00:02:13.579> when<00:02:14.120> you're

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
trickiest things to get when you're

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.390 
trickiest things to get when you're
trying<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.540> convince<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.290> viewer<00:02:15.590> of<00:02:15.890> your

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
trying to convince the viewer of your

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.010 
trying to convince the viewer of your
subject

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
subject

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.740 
subject
if<00:02:17.920> we<00:02:18.190> had<00:02:18.340> lots<00:02:18.640> of<00:02:18.790> different<00:02:19.150> light<00:02:19.360> source

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
if we had lots of different light source

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.690 
if we had lots of different light source
it's<00:02:20.020> all<00:02:20.140> coming<00:02:20.500> from<00:02:20.650> different<00:02:20.830> angles

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
it's all coming from different angles

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.730 
it's all coming from different angles
it<00:02:22.090> will<00:02:22.210> bit<00:02:22.390> more<00:02:22.660> like<00:02:22.900> a<00:02:22.930> photo<00:02:23.290> shoot

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
it will bit more like a photo shoot

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.410 
it will bit more like a photo shoot
where<00:02:23.950> everything<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.490> really<00:02:24.760> highly

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
where everything is really highly

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.930 
where everything is really highly
finished<00:02:25.660> and<00:02:26.380> painting<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.490> want<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.760> try

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
finished and painting you want to try

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.330 
finished and painting you want to try
and<00:02:28.030> keep<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.420> simple<00:02:29.020> so<00:02:29.500> it<00:02:29.650> looks<00:02:29.920> more

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
and keep it simple so it looks more

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.880 
and keep it simple so it looks more
effective<00:02:31.090> so<00:02:31.660> here<00:02:31.930> we've<00:02:32.110> got<00:02:32.260> one<00:02:32.620> light

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
effective so here we've got one light

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.030 
effective so here we've got one light
source<00:02:33.250> which<00:02:33.850> produces<00:02:34.360> lovely<00:02:35.260> shades<00:02:35.560> of

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
source which produces lovely shades of

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.610 
source which produces lovely shades of
what<00:02:36.280> are<00:02:36.370> called<00:02:36.400> cast<00:02:36.910> shadows<00:02:37.600> has<00:02:38.350> in<00:02:38.530> the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
what are called cast shadows has in the

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.570 
what are called cast shadows has in the
shadow<00:02:38.890> cast<00:02:39.370> by<00:02:39.820> an<00:02:40.180> object<00:02:40.360> so<00:02:41.200> grab<00:02:41.890> a<00:02:41.920> broom

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580
