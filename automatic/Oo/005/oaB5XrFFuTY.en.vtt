00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:16.220
 so now we come to a very important 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:21.329
 in fact 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:24.449
 a piece of course is an element floating or 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:28.830
 differently sometimes called anchor 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:33.300
 menu what are the advantages of this menu 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:36.690
 This menu allows you to navigate through 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.000
 Landing is as simple as navigation 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.239
 on the usual site respectively and people 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.129
 who do not like scrolling to which 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.930
 they say I do not like scrolling for a long time 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.940
 down is not for me i'm better at this site and 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.930
 they see your menu click on the one you need 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.940
 a piece and you accordingly respectively 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.070
 configure it so that it is on this piece 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.489
 from the sailor 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:05.660
 what the anchor menu usually consists of 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:11.899
 the anchor menu accordingly consists of 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:13.920
 anchors which is here called bookmark 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:17.490
 further he created 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.310
 consists of a layer that will move 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.240
 like the menu is always sticking on top or 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:28.440
 from the bottom which one wants and accordingly 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.119
 consists of labels or buttons which 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:36.539
 will dangle on this anchor menu 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:39.000
 let's order it first we need it 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:42.090
 directly the layer of the anchor menu itself 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:49.500
 you can do it yourself for 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:53.129
 of this you will need to select a layer here 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:57.080
 so here stretch do right here 

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:58.890
 centering here to do 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.700
 attaching their 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:06.239
 and here choose on the top right where you are it 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.190
 want let's say from above and respectively 

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:11.459
 all now this layer will always be 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.959
 crawling wormwood above or if 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.470
 you do not want to remember all these 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:19.560
 settings here in the ext section 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.439
 has a bottom layer has a thing for you 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.050
 setting it example yellowish you 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.110
 it can 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:30.760
 do whatever you copy it from here and 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:34.950
 insert into the course accordingly like this 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.650
 Now I will show how it works I 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:43.020
 here I change 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:47.890
 its location from top to bottom like this and 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:51.570
 will press preview is now slightly 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.570
 browser shift higher 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:02.680
 Respectively here on the first screen yes and 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.530
 on any other this is a yellow stripe 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.620
 will always go below her we 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:13.290
 then put the buttons directly 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:16.270
 menu so that a person needs navigation 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.330
 some people want a menu 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:27.790
 appeared after the first screen like this 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:37.349
 do accordingly let's say we are here 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:37.349
 attach at the top and when 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:50.290
 make it into the background and but need 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:53.109
 still add that this is all below 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:58.540
 we are going too we must move on 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:04:04.000
 the background to, respectively, then that 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:08.620
 us on the first screen goes it will be higher 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:12.069
 than this layer but the fact that we have it further 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:16.509
 will lower include preview see 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:18.639
 we do not see him and only in this 

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:23.370
 moment she appears 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:27.000
 track this menu where the layer ends 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:33.690
 Iâ€™m barely visible to you now 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:36.849
 I will shift the browser here it is not on top of 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:40.060
 the person starts scrolling down a bit and 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:43.570
 the menu appears and then it will be later 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.580
 all the time walk the sphere accordingly with 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.039
 the most important element of the layer we 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:52.750
 get it right if you want this 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:59.639
 less left the example on the right you just 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:59.639
 here you change us on the right and make 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:11.210
 affairs 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:13.279
 your menu for this is 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:15.169
 so and put where not always to the right 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:21.039
 then when previewing 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:21.039
 this menu is always here right 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:32.319
 what's the disadvantage why not to do 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:35.539
 menu on the right or on the left the thing is that 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:38.119
 modernity is very much in many people either 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:39.949
 computers with square monitors 

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:40.959
 which your landing page will open right 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.729
 level in rum 

00:05:40.959 --> 00:05:45.619
 or else people will start to open on 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.599
 mobile and tablet now 

00:05:45.619 --> 00:05:48.999
 A rather large market share is occupied 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:52.999
 mobile tablets 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:56.389
 accordingly this menu will start walking 

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:58.129
 here on this part yes, right on need to 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:02.019
 your client information 

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:05.449
 prevent him from reading it and accordingly 

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:07.490
 will worsen the conversion better if 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:10.389
 make the menu then do with sticking 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.389
 top or bottom 

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:16.939
 then I will tell you how to directly 

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:20.199
 arrange anchors for later 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:20.199
 use the menu
