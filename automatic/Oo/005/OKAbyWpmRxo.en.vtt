00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
here I think the first step is having a

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.490 
here I think the first step is having a
good<00:00:31.260> toothbrush<00:00:31.710> right<00:00:36.350> really<00:00:37.350> use

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
something that's gonna get in there and

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.119 
something that's gonna get in there and

well<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.850> know<00:01:17.970> most<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.390> these<00:01:18.509> toothpastes

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170

that you buy at grocery stores have

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.630 
that you buy at grocery stores have
and<00:01:22.750> even<00:01:23.110> brainwash<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.649> think<00:01:23.829> that<00:01:23.979> Florida

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
and even brainwash to think that Florida

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.039 
and even brainwash to think that Florida
is<00:01:24.700> so<00:01:24.880> essential<00:01:25.329> for<00:01:25.360> our<00:01:25.600> dental<00:01:25.960> health

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
is so essential for our dental health

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.630 
is so essential for our dental health
and<00:01:26.229> this<00:01:26.289> is<00:01:26.469> really<00:01:26.770> not<00:01:26.920> true<00:01:27.189> the<00:01:27.340> research

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
and this is really not true the research

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.639 
and this is really not true the research
does<00:01:27.820> not<00:01:28.000> really<00:01:28.210> support<00:01:28.390> that<00:01:28.810> so<00:01:29.350> I

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
does not really support that so I

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.200 
does not really support that so I
actually<00:01:29.799> recommend<00:01:30.340> to<00:01:30.460> have<00:01:30.579> a<00:01:30.909> toothpaste

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
actually recommend to have a toothpaste

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.120 
actually recommend to have a toothpaste
without<00:01:31.659> fluoride<00:01:31.990> in<00:01:32.229> it<00:01:32.350> I<00:01:32.560> really<00:01:32.770> love
