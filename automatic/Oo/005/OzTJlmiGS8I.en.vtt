00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.830 

so<00:00:00.570> now<00:00:01.439> let's<00:00:02.190> move<00:00:02.460> into<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:03.090> omics

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
so now let's move into the omics

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.099 
so now let's move into the omics
revolution<00:00:04.770> and<00:00:05.130> this<00:00:05.850> is<00:00:06.000> truly<00:00:06.480> where<00:00:06.960> we're

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
revolution and this is truly where we're

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.400 
revolution and this is truly where we're
getting<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.470> heck<00:00:07.770> of<00:00:07.799> a<00:00:08.010> lot<00:00:08.189> of<00:00:08.220> data<00:00:08.550> so<00:00:09.410> from

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
getting a heck of a lot of data so from

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.339 
getting a heck of a lot of data so from
the<00:00:10.530> bugs<00:00:10.830> perspective<00:00:11.790> we<00:00:12.420> obviously<00:00:12.599> have

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
the bugs perspective we obviously have

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.000 
the bugs perspective we obviously have
genes<00:00:14.040> which<00:00:14.969> leads<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:16.230> genome<00:00:16.680> and

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
genes which leads to the genome and

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.880 
genes which leads to the genome and
genomics<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.940> study<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:19.080> which

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
genomics the study of that which

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.910 
genomics the study of that which
basically<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.850> potential<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.869> bug<00:00:22.230> to

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
basically is the potential of the bug to

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.580 
basically is the potential of the bug to
do<00:00:23.189> certain<00:00:23.910> things<00:00:24.050> just<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.170> potential

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
do certain things just the potential

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.640 
do certain things just the potential
doesn't<00:00:26.310> mean<00:00:26.460> it's<00:00:26.849> gonna<00:00:26.939> do<00:00:27.180> it<00:00:27.470> then<00:00:28.470> the

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
doesn't mean it's gonna do it then the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.420 
doesn't mean it's gonna do it then the
transcriptome<00:00:29.640> from<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.660> mRNA<00:00:31.529> at<00:00:32.070> least

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
transcriptome from the mRNA at least

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.990 
transcriptome from the mRNA at least
gets<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.329> point<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:35.040> genes<00:00:35.430> are

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
gets you to the point that the genes are

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.360 
gets you to the point that the genes are
making<00:00:36.809> copies<00:00:37.370> such<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:40.100> there<00:00:41.100> could<00:00:41.340> be

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
making copies such that there could be

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.959 
making copies such that there could be
action<00:00:42.210> from<00:00:43.050> those<00:00:43.350> genes<00:00:43.770> but<00:00:44.550> even<00:00:44.820> that

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
action from those genes but even that

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:45.920 
action from those genes but even that
isn't<00:00:45.149> good<00:00:45.450> enough

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
isn't good enough

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.680 
isn't good enough
we<00:00:46.440> need<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.860> get<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.760> manufacturer<00:00:48.660> of

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
we need to get to the manufacturer of

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.000 
we need to get to the manufacturer of
proteins<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.460> study<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.539> now

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
proteins and the study of that is now

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.850 
proteins and the study of that is now
proteomics<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.899> also<00:00:55.110> need<00:00:55.680> to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
proteomics and we also need to

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.910 
proteomics and we also need to
understand<00:00:56.430> how<00:00:56.610> these<00:00:56.910> proteins<00:00:57.710> affect<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
understand how these proteins affect the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.650 
understand how these proteins affect the
metabolites<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:01.609> microbes<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
metabolites in the microbes and in the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.660 
metabolites in the microbes and in the
gut<00:01:03.899> or<00:01:04.729> wherever<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.720> is<00:01:06.960> metabolomics

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
gut or wherever and this is metabolomics

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.600 
gut or wherever and this is metabolomics
so<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.909> conceptual<00:01:09.540> framework<00:01:09.960> here<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.979> that

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
so the conceptual framework here is that

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.550 
so the conceptual framework here is that
when<00:01:11.790> we're<00:01:11.939> talking<00:01:12.060> about<00:01:12.240> omics<00:01:12.869> we're

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
when we're talking about omics we're

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.649 
when we're talking about omics we're
talking<00:01:14.070> not<00:01:14.400> only<00:01:14.430> about<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.390> gene

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
talking not only about the gene

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.920 
talking not only about the gene
potential<00:01:16.409> but<00:01:17.070> all<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.759> way<00:01:17.880> through<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.840> the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
potential but all the way through to the

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.620 
potential but all the way through to the
metabolites<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.860> are<00:01:20.040> there<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.939> this<00:01:21.450> is

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
metabolites that are there and this is

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.210 
metabolites that are there and this is
just<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.110> bugs<00:01:22.430> then<00:01:23.430> there's<00:01:23.700> us<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:25.220> those

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
just the bugs then there's us and those

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.010 
just the bugs then there's us and those
may<00:01:27.000> interact<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:28.590> then<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:30.000> gets<00:01:30.450> worse<00:01:30.720> than

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
may interact and then it gets worse than

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.460 
may interact and then it gets worse than
that<00:01:31.229> all<00:01:31.619> over<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.820> body<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.869> have<00:01:34.020> different

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
that all over the body we have different

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.340 
that all over the body we have different
organisms<00:01:35.159> so<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.610> function<00:01:36.240> may<00:01:36.479> vary<00:01:37.079> in

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
organisms so the function may vary in

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.429 
organisms so the function may vary in
different<00:01:38.220> parts<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.729> body<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.439> then

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
different parts of the body and then

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.580 
different parts of the body and then
people<00:01:41.369> start<00:01:41.670> eating<00:01:41.850> things<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:43.350> is

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
people start eating things and this is

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.969 
people start eating things and this is
people<00:01:44.340> eating<00:01:44.670> properly<00:01:45.590> according<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
people eating properly according to the

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.609 
people eating properly according to the
USDA<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.670> pyramid<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.930> hear<00:01:49.290> there<00:01:49.500> are<00:01:49.530> a

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
USDA a pyramid but I hear there are a

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.899 
USDA a pyramid but I hear there are a
couple<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.920> people<00:01:50.100> out<00:01:50.340> there<00:01:50.399> who<00:01:50.790> are<00:01:50.880> just

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
couple of people out there who are just

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.510 
couple of people out there who are just
not<00:01:51.270> eating<00:01:51.689> too<00:01:51.930> well<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.799> United<00:01:52.920> States

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
not eating too well in the United States

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.789 
not eating too well in the United States
and<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:55.009> some<00:01:56.009> other<00:01:56.219> countries<00:01:56.969> as<00:01:57.240> well

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
and in some other countries as well

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.810 
and in some other countries as well
hmm<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.610> then<00:02:00.119> here<00:02:00.600> are<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.820> probiotics

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
hmm and then here are the probiotics

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
hmm and then here are the probiotics
that<00:02:04.820> we're<00:02:05.820> hoping<00:02:06.439> can<00:02:07.439> have<00:02:07.649> some<00:02:08.009> effect

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
that we're hoping can have some effect

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.140 
that we're hoping can have some effect
beneficially<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.470> host

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
beneficially for the host

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.850 
beneficially for the host
and<00:02:12.239> truly<00:02:13.280> now<00:02:14.280> what<00:02:15.209> was<00:02:15.450> such<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.959> simple

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
and truly now what was such a simple

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:22.880 
and truly now what was such a simple
concept<00:02:18.049> before<00:02:19.370> 2008<00:02:20.370> take<00:02:21.269> a<00:02:21.299> probiotic<00:02:21.890> get

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
concept before 2008 take a probiotic get

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.179 
concept before 2008 take a probiotic get
a<00:02:22.920> banner<00:02:23.189> official<00:02:23.790> effect<00:02:24.090> feel<00:02:24.959> better<00:02:25.260> now

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
a banner official effect feel better now

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.470 
a banner official effect feel better now
has<00:02:26.459> become<00:02:26.970> an<00:02:27.209> incredibly<00:02:28.140> complex

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
has been quite a challenge and then when

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:14.990

we find something is that really
