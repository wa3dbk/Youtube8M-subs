00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 yes hello the web-based i would like 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.150
 Today you like the application 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:12.179
 stars show the city ​​reduced to 79 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.490
 cent costs otherwise 150 or 2 39 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.830
 and it is a new year 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.630
 a simple star chart we have the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.070
 app started and then you get 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.779
 right here in this home screen 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.220
 or pretend before 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.800
 loading screen and then lands directly in 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.930
 the map and you just can here once 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.080
 scroll through and see what's going on here 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.920
 everything is located 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.120
 you can just go with your finger 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.370
 they were able to do the same here 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.260
 star pictures if you drive over there 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.739
 here you can already see the transition 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.540
 between day and night and then changes 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.879
 Of course, this depends on the color 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.039
 You can browse her gesture 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.500
 and of course you can zoom out 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.600
 also display information if 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.000
 For example, you go to Mars here 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:59.430
 and here it clicks on it gets 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.469
 Here's a little information like that 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.080
 diameter is how bright it is there 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.430
 temperature and so on if we are now 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.500
 just look at this symbol 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.439
 then we'll get one more 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.780
 little animation to Mars and have 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.540
 now here, so to speak the mars and you can 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.759
 scroll around how does the planet look 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.979
 out and can us here again 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.330
 open information to this or even 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.860
 Close again and with a click 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.540
 come up here again to learn 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.490
 normal view and could now too 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.570
 for example, a few more 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.060
 Explore planets here 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.490
 In addition, you can also go down in here 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.900
 what settings determine what 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.750
 should be displayed when we go to 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.729
 example I would like to like the 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.299
 Latin name then is this here 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.710
 changed 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.090
 but you can also say I want 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.340
 now for example only the planets 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.049
 see and then switch the other all 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.000
 then go back and have that 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.290
 then individualized and sees stop 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.170
 here only the planet here the 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:55.649
 saturn the mars of pluto and what is it 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.909
 Not everything else is there as well 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.189
 that you just go back then it will be 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.799
 also a bit more interesting here 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:04.469
 There is a search here 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.030
 You can open it right after something 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.469
 Certainly looking for something 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.500
 certain searches or can also be here 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.370
 by scrolling through switchen if you want 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.319
 for example 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.090
 would like to explore planning mini planet 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.470
 For example, you may want to get some info 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.549
 say it again now for saturn 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.049
 then you can be here for example 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.430
 we choose one more under planet 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:23.250
 just stick to a saturn 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.480
 and close x here is looking 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.110
 and I do not play piano that well 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.819
 under planets okay that's the way it always works 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.370
 give me a big bang then we come 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.769
 again to the view where we the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.269
 saturn can explore here and see 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.790
 even here the planets are themselves 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.470
 are here around it and we can 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.060
 We can also go in and out 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.220
 whole turn from the bottom of the right of 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.829
 to the left 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.250
 that's really cool as well 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:52.950
 here are a few tours video tours to 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.140
 example here to the mars mission 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.090
 if you look at it all 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:00.030
 Anyone wants to let them do it 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.879
 There are no sounds that is just one 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:07.620
 normal video here you can see how 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:09.750
 the sun up there on bucks etc 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.890
 unfortunately can not not fast forward that 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.040
 so nice if you look at the display 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.099
 Clicks get back here again 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.030
 the previous screen 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.950
 we just see something different 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.290
 if you are the earth here 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.849
 It will be a bit more exciting there 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:30.540
 you see a little bit more like that 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:33.150
 videos are so constructed and the app is 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.739
 just 20 mb in size although it is also the 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.919
 these videos are actually quite 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.169
 well here in the video you can see 

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:41.639
 that the graphics are not that nice 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:43.859
 Here you can see here for example 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:46.049
 now on earth but in all is already 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.629
 Join in with me a few 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.579
 constellations equal, there are as 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.549
 I have the sun in front of the detail before 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.799
 sun pushes here for example it comes 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.680
 not even the whole thing 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:04:00.389
 Of course, that's what I meant, of course 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.019
 we'll go out of here and 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:05.250
 changes again to the normal view 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.780
 and yes you can continue here again 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.199
 scrolling around in addition there are still 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:13.859
 a night mode to the man 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:15.269
 no can activate here then so is 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:17.729
 the whole thing a bit rounder 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.019
 and everything darker, of course 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.430
 matter of taste if you look at that 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.229
 like to climb or not 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.300
 you can also be place to enter 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:26.000
 and then in 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.650
 or star chart of von 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.199
 display any point 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.180
 can scroll here for specific 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:34.069
 Things are really great 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.729
 for 79 cents in any case one 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.949
 worth a recommendation 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:38.690
 for the people who like the sky 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.349
 and explore stars and planets 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.349
 would like
