00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
walk him suck up a pillow I was like a

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.709 
walk him suck up a pillow I was like a
hotel<00:00:31.309> that<00:00:32.309> looks<00:00:32.460> like<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.640> hotel<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
hotel that looks like a hotel on the

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.660 
hotel that looks like a hotel on the
right

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.810 

but<00:00:39.239> you<00:00:39.539> know<00:00:39.769> sometimes<00:00:40.769> I<00:00:41.010> see<00:00:41.160> nice<00:00:41.460> hotels

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
but you know sometimes I see nice hotels

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.369 
but you know sometimes I see nice hotels
up<00:00:42.000> here<00:00:42.179> and<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.390> think<00:00:42.570> I'd<00:00:42.660> be<00:00:42.839> nice<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.199> spend

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
up here and I think I'd be nice to spend

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.040 
up here and I think I'd be nice to spend
a<00:00:43.559> night<00:00:43.769> in<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.070> mountains<00:00:44.429> but

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
a night in the mountains but

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.660 
a night in the mountains but
realistically<00:00:46.050> like<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.500> maybe<00:00:46.680> 40

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
realistically like this is maybe 40

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.729 
realistically like this is maybe 40
minutes<00:00:47.969> away<00:00:48.059> from<00:00:48.180> my<00:00:48.329> house<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.530> kind<00:00:49.680> of

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
minutes away from my house so it kind of

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:50.990 
minutes away from my house so it kind of
seems<00:00:49.920> odd<00:00:50.100> getting<00:00:50.339> a<00:00:50.370> hotel<00:00:50.519> when<00:00:50.879> you're

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
seems odd getting a hotel when you're

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.490 
seems odd getting a hotel when you're
within<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.539> less<00:00:51.780> than<00:00:51.899> an<00:00:52.019> hour<00:00:52.140> way<00:00:52.350> from

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
within like less than an hour way from

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.750 
within like less than an hour way from
your<00:00:52.620> own<00:00:52.710> all

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
your own all

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.669 
your own all
but<00:00:55.329> then<00:00:55.420> again<00:00:55.510> this<00:00:55.719> doesn't<00:00:55.899> feel<00:00:56.350> like

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679 
but then again this doesn't feel like

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:58.020 
but then again this doesn't feel like
it's<00:00:56.890> less<00:00:57.100> than<00:00:57.129> an<00:00:57.309> hour<00:00:57.429> for<00:00:57.699> my<00:00:57.760> home<00:00:57.910> it

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
it's less than an hour for my home it

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.310 
it's less than an hour for my home it
doesn't<00:00:58.149> feel<00:00:58.329> like<00:00:58.480> it's<00:00:58.660> me<00:00:58.839> or<00:00:58.989> my<00:00:59.109> house

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
doesn't feel like it's me or my house

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:07.860 
doesn't feel like it's me or my house
you<00:00:59.710> know<00:00:59.829> my<00:01:00.339> house<00:01:00.489> is<00:01:00.519> in<00:01:00.789> the<00:01:00.820> city

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:07.870 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.840 

although<00:01:08.620> I<00:01:08.650> would<00:01:08.830> be<00:01:08.950> bored<00:01:09.190> to<00:01:09.280> tears<00:01:09.490> so<00:01:09.820> I

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
although I would be bored to tears so I

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.910
