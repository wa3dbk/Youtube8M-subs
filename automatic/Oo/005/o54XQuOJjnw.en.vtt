over<00:01:08.880> all<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.330> these<00:01:09.510> you're<00:01:09.810> going<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.020> get<00:01:10.110> on

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
over all of these you're going to get on

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.980 
over all of these you're going to get on
top<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.440> building<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.420> make<00:01:12.420> sure<00:01:12.690> that

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
top of this building and make sure that

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.800 
top of this building and make sure that
if<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.380> have<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> sniper<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.030> has<00:01:15.240> armor

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
if you have a sniper that it has armor

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.319 
if you have a sniper that it has armor
piercing<00:01:16.140> rounds<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:17.159> reason<00:01:17.520> why<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.729> you

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
piercing rounds the reason why is you

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:20.959 
piercing rounds the reason why is you
will<00:01:18.479> be<00:01:18.600> able<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.780> see<00:01:19.189> valance<00:01:20.189> just<00:01:20.490> fun<00:01:20.700> but

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:20.969 
will be able to see valance just fun but

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:23.480 
will be able to see valance just fun but
the<00:01:21.030> problem<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.200> won't<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.280> able<00:01:23.399> to

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
the problem is is you won't be able to

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.950 
the problem is is you won't be able to
shoot<00:01:23.759> him<00:01:24.000> unless<00:01:24.359> you<00:01:24.570> have<00:01:24.780> those

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
shoot him unless you have those

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.599 
shoot him unless you have those
armor-piercing<00:01:25.680> rounds<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.100> reason<00:01:26.430> wise

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:26.609 
armor-piercing rounds the reason wise

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:29.330 
armor-piercing rounds the reason wise
it's<00:01:27.210> like<00:01:27.600> there's<00:01:27.869> still<00:01:28.079> a<00:01:28.289> level<00:01:29.100> or<00:01:29.280> a

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
it's like there's still a level or a

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.240 
it's like there's still a level or a
layer<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.759> metal<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.689> between<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.679> two<00:01:31.920> of<00:01:31.950> you

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
layer of metal in between the two of you

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.620 
layer of metal in between the two of you
so<00:01:32.609> you<00:01:32.640> got<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:32.880> have<00:01:33.119> something<00:01:33.420> with

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
so you got to have something with

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.940 
so you got to have something with
armor-piercing<00:01:33.899> round<00:01:34.439> then<00:01:34.590> we<00:01:34.679> try<00:01:34.890> this

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
armor-piercing round then we try this

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.910 
armor-piercing round then we try this
with<00:01:35.250> corrective<00:01:35.729> measure<00:01:35.969> a<00:01:36.780> hand<00:01:37.350> cannon<00:01:37.590> a

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
with corrective measure a hand cannon a

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:38.870 
with corrective measure a hand cannon a
few<00:01:38.159> other<00:01:38.280> weapons<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.729> had

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
few other weapons that had

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.599 
few other weapons that had
armor-piercing<00:01:39.659> rounds<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.109> did<00:01:40.590> not<00:01:40.619> work<00:01:41.159> so
