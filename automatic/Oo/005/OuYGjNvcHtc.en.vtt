00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:07.080
 aesthetic restoration of teeth 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.150
 it is not only a beautiful smile from 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.940
 the quality of the work of the dentist 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.990
 depends on how comfortable you will be 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.619
 feel yourself 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.060
 with new teeth the most important thing 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.699
 tooth restoration and accuracy 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.560
 making a future restoration any 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.420
 inaccuracy of manufacturing tries 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.970
 lead to the wrong bite that in 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.410
 further causes bone 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.570
 gum tissue and the future of a lost tooth 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.540
 due to incorrect replacement in 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.020
 a person may experience headaches 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.899
 may further arise 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.480
 need well perry prosthetics 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.329
 for accurate and reliable restoration 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.149
 Ogi clinic uses technology 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.199
 Tsarek digital ceramic method 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.789
 restorations perfectly follow the contour 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.190
 restorative tooth restoration 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.600
 it restores the tooth's effect 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.359
 certain in case they are damaged 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.399
 more than 50 percent in this 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.580
 case we use different ways 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.510
 restorations such as veneers and 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.250
 crowns or ceramic tabs 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.100
 technology queen several times 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.740
 reduces time and quantity 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.340
 unpleasant procedures for any kind of 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.400
 restorations traditional restoration 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.580
 a tooth meant several visits to the doctor 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.860
 first an unpleasant impression was taken 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.490
 the procedure for many causes gag 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.990
 reflex then ceramist manually 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.740
 made a pattern that is needed 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:41.150
 customization is required 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.150
 intermediate fillings or crowns 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.640
 earring complex consists of scanning 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.729
 device according to which computer 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.250
 builds a three-dimensional model and a milling 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.219
 the module immediately grinds the desired 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.020
 ceramic restoration present 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.850
 we can carry and necessary 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.979
 with the minimum population 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.899
 involving the patient when the patient can 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.700
 just watch the creation 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.420
 computer model of the future restoration 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.989
 and this is only the first part of the newest 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.670
 prosthetic technology accurate data 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.110
 for three-dimensional model 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.239
 gives a special scanning camera 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.030
 range of blue rays 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:25.590
 provides unique camera accuracy 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.860
 using special radiation 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.269
 conveys all the smallest details 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.549
 tooth preparation with what we 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:35.130
 we can convey as accurately as possible 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.170
 the necessary information in the program which 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.239
 the future will shape the future 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.220
 restoration 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:43.260
 do not need extra and immersion in 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.900
 oral cavity of the patient dental impression mass 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.239
 everything is displayed on the computer literally 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.870
 two three minutes after holding 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.510
 shooting obtained in almost mode 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.519
 real time three-dimensional model 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.099
 transferred to the lab for 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.739
 making restoration digital 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.970
 technology applied in the clinic ogami 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:07.200
 opened a new level of quality 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.049
 robotic machine grind out 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:13.230
 perfect exact restoration where there won't be 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:15.440
 visible joints the answer is reliable 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.030
 ceramic material completely 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.299
 matches the color of your own teeth 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.959
 patient if ordinary composite 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:27.150
 the material is easily stained 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:30.690
 deformed due to porous structure 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.690
 smell caries then ceramic 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.010
 church restorations and dentinal qualities 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.930
 real teeth 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.190
 This procedure allows you to save 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.650
 maximum number of healthy 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.410
 the patient's body at the same time grind 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.419
 it accounts for much less 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.450
 accuracy and efficiency of technology c 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:51.090
 cancer becomes even more comfortable 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.950
 when the whole procedure can be carried out with 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.280
 using sedation 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.790
 This is a comfortable method of dental treatment during 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.190
 a dream 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.950
 when the patient is not experiencing any 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:05.730
 discomfort and no adverse 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:07.489
 effects of anesthesia so we 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.150
 we get some undeniable 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:14.420
 benefits of cer technology 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:17.790
 but above all it is time saving 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:22.160
 Clinic ogami patients who receive 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.160
 perfect and quality result
