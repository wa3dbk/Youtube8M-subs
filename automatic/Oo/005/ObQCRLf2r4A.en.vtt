00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.030
 Hello friends, probably each of 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.750
 knows us that you can send a name from 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.790
 anyone 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.460
 however, I was overwhelmed with requests and 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.440
 Questions like what and how hard 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.690
 go to google and figure it out yourself 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.699
 although the people of us are now lazy yes i 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.460
 admit no better now i'm actually 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:42.890
 I will show this miracle and show it in 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.080
 work for a start I will say that the script itself I 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.930
 took on the network and remade by themselves under 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.570
 your needs and giving you it already 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.780
 working condition here is standard 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.680
 login and password admin fire change them 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.860
 can file 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.760
 index dot php comments I'm all there 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.460
 left push button enter and like this 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.560
 the script itself actually looks more 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.380
 to whom it is to whom we are sending a letter 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:13.430
 from whom the name is usually written here and 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:16.009
 surname or organization name in 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.720
 Generally anything from whom it is clear 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.890
 that is, from whom the given will be sent 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.280
 letter subject 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.380
 and those letters are either plain text or html 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.240
 with formatting, that is, it will be possible 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.060
 use html tags 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.910
 let's check its performance 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:36.340
 here we will write a test to put the ellipsis 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:38.330
 and I will send myself to my test mail 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.220
 press the button to send 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.860
 and see that the letter box is my mail 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.160
 successfully sent go to the mail 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.729
 the box is updating the page and as we see 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.420
 the letter arrived and they also assigned us 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.910
 microsoft icon 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.630
 although we have nothing to do with microsoft 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:59.690
 do not have and nothing prevents an attacker if 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.700
 hacker spa world take advantage of such 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.619
 here's the script and send the letter 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.640
 to any user with a view 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.539
 ferret him out 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.860
 important data posing as an employee 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.170
 microsoft that is so too often 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:16.540
 hack however you can send not 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.540

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.910
 zhrachku send back pass 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:26.180
 update and see that we also assigned 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.590
 and apple icon 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:34.640
 they enter and see that we are indicated here 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:35.920
 email address often use it well 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.989
 of course without winnie the pooh 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.420
 the purpose of finding out important data from 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.629
 user sends phishing emails 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.060
 where you need to click on the link enter your 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:49.819
 data and they are sent to hackers and there 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.939
 it's written some sort of crap fight what are you 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:56.599
 logged in come back later and so 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:58.879
 Further, in general, what am I leading all this 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:02.000
 such a script can be used for 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:05.329
 send letters with javascript code for 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.329
 fishing letters either for introducing people into 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.310
 delusions are often written on behalf of banks and 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:12.590
 asked to send to another mail 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.370
 any important type information 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.400
 pin code 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:19.159
 card numbers of your address and so 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.400
 I also have on the channel 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:25.879
 several videos about hacking mail mail.ru 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.219
 where I sent myself a malicious code with 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:30.169
 using this script 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:32.870

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:34.099

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.319
