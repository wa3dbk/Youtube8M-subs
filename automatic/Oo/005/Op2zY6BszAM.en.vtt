you how to make gingerbread okay so it's

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.520 
you how to make gingerbread okay so it's
been<00:00:07.379> two<00:00:07.649> hours<00:00:10.400> here's<00:00:11.400> our<00:00:11.550> dough<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.530> it's

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
been two hours here's our dough and it's

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.740 
been two hours here's our dough and it's
going<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.710> be<00:00:13.799> nice<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.250> hard<00:00:14.849> which<00:00:17.539> makes<00:00:18.539> it

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
going to be nice and hard which makes it

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.880 
going to be nice and hard which makes it
to<00:00:18.990> be<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.140> little<00:00:19.260> difficult<00:00:19.470> to<00:00:19.680> work<00:00:19.830> with

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
to be a little difficult to work with

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.410 
to be a little difficult to work with
because<00:00:20.220> it's<00:00:20.490> hard<00:00:20.670> but<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.240> won't<00:00:21.390> be

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
because it's hard but it won't be

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.420 
because it's hard but it won't be
impossible<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.930> work<00:00:22.020> with<00:00:22.080> so<00:00:23.070> we'll<00:00:23.189> do<00:00:23.279> now

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
impossible to work with so we'll do now

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.250 
impossible to work with so we'll do now
let's<00:00:23.820> grab<00:00:23.939> our<00:00:24.029> rolling<00:00:24.390> pin<00:00:24.600> and<00:00:27.260> what

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
let's grab our rolling pin and what

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:29.210 
let's grab our rolling pin and what
we're<00:00:28.349> going<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.560> do<00:00:28.650> now<00:00:28.800> is<00:00:29.070> we're<00:00:29.189> just

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
we're going to do now is we're just

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.120 
we're going to do now is we're just
going<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.460> roll<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.609> in<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:29.849> pan<00:00:30.560> so<00:00:31.560> just

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
going to roll it in the pan so just

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.569 
going to roll it in the pan so just
start<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.489> middle<00:00:33.950> for<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.100> being<00:00:35.250> firm

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
start in the middle for the being firm

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.920 
start in the middle for the being firm
like<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:36.000> it'll<00:00:36.300> be<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> little<00:00:36.540> easier<00:00:36.719> to

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
like this it'll be a little easier to

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.869 
like this it'll be a little easier to
roll<00:00:37.110> out<00:00:37.550> just<00:00:38.550> kind<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.820> plus<00:00:40.820> and<00:00:41.820> you

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
roll out just kind of the plus and you

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.200 
roll out just kind of the plus and you
want<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.149> make<00:00:42.629> sure<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.110> keep<00:00:43.260> your

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
want to make sure that you keep your

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.850 
want to make sure that you keep your
thickness<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.690> whatever<00:00:46.200> you're<00:00:46.350> rolling<00:00:46.710> out

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
thickness of whatever you're rolling out

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.830 
thickness of whatever you're rolling out
to<00:00:46.890> be<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.340> same<00:00:47.579> so<00:00:47.850> apply<00:00:48.059> even<00:00:48.390> pressure<00:00:48.420> as

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
to be the same so apply even pressure as

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.319 
to be the same so apply even pressure as
you<00:00:48.870> roll<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:52.730> it<00:00:53.730> doesn't<00:00:53.940> necessarily

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
you roll it and it doesn't necessarily

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.369 
you roll it and it doesn't necessarily
have<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.480> go<00:00:54.629> all<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.870> way<00:00:54.960> out<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.199> edges

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
have to go all the way out to the edges

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.920 
have to go all the way out to the edges
we<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:56.489> want<00:00:56.640> to<00:00:56.730> get<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.120> where<00:00:58.010> it<00:00:59.010> goes

00:00:59.920 --> 00:00:59.930 
we just want to get it to where it goes

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.579 
we just want to get it to where it goes
to<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:00.960> thickness<00:01:01.440> we're<00:01:01.590> looking<00:01:01.859> for<00:01:03.589> which

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
to the thickness we're looking for which

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.109 
to the thickness we're looking for which
depending<00:01:05.010> on<00:01:05.129> what<00:01:05.369> you're<00:01:05.580> doing<00:01:06.409> with<00:01:07.409> it

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
depending on what you're doing with it

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.120 
depending on what you're doing with it
you<00:01:09.119> want<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.330> go<00:01:09.390> anywhere<00:01:09.689> between<00:01:10.130> a

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
you want to go anywhere between a

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.859 
you want to go anywhere between a
quarter<00:01:11.700> of<00:01:11.760> an<00:01:11.850> inch<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> half<00:01:12.390> minutes

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
quarter of an inch to a half minutes

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.249 
quarter of an inch to a half minutes
right<00:01:13.080> now<00:01:13.110> we're<00:01:13.380> about<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.560> half<00:01:13.710> an<00:01:13.920> inch<00:01:15.259> I'm

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
right now we're about a half an inch I'm

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.539 
right now we're about a half an inch I'm
go<00:01:16.380> down<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.710> quarter<00:01:18.229> because<00:01:19.369> half<00:01:20.369> a

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
go down to a quarter because half a

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.920 
go down to a quarter because half a
little<00:01:20.729> bit<00:01:20.820> big<00:01:21.090> for<00:01:21.119> what<00:01:21.450> I'm<00:01:21.540> doing<00:01:21.840> with

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
little bit big for what I'm doing with

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.330 
little bit big for what I'm doing with
it<00:01:24.439> so<00:01:25.439> we're<00:01:25.650> just<00:01:25.680> going<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.950> keep<00:01:26.100> working

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
it so we're just going to keep working

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.200 
it so we're just going to keep working
it<00:01:26.700> out<00:01:27.080> something<00:01:28.080> else<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.380> can<00:01:28.530> do<00:01:29.060> is<00:01:30.060> you

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
it out something else you can do is you

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.080 
it out something else you can do is you
can<00:01:30.240> actually<00:01:30.360> get<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.290> dowel<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.729> measures

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
can actually get a dowel that measures

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.530 
can actually get a dowel that measures
the<00:01:33.119> diameter<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:33.960> you're<00:01:34.710> working<00:01:35.040> toward

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
the diameter that you're working toward

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.749 
the diameter that you're working toward
and<00:01:36.540> put<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.900> dowel<00:01:37.320> in<00:01:37.439> your<00:01:37.590> pan<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.520> so

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
and put that dowel in your pan and so

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.130 
and put that dowel in your pan and so
you<00:01:38.820> can<00:01:39.030> see<00:01:39.210> when<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.570> know<00:01:39.689> when<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.930> reach

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
you can see when you know when you reach

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.960 
you can see when you know when you reach
that<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.880> depth<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.240> you're<00:01:42.479> looking<00:01:42.570> for

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
that the depth that you're looking for

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.520 
that the depth that you're looking for
you'll<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.000> able<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.210> see<00:01:45.479> it<00:01:45.570> easier<00:01:46.049> we<00:01:46.350> want

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
you'll be able to see it easier we want

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.440 
you'll be able to see it easier we want
to<00:01:46.590> move<00:01:46.680> fairly<00:01:47.280> quickly<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.970> as<00:01:48.090> we<00:01:48.180> do<00:01:48.329> this

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
to move fairly quickly to as we do this

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.630 
to move fairly quickly to as we do this
because<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:49.079> starts<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.560> warm<00:01:49.799> up<00:01:50.009> and<00:01:50.340> gets<00:01:50.549> a

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
because it starts to warm up and gets a

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.600 
because it starts to warm up and gets a
lot<00:01:50.729> tackier<00:01:51.439> or<00:01:52.439> stickier<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.340> becomes

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
lot tackier or stickier it becomes

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.840 
lot tackier or stickier it becomes
harder<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:53.939> roll<00:01:55.250> you<00:01:56.250> also<00:01:56.399> make<00:01:56.610> sure<00:01:56.670> when

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
harder to roll you also make sure when

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.370 
harder to roll you also make sure when
you<00:01:56.909> roll<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.360> roll<00:01:57.540> all<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.810> way<00:01:57.899> over<00:01:58.259> your

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
you roll you roll all the way over your

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.870 
you roll you roll all the way over your
edges<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.130> don't<00:01:59.280> want<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.460> stop<00:01:59.700> before

edges to you don't want to stop before

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.050 
edges to you don't want to stop before
your<00:02:00.180> edges<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.689> lip<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.110> edge<00:02:01.229> there
