00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
water to the mixture because what that

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.839 
water to the mixture because what that
does<00:02:44.389> it<00:02:44.870> makes<00:02:45.530> it<00:02:45.709> to<00:02:45.859> dry<00:02:46.189> it's<00:02:46.489> almost<00:02:46.700> like

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:46.849 
does it makes it to dry it's almost like

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:49.030 
does it makes it to dry it's almost like
a<00:02:46.879> papyrus<00:02:47.359> or<00:02:47.719> something<00:02:48.049> if<00:02:48.169> you<00:02:48.260> use<00:02:48.469> no<00:02:48.739> oil

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
a papyrus or something if you use no oil

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.890 
a papyrus or something if you use no oil
so<00:02:49.639> you<00:02:49.700> want<00:02:49.939> to<00:02:50.000> add<00:02:50.090> some<00:02:50.269> oil<00:02:50.359> to<00:02:50.540> add<00:02:50.719> some

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
so you want to add some oil to add some

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.929 
so you want to add some oil to add some
pliability<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.709> this<00:02:51.859> when<00:02:52.040> it's<00:02:52.189> done<00:02:52.340> right

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:52.939 
pliability to this when it's done right

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.759 
pliability to this when it's done right
that's<00:02:53.269> the<00:02:53.359> reason<00:02:53.480> we<00:02:53.719> do<00:02:53.840> that<00:02:53.870> now<00:02:54.590> we'll

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:12.969 
now you can see with that thick mixture

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:14.640 
now you can see with that thick mixture
that<00:04:13.269> even<00:04:13.510> it<00:04:13.629> was<00:04:13.810> moving<00:04:14.140> the<00:04:14.230> Vitamix

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
that even it was moving the Vitamix

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.020 
that even it was moving the Vitamix
around<00:04:14.920> and<00:04:15.099> that's<00:04:15.219> a<00:04:15.280> heavy<00:04:15.459> machine<00:04:15.819> so

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
around and that's a heavy machine so

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.449 
around and that's a heavy machine so
it's<00:04:16.419> a<00:04:16.479> thick<00:04:16.780> mixture<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.829> consistency<00:04:18.430> you

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
it's a thick mixture the consistency you

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:19.680 
it's a thick mixture the consistency you
want<00:04:18.549> in<00:04:18.850> the<00:04:18.970> end<00:04:19.000> is<00:04:19.239> almost<00:04:19.419> like<00:04:19.570> an

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
want in the end is almost like an

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:21.449 
want in the end is almost like an
oatmeal<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.320> that<00:04:20.829> way<00:04:20.919> you'll<00:04:21.070> be<00:04:21.130> able<00:04:21.220> to

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
oatmeal and that way you'll be able to

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.480 
oatmeal and that way you'll be able to
spread<00:04:21.699> it<00:04:21.850> out<00:04:21.940> on<00:04:22.000> your<00:04:22.240> caliber<00:04:22.750> tray<00:04:23.020> and

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
spread it out on your caliber tray and

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.430 
spread it out on your caliber tray and
that'll<00:04:24.490> be<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.580> best<00:04:24.789> consistency<00:04:25.419> so<00:04:26.289> let's

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
that'll be the best consistency so let's

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.659 
that'll be the best consistency so let's
do<00:04:26.590> that<00:04:27.570> take<00:04:28.570> this<00:04:28.750> up<00:04:28.960> here<00:04:29.400> very<00:04:30.400> similar

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
do that take this up here very similar

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.430 
do that take this up here very similar

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.870 
so you got to keep a little bit of depth
to<00:05:03.699> right<00:05:05.190> so<00:05:06.190> now<00:05:06.340> you<00:05:06.400> can<00:05:06.580> see<00:05:06.729> we're

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
to right so now you can see we're

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.670 
to right so now you can see we're
spreading<00:05:07.180> it<00:05:07.360> out<00:05:07.479> here<00:05:07.810> and<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.080> good<00:05:08.199> idea<00:05:08.500> is

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 
spreading it out here and a good idea is

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.560 
spreading it out here and a good idea is
to<00:05:08.860> spread<00:05:09.039> it<00:05:09.190> out<00:05:09.280> in<00:05:09.460> a<00:05:09.610> circle<00:05:10.030> because<00:05:10.270> my

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
to spread it out in a circle because my

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:12.480 
to spread it out in a circle because my
wife<00:05:10.720> mentioned<00:05:10.990> she<00:05:11.289> said<00:05:11.500> well<00:05:11.680> what<00:05:12.310> if<00:05:12.400> you

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490
