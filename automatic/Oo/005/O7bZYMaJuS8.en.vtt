00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.650
 nice that you stayed tuned to 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.380
 test of the samsung galaxy s3 by 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.330
 mobile review we go right here 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.890
 the way bench 3 here we see the 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.380
 Technical details left easy 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.910
 once through the dispute 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.050
 gone through on both devices man 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.850
 sees the difference in the 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.019
 color calibration I had it at the beginning 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.910
 already mentioned a bit blue 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.710
 greenish I would say even with white 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.660
 we can see something here at the htc 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.210
 clearer representation is really white 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.000
 White is immediately noticeable but 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.860
 also on that the samsung galaxy s3 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.329
 he mentioned earlier about the same 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.920
 that is just the feeling of being fast 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.500
 the people given to tell others 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.390
 language almost twice as fast 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.010
 although here is a dual core with 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.300
 1 gigahertz trade if it's right in 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.730
 Remember her down here 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.690
 at least and we have one here 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.340
 dual core with 1.2 ghz but that does 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.370
 then you know how to do it 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.680
 can just see 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.480
 so is the emmental benchmark of the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.769
 I hope not with the samsung anymore 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.970
 offers is definitely the newest 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.360
 version denner you can see here, too 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.110
 huge differences 13,300 27 counter 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.400
 samsung galaxy s3 at desire 300 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.009
 There would be seven in 1847 in the details 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.810
 you see the differences for the ds 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.100
 he should be interested in here 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.540
 slow motion maybe through the video 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.640
 I'm personally interested in watching 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.520
 not so much i know that the samsung 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.650
 galaxy in practice not really much 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.710
 harder it does not feel faster 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:39.930
 on as the htc desire 300 we come 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.460
 to the last section speed 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:49.530
 Comparison to the example of lex is3 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:51.930
 and asphalt racing 8 by gameloft man 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.729
 can see here now game is running 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.159
 automatic mode so I'm on the 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.439
 details shot but it's like 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.530
 The manufacturer is practically on the 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.119
 I think that would be the right device 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.890
 say you can easily play along with them 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.299
 now no stuttering that may bother me 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.610
 be that the detail level is not the 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.440
 highest is 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.990
 for me enough on the 4 inch display 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.880
 In any case, around that too 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.250
 to be able to play fluently 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.510
 I hope that little video has you 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.850
 I liked it on my website 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.650

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.180
 find and left her a can
