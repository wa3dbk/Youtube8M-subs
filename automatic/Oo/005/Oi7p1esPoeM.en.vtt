00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
features that you would find in the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.630 
features that you would find in the
higher<00:01:01.170> end<00:01:01.410> cameras<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.070> majority<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.460> them

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
higher end cameras the majority of them

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.730 
higher end cameras the majority of them
not<00:01:02.820> all<00:01:02.850> of<00:01:03.000> them<00:01:03.320> and<00:01:04.640> you<00:01:05.640> know<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.740> hybrid

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
not all of them and you know and hybrid

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.060 
not all of them and you know and hybrid
high<00:01:07.920> megapixel<00:01:08.070> 16<00:01:08.939> megapixels<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:10.070> you

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
high megapixel 16 megapixels and you

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.539 
high megapixel 16 megapixels and you
know<00:01:11.159> fits<00:01:11.600> some<00:01:12.600> amazing<00:01:12.960> lenses<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:14.189> has

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
know fits some amazing lenses and has

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.340 
know fits some amazing lenses and has
the<00:01:14.670> autofocus<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.210> motor<00:01:15.360> built<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.259> you

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
the autofocus and motor built in so you

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.380 
the autofocus and motor built in so you
can<00:01:16.560> use<00:01:16.650> older<00:01:16.979> lenses<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.850> don't<00:01:18.090> have<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
can use older lenses that don't have the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.980 
can use older lenses that don't have the
new<00:01:18.630> AFS<00:01:19.080> motors

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
new AFS motors

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.830 
new AFS motors
one<00:01:20.770> thing<00:01:20.979> to<00:01:21.100> note<00:01:21.750> though<00:01:22.750> is<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.880> it<00:01:25.659> is<00:01:25.720> a

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
one thing to note though is that it is a

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.330 
one thing to note though is that it is a
crop<00:01:26.200> sensor<00:01:26.440> still<00:01:26.920> it's<00:01:27.130> not<00:01:27.310> a

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
crop sensor still it's not a

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.940 
crop sensor still it's not a
professional<00:01:28.270> full<00:01:28.659> sensor<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:32.320> does<00:01:32.530> crop

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
professional full sensor so it does crop

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.300 
professional full sensor so it does crop
like<00:01:33.250> I<00:01:33.490> think<00:01:33.610> it's<00:01:33.850> 1.5<00:01:34.420> times<00:01:35.040> which<00:01:36.040> means

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
like I think it's 1.5 times which means

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.560 
like I think it's 1.5 times which means
that<00:01:36.610> you're<00:01:36.729> not<00:01:36.850> going<00:01:37.030> to<00:01:37.090> get<00:01:37.270> you<00:01:37.420> know

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
that you're not going to get you know

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.410 
that you're not going to get you know
the<00:01:37.810> full<00:01:38.440> frame<00:01:38.770> when<00:01:39.070> you<00:01:39.159> use<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.310> lens<00:01:39.610> of<00:01:39.940> 55

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
the full frame when you use a lens of 55

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.180 
the full frame when you use a lens of 55
50<00:01:40.930> millimeter<00:01:41.290> turns<00:01:41.560> into<00:01:41.800> lake<00:01:42.070> and<00:01:42.369> the<00:01:43.240> 85

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
50 millimeter turns into lake and the 85

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:52.980 
50 millimeter turns into lake and the 85
or<00:01:45.190> 75<00:01:45.759> I'm<00:01:46.030> not<00:01:46.149> exactly<00:01:46.360> sure<00:01:51.570> I'm<00:01:52.570> not<00:01:52.750> a

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
or 75 I'm not exactly sure I'm not a

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.430 
or 75 I'm not exactly sure I'm not a
hundred<00:01:53.950> percent<00:01:54.070> but<00:01:54.520> I<00:01:54.640> do<00:01:54.729> know<00:01:54.910> it<00:01:55.440> like

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
hundred percent but I do know it like

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.870 
hundred percent but I do know it like
you<00:01:56.560> have<00:01:56.710> a<00:01:56.770> really<00:01:57.070> wide<00:01:57.160> angle<00:01:57.520> lens<00:01:57.640> it's

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
you have a really wide angle lens it's

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.169 
you have a really wide angle lens it's
not<00:01:58.000> going<00:01:58.119> to<00:01:58.179> be<00:01:58.270> as<00:01:58.390> wide<00:01:58.570> angle<00:01:58.869> with<00:01:59.410> a

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
not going to be as wide angle with a
