compare<00:02:19.430> him<00:02:19.549> to<00:02:19.579> any<00:02:19.819> other<00:02:20.060> characters<00:02:20.450> such

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
compare him to any other characters such

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.379 
compare him to any other characters such
as<00:02:20.599> scorpion<00:02:21.530> sub-zero<00:02:21.859> like<00:02:22.700> cabal<00:02:23.060> like

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:23.389 
as scorpion sub-zero like cabal like

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:25.300 
as scorpion sub-zero like cabal like
he's<00:02:23.569> like<00:02:23.719> he's<00:02:24.109> like<00:02:24.139> cabal<00:02:24.590> but<00:02:24.859> cabal<00:02:25.159> is<00:02:25.280> a

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
he's like he's like cabal but cabal is a

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.739 
he's like he's like cabal but cabal is a
better<00:02:25.549> version<00:02:25.760> just<00:02:26.090> because<00:02:26.359> cabal<00:02:26.719> has

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:26.749 
better version just because cabal has

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:28.479 
better version just because cabal has
super<00:02:27.109> speed<00:02:27.379> and<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:27.829> makes<00:02:27.980> it<00:02:28.099> more<00:02:28.189> cooler

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
super speed and it makes it more cooler

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.399 
super speed and it makes it more cooler
so<00:02:28.909> I<00:02:28.939> just<00:02:29.359> think<00:02:29.540> Stryker<00:02:29.870> is<00:02:30.049> just<00:02:30.230> a

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:30.409 
so I just think Stryker is just a

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:32.979 
so I just think Stryker is just a
character<00:02:31.069> that<00:02:31.340> I<00:02:31.609> would<00:02:31.849> ever<00:02:31.969> pick<00:02:32.269> like<00:02:32.629> if

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
character that I would ever pick like if

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.030 
character that I would ever pick like if
somebody<00:02:33.260> told<00:02:33.439> me<00:02:33.500> they<00:02:33.620> can't<00:02:33.859> pick<00:02:34.010> that

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
somebody told me they can't pick that

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.559 
somebody told me they can't pick that
character<00:02:34.489> I<00:02:34.519> would<00:02:34.609> look<00:02:34.760> at<00:02:34.849> him<00:02:34.969> like<00:02:35.120> I<00:02:35.359> am

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.319 
character I would look at him like I am
not<00:02:35.689> picking<00:02:35.959> that<00:02:35.989> character<00:02:36.500> at<00:02:37.400> number<00:02:38.060> one

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:38.329 
not picking that character at number one
