model you can get a very good range of
steering<00:03:23.030> movement<00:03:23.720> so<00:03:24.500> you<00:03:24.530> can<00:03:24.769> pose<00:03:24.980> the

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
steering movement so you can pose the

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:27.759 
steering movement so you can pose the
model<00:03:25.250> in<00:03:25.579> interesting<00:03:26.030> ways<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:27.440> tip<00:03:27.650> of

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.229 
model in interesting ways the tip of
mechanism<00:03:28.190> is<00:03:28.310> controlled<00:03:28.670> by<00:03:28.730> our<00:03:28.970> stiff

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
mechanism is controlled by our stiff

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.569 
mechanism is controlled by our stiff
cylinder<00:03:29.750> so<00:03:29.930> it<00:03:30.049> won't<00:03:30.230> droop<00:03:30.470> down<00:03:30.739> and<00:03:31.069> it

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
cylinder so it won't droop down and it

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:32.860 
cylinder so it won't droop down and it
also<00:03:31.700> achieves<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.209> good<00:03:32.359> angle<00:03:32.720> which<00:03:32.840> is

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
also achieves a good angle which is

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.530 
also achieves a good angle which is
around<00:03:33.230> 50<00:03:33.590> degrees<00:03:34.030> at<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.209> back<00:03:35.359> the

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
around 50 degrees at the back the

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.089 
around 50 degrees at the back the
tailgate<00:03:35.930> has<00:03:36.109> a<00:03:36.140> slight<00:03:36.440> clip<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:36.829> it<00:03:36.950> but

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
tailgate has a slight clip to it but

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:38.649 
tailgate has a slight clip to it but
once<00:03:37.280> it's<00:03:37.459> opened<00:03:37.790> it's<00:03:37.909> not<00:03:38.090> free<00:03:38.329> swinging

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:38.659 
once it's opened it's not free swinging

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:41.979 
once it's opened it's not free swinging
so<00:03:38.989> it<00:03:39.079> won't<00:03:39.290> always<00:03:39.620> hang<00:03:40.010> vertically<00:03:40.989> so

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
so it won't always hang vertically so

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.390 
so it won't always hang vertically so
now<00:03:42.200> let's<00:03:42.409> give<00:03:42.560> the<00:03:42.680> model<00:03:42.799> a<00:03:42.980> real-life

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400

you<00:03:49.670> can<00:03:49.790> imagine<00:03:49.940> how<00:03:50.239> many<00:03:50.299> hours<00:03:50.480> were

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
you can imagine how many hours were

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.229 
you can imagine how many hours were
spent<00:03:51.139> doing<00:03:51.319> that<00:03:51.620> anyway<00:03:52.579> once<00:03:52.819> the<00:03:52.970> tip<00:03:53.120> is

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
spent doing that anyway once the tip is

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.449 
spent doing that anyway once the tip is
up<00:03:53.389> steep<00:03:53.810> enough<00:03:54.079> we<00:03:54.260> can<00:03:54.470> undo<00:03:54.829> the<00:03:54.859> tailgate

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
up steep enough we can undo the tailgate

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.940 
up steep enough we can undo the tailgate
and<00:03:55.639> out<00:03:55.909> comes<00:03:56.299> the<00:03:56.510> load<00:03:56.720> this<00:03:57.530> is<00:03:57.680> not<00:03:57.829> the

and out comes the load this is not the

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.319 
and out comes the load this is not the
normal<00:03:58.159> kind<00:03:58.430> of<00:03:58.519> thing<00:03:58.700> you<00:03:58.819> can<00:03:58.970> see<00:03:59.180> in<00:03:59.269> a
