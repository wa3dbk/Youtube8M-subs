get the chat in there so it's I mean
there's<00:02:01.950> no<00:02:02.100> way<00:02:02.220> she's<00:02:02.430> wirelessly<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.210> one

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
there's no way she's wirelessly that one

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.240 
there's no way she's wirelessly that one
wire<00:02:03.510> but<00:02:04.229> it's<00:02:04.380> wireless<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.800> your<00:02:04.920> console

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
wire but it's wireless to your console

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.160 
wire but it's wireless to your console
and<00:02:05.400> we<00:02:05.880> just<00:02:06.120> plug<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.390> into<00:02:06.510> there<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:06.990> that

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
and we just plug it into there like that

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.249 
and we just plug it into there like that
so<00:02:07.549> you<00:02:08.549> don't<00:02:08.759> have<00:02:08.909> to<00:02:09.090> have<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.360> from<00:02:10.049> there

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
so you don't have to have it from there

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.729 
so you don't have to have it from there
too

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
too

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.570 
too
beautiful<00:02:11.129> yep<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.849> it's<00:02:12.200> perfect<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:14.190> it's

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
beautiful yep so it's perfect and it's

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.690 
beautiful yep so it's perfect and it's
nice<00:02:14.760> braided<00:02:15.269> cord<00:02:15.690> again<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:17.340> one<00:02:17.430> cord<00:02:17.640> you

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
nice braided cord again the one cord you

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.820 
nice braided cord again the one cord you
have<00:02:17.730> to<00:02:17.879> use<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.150> pretty<00:02:18.330> good<00:02:18.450> cord

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
have to use is a pretty good cord

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.900 
have to use is a pretty good cord
exactly<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:19.980> this<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.340> slightly<00:02:20.610> smaller

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
exactly and this is slightly smaller

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.470 
exactly and this is slightly smaller
profile<00:02:21.540> as<00:02:21.720> well<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.170> it's<00:02:22.830> even<00:02:23.069> less<00:02:23.250> and

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
profile as well so it's even less and

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.160 
profile as well so it's even less and
button<00:02:24.810> for<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.110> microphone<00:02:25.560> there<00:02:26.459> so<00:02:27.330> then

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
button for the microphone there so then

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.710 
button for the microphone there so then
exact<00:02:28.739> sound<00:02:29.040> as<00:02:29.400> we<00:02:29.640> were<00:02:29.730> just<00:02:29.970> touching<00:02:30.420> on

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
exact sound as we were just touching on

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.070 
exact sound as we were just touching on
and<00:02:31.049> basically<00:02:31.319> that's<00:02:31.650> three<00:02:31.920> profiles<00:02:32.370> and

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
and basically that's three profiles and

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.660 
and basically that's three profiles and
we<00:02:34.080> had<00:02:34.260> all<00:02:34.379> the<00:02:34.560> feedback<00:02:34.950> obviously<00:02:35.430> that

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
we had all the feedback obviously that

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.420 
we had all the feedback obviously that
even<00:02:36.299> though<00:02:36.510> we<00:02:36.810> had<00:02:37.019> modeled<00:02:37.409> the<00:02:37.650> Sundance

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
even though we had modeled the Sundance

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.990 
even though we had modeled the Sundance

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
50 ml drivers seven hate us so much yet

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.020 
50 ml drivers seven hate us so much yet
for<00:02:42.390> four<00:02:42.660> game<00:02:42.840> audio<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:43.920> less<00:02:44.190> bass<00:02:44.459> more

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
for four game audio so less bass more

footsteps<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:47.910> grenades<00:02:48.269> etc<00:02:49.250> now<00:02:50.250> we've<00:02:50.489> got

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
footsteps and grenades etc now we've got

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.430 
footsteps and grenades etc now we've got
three<00:02:50.940> profiles<00:02:51.450> which<00:02:51.660> actually<00:02:52.019> introduced

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
three profiles which actually introduced

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.490 
three profiles which actually introduced
some<00:02:52.620> more<00:02:52.769> base<00:02:52.950> levels<00:02:53.900> ideal<00:02:54.900> from<00:02:55.140> movies

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
some more base levels ideal from movies

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.490 
some more base levels ideal from movies
and<00:02:55.970> news<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.180> exception<00:02:57.720> or<00:02:57.959> an<00:02:58.110> heads<00:02:58.319> they're

as well yeah and I suppose some of the
games<00:03:04.170> which<00:03:04.440> are<00:03:04.560> more<00:03:04.680> dramatic<00:03:04.890> anyway<00:03:05.609> you

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
games which are more dramatic anyway you

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.640 
games which are more dramatic anyway you
might<00:03:06.000> want<00:03:06.209> some<00:03:06.480> of<00:03:06.599> the<00:03:06.750> base<00:03:06.959> levels<00:03:07.410> and

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
might want some of the base levels and

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.729 
might want some of the base levels and
some<00:03:07.769> game<00:03:08.010> music<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.810> some<00:03:09.810> of<00:03:09.930> those<00:03:10.049> extra

kind of got for you back and bill on
opener<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:14.510> on<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.660> off<00:03:15.750> button<00:03:16.140> you

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
opener and on and off button you

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.080 
opener and on and off button you
basically<00:03:16.620> press<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:17.099> and<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.370> flashes<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.790> say

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
basically press it and it flashes to say

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.610 
basically press it and it flashes to say
it's<00:03:18.269> a<00:03:18.500> synchronizing

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
it's a synchronizing

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.849 
it's a synchronizing
so<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.819> receiver<00:03:21.120> unit<00:03:21.450> or<00:03:22.109> should<00:03:22.470> I<00:03:22.560> say<00:03:22.709> the

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
so the receiver unit or should I say the

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.110 
so the receiver unit or should I say the
transmitter<00:03:24.410> this<00:03:25.410> is<00:03:25.890> basically<00:03:26.609> using

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
transmitter this is basically using

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.509 
transmitter this is basically using
wireless<00:03:27.450> technology<00:03:27.480> that<00:03:28.470> isn't<00:03:29.010> based<00:03:29.190> on

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
wireless technology that isn't based on

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.979 
wireless technology that isn't based on
the<00:03:29.609> usual<00:03:30.000> two<00:03:30.239> point<00:03:30.480> four<00:03:30.690> or<00:03:30.780> five

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
the usual two point four or five

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.319 
the usual two point four or five
gigahertz<00:03:31.579> it's<00:03:32.579> it's<00:03:32.880> got<00:03:33.060> its<00:03:33.180> own

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
gigahertz it's it's got its own

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.920 
gigahertz it's it's got its own
dedicated<00:03:33.750> channel<00:03:34.579> one<00:03:35.660> thing<00:03:36.660> that

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
dedicated channel one thing that

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.930 
dedicated channel one thing that
SteelSeries<00:03:37.349> didn't<00:03:37.799> want<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.099> do<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.700> we

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
SteelSeries didn't want to do and we

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.270 
SteelSeries didn't want to do and we
were<00:03:39.030> looking<00:03:39.180> at<00:03:39.450> Wireless<00:03:39.840> was<00:03:40.530> to<00:03:40.769> go<00:03:40.950> for

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
were looking at Wireless was to go for

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.470 
were looking at Wireless was to go for
something<00:03:41.459> that<00:03:41.760> could<00:03:41.940> have<00:03:42.329> these

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
something that could have these

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.110 
something that could have these
interference<00:03:43.319> or<00:03:43.650> difficulty<00:03:44.549> pairs<00:03:44.819> the

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
interference or difficulty pairs the

really<00:03:53.010> really<00:03:53.040> important<00:03:53.700> so<00:03:54.030> this<00:03:54.660> is<00:03:54.870> what

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
really really important so this is what

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.740 
really really important so this is what
really<00:03:55.470> has<00:03:55.709> taken<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.280> time<00:03:56.489> is<00:03:56.819> get<00:03:57.329> finding

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
really has taken the time is get finding

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.339 
really has taken the time is get finding
this<00:03:57.870> technology<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:59.209> so<00:04:00.209> we've<00:04:00.930> also<00:04:01.109> got

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
this technology and so we've also got

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.640 
this technology and so we've also got
volume<00:04:01.919> control<00:04:02.310> on<00:04:02.340> there<00:04:02.700> as<00:04:02.790> well<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:03.650> and

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
volume control on there as well and and

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.809 
volume control on there as well and and
that<00:04:05.130> is<00:04:05.459> pretty<00:04:05.940> much<00:04:06.269> it<00:04:06.329> as<00:04:06.870> simple<00:04:07.169> as<00:04:07.260> that

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
that is pretty much it as simple as that

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.819 
that is pretty much it as simple as that
we've<00:04:08.819> got<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.180> mock-up<00:04:09.480> of<00:04:09.750> the<00:04:09.900> box<00:04:10.139> how<00:04:10.709> it

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
we've got a mock-up of the box how it

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.220 
we've got a mock-up of the box how it
will<00:04:10.950> look<00:04:10.980> so<00:04:11.400> far<00:04:11.730> which<00:04:12.690> is<00:04:12.900> pretty<00:04:13.139> much

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
will look so far which is pretty much

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.740 
will look so far which is pretty much
the<00:04:13.379> same<00:04:13.769> in<00:04:14.040> line<00:04:14.220> with<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.579> Xbox<00:04:14.910> 360<00:04:15.510> stuff
