out<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.759> these<00:00:33.770> except<00:00:34.969> then<00:00:35.969> when<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.630> came<00:00:36.750> to

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
out of these except then when I came to

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.280 
out of these except then when I came to
spring<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:38.040> don't<00:00:39.000> know<00:00:39.180> why<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:39.750> my<00:00:39.960> tires

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
spring I don't know why but my tires

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.250 
spring I don't know why but my tires
weren't<00:00:40.649> glued<00:00:40.950> very<00:00:41.430> well<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.760> guess<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.570> they

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
weren't glued very well I guess but they

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.799 
weren't glued very well I guess but they
came<00:00:43.530> pretty<00:00:43.860> good<00:00:44.100> lube<00:00:44.730> with<00:00:44.969> my<00:00:45.149> ear<00:00:45.390> evil

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
came pretty good lube with my ear evil

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.880 
came pretty good lube with my ear evil
so<00:00:46.489> except<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:48.090> winter<00:00:48.350> they<00:00:49.350> didn't<00:00:49.680> then

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
so except in the winter they didn't then

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.549 
so except in the winter they didn't then
they<00:00:50.370> didn't<00:00:50.700> really<00:00:50.820> break<00:00:51.120> apart<00:00:51.539> cuz<00:00:51.899> there

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
they didn't really break apart cuz there

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.319 
they didn't really break apart cuz there
wasn't<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:52.980> much<00:00:53.219> friction<00:00:53.640> on<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.090> ground

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
wasn't that much friction on the ground

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.900 
wasn't that much friction on the ground
because<00:00:54.660> it<00:00:54.960> was<00:00:55.140> more<00:00:55.800> slippery<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
because it was more slippery and the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.599 
because it was more slippery and the
road<00:00:57.120> was<00:00:57.420> wet<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.350> tires<00:00:58.980> didn't<00:00:59.399> really

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
road was wet so the tires didn't really

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.029 
road was wet so the tires didn't really
have<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.879> stress<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.480> turn<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.960> much<00:01:01.199> but

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
have to stress the turn that much but

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.820 
have to stress the turn that much but
then<00:01:02.250> when<00:01:02.940> spring<00:01:03.449> came<00:01:03.780> around<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.559> road

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
then when spring came around the road

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.450 
then when spring came around the road
was<00:01:05.129> totally<00:01:05.549> dry<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.810> was<00:01:06.960> hot<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.710> was<00:01:08.369> a

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
was totally dry and it was hot it was a

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.690

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
when i started driving my ear evo around

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.840 
when i started driving my ear evo around
the<00:01:15.509> glue<00:01:15.869> finally<00:01:16.650> gave<00:01:16.950> out<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.549> then<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
the glue finally gave out and then the

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.850 
the glue finally gave out and then the
tires<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:20.240> fell<00:01:21.240> off<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.479> rims<00:01:22.020> technically

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
tires just fell off the rims technically

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.190

the one good tire i got they all fell
off<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.939> i<00:01:41.939> figured<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.810> actually<00:01:43.290> some

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.749 
off and i figured out that actually some
of<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.619> rims<00:01:43.890> were<00:01:44.310> actually<00:01:44.840> cracked<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.759> i

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
of the rims were actually cracked and i

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.399 
of the rims were actually cracked and i
don't<00:01:48.030> know<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.329> wasn't<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.780> big<00:01:48.990> of<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.229> bump

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
don't know it wasn't that big of a bump

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.490 
don't know it wasn't that big of a bump
so<00:01:49.770> don't<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.759> don't<00:01:50.790> just<00:01:51.299> say<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.540> me<00:01:51.689> like<00:01:52.229> oh

so don't so don't just say to me like oh

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.249 
so don't so don't just say to me like oh
you<00:01:53.369> probably<00:01:53.700> just<00:01:54.450> hit<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.780> bump<00:01:55.020> too<00:01:55.229> hard

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
lazy to just take off the tire so I just

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.720 
lazy to just take off the tire so I just
kept<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:04.879> on<00:03:04.970> my<00:03:05.150> ear<00:03:05.359> you<00:03:05.569> as<00:03:05.780> you<00:03:05.989> can<00:03:06.200> see<00:03:06.409> but

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
kept it on my ear you as you can see but

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.679 
kept it on my ear you as you can see but
so<00:03:07.730> and<00:03:08.090> you<00:03:08.870> can<00:03:09.079> see<00:03:09.290> that<00:03:09.319> the<00:03:10.209> big<00:03:11.209> joes<00:03:11.480> are

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:16.790 
a lot bigger and that makes you car may

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:18.729
