 on skates just to February also 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:13.480
 he likes to skate so he found a 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.270
 interesting modality of skates in 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.410
 nine appointments this modality is called 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.039
 slalom 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.039
 I'm going to be 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.440
 good 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.460
 I do not 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.820
 good 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.820
 I 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.030
 how 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.530
 the freestyle slalom is a modality 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.330
 new skating in our country the 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.910
 guys who practice it talked with 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.010
 us and they decided to tell us how to 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.320
 He came to our country in the same way 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.510
 we witnessed all the tricks that 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.030
 they realize that by the way they are 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.090
 extremely complicated and require a lot 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.280
 time and dedication 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.620
 good in front of this pioneering opening of 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.910
 this discipline in our country 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.800
 tell us a little 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.100
 first we saw the correct name of how 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.860
 it's called this sport is called freestyle 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.140
 slalom a little bit like one of the 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.420
 initiative to bring it here to Peru or 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.340
 maybe try to win adepts that 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.660
 practice or because we had not 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.400
 there were many people who do it too 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.180
 there was almost nothing 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:30.990
 so this sport started this in Peru 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:33.030
 about two and a half years ago 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.549
 in the beginning 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.320
 there was almost nobody together with a 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.420
 Bolivian and in English we begin to 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.299
 practice this one that was spinning a 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.909
 little of more people and more people is the 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.159
 Skating is a well-known sport but 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.450
 this method is new only in europe 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:54.060
 It is practiced a lot and also in Asia 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.540
 in Africa in South America too but the 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.119
 Peru was something totally new then 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.440
 to people every time someone is doing 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.440
 pirouettes you know them 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.039
 they stay a while like that watching the tricks 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.260
 and they liked then a sport that 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.990
 it got a lot of attention and people and 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.330
 everyone can practice it in reality 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.820
 the only thing is not that you have to know 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.890
 to have good to have the skates 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.720
 proper also that consists 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.030
 basically in the discipline that is a 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.010
 person who skates easily can 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.200
 get to do what you do 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.000
 do they consist of the pirouettes and 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.020
 we see here some pretty obstacles 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.210
 mozilla if the clock is like a is like 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:41.040
 a skating is an figure skating 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:43.470
 then it consists of dodging the cones 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.800
 like a dance 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.040
 Mix tricks until you go yourself 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.569
 putting together your combos that are combinations 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.109
 of tricks 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.510
 and you are acquiring a style for 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:01.010
 the movements that you are making and with 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.200
 your music becomes more fun 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.599
 this year because the good ending every 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.530
 person has a style of their own 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:12.090
 tricks are a bit complicated but bone 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.730
 if you practice with practice 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.069
 all the game each and not in their 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.560
 tricks or maybe do tricks like in the 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.660
 des that has marked already made or each 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.130
 has the possibility to innovate 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.740
 look there are a lot of tricks in the 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.080
 Slalom is like more than 30 tricks but 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.350
 there are also people who from nothing 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.420
 happened with biden one trick with another and 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.330
 put another one and out of nowhere comes a trick 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.520
 new how many guys make up people 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.040
 that you practice nothing those that are more 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:45.620
 advanced in more advanced level are like 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.859
 ten people have grown from the three 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.680
 we want those ten and the people now that 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.140
 is practicing more often around 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.200
 of 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.880
 40 people of the boys likewise 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.040
 they place the order to have a 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.410
 suitable environment especially in the subject 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:05.050
 of the track this must be flat and without 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.640
 bumps to avoid injuries after 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.030
 you do not have a circuit like 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.850
 those who have the skaters or something no no 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:16.060
 we need a smooth floor and without 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.150
 stripes without this bump 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.750
 for example the lighthouse is not the ideal floor 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.510
 but a music with the ballista me 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.270
 I do not know why there are not many spaces 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.730
 attended all stakeholders in 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.620

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.910
 that are all invited to come I am 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.350
