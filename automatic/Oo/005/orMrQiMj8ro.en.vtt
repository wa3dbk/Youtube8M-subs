00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.230
 we're still here in the kitchen 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:14.750
 to beat him today and I will 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.760
 teach how I cook good as a stew 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.100
 the beans when I take them to warn 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.590
 because I usually do not like to stew 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.570
 it does not taste richer but with that the diets 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.460
 Well, you know, I do not say I'm going to put 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.860
 it's a piece of onion like the fourth 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.100
 part the cut into slices like this 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.960
 halves in the lights and a third part 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.940
 of jalapeÃ±o pepper in pure squares 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.590
 small onions can also be 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.780
 cutting small squares is what 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.030
 I did before but now I liked that 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.680
 of cutting it in strips because I already 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.260
 grab more flavor the onion and 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.390
 apart he looks very father when they are 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.700
 thus serving well father who does not 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.010
 like the onion pure cigars of 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.010
 chilito and if you do not want to put that 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.180
 ok to the carton 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:11.170
 very hot hot well rich well 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:11.170
 ricolino at the same time the onion 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.890
 it kills me that will bring a little 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:24.720
 onion 3 assists capitalist highchairs 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:29.970
 as strange also chilito 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.970
 start to smell and it is very good 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.020
 effective that also smells for the week 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.950
 go a little more 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.100
 at four minus four say edit here 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.299
 I have the beans that are ready to 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.299
 empty a little while 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.480
 check the equation two minutes three 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.930
 Chiquita minutes are onion 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.530
 faster it is ready and it gets up 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.530
 that starts 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.880
 in this case the onion we have to wait 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.410
 a little bit to attend and as they 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.410
 I say a little more 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.040
 towards nothing 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:37.909
 this is the onion when you add beans 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:41.099
 It's a little bit like two people swims 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:43.280
 you can hang this can be for this 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:47.190
 it depends on how much you like the rituals 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:51.720
 that I turned around I'm going to cover up with some 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:55.680
 of paddle and it's here and I'll let that 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.579
 boil well about three minutes before 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.579

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:09.730
 boiling and here is a moment of is 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.730
 macho carlos 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.140
 there are places like the guatemala closer 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.319
 I do not know if Honduras also make us 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.900
 smoothies or lengthen the places 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.360
 they also know once they provide us and not 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.620
 had as well as origin knowing touching 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.470
 because I was used to this guy 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.260
 of beans since the suppliers 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.800
 they also know our rich and good 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.530
 Well, one of Mexican, we like it without 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.690

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.310
 shuffles two when no more than one collides 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.560
 little do not have to be a mold and 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.310
 two means well this fact of these already 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.220

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.170
 they are well well well rich I do not go 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.390
 to try because it's going to be the stew of 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.310
 pork and that's when I'm going to 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:00.470
