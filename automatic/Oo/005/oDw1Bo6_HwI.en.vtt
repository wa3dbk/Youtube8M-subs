00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
back in the first place was so that they

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.930 
back in the first place was so that they
can<00:02:53.660> punish<00:02:53.930> me<00:02:54.260> for<00:02:54.290> going<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.800> TNA<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.610> the

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.130 
only reason they gave me those two title
runs<00:02:58.130> was<00:02:58.490> because<00:02:58.820> my<00:02:59.000> friend<00:02:59.360> edge<00:02:59.600> begged
