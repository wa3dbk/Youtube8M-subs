00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
change the font and the layout and

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:36.920 
change the font and the layout and
whether<00:00:35.850> or<00:00:35.940> not<00:00:35.970> it<00:00:36.180> shows<00:00:36.540> copy<00:00:36.780> and

whether or not it shows copy and
uppercase<00:00:37.230> or<00:00:37.260> lowercase<00:00:37.440> so<00:00:38.220> it's<00:00:38.340> all<00:00:38.430> these

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550

different factors that it can it can

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.470 
different factors that it can it can
vary<00:00:40.430> and<00:00:41.430> each<00:00:41.550> one<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.760> those<00:00:41.850> factors<00:00:42.240> for

vary and each one of those factors for

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.120 
vary and each one of those factors for
us<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.720> represented<00:00:43.200> as<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> number<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.920> which

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:44.130 
us is represented as a number of which

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:48.380 
us is represented as a number of which
we're<00:00:44.310> considering<00:00:44.580> like<00:00:44.970> a<00:00:45.000> gene<00:00:45.410> so<00:00:47.390> those

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
we're considering like a gene so those

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.180 
we're considering like a gene so those
are<00:00:48.570> successful<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.380> get<00:00:49.590> people<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.980> look<00:00:50.070> at

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
are successful I get people to look at

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.830 
are successful I get people to look at
it<00:00:50.340> get<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.970> reproduce<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:51.690> other

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
it get to reproduce with other

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.360 
it get to reproduce with other
successful<00:00:52.079> ads<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.680> their<00:00:52.770> offspring<00:00:53.190> have

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
successful ads and their offspring have

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.220 
successful ads and their offspring have
a<00:00:53.400> combination<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.970> their<00:00:54.180> most<00:00:54.780> appearances

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
a combination of their most appearances

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.390 
a combination of their most appearances
genes<00:00:56.150> so<00:00:57.150> over<00:00:57.329> time<00:00:57.560> we<00:00:58.560> want<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:59.160> want<00:00:59.190> it

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
genes so over time we want to we want it

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.560 
genes so over time we want to we want it
to<00:00:59.489> evolve<00:00:59.760> into<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.180> more<00:01:00.360> and<00:01:00.480> more

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
to evolve into a more and more

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.680 
to evolve into a more and more
successful<00:01:00.989> ad<00:01:01.110> to<00:01:01.890> converge<00:01:02.250> onto<00:01:02.700> a<00:01:02.970> in<00:01:03.630> a

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
successful ad to converge onto a in a

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.469 
successful ad to converge onto a in a
sort<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:03.960> survival<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.530> fittest<00:01:05.329> since<00:01:06.329> we

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
sort of survival of the fittest since we

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.179 
sort of survival of the fittest since we
wanted<00:01:06.749> to<00:01:06.840> evolve<00:01:07.079> into<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.890> ad<00:01:07.979> that's

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
wanted to evolve into the the ad that's

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.190 
wanted to evolve into the the ad that's
most<00:01:08.369> fit<00:01:08.579> for<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:08.850> league<00:01:09.060> yeah<00:01:09.869> we've<00:01:10.049> only

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
most fit for this league yeah we've only

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.809 
most fit for this league yeah we've only
got<00:01:10.350> three<00:01:10.499> days<00:01:10.649> worth<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:10.950> results<00:01:11.369> but<00:01:11.609> so

00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:11.819 
got three days worth of results but so

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:14.590 
got three days worth of results but so
far<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.329> are<00:01:12.450> starting<00:01:12.929> to<00:01:13.109> see<00:01:13.140> some<00:01:13.319> patterns

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
far we are starting to see some patterns

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.160 
far we are starting to see some patterns
what<00:01:15.600> we<00:01:15.719> would<00:01:15.810> hope<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.619> over<00:01:17.280> time

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
what we would hope is that over time

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.660 
what we would hope is that over time
there's<00:01:19.170> less<00:01:19.319> variety<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.249> starts<00:01:20.549> off

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
there's less variety so it starts off

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.039 
there's less variety so it starts off
trying<00:01:20.909> lots<00:01:20.999> of<00:01:21.179> things<00:01:21.359> at<00:01:21.479> random<00:01:21.600> lots<00:01:21.990> of

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
trying lots of things at random lots of

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.330 
trying lots of things at random lots of
images<00:01:22.380> different<00:01:22.590> fonts<00:01:22.979> different<00:01:23.069> lines

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
images different fonts different lines

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.730 
images different fonts different lines
of<00:01:23.460> copy<00:01:23.639> and<00:01:24.539> over<00:01:24.899> time<00:01:25.109> it<00:01:25.380> gradually

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
of copy and over time it gradually

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.219 
of copy and over time it gradually
converges<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.639> less<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.060> less<00:01:27.179> solutions<00:01:27.780> as

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
converges on less and less solutions as

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.770 
converges on less and less solutions as
it<00:01:28.469> finds<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:29.039> more<00:01:29.299> effective<00:01:30.299> ones<00:01:30.479> and

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
it finds the more effective ones and

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.590 
it finds the more effective ones and
that<00:01:30.929> starting<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.350> happen<00:01:31.649> so<00:01:31.939> it's<00:01:32.939> deciding

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
that starting to happen so it's deciding

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.709 
that starting to happen so it's deciding
now<00:01:33.749> that<00:01:34.109> shorter<00:01:34.439> copy<00:01:34.619> works<00:01:34.889> best<00:01:35.719> it

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:36.719 
now that shorter copy works best it

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:38.330 
now that shorter copy works best it
finds<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.229> writing<00:01:37.649> stuff<00:01:37.859> in<00:01:37.950> capitals

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
finds the writing stuff in capitals

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.819 
finds the writing stuff in capitals
works<00:01:38.579> overwhelmingly<00:01:39.439> surprisingly<00:01:40.439> it

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
works overwhelmingly surprisingly it

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.440 
works overwhelmingly surprisingly it
started<00:01:41.249> off<00:01:41.310> with<00:01:41.399> lots<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.670> different

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
started off with lots of different

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.649 
started off with lots of different
brightly<00:01:43.109> colored<00:01:43.350> images<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.279> over<00:01:44.520> time<00:01:44.729> it

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
brightly colored images and over time it

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.599 
brightly colored images and over time it
went<00:01:45.899> through<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.380> phase<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:47.069> showing<00:01:47.429> more

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:47.609 
went through a phase of showing more

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:50.809 
went through a phase of showing more
kind<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.909> plain<00:01:48.209> gray<00:01:48.869> textures<00:01:49.579> but<00:01:50.579> now<00:01:50.700> it

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:50.819 
kind of plain gray textures but now it

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:52.910 
kind of plain gray textures but now it
seems<00:01:50.999> to<00:01:51.060> have<00:01:51.270> gone<00:01:51.420> for<00:01:51.569> hearts<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.319> we've

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
seems to have gone for hearts so we've

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.469 
seems to have gone for hearts so we've
got<00:01:53.039> several<00:01:53.310> different<00:01:53.399> heart<00:01:53.880> images<00:01:54.329> in

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
got several different heart images in

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.029 
got several different heart images in
the<00:01:54.569> database<00:01:54.959> and<00:01:55.170> for<00:01:55.259> some<00:01:55.409> reason<00:01:55.740> it's

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
the database and for some reason it's

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:57.679 
the database and for some reason it's
showing<00:01:56.369> loads<00:01:56.609> and<00:01:56.700> loads<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.880> half<00:01:57.029> so<00:01:57.329> it

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
showing loads and loads of half so it

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.529 
showing loads and loads of half so it
seems<00:01:57.869> that<00:01:57.959> people<00:01:58.079> like<00:01:58.409> carps<00:01:59.299> well<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.329> mean

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
seems that people like carps well I mean

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.149 
seems that people like carps well I mean
at<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.810> moment<00:02:01.079> for<00:02:01.289> us<00:02:01.319> from<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.740> data<00:02:01.950> side

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
at the moment for us from the data side

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.740 
at the moment for us from the data side
it's<00:02:02.279> very<00:02:02.310> early<00:02:02.670> days<00:02:02.789> right<00:02:03.179> say<00:02:03.420> what

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
it's very early days right say what

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.150 
it's very early days right say what

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
algorithm that embassy have actually put

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.300 
algorithm that embassy have actually put
together<00:02:06.900> along<00:02:07.470> with<00:02:08.420> 51<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.539> results

order to then work out on a day to day
basis<00:02:15.450> what<00:02:16.050> trends<00:02:16.500> we<00:02:16.650> actually<00:02:16.920> begin<00:02:17.100> to

basis what trends we actually begin to

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.610 
basis what trends we actually begin to
see<00:02:17.520> so<00:02:17.820> we<00:02:17.910> can<00:02:18.000> actually<00:02:18.120> obtain<00:02:18.510> inside<00:02:19.110> not

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620
