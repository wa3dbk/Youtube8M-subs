and then let me go to Google this one's
doing<00:01:04.769> some<00:01:04.979> speed<00:01:05.250> tests<00:01:05.519> earlier<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:10.310> so<00:01:11.310> in

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
doing some speed tests earlier and so in

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.789 
doing some speed tests earlier and so in
networks<00:01:12.210> fine<00:01:12.810> here<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.590> go<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:15.080> muse<00:01:17.090> and

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
networks fine here and go to muse and

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.580 
networks fine here and go to muse and
it's<00:01:19.799> pretty<00:01:20.220> pretty<00:01:20.820> darn<00:01:21.090> fast<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.750> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
it's pretty pretty darn fast and the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.510 
it's pretty pretty darn fast and the
reason<00:01:22.920> I'm<00:01:23.040> using<00:01:23.100> my<00:01:23.490> palm<00:01:23.850> pre<00:01:24.060> as<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:25.520> Wi-Fi

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
reason I'm using my palm pre as a Wi-Fi

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.399 
reason I'm using my palm pre as a Wi-Fi
hotspot<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:27.150> because<00:01:27.420> sometimes<00:01:27.840> my<00:01:27.900> t-mobile

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
hotspot is because sometimes my t-mobile

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.969 
hotspot is because sometimes my t-mobile
is<00:01:29.250> really<00:01:29.970> slow<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:30.869> I'm<00:01:31.320> at<00:01:31.470> my<00:01:31.619> parents

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
is really slow like I'm at my parents

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.370 
is really slow like I'm at my parents
place<00:01:32.009> right<00:01:32.490> now<00:01:32.640> but<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.659> internet<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.020> so

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
place right now but the internet is so

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.609 
place right now but the internet is so
slow<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:35.840> sometimes<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.930> don't<00:01:36.990> get<00:01:37.259> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
slow that sometimes I don't get the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.980 
slow that sometimes I don't get the
right<00:01:37.740> signals<00:01:38.159> so<00:01:38.579> let<00:01:39.090> me<00:01:39.119> connect<00:01:39.420> it<00:01:39.600> to

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
right signals so let me connect it to

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.090 
right signals so let me connect it to
the<00:01:40.380> palm<00:01:40.619> pre<00:01:40.770> on<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.130> one<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:42.619> connect<00:01:43.619> I

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.929 

should<00:01:47.100> connect<00:01:48.920> there<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:49.979> go<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.759> got

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
should connect there you go so you got

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.719 
should connect there you go so you got
another<00:01:51.149> buzz<00:01:51.450> there<00:01:52.009> every<00:01:53.009> time<00:01:53.189> buzzes
