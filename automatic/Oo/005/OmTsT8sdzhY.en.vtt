that I think that's that's what's really
exciting<00:00:51.449> about<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:53.090> and<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.270> saw<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:55.170> saw

there's a piece actually where is it
there<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.899> think<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.230> over<00:00:58.350> here

like the way it seemed like he was
basically<00:01:15.200> making<00:01:15.380> up<00:01:15.590> as<00:01:15.710> he<00:01:15.800> went<00:01:15.950> along<00:01:17.080> but

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
point of obsession and and fixation

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.060 
point of obsession and and fixation
there's<00:02:42.850> so<00:02:43.000> many<00:02:43.060> moods<00:02:43.959> in<00:02:44.290> poor<00:02:44.560> guys<00:02:44.800> work

there's so many moods in poor guys work

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.650 
there's so many moods in poor guys work

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
it's almost contradictory it's like

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.750 
it's almost contradictory it's like
sometimes<00:02:47.080> he's<00:02:47.290> really<00:02:48.010> obsessive<00:02:48.370> about

sometimes he's really obsessive about
certain<00:02:49.150> things<00:02:49.450> and<00:02:49.720> we<00:02:50.080> can<00:02:50.230> imagine<00:02:50.440> him<00:02:50.709> a

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
certain things and we can imagine him a

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.270 
certain things and we can imagine him a
milestone<00:02:51.310> but<00:02:51.880> being<00:02:52.090> so<00:02:52.300> into<00:02:52.570> it<00:02:52.690> he<00:02:53.280> it

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
milestone but being so into it he it

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.860

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
like something like that you know so

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.789 
like something like that you know so

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
it's actually it's actually called

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.910 
it's actually it's actually called
harmony<00:03:03.370> but<00:03:04.030> yeah<00:03:04.209> yes<00:03:04.660> sir<00:03:04.930> yeah<00:03:05.799> it's

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
really it's such a range of emotion in

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.690 
really it's such a range of emotion in
his<00:03:08.380> work<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:10.500> think<00:03:11.500> it's<00:03:11.680> quite<00:03:11.860> easy<00:03:12.100> people

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
his work I think it's quite easy people

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.960 
his work I think it's quite easy people
to<00:03:12.850> feel<00:03:13.000> like<00:03:13.030> art<00:03:13.540> is<00:03:13.750> inaccessible<00:03:14.970> you

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
to feel like art is inaccessible you

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.330 
to feel like art is inaccessible you
feel<00:03:16.299> you<00:03:16.930> can't<00:03:17.170> identify<00:03:17.260> with<00:03:17.980> it<00:03:18.130> and

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
feel you can't identify with it and

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.949 
feel you can't identify with it and
secondly<00:03:18.910> that<00:03:18.970> you<00:03:19.209> could<00:03:19.390> never<00:03:19.570> do

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
secondly that you could never do

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.630 
secondly that you could never do
anything<00:03:20.410> that<00:03:20.620> was<00:03:20.769> technically<00:03:21.400> that

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
anything that was technically that

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.710 
anything that was technically that
proficient<00:03:23.970> but<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.150> me<00:03:25.299> things<00:03:25.570> like<00:03:25.630> that

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
proficient but to me things like that

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.050 
proficient but to me things like that
don't<00:03:25.989> really<00:03:26.200> mean<00:03:26.530> as<00:03:26.680> much<00:03:26.890> as<00:03:26.950> a<00:03:27.430> lot<00:03:28.000> of

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
don't really mean as much as a lot of

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.280 
don't really mean as much as a lot of
Paul<00:03:28.239> clay<00:03:28.510> stuff<00:03:28.810> which<00:03:28.959> is<00:03:28.989> quite

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
Paul clay stuff which is quite

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.530 
Paul clay stuff which is quite
instinctive<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:30.430> somehow<00:03:31.209> it<00:03:31.390> has<00:03:31.510> a

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
instinctive and somehow it has a

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.410 
instinctive and somehow it has a
lot<00:03:31.840> more<00:03:31.989> life<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.820> he's<00:03:33.820> got<00:03:34.000> a<00:03:34.060> sort<00:03:34.360> of

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:34.420 
lot more life to it he's got a sort of

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.540 
lot more life to it he's got a sort of
an<00:03:35.140> enthusiasm

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
an enthusiasm

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.670 
an enthusiasm
which<00:03:37.120> is<00:03:37.300> sort<00:03:37.420> of<00:03:37.510> bordering<00:03:37.840> on<00:03:37.990> childlike

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
which is sort of bordering on childlike

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.180 
which is sort of bordering on childlike
I<00:03:42.840> think<00:03:43.840> more<00:03:43.990> than<00:03:44.170> any<00:03:44.320> other<00:03:44.530> artist<00:03:44.620> I

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
I think more than any other artist I

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.400 
I think more than any other artist I
think<00:03:45.400> with<00:03:45.520> Paul<00:03:45.700> clay<00:03:46.000> and<00:03:46.300> especially<00:03:47.140> when

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
think with Paul clay and especially when

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.050 
think with Paul clay and especially when
you<00:03:47.500> see<00:03:47.710> it<00:03:47.860> right<00:03:48.160> in<00:03:48.190> front<00:03:48.490> of<00:03:48.670> you<00:03:48.790> as<00:03:48.880> well

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
you see it right in front of you as well

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.730 
you see it right in front of you as well
when<00:03:49.270> you<00:03:49.390> see<00:03:49.600> a<00:03:49.630> whole<00:03:49.780> body<00:03:50.020> of<00:03:50.170> his<00:03:50.290> work<00:03:50.470> it

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
when you see a whole body of his work it

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.310 
when you see a whole body of his work it
could<00:03:50.860> really<00:03:51.100> send<00:03:51.430> you<00:03:51.580> in<00:03:51.700> any<00:03:51.850> any

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
could really send you in any any

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.320 
could really send you in any any
direction
