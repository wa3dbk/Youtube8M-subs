00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.990
 in the new category 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.179
 play or not play we will be short 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.490
 talk about the good and bad sides 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.680
 games without spoilers without crushing 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.789
 and without compromise just what you can 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.930
 love this or that game and hate 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:23.250
 today we will tell about cyberpunk 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.869
 adventures of remember me 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.849
 young french team dontnod 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.619
 together with capcom wanted to create 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.840
 every way unique game or how 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.550
 minimum unusual catch fitting 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.230
 Combat System Combination Techniques 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.660
 which is not considered a new gaming 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.790
 mechanics atypical heroine is everything so 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.360
 rosy in the kingdom of french you learn 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.360
 from our review 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.640
 so advantages one of the main advantages 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.440
 thoughtful and believable world 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.719
 near future where detail 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.110
 explained his life and history therefore 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.309
 be sure to look for all the diaries 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.750
 Separately worth highlighting the design and 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.909
 visual variety of all 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.979
 components of the game from the detail you are very 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.110
 His Paris was brightly worked on. 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.200
 actors even if those appear 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.060
 just a couple of scenes the game strictly follows 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.880
 cyberpunk covenants to bookstores and 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.479
 cinema workshop work plan 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.149
 musical accompaniment and design 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.979
 the plot will not leave you indifferent 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.399
 the main character made a woman that too 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.350
 a plus 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:31.020
 in the gaming industry infrequently weaker sex 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.910
 I trust such roles new gameplay 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.539
 mechanics mounting memory 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:38.190
 really new and worthwhile find 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.979
 good puzzles that will have 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.780
 think it all but does not make the game 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.679
 so good on the cons can not 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.840
 turn a blind eye 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.399
 one of them is linearity rich on 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.119
 details of the world want to spend more 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.170
 of time exploring every nook and cranny but alas 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.940
 seemingly combat system 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.509
 diversity turns out to be 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.509
 very simple and annoying just four 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.489
 episode with mounting memory 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:06.330
 jerky animation unresponsive 

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:09.360
 control camera with character and very 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.569
 appeasable last boss whom we 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.090
 we will not show you the shameful triviality 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.400
 Russian localization is lame average 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.790
 she's normal but with monstrous blunders in 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.790
 important places 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.810
 play or not play in mv name so 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.819
 easy to solve in the first place it 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.430
 adventure outside the formats and then already 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.590
 game so if you want stories with 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.359
 excellent audio-visual accompaniment 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.730
 feel free to take the game before 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:37.739
 putting the difficulty level on easy but 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.900
 if the gameplay is more important to you then itâ€™s better not 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.239
 waste your time on the frame we are myth but 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.370
 metacritic overall score from journalists 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.109
 was seven point one tenth 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:53.609
 and the players became generous with seven 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:54.599
 half the author of the text and speaker 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:58.400
