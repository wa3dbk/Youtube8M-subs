now<00:02:25.010> I'm<00:02:25.130> going<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.400> try<00:02:25.610> something<00:02:25.850> a<00:02:26.090> little

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
now I'm going to try something a little

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.240 
now I'm going to try something a little
different<00:02:26.690> and<00:02:26.840> show<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.500> mascara<00:02:27.980> licks

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
different and show you to mascara licks

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.120 
different and show you to mascara licks
1<00:02:28.790> just<00:02:29.030> using<00:02:29.360> mascara<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.320> other<00:02:30.530> using

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
1 just using mascara and the other using

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.780 
1 just using mascara and the other using
popular<00:02:31.700> mascara<00:02:32.240> tricks<00:02:33.070> so<00:02:34.070> I<00:02:34.580> recently

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
popular mascara tricks so I recently

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.970 
popular mascara tricks so I recently
learned<00:02:35.270> that<00:02:35.570> women<00:02:36.140> have<00:02:36.290> been<00:02:36.410> using<00:02:36.440> baby

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
learned that women have been using baby

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.970 
learned that women have been using baby
powder<00:02:37.370> on<00:02:37.550> curled<00:02:38.180> lashes<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:39.380> act<00:02:39.590> as<00:02:39.800> a

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
powder on curled lashes to act as a

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.340 
powder on curled lashes to act as a
primer<00:02:40.370> of<00:02:40.670> sorts<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.420> boost<00:02:41.690> up<00:02:41.900> the<00:02:42.020> volume

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
primer of sorts to boost up the volume

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.650 
primer of sorts to boost up the volume
of<00:02:42.500> lashes<00:02:43.040> so<00:02:43.670> I<00:02:43.700> figured<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:44.180> would<00:02:44.210> give<00:02:44.540> it<00:02:44.630> a

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
of lashes so I figured I would give it a

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.230 
of lashes so I figured I would give it a
try<00:02:44.990> and<00:02:45.290> I<00:02:45.650> topped<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.340> baby<00:02:46.580> powder<00:02:46.850> with

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
try and I topped the baby powder with

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.780 
try and I topped the baby powder with
some<00:02:47.480> of<00:02:47.600> my<00:02:47.630> favorite<00:02:48.100> waterproof<00:02:49.100> mascaras

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
some of my favorite waterproof mascaras

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.520 
some of my favorite waterproof mascaras
and<00:02:50.150> I<00:02:50.540> actually<00:02:50.690> didn't<00:02:51.170> see<00:02:51.320> as<00:02:51.470> much

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
and I actually didn't see as much

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.590 
and I actually didn't see as much
clumping<00:02:52.220> as<00:02:52.520> I<00:02:52.640> had<00:02:52.790> anticipated

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
clumping as I had anticipated

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.470 
clumping as I had anticipated
but<00:02:54.050> you'll<00:02:54.200> see<00:02:54.530> here<00:02:54.980> that<00:02:55.010> that<00:02:55.610> extra<00:02:56.120> step

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
but you'll see here that that extra step

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.410 
but you'll see here that that extra step
doesn't<00:02:57.110> even<00:02:57.260> compare<00:02:57.800> to<00:02:57.830> just<00:02:58.670> one<00:02:58.910> coat<00:02:59.180> of

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
doesn't even compare to just one coat of

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.320 
doesn't even compare to just one coat of
the<00:02:59.660> Lancome<00:03:00.110> grandiose<00:03:00.770> mascara<00:03:01.010> on<00:03:01.700> just<00:03:02.240> my

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
the Lancome grandiose mascara on just my

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.120 
the Lancome grandiose mascara on just my
bare<00:03:02.540> lashes<00:03:03.110> I<00:03:03.350> was<00:03:03.740> pretty<00:03:03.980> impressed

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
bare lashes I was pretty impressed

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.000 
bare lashes I was pretty impressed
because<00:03:04.640> I<00:03:04.880> used<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.780> waterproof<00:03:06.290> mascara<00:03:06.470> with

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
because I used a waterproof mascara with

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.800 
because I used a waterproof mascara with
the<00:03:07.100> baby<00:03:07.280> powder<00:03:07.520> trick<00:03:07.910> but<00:03:08.300> the<00:03:08.420> Lancome

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
the baby powder trick but the Lancome

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:10.600 
the baby powder trick but the Lancome
grandiose<00:03:09.260> is<00:03:09.470> not<00:03:09.620> even<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.070> waterproof

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
grandiose is not even a waterproof

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.550 
grandiose is not even a waterproof
mascara<00:03:10.790> so<00:03:11.510> those<00:03:11.660> are<00:03:11.810> some<00:03:11.990> pretty<00:03:12.020> great

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
mascara so those are some pretty great

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.410 
mascara so those are some pretty great
results<00:03:15.400> now<00:03:16.400> I'm<00:03:16.520> going<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:16.850> share<00:03:17.060> with<00:03:17.209> you

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
results now I'm going to share with you

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.120 
results now I'm going to share with you
a<00:03:17.450> second<00:03:18.080> trick<00:03:18.290> that<00:03:18.530> I<00:03:18.560> learned<00:03:18.830> recently

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
a second trick that I learned recently

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.970 
a second trick that I learned recently
and<00:03:19.760> that's<00:03:20.120> to<00:03:20.390> separate<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.230> lashes<00:03:21.500> and

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
and that's to separate the lashes and

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.010 
and that's to separate the lashes and
remove<00:03:22.340> clumps<00:03:22.850> with<00:03:23.000> a<00:03:23.030> safety<00:03:23.360> pin<00:03:23.780> or

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
remove clumps with a safety pin or

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.400 
remove clumps with a safety pin or
tweezer<00:03:24.500> now<00:03:25.400> I<00:03:25.820> was<00:03:26.120> a<00:03:26.360> little<00:03:26.390> too<00:03:27.020> scared<00:03:27.320> to

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
tweezer now I was a little too scared to

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.470 
tweezer now I was a little too scared to
use<00:03:27.560> the<00:03:27.680> safety<00:03:28.040> pin<00:03:28.459> just<00:03:28.820> in<00:03:29.030> case<00:03:29.239> of

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
use the safety pin just in case of

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.570 
use the safety pin just in case of
poking<00:03:29.930> my<00:03:30.080> eye<00:03:30.110> out<00:03:30.320> despite<00:03:31.160> having<00:03:31.430> a

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
poking my eye out despite having a

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.630 
poking my eye out despite having a
steady<00:03:32.000> hand<00:03:32.330> so<00:03:33.019> I<00:03:33.050> used<00:03:33.500> a<00:03:33.739> very<00:03:34.040> pointy

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
steady hand so I used a very pointy

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.390 
steady hand so I used a very pointy
tweezer<00:03:35.090> 'men<00:03:35.239> tweezer<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:35.989> I<00:03:36.590> will<00:03:36.830> say<00:03:37.100> that

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
tweezer 'men tweezer and I will say that

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.090 
tweezer 'men tweezer and I will say that
it<00:03:37.580> actually<00:03:37.610> did<00:03:38.330> work<00:03:38.540> fairly<00:03:39.019> well<00:03:39.170> but<00:03:39.920> it

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
it actually did work fairly well but it

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.970 
it actually did work fairly well but it
does<00:03:40.370> take<00:03:40.760> quite<00:03:41.030> a<00:03:41.150> while<00:03:41.300> to<00:03:41.930> separate<00:03:42.769> and

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
does take quite a while to separate and

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.580 
does take quite a while to separate and
rake<00:03:43.250> through<00:03:43.640> each<00:03:43.940> individual<00:03:44.750> eyelash<00:03:45.260> and

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
rake through each individual eyelash and

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.490 
rake through each individual eyelash and
to<00:03:46.040> really<00:03:46.340> remove<00:03:46.820> those<00:03:47.120> clumps<00:03:47.570> so<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:48.140> would

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
to really remove those clumps so I would

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.190 
to really remove those clumps so I would
probably<00:03:48.739> just<00:03:49.010> use<00:03:49.550> a<00:03:49.880> mascara<00:03:50.390> wand<00:03:50.570> that

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
probably just use a mascara wand that

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.840 
probably just use a mascara wand that
can<00:03:51.470> separate<00:03:51.920> better<00:03:52.280> I'm<00:03:52.610> definitely

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
can separate better I'm definitely

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.670 
can separate better I'm definitely
low-maintenance<00:03:53.510> when<00:03:54.049> it<00:03:54.140> comes<00:03:54.350> to<00:03:54.530> my<00:03:54.650> eye

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
low-maintenance when it comes to my eye

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.910 
low-maintenance when it comes to my eye
lashes<00:03:55.070> so<00:03:55.850> as<00:03:56.180> fun<00:03:56.600> and<00:03:56.900> funny<00:03:57.200> as<00:03:57.560> these

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
lashes so as fun and funny as these

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.800 
lashes so as fun and funny as these
tricks<00:03:58.340> are<00:03:58.519> I'll<00:03:58.760> definitely<00:03:59.269> be<00:03:59.420> sticking

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
tricks are I'll definitely be sticking

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:15.710 
tricks are I'll definitely be sticking

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
I like to wear my makeup on the everyday

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.190 
I like to wear my makeup on the everyday
and<00:04:22.410> yes<00:04:23.370> I<00:04:23.550> really<00:04:23.700> do<00:04:23.940> wear<00:04:24.210> em<00:04:24.450> scribble

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
and yes I really do wear em scribble

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.140 
and yes I really do wear em scribble
liner<00:04:25.350> pretty<00:04:25.680> often<00:04:25.860> I<00:04:26.250> just<00:04:26.640> love<00:04:26.850> that<00:04:26.880> it

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
liner pretty often I just love that it

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.420 
liner pretty often I just love that it
has<00:04:27.300> a<00:04:27.570> really<00:04:27.780> thin<00:04:28.080> applicator<00:04:28.650> because<00:04:29.220> my

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
has a really thin applicator because my

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.010 
has a really thin applicator because my
lashes<00:04:29.670> grow<00:04:30.030> all<00:04:30.330> over<00:04:30.690> the<00:04:30.810> place

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
lashes grow all over the place

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.470 
lashes grow all over the place
especially<00:04:31.830> on<00:04:32.070> this<00:04:32.250> side<00:04:32.310> sometimes<00:04:33.120> it's

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
especially on this side sometimes it's

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.300 
especially on this side sometimes it's
hard<00:04:33.630> to<00:04:33.660> get<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:33.870> really<00:04:34.110> crisp<00:04:34.440> straight<00:04:35.010> line

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
hard to get a really crisp straight line

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.670 
hard to get a really crisp straight line
but<00:04:35.820> because<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.270> M<00:04:36.420> eyeliner<00:04:37.080> applicator<00:04:37.590> is

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
but because the M eyeliner applicator is

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.630 
but because the M eyeliner applicator is
so<00:04:37.920> thin<00:04:38.340> it<00:04:38.670> really<00:04:38.940> gets<00:04:39.150> a<00:04:39.360> super<00:04:40.260> tight

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640 
so thin it really gets a super tight

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.820 
so thin it really gets a super tight
even<00:04:41.640> close<00:04:42.060> line<00:04:42.330> to<00:04:42.630> my<00:04:42.750> lashes<00:04:42.960> and<00:04:43.470> of

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
even close line to my lashes and of

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.920 
even close line to my lashes and of
course<00:04:44.040> I<00:04:44.220> love<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.520> grandiose<00:04:45.180> packaging

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
course I love the grandiose packaging

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.350 
course I love the grandiose packaging
for<00:04:46.230> the<00:04:46.410> Elanco<00:04:46.800> mascara<00:04:47.250> it<00:04:47.670> just<00:04:47.940> reminds

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
for the Elanco mascara it just reminds

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.210 
for the Elanco mascara it just reminds
me<00:04:48.450> so<00:04:48.510> much<00:04:48.780> of<00:04:48.990> a<00:04:49.290> fragrance<00:04:49.710> bottle<00:04:49.920> just

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
me so much of a fragrance bottle just

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.870 
me so much of a fragrance bottle just
because<00:04:50.550> of<00:04:50.700> that

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
because of that

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.480 
because of that
ombre<00:04:51.300> effect<00:04:51.660> that<00:04:51.840> it<00:04:51.960> has<00:04:52.140> with<00:04:52.740> the<00:04:52.800> rose

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
ombre effect that it has with the rose

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.090 
ombre effect that it has with the rose
in<00:04:53.880> the<00:04:54.000> center<00:04:54.420> I<00:04:54.660> just<00:04:55.020> love<00:04:55.260> the<00:04:55.530> lucite

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
in the center I just love the lucite

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.340 
in the center I just love the lucite
look<00:04:56.400> so<00:04:56.730> maybe<00:04:57.210> that's<00:04:57.630> just<00:04:57.870> my<00:04:58.080> preference

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
look so maybe that's just my preference

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.260 
look so maybe that's just my preference
but<00:04:58.710> I<00:04:58.800> think<00:04:59.070> that<00:04:59.190> the<00:04:59.280> packaging<00:04:59.820> is<00:05:00.000> just

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
but I think that the packaging is just

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.510 
but I think that the packaging is just
fabulous<00:05:00.750> and<00:05:01.320> as<00:05:01.620> far<00:05:01.800> as<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:02.040> wand<00:05:02.250> goes

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
fabulous and as far as the wand goes

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.640 
fabulous and as far as the wand goes
it's<00:05:02.760> actually<00:05:03.180> more<00:05:03.450> beneficial<00:05:03.960> than<00:05:04.140> just

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
it's actually more beneficial than just

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.190 
it's actually more beneficial than just
for<00:05:04.920> grabbing<00:05:05.460> each<00:05:05.670> lash<00:05:06.030> every<00:05:06.720> time<00:05:06.930> you

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
for grabbing each lash every time you

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.900 
for grabbing each lash every time you
place<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:07.650> wand<00:05:07.830> back<00:05:08.190> into<00:05:08.520> the<00:05:08.640> tube

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
place the wand back into the tube

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.480 
place the wand back into the tube
because<00:05:09.600> of<00:05:09.810> the<00:05:09.900> bend<00:05:10.170> it<00:05:10.500> actually<00:05:10.950> mixes

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
because of the bend it actually mixes

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.880 
because of the bend it actually mixes
the<00:05:11.670> formula<00:05:12.240> within<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:13.260> bottle<00:05:13.470> so<00:05:13.860> that

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
the formula within the bottle so that

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.100 
the formula within the bottle so that
you<00:05:14.100> get<00:05:14.250> fresh<00:05:14.550> mascara<00:05:15.060> every<00:05:15.510> time<00:05:15.720> instead

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
you get fresh mascara every time instead

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.290 
you get fresh mascara every time instead
of<00:05:16.260> pumping<00:05:16.530> as<00:05:17.010> you<00:05:17.280> would<00:05:17.430> with<00:05:17.610> a<00:05:17.640> standard

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
of pumping as you would with a standard

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.930 
of pumping as you would with a standard
straight<00:05:18.960> mascara<00:05:19.500> tube<00:05:19.740> and<00:05:20.010> also<00:05:20.520> it

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
straight mascara tube and also it

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:23.659 
straight mascara tube and also it
definitely<00:05:21.570> stays<00:05:21.900> fresher<00:05:22.380> for<00:05:22.770> a<00:05:22.800> longer<00:05:23.280> so

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:23.669 
definitely stays fresher for a longer so

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.390 
definitely stays fresher for a longer so
it<00:05:24.000> has<00:05:24.300> benefits<00:05:25.050> since<00:05:25.290> it<00:05:25.470> doesn't<00:05:25.680> let<00:05:26.040> so

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
it has benefits since it doesn't let so

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.790 
it has benefits since it doesn't let so
much<00:05:26.640> air<00:05:26.910> into<00:05:27.360> the<00:05:27.480> tube<00:05:27.780> and<00:05:28.110> of<00:05:28.350> course<00:05:28.590> it

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:28.800 
much air into the tube and of course it

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.890 
much air into the tube and of course it
doesn't<00:05:29.010> hurt<00:05:29.340> that<00:05:29.640> the<00:05:29.880> mascara<00:05:30.390> wand<00:05:30.690> was

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
doesn't hurt that the mascara wand was

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.990 
doesn't hurt that the mascara wand was
designed<00:05:31.350> to<00:05:31.680> work<00:05:32.070> with<00:05:32.250> your<00:05:32.400> nose<00:05:32.610> and<00:05:32.880> your

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
designed to work with your nose and your

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.580 
designed to work with your nose and your
cheeks<00:05:33.300> and<00:05:33.510> your<00:05:33.600> forehead<00:05:33.840> to<00:05:34.260> make<00:05:34.410> sure

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
cheeks and your forehead to make sure

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.380 
cheeks and your forehead to make sure
you<00:05:34.680> could<00:05:34.860> grab<00:05:35.040> each<00:05:35.310> lash<00:05:35.610> so<00:05:36.090> it<00:05:36.180> just

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
you could grab each lash so it just

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.990 
you could grab each lash so it just
makes<00:05:36.600> applying<00:05:37.200> mascara<00:05:37.710> much<00:05:38.310> easier<00:05:38.790> I

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
makes applying mascara much easier I

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.820 
makes applying mascara much easier I
never<00:05:39.419> have<00:05:39.660> to<00:05:39.780> use<00:05:39.900> more<00:05:40.110> than<00:05:40.140> two<00:05:40.530> coats

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
never have to use more than two coats

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.100 
never have to use more than two coats
just<00:05:41.340> because<00:05:41.610> it<00:05:41.730> gives<00:05:41.910> my<00:05:42.060> lashes<00:05:42.270> a<00:05:42.510> lot<00:05:42.930> of

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
just because it gives my lashes a lot of

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.440 
just because it gives my lashes a lot of
volume<00:05:43.530> so<00:05:43.860> what<00:05:43.980> lengthens<00:05:44.580> lifts<00:05:45.300> it

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
volume so what lengthens lifts it

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.630 
volume so what lengthens lifts it
volumizes<00:05:45.930> it<00:05:46.470> pretty<00:05:46.680> much<00:05:46.830> does<00:05:47.130> it<00:05:47.160> all<00:05:47.400> and

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
volumizes it pretty much does it all and

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.970 
volumizes it pretty much does it all and
it's<00:05:47.760> the<00:05:47.940> best<00:05:48.270> non<00:05:48.750> waterproof<00:05:49.080> mascara

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980 
it's the best non waterproof mascara

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.880 
it's the best non waterproof mascara
that<00:05:50.520> I<00:05:50.580> found<00:05:51.120> that<00:05:51.540> works<00:05:51.750> for<00:05:51.960> my<00:05:52.080> lashes<00:05:52.290> in
