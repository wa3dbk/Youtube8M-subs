00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.099
 to see how it might look like 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.750
 have noticed that the user synonymous 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.980
 reasonably on us network partner 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.809
 divided I find a really cool 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.760
 factual animal goat on it and 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.130

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.480

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.460
 Just let me and I will 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.050
 every Saturday so the hottest 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.820
 videos someone out there in the week 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.330
 the network will still be so 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.730
 the new member and the network you 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.649

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.550

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.260
 just a little bit about that 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.120
 network tell what's new 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.550
 what it has admitted who maybe that 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.750
 Has cracked 100,000 subscriptions and so is 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.640
 Mainly I will give you the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.410
 Whole videos show where possibly what 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.539
 missed and where you might still be 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.489
 look at it, we should begin with the 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.250
 first video and although my predecessor the 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.989
 frank sirius he has friday the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.879
 made daily news and has in the daily 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.710
 news including a meet 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.270
 and greet talked to him and that 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.100
 really horny thing quit win looks 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.229
 Definitely in and indeed 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.850
 can you there from ea sports father 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.320
 You get paid hotel 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.790
 you pay or you can stop that 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.200
 Frank and then moved with him 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.689
 Together I think like warrior or 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.250
 because the pears are also there and there 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.960
 a really cool time I think 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.430
 So who has bock to do with it 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.400
 watch the video pretty much 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.720
 In the end, talk about it and I say 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.890
 then that's just me for a bit 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.689
 film and somehow something like that 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.830
 Look at it when you see 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.479
 want to be there just look 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.299
 over so the second video is on 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.829
 palawan part 2 for me single 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.150
 most important videos of the week definitely 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.130
 what the commander warrior or 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.170
 I uploaded myself if you 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.680
 as a padawan somewhere like that too 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.540
 affected 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.820
 because and that has warriors in the video 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.380
 also i said in the plane to me 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.460
 First, the eight from the first time 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.320

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.070
 beastly about it all through to 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.509
 Just look and it can not be enough 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.610
 so they will be theirs again 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.200
 call with a second round 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.829
 from the partner I enjoyed it 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.590
 helped 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.030
 I got the betrayal pumped full 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.890
 with subscribers i find really cool 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.390
 and I'm very warrior too 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.129
 thankful for the first round and me 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.840
 press each one of his application video 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.649
 send second round quite violently the 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.360
 thumb 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.860
 Watch and I'm so for me 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.510
 pick my favorites and thus 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.670
 pierce the warrior who we are there 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.950
 want to send eight people to the start 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.540
 namely the next video was 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.760
 Now for me, here we come 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.430
 to indeed have the solution and the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.209
 tesco begged again and look there 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.209
 we just go in now 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.510
 yes the two play black ops 2 on 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.590
 the xbox whoever wins this can do that 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.879
 then you rather in the video 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.650
 of course, is also in the 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.000
 description linked I find it easy 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.680
 always cool when the two themselves 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.060
 battle because tesco and solution you have to 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.900
 say are because it's really very, very 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.639
 good player 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.170
 But I think even if they are together 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:51.420
 what do and only their battles 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.500
 it is just super funny 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.690
 to look at her like she was there 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.189
 a little bit stand still like that 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.450
 what i could aim for all day 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:59.459
 I think a very cool video 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:04.409
 definitive tip from me to go in there too 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:06.720
 So look for the next tip for today 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.639
 is a video of the genius and strict 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.920
 not taken by the jury but the 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:13.260
 commander warrior captain cork james and 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.109
 the potato also with 3 es 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.069
 is a league of legends dwarf round 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:21.989
 extremely cool idea I found extremely 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.400
 To look at it is also a lot of fun 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.690
 made laughter I look in 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.980
 Lately, very much 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.329
 I would like to visit this place too 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.769
 genie a congratulations too 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.049
 5000 subscribers say it out 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.609
 really cool video for the new fans 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:34.590
 definitely a hint under you 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:40.229
 but it's really really real 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:44.040
 cool thinking in the next 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:45.989
 Tip from me that started pokémon 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.889
 to play and indeed the black edition 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:51.120
 Part 2 I think it's a really cool idea 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:52.470
 Pokemon let's play to start many quite 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.109
 I like to be myself a giant 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.389
 fan of pokemon the new edition and 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.560
 I fish all those new dirt 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.659
 Do you believe it by now? 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.010
 millionth pokemon have arrived 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:03.209
 Not my thing but I think so 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.859
 Generally , as I said, a cool one 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.510
 thing of the pokémon display to start 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.940
 the danny as he called in the game 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:11.129
 has begged against nico 's choice 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.349
 called and his start pokémon is a 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.430
 I have never heard anything from car 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:15.930
 but somehow it looks like a piece of me 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.280
 In any case, you can also 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.419
 take a look then my tip of 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.769
 I now have another one 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.340
 to look at new let's play 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.260
 and then we have so little 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.530
 the video for you and that has the 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.960
 mother on her velux window velux 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.400
 The velux neviges are not called little 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.110
 the choice is clearly so ugly 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.850
 laughs on her windows window one 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.889
 dove discovered and this dove has so 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.540
 an extremely dramatic look and has 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.130
 she so a little mini video of 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:41.330
 that was not cool because of that 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.760
 I'll hang this on you again 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.470
 in the back and now here in here 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.520
 again in the background very straight 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.919
 and of course in the description 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.110
 You can also check it out that way 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.210
 not synonymous in my network 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.370
 News has been in my opinion 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:57.440
 pretty much the most interesting videos of the 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.330
 week and of course I find her 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.380
 very interesting if you then me 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.760
 Of course a bit supported 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.960
 if you now of a game time 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.090
 partner somehow really cool video 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.889
 seen where he has as a partner there 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.540
 I'm really everything under it 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.370
 melted away as she was a good one 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.110
 Customer really like to write I watch 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.389
 Of course I have a lot to watch 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.039
 but I can not do it all 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:17.690
 if you have seen something write 

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:19.070
 me the message so that I would 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:20.389
 I hope you liked it 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.370
 hopefully the videos are me 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.110
 I also chose which ones you too 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.699
 Well, then that's one or 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.830
 others that you did not know yet 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:29.660
 maybe one or the other 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.950
 you did not know I can do you any 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.940
 mouse network recommended and we 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.770
 Will be there a few times next week 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.419
 then look who have what the people 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.070
 learn so much what's going on there and 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.930
 say a place I'm out or
