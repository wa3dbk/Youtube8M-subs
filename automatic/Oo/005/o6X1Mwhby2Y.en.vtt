00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.400 
okay as you can see it's at ninety-eight
percent<00:03:26.669> it's<00:03:27.480> just<00:03:27.690> about<00:03:27.900> done<00:03:28.139> so<00:03:28.290> we're

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
percent it's just about done so we're

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.830 
percent it's just about done so we're
just<00:03:28.440> going<00:03:28.650> to<00:03:28.680> wait<00:03:28.859> for<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.040> to<00:03:29.129> finish<00:03:29.840> sit

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
just going to wait for it to finish sit

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:58.510 
just going to wait for it to finish sit
99

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.560 

and<00:03:59.210> it's<00:03:59.720> done<00:03:59.930> now<00:04:00.290> you'll<00:04:00.890> see<00:04:01.390> there's<00:04:02.390> two

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
and it's done now you'll see there's two

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.420 
and it's done now you'll see there's two
logos<00:04:02.720> there<00:04:03.080> once<00:04:03.350> top<00:04:03.710> of<00:04:03.860> the<00:04:03.950> disk<00:04:04.190> that's

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
logos there once top of the disk that's

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.800 
logos there once top of the disk that's
in<00:04:04.550> the<00:04:04.640> machine<00:04:04.940> the<00:04:05.090> bottom<00:04:05.360> one<00:04:05.510> that<00:04:05.690> is

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:05.810 
in the machine the bottom one that is

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
in the machine the bottom one that is
the<00:04:05.900> one<00:04:06.020> that's<00:04:06.140> actually<00:04:06.440> been<00:04:06.560> backed<00:04:06.740> up

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
the one that's actually been backed up

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:07.930 
the one that's actually been backed up
under<00:04:07.040> the<00:04:07.130> hard<00:04:07.310> drive<00:04:07.490> so<00:04:07.610> what<00:04:07.730> we're<00:04:07.850> going

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
under the hard drive so what we're going

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.010 
under the hard drive so what we're going
to<00:04:08.030> do<00:04:08.120> now<00:04:08.270> just<00:04:08.510> to<00:04:08.600> prove<00:04:08.720> that<00:04:08.780> it's

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020 
to do now just to prove that it's

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.090 
to do now just to prove that it's
loading<00:04:09.260> off<00:04:09.350> the<00:04:09.470> hard<00:04:09.650> drive<00:04:09.830> we're<00:04:09.980> going

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
loading off the hard drive we're going

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.930 
loading off the hard drive we're going
to<00:04:10.190> take<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:11.200> original<00:04:12.200> way<00:04:12.260> up<00:04:12.730> and<00:04:13.730> put<00:04:13.910> a

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:13.940 
to take the original way up and put a

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:23.200 
to take the original way up and put a
different<00:04:14.210> one<00:04:14.300> in

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.029 

and<00:04:24.210> you'll<00:04:24.780> see<00:04:24.990> it<00:04:25.080> come<00:04:25.650> up<00:04:25.740> on<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:25.949> screen

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
and you'll see it come up on the screen

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:31.850 
and you'll see it come up on the screen
in<00:04:26.280> just<00:04:26.340> a<00:04:26.520> second<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:30.990> what<00:04:31.560> we're<00:04:31.680> going<00:04:31.770> to

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
in just a second and what we're going to

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.379 
in just a second and what we're going to
do<00:04:31.949> now<00:04:32.129> is<00:04:33.439> load<00:04:34.439> up<00:04:34.879> the<00:04:35.879> one<00:04:36.029> on<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.210> hard

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
do now is load up the one on the hard

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.339 
do now is load up the one on the hard
drive<00:04:36.710> will<00:04:37.710> do<00:04:37.919> it'll<00:04:38.099> drop<00:04:38.249> you<00:04:38.520> back<00:04:38.759> to<00:04:38.969> the

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:39.349 
drive will do it'll drop you back to the

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:45.100

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
and if the camera was focused you can

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.650 
and if the camera was focused you can
see<00:05:04.890> that<00:05:05.040> it<00:05:05.130> is<00:05:05.160> loaded<00:05:05.370> so<00:05:06.180> that's<00:05:06.480> our

the product epic is going to have a lot
of<00:05:12.870> development<00:05:13.410> done<00:05:13.560> for<00:05:13.800> it<00:05:13.890> there's<00:05:14.100> going

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
of development done for it there's going

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.400 
of development done for it there's going
to<00:05:14.430> be<00:05:14.460> you<00:05:15.270> know<00:05:15.360> a<00:05:15.390> host<00:05:15.630> of<00:05:15.780> homebrew<00:05:16.200> and
