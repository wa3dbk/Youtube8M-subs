be<00:01:29.390> here's<00:01:29.659> the<00:01:29.780> surge<00:01:30.020> I<00:01:30.350> I<00:01:30.619> do<00:01:31.280> now<00:01:31.610> just<00:01:31.850> a

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
be here's the surge I I do now just a

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.880 
be here's the surge I I do now just a
bit<00:01:32.090> of<00:01:32.180> a<00:01:32.240> test<00:01:32.539> and<00:01:32.840> then<00:01:33.200> I<00:01:33.229> I<00:01:33.560> sort<00:01:33.860> of

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
bit of a test and then I I sort of

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.950 
bit of a test and then I I sort of
pulled<00:01:34.070> to<00:01:34.189> the<00:01:34.310> right<00:01:34.340> over<00:01:34.880> the<00:01:35.420> road<00:01:35.600> hoping

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
pulled to the right over the road hoping

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.810 
pulled to the right over the road hoping
that<00:01:36.229> he'd<00:01:36.350> counter<00:01:36.679> that<00:01:36.799> surge<00:01:37.070> thinking

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
that he'd counter that surge thinking

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.219 
that he'd counter that surge thinking
this<00:01:37.909> was<00:01:38.090> a<00:01:38.119> move<00:01:38.390> I<00:01:38.539> was<00:01:38.630> going<00:01:38.780> to<00:01:38.840> make<00:01:39.020> on

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
this was a move I was going to make on

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.100 
this was a move I was going to make on
that<00:01:39.259> for<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:40.250> run<00:01:40.399> for<00:01:40.580> home<00:01:40.810> when<00:01:41.810> it<00:01:41.929> wasn't

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
that for the run for home when it wasn't

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.990 
that for the run for home when it wasn't
I<00:01:42.320> was<00:01:42.439> supposed<00:01:42.679> to<00:01:42.770> totally<00:01:43.220> prepared<00:01:43.909> the

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
I was supposed to totally prepared the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.429 
I was supposed to totally prepared the
weight<00:01:44.149> for<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.360> downhill<00:01:44.600> that<00:01:44.899> was<00:01:45.080> that

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
weight for the downhill that was that

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.740 
weight for the downhill that was that
was<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.830> plan<00:01:46.189> to<00:01:46.429> try<00:01:46.789> and<00:01:46.970> run<00:01:47.539> away<00:01:47.630> from

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
was the plan to try and run away from

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.449 
was the plan to try and run away from
him<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:48.229> I<00:01:48.289> pulled<00:01:48.560> it<00:01:48.679> to<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:49.159> right<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:49.340> little

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:49.459 
him so I pulled it to the right a little

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.880 
him so I pulled it to the right a little
bit<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:49.789> he<00:01:49.940> counters<00:01:50.500> counters<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.649> surge

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
bit and he counters counters the surge

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.529 
bit and he counters counters the surge
engaged<00:01:52.399> past<00:01:52.670> me<00:01:52.850> which<00:01:52.940> is<00:01:53.030> exactly<00:01:53.390> where<00:01:53.509> I

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
engaged past me which is exactly where I

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.389 
engaged past me which is exactly where I
want<00:01:53.750> him<00:01:53.869> to<00:01:53.959> be<00:01:54.140> traditionally<00:01:55.130> at<00:01:55.220> this

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
want him to be traditionally at this

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:56.710 
want him to be traditionally at this
distance<00:01:55.789> we<00:01:55.970> haven't<00:01:56.209> seen<00:01:56.450> too<00:01:56.690> many

were with your experience ready to just
hammer<00:02:07.310> on<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.610> downhill<00:02:08.019> yeah<00:02:09.019> that's<00:02:09.440> uh

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
hammer on the downhill yeah that's uh

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.770 
hammer on the downhill yeah that's uh
you<00:02:10.009> know<00:02:10.130> that<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.910> key<00:02:11.090> of<00:02:11.120> Daniel<00:02:11.510> running

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
you know that the key of Daniel running

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.180 
you know that the key of Daniel running
is<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:11.900> get<00:02:12.140> that<00:02:12.290> surprised<00:02:12.709> because<00:02:12.739> once

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
is to get that surprised because once

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.740 
is to get that surprised because once
you're<00:02:13.370> in<00:02:13.430> full<00:02:13.700> flight<00:02:14.060> it's<00:02:14.360> very<00:02:14.569> very

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
you're in full flight it's very very

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.360 
you're in full flight it's very very
difficult<00:02:14.959> to<00:02:15.260> get<00:02:15.349> the<00:02:15.440> legs<00:02:15.650> turning<00:02:16.069> so<00:02:16.340> I

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
difficult to get the legs turning so I

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.640 
difficult to get the legs turning so I
knew<00:02:16.819> if<00:02:16.940> I<00:02:17.060> was<00:02:17.180> behind<00:02:17.450> him<00:02:17.660> I<00:02:17.870> could<00:02:18.470> see

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
knew if I was behind him I could see

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.500 
knew if I was behind him I could see
what<00:02:18.769> he's<00:02:18.890> doing<00:02:19.040> at<00:02:19.220> all<00:02:19.310> times<00:02:19.370> and<00:02:19.910> if<00:02:20.420> I

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
what he's doing at all times and if I

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.699 
what he's doing at all times and if I
wanted<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.810> make<00:02:20.959> a<00:02:20.989> move<00:02:21.260> I'd<00:02:21.410> get<00:02:21.590> that

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
wanted to make a move I'd get that

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.640 
wanted to make a move I'd get that
element<00:02:22.070> of<00:02:22.130> surprise<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:23.260> we'll<00:02:24.260> cresting

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
element of surprise so we'll cresting

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.170 
element of surprise so we'll cresting
the<00:02:24.680> hill<00:02:24.890> I<00:02:24.920> thought<00:02:25.250> this<00:02:25.370> is<00:02:25.519> perfect<00:02:25.700> he's

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
home from here but I I didn't know how

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.530 
home from here but I I didn't know how
much<00:03:33.220> he<00:03:33.340> knew<00:03:33.490> about<00:03:33.580> this<00:03:33.790> downhill<00:03:34.060> finish

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
much he knew about this downhill finish

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.600 
much he knew about this downhill finish
and<00:03:34.810> I<00:03:35.140> kept<00:03:35.590> telling<00:03:35.860> myself<00:03:35.980> he'd<00:03:36.370> have<00:03:36.490> to

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
and I kept telling myself he'd have to

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.070 
and I kept telling myself he'd have to
be<00:03:36.700> worried<00:03:36.940> about<00:03:37.000> me<00:03:37.330> if<00:03:37.480> I<00:03:37.660> was<00:03:37.810> in<00:03:37.930> his

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
be worried about me if I was in his

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.700 
be worried about me if I was in his
shoes

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:38.710 
shoes

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.590 
shoes
I'm<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:39.460> guy<00:03:39.610> who's<00:03:39.880> running<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.270> quickest

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
I'm the guy who's running the quickest

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.210 
I'm the guy who's running the quickest
times<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.200> then<00:03:41.410> he's<00:03:41.620> worrying<00:03:41.860> about<00:03:41.980> me

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
times and then he's worrying about me

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.920 
times and then he's worrying about me
and<00:03:42.340> this<00:03:42.459> is<00:03:42.640> the<00:03:42.850> approach<00:03:43.540> in<00:03:43.660> the<00:03:43.750> downhill

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
and this is the approach in the downhill

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.320 
and this is the approach in the downhill
now<00:03:44.230> this<00:03:44.980> is<00:03:45.130> where<00:03:45.310> we<00:03:45.430> really<00:03:45.700> see<00:03:45.940> Marco

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
now this is where we really see Marco

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.500 
now this is where we really see Marco
pull<00:03:46.600> away<00:03:46.780> from<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:48.400> Spaniard<00:03:48.940> tell<00:03:49.390> us

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
pull away from the Spaniard tell us

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.730 
pull away from the Spaniard tell us
about<00:03:49.720> what's<00:03:49.870> going<00:03:50.140> on<00:03:50.260> here<00:03:50.560> your

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
about what's going on here your

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.470 
about what's going on here your
commitment<00:03:51.190> on<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.370> downhill<00:03:51.790> well<00:03:52.300> it's<00:03:52.390> a

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
commitment on the downhill well it's a

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.910 
commitment on the downhill well it's a
mall<00:03:52.660> from<00:03:52.870> the<00:03:52.990> top<00:03:53.200> to<00:03:53.350> the<00:03:53.440> bottom<00:03:53.470> and<00:03:53.830> I

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
mall from the top to the bottom and I

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.910 
mall from the top to the bottom and I
was<00:03:54.580> like<00:03:54.730> it's<00:03:54.880> a<00:03:54.940> long<00:03:55.120> way<00:03:55.330> enough<00:03:55.660> I

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
was like it's a long way enough I

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
was like it's a long way enough I
thought<00:03:56.920> to<00:03:56.980> myself<00:03:57.100> once<00:03:57.400> I<00:03:57.520> make<00:03:57.670> my<00:03:57.700> move

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
thought to myself once I make my move

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.449 
thought to myself once I make my move
that's<00:03:58.209> my<00:03:58.450> move<00:03:58.630> if<00:03:58.840> he<00:03:58.900> comes<00:03:59.200> back<00:03:59.500> at<00:04:00.280> me

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
that's my move if he comes back at me

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.940 
that's my move if he comes back at me
then<00:04:00.670> then<00:04:01.360> he's<00:04:01.810> gonna<00:04:01.930> get<00:04:02.140> me<00:04:02.320> this<00:04:02.500> is<00:04:02.739> once

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
then then he's gonna get me this is once

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.160 
then then he's gonna get me this is once
you<00:04:03.070> make<00:04:03.250> a<00:04:03.280> move<00:04:03.520> be<00:04:03.700> committed<00:04:04.120> and<00:04:04.780> I<00:04:04.989> said

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
you make a move be committed and I said

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.479 
you make a move be committed and I said
forget<00:04:05.380> your<00:04:05.620> toes<00:04:05.800> forget<00:04:06.190> your<00:04:06.310> knees

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
forget your toes forget your knees

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.699

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
forget ya hips this is what you're

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.170

thinking<00:04:09.070> right<00:04:09.250> here<00:04:09.280> right<00:04:09.700> here<00:04:09.910> this<00:04:10.120> is

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
thinking right here right here this is

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.150 
thinking right here right here this is
for<00:04:10.330> the<00:04:10.570> wind<00:04:10.780> just<00:04:10.989> let<00:04:11.470> the<00:04:11.560> legs<00:04:11.739> go<00:04:11.860> as

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
for the wind just let the legs go as

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.770 
for the wind just let the legs go as
much<00:04:12.310> as<00:04:12.489> you<00:04:12.580> can<00:04:12.760> and<00:04:12.970> once<00:04:13.090> you<00:04:13.239> go<00:04:13.390> just<00:04:13.660> go

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
much as you can and once you go just go

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.830 
much as you can and once you go just go
and<00:04:14.320> I<00:04:15.010> made<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:15.820> move<00:04:16.000> past<00:04:16.269> him<00:04:16.480> I<00:04:16.570> was<00:04:16.690> like

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
and I made the move past him I was like

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.630 
and I made the move past him I was like
okay<00:04:17.140> so<00:04:17.350> I'm<00:04:17.709> out<00:04:17.799> of<00:04:17.829> the<00:04:17.950> quantum<00:04:18.220> I<00:04:18.280> start

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
okay so I'm out of the quantum I start

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.039 
okay so I'm out of the quantum I start
to<00:04:18.700> drop<00:04:18.910> off<00:04:19.090> and<00:04:19.239> I<00:04:19.269> weigh<00:04:19.359> this<00:04:19.510> is<00:04:19.690> it
