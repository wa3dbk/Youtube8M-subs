lot<00:02:48.830> of<00:02:49.040> experience<00:02:49.580> got<00:02:49.880> myself<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.269> few

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
lot of experience got myself a few

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.070 
lot of experience got myself a few
construction<00:02:52.910> levels<00:02:53.209> as<00:02:53.390> well<00:02:53.420> as<00:02:53.810> one

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
construction levels as well as one

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.400 
construction levels as well as one
pretty<00:02:54.320> little<00:02:54.650> and<00:02:54.970> back<00:02:55.970> to<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.239> spiders<00:02:56.690> so

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
pretty little and back to the spiders so

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.150 
pretty little and back to the spiders so
right<00:02:57.800> now<00:02:57.830> I'm<00:02:58.220> 60<00:02:58.670> effect<00:02:58.940> and<00:02:59.530> I'm<00:03:00.530> also<00:03:00.650> 60

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
right now I'm 60 effect and I'm also 60

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
right now I'm 60 effect and I'm also 60
strain<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:02.500> let's<00:03:03.500> go<00:03:03.650> with<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:04.180> defense

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
strain so let's go with the defense

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:18.220 
strain so let's go with the defense
lowly<00:03:08.019> 58<00:03:09.130> and<00:03:11.739> that<00:03:12.739> should<00:03:12.920> be<00:03:13.010> 59<00:03:14.170> and<00:03:15.910> 60<00:03:17.230> so

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
lowly 58 and that should be 59 and 60 so

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.470 
lowly 58 and that should be 59 and 60 so
I<00:03:18.260> decided<00:03:18.950> to<00:03:19.070> get<00:03:19.220> them<00:03:19.430> self<00:03:19.610> Michael

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
I decided to get them self Michael

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.449 
I decided to get them self Michael
search<00:03:20.690> levels<00:03:21.079> because<00:03:21.620> it's<00:03:22.100> kind<00:03:22.340> of

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
search levels because it's kind of

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.640 
search levels because it's kind of
annoying<00:03:22.640> did<00:03:22.910> not<00:03:23.060> have<00:03:23.299> amount<00:03:23.989> of<00:03:24.140> glory<00:03:24.470> in

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
annoying did not have amount of glory in

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.370 
annoying did not have amount of glory in
my<00:03:24.829> house<00:03:25.070> because<00:03:25.630> it<00:03:26.630> requires<00:03:27.019> me<00:03:27.230> to<00:03:27.260> have

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
my house because it requires me to have

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.180 
my house because it requires me to have
multiple<00:03:27.829> glories<00:03:28.400> in<00:03:28.549> my<00:03:28.850> bank<00:03:29.030> which<00:03:29.390> is

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
multiple glories in my bank which is

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.860 
multiple glories in my bank which is
unnecessary<00:03:31.390> unnecessary<00:03:32.390> money<00:03:32.570> and

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
unnecessary unnecessary money and

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.090 
unnecessary unnecessary money and
construction<00:03:35.870> done<00:03:36.110> really<00:03:36.410> cost<00:03:36.650> that<00:03:36.920> much

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
construction done really cost that much

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.319 
construction done really cost that much
anyways<00:03:37.610> I<00:03:37.850> think<00:03:38.180> I've<00:03:38.299> used<00:03:38.540> about<00:03:39.820> 1<00:03:40.820> mil<00:03:41.030> to

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
anyways I think I've used about 1 mil to

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:47.699 
anyways I think I've used about 1 mil to
get<00:03:41.540> myself<00:03:42.049> from<00:03:43.810> 31<00:03:44.810> to<00:03:45.459> 48<00:03:46.459> construction

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
get myself from 31 to 48 construction

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.160 
get myself from 31 to 48 construction
totally<00:03:48.709> worth<00:03:48.890> it

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:00.050 

and<00:03:53.530> that<00:03:54.250> was<00:03:54.430> for<00:03:54.819> six<00:03:55.180> construction<00:03:57.060> 47<00:03:58.830> and

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
and that was for six construction 47 and

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.010 
and that was for six construction 47 and
48<00:04:01.590> so<00:04:02.849> let's<00:04:03.849> move<00:04:04.030> on<00:04:04.270> to<00:04:04.300> building<00:04:04.989> the
