00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
engineering of this vehicle let's start

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.080 
engineering of this vehicle let's start
off<00:01:01.829> talking<00:01:02.039> about<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.609> brake<00:01:02.850> energy

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
off talking about the brake energy

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.899 
off talking about the brake energy
regeneration<00:01:03.920> now<00:01:04.920> in<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.129> normal<00:01:05.339> car<00:01:05.670> and

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
regeneration now in a normal car and

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.550 
regeneration now in a normal car and
alternative<00:01:06.360> runs<00:01:06.570> continuously<00:01:06.900> and

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
alternative runs continuously and

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
continuously recharges the battery BMW

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.080 
continuously recharges the battery BMW
of<00:01:10.530> developed<00:01:10.950> technology<00:01:11.549> where<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
of developed technology where the

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.000 
of developed technology where the
alternator<00:01:12.510> only<00:01:12.960> runs<00:01:13.229> in<00:01:13.530> this<00:01:13.710> vehicle

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
alternator only runs in this vehicle

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.789 
alternator only runs in this vehicle
when<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:14.760> decelerating<00:01:15.299> which<00:01:16.259> means<00:01:16.590> that

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
when it's decelerating which means that

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.340 
when it's decelerating which means that
it<00:01:16.979> conserves<00:01:17.430> all<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:18.030> extra<00:01:18.540> energy<00:01:18.750> and

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
it conserves all that extra energy and

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.010 
it conserves all that extra energy and
doesn't<00:01:19.950> waste<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.549> when<00:01:20.790> it's<00:01:20.939> not<00:01:21.150> needed<00:01:21.210> if

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
doesn't waste it when it's not needed if

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.990 
doesn't waste it when it's not needed if
you<00:01:22.200> sit<00:01:22.409> this<00:01:22.530> new<00:01:22.710> 7-series<00:01:23.189> side-by-side

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
with cars of the past from BMW it looks

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:27.950 
with cars of the past from BMW it looks
completely<00:01:27.030> different<00:01:27.270> but<00:01:27.509> yet<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.780> can
