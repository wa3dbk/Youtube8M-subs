00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
frame rates yegas is not as much

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.850 
frame rates yegas is not as much
texturing<00:02:36.770> it's<00:02:36.920> not<00:02:37.130> but<00:02:38.470> so<00:02:39.470> again<00:02:39.710> guys

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
texturing it's not but so again guys

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.410 
texturing it's not but so again guys
2560<00:02:40.670> by<00:02:40.790> 1600<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:43.160> again<00:02:43.490> this<00:02:43.670> is<00:02:43.880> on<00:02:44.090> to

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
2560 by 1600 and again this is on to

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.160 
2560 by 1600 and again this is on to
stock<00:02:46.060> signature<00:02:47.060> two<00:02:47.210> cards<00:02:47.600> is<00:02:47.720> not<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:48.080> I

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
stock signature two cards is not that I

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.910 
stock signature two cards is not that I
oughta<00:02:48.350> locked<00:02:48.620> at<00:02:48.770> all<00:02:50.590> it's<00:02:51.590> just<00:02:51.650> making

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
going to custom my GPU lost out let me

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.170 
going to custom my GPU lost out let me
know<00:03:27.650> guys<00:03:28.040> how<00:03:28.280> you<00:03:28.340> like<00:03:28.550> the<00:03:28.670> game<00:03:28.820> how<00:03:29.060> it

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
know guys how you like the game how it

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.420 
know guys how you like the game how it
looks<00:03:29.390> what<00:03:29.840> you<00:03:29.960> guys<00:03:30.110> think<00:03:30.290> of<00:03:30.440> it<00:03:30.560> if<00:03:31.310> you

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
looks what you guys think of it if you

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.030 
looks what you guys think of it if you
picked<00:03:31.640> it<00:03:31.730> up<00:03:31.820> yet<00:03:32.090> always<00:03:32.660> interested<00:03:33.140> as<00:03:33.860> I

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
picked it up yet always interested as I

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.230 
picked it up yet always interested as I
still<00:03:34.250> here<00:03:34.430> see<00:03:34.640> the<00:03:34.730> frame<00:03:34.910> rate<00:03:35.090> we're

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.240 
still here see the frame rate we're

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:36.220 
still here see the frame rate we're
getting<00:03:35.390> hitches<00:03:35.720> here<00:03:35.900> I<00:03:35.930> don't<00:03:36.080> know<00:03:36.140> if

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:36.230 
getting hitches here I don't know if

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.210 
getting hitches here I don't know if
it's<00:03:36.320> just<00:03:36.410> gonna<00:03:36.560> I<00:03:37.180> mean<00:03:38.290> I'm<00:03:39.290> noticing<00:03:39.950> a

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
it's just gonna I mean I'm noticing a

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.300 
it's just gonna I mean I'm noticing a
lot<00:03:40.370> of<00:03:40.550> hitching<00:03:40.940> look<00:03:41.840> at<00:03:41.930> its<00:03:42.050> run<00:03:42.170> 2<00:03:42.260> 20's<00:03:45.310> I

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
lot of hitching look at its run 2 20's I

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.700 
lot of hitching look at its run 2 20's I
think<00:03:47.060> it's<00:03:47.210> more<00:03:47.500> initiative<00:03:48.500> with<00:03:48.590> the

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:48.710 
think it's more initiative with the

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.910 
think it's more initiative with the
drivers<00:03:49.160> I<00:03:49.340> think<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:49.700> game<00:03:49.850> is<00:03:49.880> it<00:03:50.740> they<00:03:51.740> may

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
drivers I think the game is it they may

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.140 
drivers I think the game is it they may
have<00:03:51.950> created<00:03:52.400> new<00:03:52.520> drivers<00:03:52.910> but<00:03:53.000> it's

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
have created new drivers but it's

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.730 
have created new drivers but it's
hitching<00:03:53.540> I'm<00:03:53.720> getting<00:03:54.020> definitely<00:03:54.230> I<00:03:54.680> mean

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:54.740 
hitching I'm getting definitely I mean

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.160 
hitching I'm getting definitely I mean
look<00:03:54.980> at<00:03:55.010> us<00:03:55.100> or<00:03:55.220> into<00:03:55.370> 20s<00:03:55.760> and<00:03:56.080> all<00:03:57.080> of<00:03:57.140> a

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
look at us or into 20s and all of a

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.750 
look at us or into 20s and all of a
sudden<00:03:57.470> it<00:03:57.650> gets<00:03:57.770> smooth<00:03:58.130> again<00:03:58.370> look<00:03:58.610> we're

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
sudden it gets smooth again look we're

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.930 
sudden it gets smooth again look we're
in<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:58.910> 60s<00:03:59.330> so<00:04:00.230> I<00:04:00.500> will<00:04:01.340> definitely<00:04:01.550> say<00:04:01.910> that

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
in the 60s so I will definitely say that

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.700 
in the 60s so I will definitely say that
they<00:04:02.210> have<00:04:02.360> to<00:04:02.510> optimize<00:04:02.780> this<00:04:03.110> game<00:04:03.350> want

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
they have to optimize this game want

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.340 
they have to optimize this game want
properly<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:04.460> the<00:04:04.520> drive<00:04:04.760> is<00:04:04.790> they

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
properly and the drive is they

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.480 
properly and the drive is they
compensate<00:04:06.350> it<00:04:06.470> look<00:04:06.620> at<00:04:06.710> the<00:04:06.830> particle

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
compensate it look at the particle

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.880 
compensate it look at the particle
effects<00:04:07.790> really<00:04:08.150> cool<00:04:08.360> really<00:04:08.770> come<00:04:09.770> a<00:04:09.800> long

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
effects really cool really come a long

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.760 
effects really cool really come a long
way<00:04:10.190> compared<00:04:10.640> to<00:04:10.700> like<00:04:10.820> metro<00:04:11.210> and<00:04:11.420> stuff<00:04:11.770> but

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
way compared to like metro and stuff but

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.680 
way compared to like metro and stuff but
very<00:04:12.830> strange<00:04:13.340> it'll<00:04:13.850> run<00:04:14.030> really<00:04:14.450> smooth

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
very strange it'll run really smooth

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.060 
very strange it'll run really smooth
like<00:04:14.990> right<00:04:15.200> now<00:04:15.380> and<00:04:15.650> then<00:04:15.800> all<00:04:15.920> of<00:04:15.950> a<00:04:16.040> sudden

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
like right now and then all of a sudden

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.550 
like right now and then all of a sudden
you'll<00:04:16.610> just<00:04:16.880> get<00:04:17.060> that<00:04:17.299> I<00:04:17.570> didn't<00:04:18.410> see<00:04:18.500> this

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
you'll just get that I didn't see this

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.020 
you'll just get that I didn't see this
guy<00:04:21.130> they<00:04:22.130> don't<00:04:22.280> like<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:22.520> diagnose<00:04:22.880> game

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
guy they don't like the diagnose game

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.050 
guy they don't like the diagnose game
either<00:04:24.010> but<00:04:25.010> you<00:04:25.160> see<00:04:25.310> the<00:04:25.400> particle<00:04:25.790> effects

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
either but you see the particle effects

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.580 
either but you see the particle effects
in<00:04:26.210> the<00:04:26.270> physics<00:04:26.660> getting<00:04:26.960> used<00:04:27.200> here<00:04:27.470> and

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
in the physics getting used here and

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.420 
in the physics getting used here and
stuff<00:04:28.090> smooth<00:04:29.090> here<00:04:29.330> very<00:04:29.570> smooth<00:04:30.250> you<00:04:31.250> have

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
stuff smooth here very smooth you have

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:32.680 
stuff smooth here very smooth you have
to<00:04:31.550> find<00:04:31.700> a<00:04:31.790> sweet<00:04:32.000> spot<00:04:32.060> with<00:04:32.420> the<00:04:32.450> game

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
to find a sweet spot with the game

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.710 
to find a sweet spot with the game
obviously<00:04:34.840> we<00:04:35.840> gotta<00:04:36.020> kill<00:04:36.230> you

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
obviously we gotta kill you
