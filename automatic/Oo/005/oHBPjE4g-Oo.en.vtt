00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.149
 said I didn't understand anything 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.059
 I tried to read and asked 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.070
 then I have n't understood a thousand magazines 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.199
 nothing I came here tell me you mark bo 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.899
 but tell what he did to you 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.939
 I was going to normally did it for a 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:10.070
 generate but the note was spinning if 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.439
 they didn't turn around, they were behind me but like 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.720
 a car in crowds yes yes like 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:17.210
 a car in crazy looks will be almost 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.580
 certainly the variator belt o 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.840
 the one that connects the engine to the wheel 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:28.179
 and therefore we must unfortunately replace 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.179
 come on you are always one 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.509
 now let's see the cig that you will be 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:37.340
 ragged destroyed on this not 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.110
 we had doubts also because if not to be 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.729
 here but i would like to know how i do 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.890
 understand when I have to go change 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.659
 you can't do this blessed belt 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.250
 the belt is silent and does not give 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.879
 warnings you always have to do 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.349
 refer to the manual supplied with 

00:01:49.879 --> 00:01:53.209
 this is why I do not want to shield 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:55.369
 find myself standing in the middle again 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:57.050
 to the road with this engine to pull 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.509
 but I know that this time it's also gone 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.039
 well my mom could go very well 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.509
 but that is funny of the ill-omen that 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.610
 distress you hear what we have to do 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.410
 here we have to go all the coffins 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.660
 screws that stop the cover 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.060
 transmission and to change it 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.790
 weighed the situation gets complicated 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.650
 the like absolutely always the gloves 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:17.650
 come on we intervene 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.660
 to complete the removal of the 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.849
 cover 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.250
 all that remains is to remove the lid from 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:36.790
 plastic that hides a nut to be unscrewed 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:40.580
 with the hour habitat it is the oil auction 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.410
 you want to remove the oil plug but mine 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.790
 day is resolved the same I feel good 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.680
 I make the destiny and you make the head 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.680
 something good to put anguish 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.550
 look at this belt as it is styled 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.230
 destroyed just a tad bit is certain 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.940
 therefore we have risen from here for strong 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.390
 we are the data of the variator anyway 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.520
 noisy thing before we explain the 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.340
 variator and so much that we are inspecting 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.660
 I love the rollers that are rollers instead 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.970
 those that serve to move the 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.830
 variator ok as it is tanned a 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.980
 this eyelash will surely be the 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:28.810
 lance then we see the clutch and not 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.330
 just that I'd do this here 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.980
 lesson ok at that point the strap 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.120
 free we can remove it well 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.120
 let's start on via 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.800
 then we are ready to reassemble 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:54.099
 very ready to go that I do 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:56.800
 I would start with the brand rollers 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:59.379
 we use the ban that I am a home that 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.239
 supplies the houses first 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:04.269
 motorcyclists let's say I'm not a 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:07.209
 genius but I deduce that it is a bit like the 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:09.819
 zero no finally the married people spoke e 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.709
 then the variator must be closed e 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.239
 place it on the tree but it is 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.879
 a delicate operation then there 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.769
 he wants the strap to stop here but that 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.660
 adopt a new thank you god there 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.210
 we choose a friend of box that he too 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.910
 first plant supplier we must 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.220
 position the clutch on the variator 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.120
 however being careful in this case to 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.680
 braids 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.130
 but that's why these yellow darts 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.590
 ok yes yes so we make it go to who it is 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.030
 and then we have to close the variator a 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.810
 that point I can go shopping 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:44.010
 and no and the cover I understood what 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.010
 I do n't buy anything 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.690
 you know what I was thinking marco lux that 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.700
 in the end if I learned to elevate 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.920
 the old belt put the new one 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.110
 close the whole thing as if nothing had happened 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.960
 here I could make the wind not to go by 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:28.080
 my man on his bike and replace the 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:30.270
 belt I know why but the bike does not but comes 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.760
 see margherita this bike here 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:35.640
 are the chains with gears e 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:37.290
 no 5 for replacement and then there 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.540
 they are special kits and in this case 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:43.620
 we have a Bergamo kit with inside 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:46.410
 chains rk gears but it's too much 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.610
 complicated canvas explains yes again 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.950
 another time you just don't do me 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.450
 brother still shopping maybe me 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.450
 an idea comes that scares
