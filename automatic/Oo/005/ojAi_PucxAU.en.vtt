 So to show you how he 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.510
 it works 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.910
 it obviously behind all the quality of the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.910
 pected in terms of safety 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.189
 the adtur ability to him believes that in the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.219
 background because they changed a little 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.410
 there are some things please first here at 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.719
 cutting the pulling cart is extremely 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.510
 comfortable now he has this binge 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.969
 integral are no more like some others 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.940
 paths until she then they changed 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.730
 we have this integral bar the brake 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.640
 it's also practical to just step on it 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.730
 locks the two rear wheels of the car 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.100
 also been created for the C 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.260
 another innovation on this path of peg 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.180
 that base actually leads to 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.969
 aluminum and this stroller is 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.129
 Losing weight weighs 10 pounds is very f for one 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.590
 cart or cart 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.080

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.650
 Peter Leko came with different colors 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.110

 It 's very comfortable for me, it 's very light. 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.500
 It's cool because he's not aggressive in 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.390
 and baby does not get so hot 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.220
