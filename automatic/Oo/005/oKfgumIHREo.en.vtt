00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.219 
has been a regular critic of mine so I

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.780 
thought I would go to his channel and I
never<00:01:55.439> did<00:01:55.619> find<00:01:55.799> out<00:01:55.979> if<00:01:56.159> he<00:01:56.250> has<00:01:56.369> changed<00:01:56.610> his

never did find out if he has changed his
mind<00:01:57.119> or<00:01:57.299> not<00:01:57.450> but<00:01:57.780> right<00:01:58.020> away<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.320> saw<00:01:58.710> he<00:01:58.920> had

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
mind or not but right away I saw he had

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.130 
mind or not but right away I saw he had
a<00:01:59.070> very<00:01:59.430> interesting<00:01:59.820> title<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.750> one<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.049> his

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
a very interesting title on one of his

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.420 
a very interesting title on one of his
videos<00:02:01.369> called<00:02:02.600> magic<00:02:03.600> head<00:02:04.110> wound<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:05.310> of

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
videos called magic head wound and of

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.749 
videos called magic head wound and of
course<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:06.140> immediately<00:02:07.140> thought<00:02:07.649> in<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.610> book

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
course I immediately thought in the book

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.100 
course I immediately thought in the book
of<00:02:08.879> revelation<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.160> Antichrist<00:02:11.160> who

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
of revelation of the Antichrist who

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.860 
of revelation of the Antichrist who
first<00:02:12.350> a<00:02:12.500> head<00:02:12.920> wound<00:02:13.360> so<00:02:14.360> I<00:02:14.390> thought<00:02:14.630> it<00:02:14.780> would

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
first a head wound so I thought it would

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.070 
first a head wound so I thought it would
show<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.530> clip<00:02:16.040> from<00:02:16.310> rose<00:02:16.670> bushes<00:02:17.000> video<00:02:17.840> I

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
show you a clip from rose bushes video I

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.830 
show you a clip from rose bushes video I
