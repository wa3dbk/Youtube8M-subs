00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.420
 the one where we were was a carnet 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:28.700
 combined those intentions of shoulders 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.200
 arms upwards how to go for 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.920
 perform this exercise 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.660
 then let's go and place weights or 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.910
 some nice cat in this case i 'm 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.970
 using the beautiful cat though you can 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.860
 also use dumbbells we hold in 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.370
 slightly more open than Italians 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.110
 our hips we are going to bend the 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.960
 then knees when we have to 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.280
 recover heavy objects from 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.800
 floor 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.530
 we must never recover them by keeping them 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.620
 knees straight and going to tear 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:03.399
 back ok so we go to 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:07.670
 bend our knees grasp 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:09.860
 ours what a nice handlebar that 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.229
 we return to our knees we hold them 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.479
 always slightly bent then when 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.149
 we work we must never hold in 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.350
 full knees extension 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.610
 let's try to take a position 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.280
 comfortable with the back and then in the buttocks 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.979
 let's take the elbows and go to 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:32.179
 rest on our hips so as to 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:35.360
 let's have more strength and get more leverage, let's go 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:38.149
 to bring our little cats the dumbbells 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:42.530
 at the bottom trying to never stretch out 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:46.280
 completely the elbows we carry the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:50.599
 our beautiful handlebar cat towards the ball 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.039
 and then we go to lie down on top 

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:54.440
 our head 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:57.849
 let's go back down to do ours 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.849
 dear jun 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:10.330
 I go down a long carry on the beautiful cat 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:13.970
 shoulder and being above the head 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.150
 the error that connects easily is 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.610
 that of going to arch your back 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.220
 during the distending movement in 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.780
 upper arms above the head then 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.770
 let's never go looking for us 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.770
 backwards 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.670
 if we remain always positioned with 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.830
 knees bent and abdominal beautiful 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.480
 contract and buttocks slightly 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.300
 back a little 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.350
 we will never go to compromise the 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.580
 our back 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:50.450
 if I can't do it or with weights 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:54.500
 nor can I do it with the cast 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:57.430
 with two bottles of water so we'll go 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:02.630
 to do 1 and 2 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:05.450
 go down 1 and 2 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:10.220
 also watch your wrist when we have it 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.350
 an object a handlebar a cash back the 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.440
 wrist should always be kept straight not 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.880
 we must never rotate it outwards 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.880
 hello good workout
