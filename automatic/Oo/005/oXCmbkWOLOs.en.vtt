of the contamination and it's just a

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.160 
of the contamination and it's just a
moment<00:01:02.340> because<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.789> covers<00:01:03.090> up<00:01:03.270> too<00:01:03.750> much<00:01:03.899> of

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
one of the big examples which i can

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.899 
one of the big examples which i can

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
provide it's just the size of them like

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.260 
provide it's just the size of them like
they<00:01:18.390> can't<00:01:18.659> go<00:01:19.110> freely<00:01:19.439> into<00:01:19.680> cooler<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.369> they

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
they can't go freely into cooler so they

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.100 
they can't go freely into cooler so they
just<00:01:21.479> get<00:01:21.630> stuck<00:01:22.159> what<00:01:23.159> can<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.369> do<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:24.210> what<00:01:25.049> I'm
