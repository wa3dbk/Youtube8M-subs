00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:02.889 

we're<00:00:01.319> at<00:00:01.410> the<00:00:01.530> Marquette<00:00:01.890> city<00:00:02.190> number<00:00:02.550> two

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:02.899 
we're at the Marquette city number two

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:07.780 
we're at the Marquette city number two
hydroelectric<00:00:03.899> plant<00:00:04.700> off<00:00:05.700> of<00:00:06.330> Wright<00:00:06.540> Street

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:07.790 
hydroelectric plant off of Wright Street

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.440 
hydroelectric plant off of Wright Street
this<00:00:08.790> plant<00:00:09.090> was<00:00:09.240> built<00:00:09.389> in<00:00:09.570> 1920<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:11.450> think

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
this plant was built in 1920 I think

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
this plant was built in 1920 I think
there's<00:00:12.630> two<00:00:12.809> turbines<00:00:13.290> in<00:00:13.530> there<00:00:15.320> and<00:00:16.320> those

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
there's two turbines in there and those

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.689 
there's two turbines in there and those
are<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.680> penstocks<00:00:18.590> that<00:00:19.590> bring<00:00:19.859> water<00:00:19.890> from

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
are the penstocks that bring water from

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.570 
are the penstocks that bring water from
the<00:00:20.820> dam<00:00:22.730> the<00:00:23.730> dam<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:24.090> upstream<00:00:25.580> maybe

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
the dam the dam is upstream maybe

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.440 
the dam the dam is upstream maybe
twenty-five<00:00:27.119> hundred<00:00:27.449> feet<00:00:27.660> or<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:32.450> by

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
twenty-five hundred feet or so and by

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.490 
twenty-five hundred feet or so and by
placing<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:33.960> distance<00:00:34.440> between<00:00:36.290> the<00:00:37.290> dam

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
placing that distance between the dam

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.920 
placing that distance between the dam
and<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.700> powerhouse<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.210> take<00:00:39.390> advantage<00:00:39.750> of

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
and the powerhouse you take advantage of

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.630 
and the powerhouse you take advantage of
the<00:00:40.050> fall<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.710> river<00:00:43.309> I'll<00:00:44.309> get<00:00:44.430> closer

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
the fall of this river I'll get closer

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.709 
the fall of this river I'll get closer
maybe<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.149> can<00:00:45.300> hear<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.750> turbines<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.710> there

00:00:50.709 --> 00:00:50.719 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.200 

okay<00:00:51.719> we're<00:00:51.870> up<00:00:51.960> by<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.610> penstock

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.150 

that's<00:00:56.720> about<00:00:56.930> a<00:00:56.990> six<00:00:57.350> seven<00:00:57.740> foot<00:00:57.980> diameter

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
that's about a six seven foot diameter

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.550 
that's about a six seven foot diameter
pipe<00:01:01.240> you<00:01:02.240> can<00:01:02.270> hear<00:01:02.810> the<00:01:03.020> water<00:01:03.260> going

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
pipe you can hear the water going

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.780 
pipe you can hear the water going
through<00:01:03.830> it<00:01:03.920> you<00:01:04.040> can<00:01:04.190> feel<00:01:04.460> it<00:01:05.200> shaking<00:01:06.790> you

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
through it you can feel it shaking you

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:18.109 
through it you can feel it shaking you
can<00:01:07.940> hear<00:01:08.120> the<00:01:08.240> turbines<00:01:08.600> in<00:01:08.780> there

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.109 

I'm<00:01:18.510> gonna<00:01:18.659> walk<00:01:18.869> up<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.790> pipeline<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> little

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
I'm gonna walk up the pipeline a little

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.440 
I'm gonna walk up the pipeline a little
bit<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.420> see<00:01:21.510> what<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.720> looks<00:01:21.869> like<00:01:23.420> okay<00:01:24.420> I

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
bit and see what it looks like okay I

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.820 
bit and see what it looks like okay I
just<00:01:24.540> climbed<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:25.080> hill<00:01:25.290> there's<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
just climbed the hill there's the

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.030 
just climbed the hill there's the
powerhouse<00:01:26.220> down<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:27.560> there's<00:01:28.560> an<00:01:28.710> elbow

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
powerhouse down there there's an elbow

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.780 
powerhouse down there there's an elbow
in<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> line<00:01:32.180> there's<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.240> workout<00:01:34.550> and<00:01:35.550> up

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
in the line there's a workout and up

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:45.100 
in the line there's a workout and up
there<00:01:36.649> is<00:01:37.649> a<00:01:37.710> surge<00:01:38.070> tank<00:01:41.119> to<00:01:42.119> handle<00:01:42.450> surges

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:54.340 

in<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.320> system<00:01:50.869> there's<00:01:51.869> two<00:01:52.080> of<00:01:52.229> these

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
in the system there's two of these

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:07.600 
in the system there's two of these
penstocks<00:01:55.350> here

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.570 

I<00:02:09.190> think<00:02:10.190> that<00:02:10.340> tank<00:02:10.640> is<00:02:11.770> roughly<00:02:12.770> 60<00:02:13.400> feet

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
I think that tank is roughly 60 feet

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:21.790 
I think that tank is roughly 60 feet
tall<00:02:19.780> 3040<00:02:20.780> feet<00:02:20.900> in<00:02:21.170> diameter

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
tall 3040 feet in diameter

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:29.680 
tall 3040 feet in diameter
Oh<00:02:28.090> sprung<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.120> leak

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
Oh sprung a leak

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.430 
Oh sprung a leak
oh<00:02:31.450> that's<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.660> wooden<00:02:34.960> okay<00:02:35.960> I've<00:02:36.080> heard<00:02:36.260> that

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
oh that's a wooden okay I've heard that

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.750 
oh that's a wooden okay I've heard that
sections<00:02:36.860> of<00:02:36.980> this<00:02:37.070> were<00:02:37.250> wood<00:02:39.370> this<00:02:40.370> section

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
sections of this were wood this section

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:50.530 
sections of this were wood this section
is<00:02:40.850> wood<00:02:42.130> it's<00:02:43.930> got<00:02:45.910> wooden<00:02:46.910> staves<00:02:49.540> they're

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
is wood it's got wooden staves they're

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.880 
is wood it's got wooden staves they're
all<00:02:50.660> banded<00:02:51.050> together<00:02:52.570> creosote<00:02:53.570> 'add

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.650 

several<00:02:57.890> leaks<00:02:59.950> up<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.160> down<00:03:01.310> there<00:03:01.580> and<00:03:02.510> see

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
several leaks up and down there and see

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.230 
several leaks up and down there and see
if<00:03:02.720> I<00:03:02.780> can<00:03:02.900> get<00:03:02.990> up<00:03:03.080> on<00:03:03.290> top

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:21.960 

oh<00:03:15.000> there's<00:03:16.000> only<00:03:16.150> one<00:03:16.360> penstock<00:03:16.870> left<00:03:20.850> so<00:03:21.850> the

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
oh there's only one penstock left so the

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.670 
oh there's only one penstock left so the
other<00:03:22.120> one<00:03:22.300> on<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.450> right<00:03:22.660> there<00:03:22.900> is<00:03:22.930> no

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
other one on the right there is no

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:34.080 
other one on the right there is no
longer<00:03:23.890> functioning<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:33.580> take<00:03:33.760> a<00:03:33.790> look<00:03:33.970> in

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
longer functioning to take a look in

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:45.630 
longer functioning to take a look in
there<00:03:41.790> yeah<00:03:42.790> I<00:03:42.850> think<00:03:43.060> it's<00:03:44.370> gonna<00:03:45.370> guess

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
there yeah I think it's gonna guess

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.710 
there yeah I think it's gonna guess
maybe<00:03:45.880> 2500<00:03:46.870> feet<00:03:48.090> back<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.240> the<00:03:49.330> river<00:03:49.510> this

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
maybe 2500 feet back to the river this

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.210 
maybe 2500 feet back to the river this
is<00:03:49.840> actually<00:03:50.110> going<00:03:50.290> downhill<00:03:50.500> just<00:03:50.890> a<00:03:51.010> little

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
is actually going downhill just a little

00:03:51.220 --> 00:04:00.990 
is actually going downhill just a little
bit<00:03:56.100> but<00:03:57.100> not<00:03:57.760> too<00:03:57.820> much<00:03:58.950> what<00:03:59.950> that<00:04:00.160> tank<00:04:00.850> is

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
bit but not too much what that tank is

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.500 
bit but not too much what that tank is
meant<00:04:01.210> to<00:04:01.300> do<00:04:01.450> is<00:04:02.430> once<00:04:03.430> in<00:04:03.550> a<00:04:03.610> while<00:04:03.790> you'll

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
meant to do is once in a while you'll

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.180 
meant to do is once in a while you'll
get<00:04:04.630> a<00:04:04.690> surge<00:04:04.930> of<00:04:05.080> pressure<00:04:05.350> in<00:04:05.650> this<00:04:05.860> whole

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
get a surge of pressure in this whole

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.510 
get a surge of pressure in this whole
line<00:04:06.580> and<00:04:06.820> the<00:04:07.830> water<00:04:08.830> will<00:04:09.010> rise<00:04:09.190> in<00:04:09.400> that

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
line and the water will rise in that

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.660 
line and the water will rise in that
tank<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:09.970> it<00:04:10.060> will<00:04:10.180> store<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.690> surge<00:04:11.670> when

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
tank and it will store the surge when

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:16.979 
tank and it will store the surge when
the<00:04:12.790> water<00:04:12.970> goes<00:04:13.270> down<00:04:13.570> in<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:14.830> system<00:04:15.989> you've

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
the water goes down in the system you've

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.180 
the water goes down in the system you've
got<00:04:17.200> some<00:04:17.410> extra<00:04:17.710> head<00:04:17.859> available<00:04:18.960> some<00:04:20.190> extra

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
got some extra head available some extra

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.800 
got some extra head available some extra
