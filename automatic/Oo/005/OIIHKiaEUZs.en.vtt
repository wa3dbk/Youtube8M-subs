 play video no today is the kind of 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.130
 information video for the people who join 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.300
 gt-line cannot be online and you or 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.560
 people kinders who connector with the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.720
 server on star 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.939
 I drop them coming from someone from Mr. 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.010
 fireworks last and you need dns 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.330
 change and watch things because I do 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.039
 I never had problems with my own 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.779
 in that connection and my dns must 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.710
 exactly the same as he said he was 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.940
 had to stand 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.010
 so I'll show you how to do it 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.829
 and how you can change that and 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.000
 if it helps then pros to mr your 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.800
 it lasts until he was the one who 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.640
 now come and I already have several 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.289
 people told you about and what everyone else 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.510
 work well again on star or ja geertje 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.579
 online so hopefully that's it at the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.899
 most of you also work so I'll leave 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.180
 see how it works well here is the 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.250
 playstation this just menu and as one 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.420
 xbox 360 years old in principle from 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.949
 borrowers who work the same 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.469
 of course something else so you go 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.589
 roon you had to your network settings 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.030
 then you go for is well settings and 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.760
 connection status one day you can dns 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.340
 zenith that clicks then you need primer dns 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.220
 and sec to see dns are the primary 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.250
 you must be on 8888 and secondary must 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.740
 8844 if it is and you 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.060
 baby online still does not work then 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.650
 unfortunately I can not help you then 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.610
 I call a rock star or something and watch something 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.799
 it could help you 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.600
 but if you do now is go over 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.790
 especially to give it a try and 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.950
 maybe it helps so I'll leave 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.900
 see how you can change that 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.890
 you go to settings 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.259
 Internet connection 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.850
 if you already click then you can in the 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.790
 change settings no you have to 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.939
 the end up being just you 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.079
 know passwords and number on you 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:49.140
 Internet router kiwi to the colic web 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.909
 pain level to experience than it would 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.920
 in then do the most important thing is you 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.540
 equally adjusted and the reason thereof 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.380
 is that is dns can change us 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.549
 you can not change 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.990
 so choose adjusted 'than you 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.540
 connection method so in my case they 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.340
 have wireless the cable 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.409
 well this time best to know us that 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.270
 week to also take head 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.970
 well then you see internet then you choose 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.500
 internet then yes 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.480
 security this format that we 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.920
 yes rather with us while and then you go 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.030
 enter via code so I say there 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.030
 I will see you again soon enough 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.790
 if you have entered the code then you go 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.880
 just continue and then the IP address 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.320
 Sure automatically even though my head 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.660
 host name kidney cells 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.280
 and that look did sds you have to 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.090
 manually sets as automatic then goes 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.520
 I have to pay that 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.750
 if you manually thank you so that 888 and 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.630
 8844 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.090
 so you should get up now i would say 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.860
 just try to change it and 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.690
 like to try battleships years and ever 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.920
 hopefully this will work for you before they go out 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.800
 row from further 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.760
 not automatically use this is also 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.310
 important 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.190
 now p &amp; p states universal plug and play and 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.750
 So you can better join the online gaming 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.260
 I advise you to leave it enabled 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.900
 and confirm verest 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.890
 give binding testing and then you can 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.300
 just online is me 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.640
 I don't need to see you because 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.800
 I actually always work then 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.510
 level I hope I let you work 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.290
 please in the comments or behind it 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.900
 has worked 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.640
 and yes I was just in the circle to 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.049
 know that it doesn't work alongside the people 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.549
 then they can take that video offline 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.049
 but with whether people have worked so 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.970

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.680
