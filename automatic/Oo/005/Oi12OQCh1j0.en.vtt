it's<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.110> halfway<00:02:23.260> point<00:02:23.500> i<00:02:23.860> guess<00:02:23.890> in<00:02:24.310> the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
it's the halfway point i guess in the

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.490 
it's the halfway point i guess in the
second<00:02:25.540> day<00:02:25.630> here<00:02:25.980> 27.5<00:02:26.980> for<00:02:28.170> now<00:02:29.170> by<00:02:29.320> ever

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.560 
second day here 27.5 for now by ever
that<00:02:29.680> is<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.040> second<00:02:30.520> highest<00:02:30.700> mark<00:02:31.300> we've

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
that is the second highest mark we've

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:32.940 
that is the second highest mark we've
seen<00:02:31.780> I<00:02:31.900> think<00:02:31.930> I'm<00:02:32.200> ready<00:02:32.350> say<00:02:32.620> no<00:02:32.770> it's<00:02:32.860> the
