00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
think of where it's at you still think

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.450 
think of where it's at you still think
of<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:39.440> hits<00:00:39.589> that<00:00:39.769> sort<00:00:39.949> of<00:00:40.010> put<00:00:40.160> him<00:00:40.250> on<00:00:40.370> the

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
of the hits that sort of put him on the

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:48.130 
of the hits that sort of put him on the
map<00:00:40.670> I<00:00:45.850> think<00:00:46.850> this<00:00:47.030> thing<00:00:47.360> we're<00:00:47.600> seeing<00:00:47.839> now

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
map I think this thing we're seeing now

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.479 
map I think this thing we're seeing now
is<00:00:48.470> that<00:00:49.220> Beck<00:00:49.460> is<00:00:49.850> kind<00:00:50.210> of<00:00:50.300> norm<00:00:50.720> core<00:00:51.489> back

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
is that Beck is kind of norm core back

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.939 
is that Beck is kind of norm core back
is<00:00:52.670> kind<00:00:52.940> of<00:00:53.059> normal<00:00:53.629> now<00:00:53.809> he's<00:00:54.230> just<00:00:54.260> chilled

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
is kind of normal now he's just chilled

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:57.510 
is kind of normal now he's just chilled
out<00:00:55.159> and<00:00:55.550> I<00:00:55.820> think<00:00:56.449> that's<00:00:56.629> maybe<00:00:56.840> part<00:00:56.989> of<00:00:57.379> why

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
out and I think that's maybe part of why

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.549 
out and I think that's maybe part of why
he<00:00:58.520> is<00:00:58.670> nominated<00:00:58.820> again<00:00:59.480> now<00:00:59.960> for<00:01:00.260> album<00:01:00.500> of

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:35.890 
I kind of think that that's the guy
who's<00:03:34.790> a<00:03:34.819> better<00:03:35.030> chance<00:03:35.360> of<00:03:35.450> winning<00:03:35.569> Album

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
of the Year at the Grammys I think the

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.770 
of the Year at the Grammys I think the
Ernest<00:03:42.170> Beck<00:03:42.380> that<00:03:42.560> we<00:03:42.709> see<00:03:42.950> on<00:03:43.099> this<00:03:43.220> album

Ernest Beck that we see on this album

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.449 
Ernest Beck that we see on this album
probably<00:03:44.780> stands<00:03:45.140> the<00:03:45.410> best<00:03:45.590> chance<00:03:45.830> of

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
probably stands the best chance of

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.030 
probably stands the best chance of
winning<00:03:47.000> that<00:03:47.480> he's<00:03:47.690> had<00:03:47.959> and<00:03:47.989> over<00:03:48.890> his

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
winning that he's had and over his

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.890 
winning that he's had and over his
career<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.970> Recording<00:03:50.269> Academy<00:03:50.569> likes<00:03:50.750> the

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
career the Recording Academy likes the

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.300 
career the Recording Academy likes the
narrative<00:03:51.290> of<00:03:51.319> an<00:03:51.530> artist<00:03:51.860> that<00:03:51.980> sort<00:03:52.220> of

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
narrative of an artist that sort of

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.309 
narrative of an artist that sort of
grows<00:03:52.549> up<00:03:52.790> and<00:03:53.090> comes<00:03:53.510> into<00:03:53.630> their<00:03:53.870> own<00:03:54.080> and

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
grows up and comes into their own and

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.620 
grows up and comes into their own and
makes<00:03:54.560> more<00:03:54.950> quote/unquote<00:03:55.670> serious<00:03:56.150> music

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
makes more quote/unquote serious music

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.020 
makes more quote/unquote serious music
and<00:03:56.870> I<00:03:57.110> think<00:03:57.410> in<00:03:57.920> a<00:03:58.010> lot<00:03:58.160> of<00:03:58.190> ways<00:03:58.430> this<00:03:58.700> fits

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
and I think in a lot of ways this fits

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.850 
and I think in a lot of ways this fits
the<00:03:59.180> bill<00:03:59.329> for<00:03:59.540> that<00:03:59.569> if<00:04:00.110> he<00:04:00.260> were<00:04:00.349> up<00:04:00.470> against

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
the bill for that if he were up against

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:03.400 
the bill for that if he were up against
you<00:04:00.980> -<00:04:01.190> or<00:04:01.549> the<00:04:02.299> Arcade<00:04:02.569> Fire<00:04:02.750> record<00:04:03.200> from

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
you - or the Arcade Fire record from

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.470 
you - or the Arcade Fire record from
last<00:04:03.500> year<00:04:04.010> I<00:04:04.040> think<00:04:04.549> that<00:04:04.730> Beck<00:04:04.910> would<00:04:05.299> have

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
last year I think that Beck would have

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.000 
last year I think that Beck would have
totally<00:04:05.810> different<00:04:05.930> chances<00:04:06.590> of<00:04:06.709> winning

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
totally different chances of winning

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.550 
totally different chances of winning

really staid people when if he's against

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.170 
really staid people when if he's against
like<00:04:12.140> Steely<00:04:12.650> Dan<00:04:12.829> you<00:04:13.280> know<00:04:13.400> funky<00:04:14.000> Beck

established fan base as opposed to

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.279 
established fan base as opposed to
crossing<00:04:29.450> over<00:04:29.570> like<00:04:29.870> some<00:04:30.020> of<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.169> other

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
crossing over like some of the other

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:31.390 
crossing over like some of the other
artists<00:04:30.620> in<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.740> categories<00:04:31.250> have

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
artists in the categories have

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.060 
artists in the categories have
alternative<00:04:32.180> music<00:04:32.479> is<00:04:32.600> not<00:04:32.780> that<00:04:33.229> old<00:04:33.620> but

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
alternative music is not that old but

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:37.480 
alternative music is not that old but
because<00:04:34.940> it's<00:04:35.750> not<00:04:35.840> yet<00:04:36.200> classic<00:04:36.740> rock<00:04:36.919> we're

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
because it's not yet classic rock we're

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.290 
because it's not yet classic rock we're
seeing<00:04:37.820> what<00:04:38.150> it<00:04:38.240> means<00:04:38.419> to<00:04:38.660> age<00:04:38.930> and<00:04:39.530> I<00:04:40.160> think

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
seeing what it means to age and I think

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.779 
seeing what it means to age and I think
morning<00:04:41.300> phase<00:04:41.539> for<00:04:41.870> Beck<00:04:42.020> is<00:04:42.350> a<00:04:42.500> record<00:04:43.070> about

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
morning phase for Beck is a record about

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:48.320 
morning phase for Beck is a record about
sort<00:04:44.300> of<00:04:44.450> he's<00:04:45.320> aging<00:04:45.680> gracefully

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.389
