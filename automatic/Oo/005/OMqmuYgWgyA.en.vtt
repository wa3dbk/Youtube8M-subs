missions<00:02:09.509> I've<00:02:09.869> put<00:02:10.079> a<00:02:10.109> website<00:02:10.349> together<00:02:10.799> and

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
missions I've put a website together and

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:12.860 
missions I've put a website together and
you<00:02:11.849> know<00:02:12.030> it's<00:02:12.209> getting<00:02:12.269> commissions<00:02:12.780> from

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
you know it's getting commissions from

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.449 
you know it's getting commissions from
all<00:02:13.079> over<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.379> world<00:02:13.409> and<00:02:13.829> I<00:02:13.950> realized<00:02:14.280> all

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
all over the world and I realized all

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.920 
all over the world and I realized all
right<00:02:14.609> there's<00:02:14.849> something<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.209> this<00:02:15.329> so<00:02:15.900> i

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
left the law practice behind and became

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.199 
left the law practice behind and became
a<00:02:18.269> full-time<00:02:19.019> artist<00:02:19.769> who<00:02:20.310> plays<00:02:20.519> with<00:02:20.549> Lego<00:02:20.909> a

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
a full-time artist who plays with Lego a

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.869 
a full-time artist who plays with Lego a
lot<00:02:22.109> of<00:02:22.230> people<00:02:22.379> often<00:02:22.980> ask<00:02:23.219> me<00:02:23.609> you<00:02:23.790> know

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
lot of people often ask me you know

lot of people often ask me you know
what's<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.689> best<00:02:24.719> way<00:02:25.019> is<00:02:25.469> to<00:02:25.769> switch<00:02:26.549> careers

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
what's the best way is to switch careers

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.270 
what's the best way is to switch careers
you<00:02:27.209> know<00:02:27.269> how<00:02:27.510> can<00:02:28.049> I<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.739> know<00:02:28.829> take<00:02:29.099> that

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
you know how can I you know take that

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.949 
you know how can I you know take that
leap<00:02:29.489> kind<00:02:29.819> of<00:02:29.879> like<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.120> did<00:02:30.329> and<00:02:30.510> I<00:02:30.569> say<00:02:30.810> well

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
leap kind of like you did and I say well

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.470 
leap kind of like you did and I say well
you<00:02:31.200> know<00:02:31.430> you<00:02:32.430> you<00:02:32.760> just<00:02:32.879> have<00:02:33.030> to<00:02:33.150> find<00:02:33.299> your

you know you you just have to find your

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.610 
you know you you just have to find your
passion<00:02:33.659> I<00:02:34.019> think<00:02:34.230> that's<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.469> most

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
passion I think that's the most

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.259 
passion I think that's the most
important<00:02:35.099> thing<00:02:35.129> and<00:02:35.430> then<00:02:35.549> follow<00:02:35.879> it<00:02:36.000> you

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
important thing and then follow it you

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.679 
important thing and then follow it you
know<00:02:36.739> it<00:02:37.739> was<00:02:38.189> not<00:02:38.340> a<00:02:38.370> quick<00:02:38.760> move<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.269> didn't<00:02:39.569> do

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:39.689 
know it was not a quick move I didn't do

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.440 
know it was not a quick move I didn't do
it<00:02:39.719> overnight<00:02:40.079> it<00:02:40.560> took<00:02:40.920> years<00:02:41.159> of<00:02:41.489> kind<00:02:42.299> of

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
it overnight it took years of kind of

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.149 
it overnight it took years of kind of
you<00:02:42.900> know<00:02:42.930> figuring<00:02:43.349> out<00:02:43.530> what<00:02:43.739> I<00:02:43.769> wanted<00:02:44.099> to

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
you know figuring out what I wanted to

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.240 
you know figuring out what I wanted to
do<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.639> could<00:02:44.970> I<00:02:45.030> make<00:02:45.329> a<00:02:45.359> living<00:02:45.750> doing<00:02:45.780> it

do and could I make a living doing it

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.309 
do and could I make a living doing it
but<00:02:47.269> you<00:02:48.269> know<00:02:48.299> once<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.659> find<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.109> you<00:02:49.169> just

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
but you know once you find it you just

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.369 
but you know once you find it you just
got<00:02:49.530> to<00:02:49.560> go<00:02:49.769> for<00:02:49.799> it<00:02:50.099> I<00:02:50.840> tell<00:02:51.840> people<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.260> know

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
got to go for it I tell people you know

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.589 
got to go for it I tell people you know
if<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:53.069> want<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:53.430> go<00:02:53.579> out<00:02:53.609> on<00:02:53.939> the<00:02:54.000> street<00:02:54.389> and

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
if you want to go out on the street and

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.190 
if you want to go out on the street and
so<00:02:55.409> clay<00:02:55.769> pots<00:02:56.069> that's<00:02:56.909> great<00:02:57.150> go<00:02:57.569> for<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:57.900> but

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
so clay pots that's great go for it but

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.839 
so clay pots that's great go for it but
be<00:02:58.379> sure<00:02:58.409> you<00:02:58.590> take<00:02:58.859> a<00:02:58.889> pottery<00:02:59.159> class<00:02:59.340> before

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
be sure you take a pottery class before

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.059 
be sure you take a pottery class before
you<00:03:00.090> do<00:03:00.209> so<00:03:00.419> so<00:03:01.079> everything<00:03:01.530> that<00:03:01.889> I<00:03:01.919> do

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
you do so so everything that I do

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.339 
you do so so everything that I do
everything<00:03:02.579> starts<00:03:02.939> with<00:03:02.969> an<00:03:03.150> idea<00:03:03.299> I<00:03:03.719> have<00:03:04.230> to

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
everything starts with an idea I have to

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:05.750 
everything starts with an idea I have to
have<00:03:04.439> that<00:03:04.620> idea<00:03:04.889> so<00:03:05.069> I<00:03:05.099> carry<00:03:05.370> around<00:03:05.489> a

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
have that idea so I carry around a

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.610 
have that idea so I carry around a
sketchbook<00:03:06.180> wherever<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.599> go<00:03:06.840> I'm<00:03:07.409> often

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
sketchbook wherever I go I'm often

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.949 
sketchbook wherever I go I'm often
sketching<00:03:08.310> different<00:03:08.669> ideas<00:03:09.299> and<00:03:09.329> doodles

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
sketching different ideas and doodles

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.349 
sketching different ideas and doodles
and<00:03:10.139> whatnot<00:03:10.590> once<00:03:11.159> I<00:03:11.310> home<00:03:11.549> down<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.939> idea<00:03:12.269> I

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
and whatnot once I home down that idea I

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:14.899 
and whatnot once I home down that idea I
really<00:03:13.079> try<00:03:13.829> and<00:03:13.859> visualize<00:03:14.069> it<00:03:14.519> in<00:03:14.579> my<00:03:14.729> head

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
really try and visualize it in my head

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.069 
really try and visualize it in my head
what<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.180> finished<00:03:15.329> piece<00:03:15.629> is<00:03:15.780> going<00:03:15.900> to<00:03:15.989> look

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
what the finished piece is going to look

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.750 
what the finished piece is going to look
like<00:03:16.109> before<00:03:16.709> I<00:03:16.949> even<00:03:17.040> put<00:03:17.280> down<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:17.459> first

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
like before I even put down that first

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.610 
like before I even put down that first
break<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.299> there's<00:03:18.690> a<00:03:18.780> lot<00:03:18.930> of<00:03:18.959> sketching<00:03:19.470> and

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
break and there's a lot of sketching and

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.020 
break and there's a lot of sketching and
I<00:03:19.650> sketch<00:03:19.919> out<00:03:20.129> on<00:03:20.310> something<00:03:20.639> called<00:03:20.819> brick

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
I sketch out on something called brick

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.449 
I sketch out on something called brick
paper<00:03:21.269> which<00:03:21.659> is<00:03:21.690> it's<00:03:22.620> like<00:03:22.859> graph<00:03:23.250> paper

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
paper which is it's like graph paper

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.399 
paper which is it's like graph paper
that<00:03:23.819> we<00:03:23.879> used<00:03:24.030> in<00:03:24.150> math<00:03:24.299> class<00:03:24.479> only<00:03:24.840> instead

00:03:25.399 --> 00:03:25.409 
that we used in math class only instead

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:27.140 
that we used in math class only instead
of<00:03:25.470> having<00:03:25.739> squares<00:03:26.129> as<00:03:26.370> little<00:03:26.609> rectangles

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
of having squares as little rectangles

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.759 
of having squares as little rectangles
the<00:03:27.299> shape<00:03:27.479> of<00:03:27.659> Lego<00:03:27.810> bricks<00:03:28.199> so<00:03:28.409> I<00:03:28.439> can<00:03:28.650> use

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
the shape of Lego bricks so I can use

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.030 
the shape of Lego bricks so I can use
that<00:03:28.799> as<00:03:29.280> kind<00:03:29.819> of<00:03:30.000> a<00:03:30.120> blueprint<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:31.040> the

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
that as kind of a blueprint and the

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.520 
that as kind of a blueprint and the
building<00:03:32.430> process<00:03:32.639> is<00:03:33.150> it's<00:03:33.629> slow<00:03:34.139> because<00:03:34.349> I

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
building process is it's slow because I

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.069 
building process is it's slow because I
glue<00:03:34.949> each<00:03:35.250> brick<00:03:35.579> down<00:03:35.760> as<00:03:36.030> I<00:03:36.180> go<00:03:36.389> I<00:03:36.689> used<00:03:36.959> to

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
glue each brick down as I go I used to

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.309 
glue each brick down as I go I used to
you<00:03:38.069> know<00:03:38.099> create<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.549> sculpture<00:03:39.079> unglued<00:03:40.079> and

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
you know create a sculpture unglued and

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.530 
you know create a sculpture unglued and
then<00:03:40.530> rebuild<00:03:40.919> it<00:03:41.040> again<00:03:41.129> glued<00:03:41.609> these<00:03:41.939> days<00:03:42.269> I

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
then rebuild it again glued these days I

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.569 
then rebuild it again glued these days I
trust<00:03:42.840> myself<00:03:43.049> enough<00:03:43.530> that<00:03:43.709> I<00:03:43.799> glue<00:03:44.069> as<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.250> go

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
trust myself enough that I glue as I go

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.789 
trust myself enough that I glue as I go
so<00:03:45.389> each<00:03:45.569> little<00:03:45.930> brick<00:03:46.199> gets<00:03:46.409> a<00:03:46.470> little<00:03:46.560> dab

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
so each little brick gets a little dab

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.469 
so each little brick gets a little dab
of<00:03:46.829> glue<00:03:47.009> and<00:03:47.189> then<00:03:47.519> I<00:03:47.669> put<00:03:48.000> the<00:03:48.120> next<00:03:48.329> break

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:48.479 
of glue and then I put the next break

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:50.240 
of glue and then I put the next break
down<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.959> next<00:03:49.199> break<00:03:49.349> down<00:03:49.530> so<00:03:49.709> it's<00:03:49.859> a<00:03:49.949> slow

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
down the next break down so it's a slow

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.949 
down the next break down so it's a slow
process<00:03:50.280> you<00:03:50.970> have<00:03:51.000> to<00:03:51.180> have<00:03:51.269> patience<00:03:51.810> in

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
process you have to have patience in

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.249 
process you have to have patience in
this<00:03:52.109> job<00:03:52.609> but<00:03:53.609> you<00:03:54.479> know<00:03:54.569> eventually<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:55.079> get

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:55.259 
this job but you know eventually I get

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:56.629 
this job but you know eventually I get
to<00:03:55.379> a<00:03:55.409> point<00:03:55.590> where<00:03:55.769> something<00:03:56.340> recognizable

to a point where something recognizable
is<00:03:57.389> there<00:03:57.599> and<00:03:57.840> just<00:03:58.829> a<00:03:59.040> lot<00:03:59.220> of<00:03:59.340> building<00:03:59.930> so<00:04:00.930> a
