00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.700
 and I love I love being in art 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:09.330
 because in addition 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:12.240
 I find new things with karina head 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.389
 and also easy on the stamps here comes 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.210
 because they are very innovative novelties 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:23.039
 because they are great so barbarians 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:26.140
 It serves for large surfaces for 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.230
 surfaces girls also has its 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.029
 rubber version are rubber stamps and 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.430
 also that they come in tiny 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.829
 little ones and they do not come tiny 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.329
 being a tiny for fry 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.839
 you can be apply on all 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:44.379
 surfaces or the surface of the video 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:46.969
 cold porcelain wood cakes 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:51.739
 wood everything you imagine us 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:54.739
 we put them because in addition the designs 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.960
 they are super originals are not originals and 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:02.559
 we try to constantly draw models 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:05.840
 new and to be the order of the day 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.850
 I want to take my year of friends to 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.100
 look we have of the ethnic people who are 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.659
 these there is a more vintage wave is that 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.600
 they are more portaaditos like this 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.540
 if we want 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.939
 more complete what we're going to see a 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.640
 little while we are closing is 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:26.240
 how to make acquaintances does not have prepared 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.299
 something acrylic if it can be a yes 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.640
 you apply on the seal of the acrylic as 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.450
 can be with a brush with a 15 what 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.180
 pretty worn with a roller in these 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.270
 large we can apply it with rollers or 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.970
 with sponge that out there like one 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.009
 it's easier to find some that you 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:49.280
 we passed with our fingers 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.259
 and others with steels with a brush afterwards 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.569
 I also see some here that later one 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.240
 when you apply the seal and you do not 

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:59.450
 you finished using how to do it 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.149
 neighborhood are transferable you know me 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.509
 forgot to wash us a day later I go to 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:08.600
 water for a brush but it's the head 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.310
 of the sack and that have barbarians not the truth 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.870
 that I am fascinated by the one who has 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.150
 gone through art are all 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.700
 delighted 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.290
 with the possibility of these stamps and 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:23.110

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.370
 time to get new things 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.230
 the truth is because you have to take out 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.510
 new things for people to like 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.810

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.340
