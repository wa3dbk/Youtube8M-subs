00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.230 

alright<00:00:10.769> guys<00:00:10.920> so<00:00:10.980> we<00:00:11.550> just<00:00:11.580> got<00:00:11.880> kicked<00:00:12.030> out

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
alright guys so we just got kicked out

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.509 
alright guys so we just got kicked out
of<00:00:12.269> that<00:00:12.420> spot<00:00:12.799> I'm<00:00:13.799> actually<00:00:14.040> at<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.309> same

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
of that spot I'm actually at the same

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.000 
of that spot I'm actually at the same
exact<00:00:14.849> building<00:00:15.240> but<00:00:16.199> in<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.379> back<00:00:16.560> it's

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
exact building but in the back it's

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.220 
exact building but in the back it's
almost<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.400> exact<00:00:17.699> same<00:00:17.730> setup<00:00:18.270> kind<00:00:19.080> of

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
almost the exact same setup kind of

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:28.960 
almost the exact same setup kind of
precision<00:00:19.730> so<00:00:20.730> check<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.359> out

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.820 

it's<00:00:29.630> actually<00:00:29.930> better<00:00:30.080> and<00:00:30.410> there's<00:00:30.590> a<00:00:30.650> much

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:30.830 
it's actually better and there's a much

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.790 
it's actually better and there's a much
clearer<00:00:31.310> run-up<00:00:32.140> always<00:00:33.140> have<00:00:33.290> a<00:00:33.350> nice<00:00:33.500> clean

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
clearer run-up always have a nice clean

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.380 
clearer run-up always have a nice clean
run<00:00:34.040> up<00:00:34.989> solid<00:00:36.190> Rippey<00:00:37.190> surface<00:00:38.000> for<00:00:38.270> your

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
run up solid Rippey surface for your

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.510 
run up solid Rippey surface for your
tongue<00:00:39.230> and<00:00:39.530> your<00:00:39.860> precision<00:00:41.110> know<00:00:42.110> your<00:00:42.290> outs

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:42.520 
tongue and your precision know your outs

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.580 
tongue and your precision know your outs
there's<00:00:43.520> nothing<00:00:43.820> behind<00:00:43.970> it<00:00:44.559> except<00:00:45.559> for

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
there's nothing behind it except for

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.740 
there's nothing behind it except for
some<00:00:45.800> people<00:00:46.129> so<00:00:46.340> be<00:00:46.460> careful<00:00:46.820> all<00:00:47.449> right<00:00:47.570> so

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
some people so be careful all right so

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.850 
some people so be careful all right so
the<00:00:47.840> truth<00:00:48.050> is<00:00:48.230> if<00:00:48.379> you<00:00:48.410> already<00:00:48.530> know<00:00:48.739> how<00:00:48.769> to

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
the truth is if you already know how to

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.110 
the truth is if you already know how to
calm<00:00:49.160> and<00:00:49.519> you're<00:00:49.730> any<00:00:49.850> know<00:00:49.940> how<00:00:50.030> to

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
calm and you're any know how to

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.750 
calm and you're any know how to
precision<00:00:50.449> time<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:51.590> precision<00:00:51.920> is<00:00:52.190> really

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
precision time to precision is really

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.939 
precision time to precision is really
not<00:00:52.879> that<00:00:52.940> difficult<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:54.530> only<00:00:54.710> things<00:00:54.890> you

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
not that difficult the only things you

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.770 
not that difficult the only things you
have<00:00:55.070> to<00:00:55.129> take<00:00:55.309> another<00:00:55.430> judgment<00:00:56.000> is<00:00:56.120> how<00:00:56.480> far

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
have to take another judgment is how far

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.549 
have to take another judgment is how far
you're<00:00:57.019> able<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:57.500> come<00:00:57.710> all<00:00:58.400> right

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
you're able to come all right

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.889 
you're able to come all right
also<00:01:00.559> whether<00:01:00.800> it's<00:01:01.010> a<00:01:01.510> level<00:01:02.510> conquer

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
also whether it's a level conquer

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.960 
also whether it's a level conquer
precision<00:01:03.350> then<00:01:03.980> you're<00:01:04.129> gonna<00:01:04.250> be<00:01:04.430> coming<00:01:04.820> up

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
precision then you're gonna be coming up

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.900 
precision then you're gonna be coming up
and<00:01:05.449> harder<00:01:05.869> take<00:01:06.649> your<00:01:06.800> bodies<00:01:07.039> off<00:01:07.190> this<00:01:07.700> is

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
and harder take your bodies off this is

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.070 
and harder take your bodies off this is
a<00:01:08.470> not<00:01:09.470> not<00:01:09.890> that<00:01:10.039> big<00:01:10.220> but<00:01:10.840> essentially<00:01:11.840> I'm

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
a not not that big but essentially I'm

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.130 
a not not that big but essentially I'm
dropping<00:01:12.590> down<00:01:12.619> to<00:01:12.830> precision<00:01:13.840> either<00:01:14.840> way<00:01:15.110> I

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
dropping down to precision either way I

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.850 
dropping down to precision either way I
still<00:01:15.590> want<00:01:15.740> to<00:01:15.770> arc<00:01:15.979> my<00:01:16.160> body<00:01:16.369> off<00:01:16.670> end<00:01:17.149> down

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
still want to arc my body off end down

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.010 
still want to arc my body off end down
because<00:01:18.860> the<00:01:19.250> idea<00:01:19.610> of<00:01:19.670> precision<00:01:20.300> czar<00:01:20.539> you

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
because the idea of precision czar you

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.450 
because the idea of precision czar you
take<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.350> momentum<00:01:21.740> forward<00:01:22.009> it's<00:01:22.250> gonna<00:01:22.369> be

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
take the momentum forward it's gonna be

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.609 
take the momentum forward it's gonna be
a<00:01:22.490> lot<00:01:22.670> harder<00:01:22.700> for<00:01:23.090> you<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:23.899> land<00:01:24.080> on<00:01:24.259> it<00:01:24.410> and

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
a lot harder for you to land on it and

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.740 
a lot harder for you to land on it and
stay<00:01:24.860> on<00:01:24.890> it<00:01:25.070> so<00:01:25.310> take<00:01:25.460> your<00:01:25.610> coming<00:01:25.940> up<00:01:26.119> give

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
stay on it so take your coming up give

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.219 
stay on it so take your coming up give
it<00:01:26.840> a<00:01:26.899> nice<00:01:27.050> Park

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:37.730 

let's<00:01:31.229> do<00:01:31.500> one<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:32.250> know<00:01:36.350> so<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.380> want<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.679> guys

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
let's do one you know so I want you guys

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.219 
let's do one you know so I want you guys
also<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.310> notice<00:01:38.640> see<00:01:39.000> my<00:01:39.119> wrists<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.899> fingers

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
also to notice see my wrists and fingers

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.200 
also to notice see my wrists and fingers
how<00:01:40.590> I'm<00:01:40.710> pushing<00:01:41.310> off<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.670> continue<00:01:42.090> my

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
how I'm pushing off to continue my

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.389 
how I'm pushing off to continue my
movement<00:01:42.659> make<00:01:43.380> sure<00:01:43.649> you<00:01:43.799> don't<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.189> keep

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
movement make sure you don't just keep

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.960 
movement make sure you don't just keep
your<00:01:44.549> hands<00:01:44.850> flat<00:01:45.149> okay<00:01:46.429> so<00:01:47.429> in<00:01:47.520> a<00:01:47.549> gap<00:01:47.759> like

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
your hands flat okay so in a gap like

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.249 
your hands flat okay so in a gap like
this<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.329> kind<00:01:48.539> of<00:01:48.600> want<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:48.780> know<00:01:48.840> where<00:01:49.110> the

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
this you kind of want to know where the

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.100 
this you kind of want to know where the
wall<00:01:49.470> starts<00:01:50.039> and<00:01:50.509> ends<00:01:51.509> I'm<00:01:51.750> gonna<00:01:51.899> line

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
wall starts and ends I'm gonna line

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.100 
wall starts and ends I'm gonna line
yourself<00:01:52.289> up<00:01:53.090> find<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.179> line<00:01:54.360> there<00:01:54.960> on<00:01:55.049> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
yourself up find the line there on the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.190 
yourself up find the line there on the
wall<00:01:55.579> make<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.610> mark<00:01:57.259> and<00:01:58.259> look<00:01:58.819> boom<00:02:00.200> that's

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
wall make a mark and look boom that's

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:11.699 
wall make a mark and look boom that's
over<00:02:01.439> here

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.869 

so<00:02:12.709> guys<00:02:12.860> one<00:02:13.190> thing<00:02:13.340> I<00:02:13.400> want<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:13.610> talk<00:02:13.730> about

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
so guys one thing I want to talk about

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.500 
so guys one thing I want to talk about
is<00:02:14.120> really<00:02:15.099> where<00:02:16.099> you<00:02:16.340> leave<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.730> ground<00:02:17.090> or

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
is really where you leave the ground or

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.600 
is really where you leave the ground or
your<00:02:17.810> cognitive<00:02:18.140> decision<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:19.069> the<00:02:19.190> gap<00:02:19.400> like

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
your cognitive decision so the gap like

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.190 
your cognitive decision so the gap like
this<00:02:19.790> again<00:02:20.420> it's<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.830> chop<00:02:22.069> down<00:02:22.900> but<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:23.930> still

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
this again it's to chop down but I still

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.320 
this again it's to chop down but I still
want<00:02:24.379> to<00:02:24.410> go<00:02:24.530> up<00:02:24.709> in<00:02:25.519> order<00:02:25.730> to<00:02:25.970> take<00:02:26.120> that

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
want to go up in order to take that

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.140 
want to go up in order to take that
momentum<00:02:26.569> pump<00:02:27.019> I<00:02:27.410> need<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.160> leave<00:02:28.400> a<00:02:28.700> little

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
momentum pump I need to leave a little

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.660 
momentum pump I need to leave a little
bit<00:02:29.269> later<00:02:29.480> drive<00:02:30.230> it<00:02:30.970> up<00:02:31.970> like<00:02:32.269> this

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
bit later drive it up like this
