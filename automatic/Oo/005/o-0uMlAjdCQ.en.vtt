00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
neat things about ABC is the sensors are

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.910 
neat things about ABC is the sensors are
so<00:02:00.460> small<00:02:00.759> and<00:02:01.000> in<00:02:01.330> fact<00:02:01.539> the<00:02:01.690> entire<00:02:01.869> unit<00:02:02.560> is

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
so small and in fact the entire unit is

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.820 
so small and in fact the entire unit is
incorporated<00:02:03.670> in<00:02:03.820> an<00:02:04.300> existing<00:02:04.660> receiver<00:02:05.170> so

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
incorporated in an existing receiver so

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.249 
incorporated in an existing receiver so
the<00:02:06.009> receiver<00:02:06.369> is<00:02:06.610> no<00:02:06.940> larger<00:02:07.360> than<00:02:07.660> a

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.169 
the receiver is no larger than a
conventional<00:02:08.500> receiver<00:02:09.280> and<00:02:09.489> it's<00:02:09.729> also<00:02:09.910> just

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
conventional receiver and it's also just

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.440 
conventional receiver and it's also just
a<00:02:10.330> couple<00:02:10.570> grams<00:02:10.869> heavier<00:02:11.110> so<00:02:11.560> there<00:02:11.739> is<00:02:11.860> no

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
a couple grams heavier so there is no

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.660 
a couple grams heavier so there is no
negative<00:02:13.450> effects<00:02:13.810> on<00:02:14.050> incorporating<00:02:14.380> ABC<00:02:15.190> so

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
negative effects on incorporating ABC so

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.760 
negative effects on incorporating ABC so

the system comes already calibrated and
set<00:02:31.150> up<00:02:31.300> out<00:02:31.480> of<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.750> box<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:32.590> literally<00:02:33.160> you

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
set up out of the box so literally you

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.100 
set up out of the box so literally you
pull<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.850> vehicle<00:02:34.000> out<00:02:34.210> of<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.510> box<00:02:34.720> you're

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
pull the vehicle out of the box you're

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.360 
pull the vehicle out of the box you're
going<00:02:35.230> to<00:02:35.290> charge<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.680> batteries<00:02:36.040> you'll

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
going to charge the batteries you'll

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.550 
going to charge the batteries you'll
stick<00:02:36.610> for<00:02:36.970> double<00:02:37.270> a's<00:02:37.420> in<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.750> DX<00:02:38.020> 2<00:02:38.230> e<00:02:38.260> and

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
stick for double a's in the DX 2 e and

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.860 
stick for double a's in the DX 2 e and
you're<00:02:39.130> ready<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.490> go<00:02:39.700> there's<00:02:40.300> really<00:02:40.570> no

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
you're ready to go there's really no

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.960 
you're ready to go there's really no
reason<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.410> recalibrate<00:02:41.830> of<00:02:42.460> course<00:02:42.640> keep<00:02:42.820> in

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
reason to recalibrate of course keep in

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.850 
reason to recalibrate of course keep in
mind<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.360> rotate<00:02:43.780> this<00:02:43.930> knob<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.380> turn<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.740> up

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
mind you rotate this knob to turn it up

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.980 
mind you rotate this knob to turn it up
and<00:02:45.280> increase<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.970> sensitivity<00:02:46.180> turn<00:02:46.840> it

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
and increase the sensitivity turn it

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.410 
and increase the sensitivity turn it
down<00:02:47.230> to<00:02:47.560> decrease<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.130> sensitivity<00:02:48.820> if

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
down to decrease the sensitivity if

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.900 
down to decrease the sensitivity if
indeed<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:50.170> find<00:02:50.650> that<00:02:50.950> later<00:02:51.250> on<00:02:51.490> you<00:02:51.730> want

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
indeed you find that later on you want

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.460 
indeed you find that later on you want
to<00:02:52.030> recalibrate<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.750> system<00:02:53.110> or<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.380> know

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
to recalibrate the system or you know

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.600 
to recalibrate the system or you know
pull<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.680> out<00:02:53.860> stick<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.100> in<00:02:54.220> another<00:02:54.430> vehicle

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
pull it out stick it in another vehicle

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.790 
pull it out stick it in another vehicle
there<00:02:55.330> are<00:02:55.450> instructions<00:02:55.900> that<00:02:56.350> are<00:02:56.380> included

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
there are instructions that are included

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.120 
there are instructions that are included
with<00:02:57.520> the<00:02:58.270> system<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:58.810> talk<00:02:59.200> about<00:02:59.230> that<00:02:59.650> and

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
with the system that talk about that and

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.400 
with the system that talk about that and
basically<00:03:00.310> when<00:03:01.030> you<00:03:01.120> bind<00:03:01.450> you<00:03:01.930> go<00:03:02.110> through<00:03:02.350> a

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
basically when you bind you go through a

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.920 
basically when you bind you go through a
special<00:03:02.650> procedure<00:03:03.210> teaching<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:04.450> teaching

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
special procedure teaching the teaching

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.860 
special procedure teaching the teaching
the<00:03:05.470> receiver<00:03:05.860> full<00:03:06.580> throttle<00:03:06.820> full<00:03:07.600> brake

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
the receiver full throttle full brake

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.080 
the receiver full throttle full brake
full<00:03:08.560> right<00:03:08.800> and<00:03:09.040> full<00:03:09.340> left<00:03:09.520> steering<00:03:09.910> it's

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
full right and full left steering it's

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.610 
full right and full left steering it's
actually<00:03:10.450> very<00:03:10.480> simple<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:11.110> takes<00:03:11.320> about

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
actually very simple and takes about

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:28.809 
actually very simple and takes about
less<00:03:12.130> than<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:12.340> minute

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819
