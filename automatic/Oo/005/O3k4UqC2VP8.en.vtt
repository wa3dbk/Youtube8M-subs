00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
Brazilian striker two girls and one

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.720 
Brazilian striker two girls and one
assist<00:03:28.230> him<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.800> I<00:03:28.830> believe<00:03:29.460> this<00:03:29.550> is<00:03:29.610> a

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
second in form as well so wouldn't be

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.510 
second in form as well so wouldn't be
too<00:03:31.260> bad<00:03:31.290> especially<00:03:31.770> with<00:03:32.280> some

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
too bad especially with some

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.550 
too bad especially with some

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
ridiculously high shooting like that and

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.770 
ridiculously high shooting like that and
then<00:03:34.830> finally<00:03:35.310> finishing<00:03:35.670> off<00:03:35.850> Sergio<00:03:36.510> Aguero

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
then finally finishing off Sergio Aguero

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.570 
then finally finishing off Sergio Aguero
who<00:03:37.020> where<00:03:37.230> he<00:03:37.500> should<00:03:37.770> get<00:03:37.890> it<00:03:38.040> shown<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.280> free
