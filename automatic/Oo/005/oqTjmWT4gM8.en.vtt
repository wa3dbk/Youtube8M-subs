00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
advanced warfare so we got to talk about

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.410 
advanced warfare so we got to talk about
that<00:00:29.070> today<00:00:29.279> there's<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.609> lot<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.910> really

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
that today there's a lot of really

that today there's a lot of really
really<00:00:30.660> big<00:00:30.900> improvements<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.529> i<00:00:31.590> think<00:00:31.769> a

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
really big improvements that i think a

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.650 
really big improvements that i think a
lot<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:32.009> people<00:00:32.099> missed<00:00:32.550> because<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.450> all<00:00:33.570> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
lot of people missed because of all the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.209 
lot of people missed because of all the
black<00:00:33.870> ops<00:00:34.050> 3<00:00:34.350> information<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:34.920> let's<00:00:35.100> get

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
black ops 3 information so let's get

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.370 
black ops 3 information so let's get
into<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:35.700> first<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.120> all<00:00:36.210> match<00:00:37.020> making

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
into this so first of all match making

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.490 
into this so first of all match making
improvements<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.340> connectivity

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
improvements and connectivity

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.380 
improvements and connectivity
optimizations<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.829> connectivity

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
optimizations so the connectivity

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.819 
optimizations so the connectivity
optimization<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:43.050> making<00:00:43.379> it<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.649> that

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
optimization is just making it so that

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.369 
optimization is just making it so that
you<00:00:44.100> get<00:00:44.280> put<00:00:44.579> or<00:00:45.149> your<00:00:45.329> connection<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.050> lot

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
you get put or your connection is a lot

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.799 
you get put or your connection is a lot
better<00:00:46.500> more<00:00:47.070> often<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:47.969> simple<00:00:48.570> now<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
better more often that simple now the

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.540 
better more often that simple now the
match<00:00:49.140> making<00:00:49.500> improvements<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.309> lot<00:00:50.460> of

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
match making improvements a lot of

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.889 
match making improvements a lot of
people<00:00:50.820> are<00:00:50.910> wondering<00:00:51.149> whether<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.840> is

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
people are wondering whether this is

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.260 
people are wondering whether this is
skill<00:00:52.289> based<00:00:52.500> matchmaking<00:00:52.710> or<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:53.489> get<00:00:54.090> into

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
skill based matchmaking or just get into

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.569 
skill based matchmaking or just get into
a<00:00:54.300> game<00:00:54.510> kind<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.870> faster<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:56.160> noticed

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
a game kind of faster I have noticed

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.400 
a game kind of faster I have noticed
that<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.760> playing<00:00:57.210> against<00:00:57.539> some<00:00:57.750> lower<00:00:57.989> level

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
that I playing against some lower level

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.410 
that I playing against some lower level
players<00:00:58.739> but<00:00:59.160> let<00:00:59.340> me<00:00:59.370> know<00:00:59.520> what<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.940> think<00:01:00.180> I

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
players but let me know what you think I

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.510 
players but let me know what you think I
I<00:01:00.449> think<00:01:01.109> they<00:01:01.379> may<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:01.590> improved<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.309> skill

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
I think they may have improved the skill

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.889 
I think they may have improved the skill
based<00:01:02.699> matchmaking<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.359> where<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.570> don't<00:01:03.690> get

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
based matchmaking to where you don't get

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.990 
based matchmaking to where you don't get
put<00:01:04.110> against<00:01:04.470> MLG<00:01:04.979> Pro<00:01:05.250> is<00:01:05.280> half<00:01:05.610> at<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.820> time

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
put against MLG Pro is half at the time

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.580 
put against MLG Pro is half at the time
so<00:01:06.659> let<00:01:06.810> me<00:01:06.930> know<00:01:07.049> what<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.320> think<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
so let me know what you think in the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.960 
so let me know what you think in the
comments<00:01:07.920> section<00:01:07.950> below<00:01:08.220> I'm<00:01:08.520> not<00:01:08.760> totally

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
comments section below I'm not totally

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.580 
comments section below I'm not totally
sure<00:01:09.210> about<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:09.869> think<00:01:10.229> they<00:01:10.409> may<00:01:10.560> have

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
sure about it but I think they may have

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.440 
sure about it but I think they may have
improved<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.189> just<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.490> little<00:01:11.520> bit<00:01:11.760> now<00:01:11.970> the

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
improved it just a little bit now the

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.000 
improved it just a little bit now the
important<00:01:12.869> part<00:01:13.080> is<00:01:13.200> here<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.799> there's

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
important part is here is that there's

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.550 
important part is here is that there's
four<00:01:14.430> weapon<00:01:14.909> updates<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.450> first<00:01:15.689> one<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.110> a

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
four weapon updates the first one is a

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.679 
four weapon updates the first one is a
nerf<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> ASM<00:01:17.939> one<00:01:18.150> as<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.540> could

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
nerf to the ASM one as you could

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.060 
nerf to the ASM one as you could
probably<00:01:18.840> tell<00:01:19.080> by<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.470> title<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:19.920> video

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
probably tell by the title of this video

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.640 
probably tell by the title of this video
so<00:01:20.310> that<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.850> nerve<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.390> ASM<00:01:21.750> one<00:01:22.049> has<00:01:22.439> to

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
so that the nerve to the ASM one has to

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.800 
so that the nerve to the ASM one has to
do<00:01:22.799> with<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.369> amount<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.909> bullets<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.509> clip

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
do with the amount of bullets in a clip

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.950 
do with the amount of bullets in a clip
or<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.080> magazine<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.250> normally<00:01:26.549> there's<00:01:26.850> 45<00:01:27.330> now

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
or a magazine so normally there's 45 now

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.170 
or a magazine so normally there's 45 now
there<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.439> only<00:01:28.470> 35<00:01:29.310> if<00:01:29.670> you're<00:01:29.790> using<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
there is only 35 if you're using the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.980 
there is only 35 if you're using the
speakeasy<00:01:30.720> or<00:01:31.049> extended<00:01:31.680> mags<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.070> goes<00:01:32.220> from

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
speakeasy or extended mags it goes from

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.020 
speakeasy or extended mags it goes from
6254<00:01:33.990> so<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.560> no<00:01:34.829> extended<00:01:35.189> mags<00:01:35.460> it's<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.820> ten

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
6254 so if no extended mags it's a ten

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.700 
6254 so if no extended mags it's a ten
bullet<00:01:36.299> difference<00:01:36.689> with<00:01:37.200> extended<00:01:37.680> mags

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
bullet difference with extended mags

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.590 
bullet difference with extended mags
it's<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.130> six<00:01:38.400> bullet<00:01:38.700> difference<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.390> so<00:01:39.540> you

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
it's a six bullet difference just so you

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.870 
it's a six bullet difference just so you
guys<00:01:39.750> know<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.079> also<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.829> mk14<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
guys know that also the mk14 this is the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.700 
guys know that also the mk14 this is the
biggest<00:01:42.060> one<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.329> my<00:01:42.479> opinion<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.840> mk14<00:01:43.409> got

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
biggest one of my opinion the mk14 got

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.560 
biggest one of my opinion the mk14 got
an<00:01:43.829> increased<00:01:44.369> headshot<00:01:44.909> damage<00:01:45.390> multiplier

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
an increased headshot damage multiplier

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.990 
an increased headshot damage multiplier
the<00:01:46.350> reason<00:01:46.860> why<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.490> important<00:01:47.909> is

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
the reason why this is so important is

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.060 
the reason why this is so important is
because<00:01:48.060> now<00:01:48.540> if<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.810> get<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.930> headshot<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.590> a

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
because now if you get a headshot and a

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.340 
because now if you get a headshot and a
body<00:01:50.310> shot<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:51.180> will<00:01:51.299> now<00:01:51.479> get<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.750> two<00:01:51.899> bullet

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
body shot you will now get a two bullet

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.990 
body shot you will now get a two bullet
kill<00:01:52.560> whereas<00:01:52.829> before<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.399> would<00:01:53.520> not<00:01:53.790> get<00:01:53.970> a

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
kill whereas before you would not get a

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.490 
kill whereas before you would not get a
two<00:01:54.180> bullet<00:01:54.479> kill<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:54.810> that's<00:01:54.960> really<00:01:55.320> really

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
two bullet kill so that's really really

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.889 
two bullet kill so that's really really
big<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.829> actually<00:01:56.280> makes<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.759> mk14<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.540> lot

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
big and actually makes the mk14 a lot

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.440 
big and actually makes the mk14 a lot
better<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.350> gun<00:01:58.560> also<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.490> piatek<00:02:00.060> which<00:02:00.299> I

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
better of a gun also the piatek which I

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.940 
better of a gun also the piatek which I
didn't<00:02:00.689> think<00:02:00.719> needed<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.320> buff<00:02:01.469> but<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.770> got

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
didn't think needed a buff but it got

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.910 
didn't think needed a buff but it got
one<00:02:02.159> decreased<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.270> initial<00:02:04.170> recoil<00:02:04.619> so<00:02:04.860> you

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
one decreased a initial recoil so you

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.499 
one decreased a initial recoil so you
don't<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.399> crazy<00:02:05.700> recoil<00:02:06.180> at<00:02:06.299> first

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
don't have that crazy recoil at first

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.389 
don't have that crazy recoil at first
you<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.719> some<00:02:06.840> pretty<00:02:07.049> standard<00:02:07.860> recoil<00:02:08.220> and

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
you have some pretty standard recoil and

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.249 
you have some pretty standard recoil and
then<00:02:08.849> it<00:02:08.970> gets<00:02:09.060> into<00:02:09.330> that<00:02:09.360> laser<00:02:09.720> beam<00:02:10.050> that

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
then it gets into that laser beam that

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.199 
then it gets into that laser beam that
we<00:02:10.410> know<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:11.099> piatek<00:02:11.520> has<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.090> then

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
we know the piatek has and then

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.670 
we know the piatek has and then
decreased<00:02:13.170> aim

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
decreased aim

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.619 
decreased aim
down<00:02:13.769> sights<00:02:14.129> time<00:02:14.370> as<00:02:14.579> well<00:02:14.819> for<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.239> piatek

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
down sights time as well for the piatek

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:16.910 
down sights time as well for the piatek
so<00:02:15.840> this<00:02:15.989> gun<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.230> actually<00:02:16.709> going<00:02:16.799> to<00:02:16.890> be

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
so this gun is actually going to be

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.459 
so this gun is actually going to be
pretty<00:02:17.310> damn<00:02:17.549> good<00:02:17.849> now<00:02:18.060> now<00:02:18.299> also<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.750> EPM<00:02:19.140> 3

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:19.469 
pretty damn good now now also the EPM 3

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:21.229 
pretty damn good now now also the EPM 3
got<00:02:19.650> buffed<00:02:19.890> increased<00:02:20.400> headshot<00:02:20.849> damage

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
got buffed increased headshot damage

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.690 
got buffed increased headshot damage
multiplier<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:22.010> decreased<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.400> heat

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
multiplier and decreased the heat

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.970 
multiplier and decreased the heat
build-up<00:02:24.269> when<00:02:24.719> firing<00:02:25.049> I<00:02:25.379> don't<00:02:25.620> know<00:02:25.799> why

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
build-up when firing I don't know why

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.500 
build-up when firing I don't know why
they<00:02:26.159> worded<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.640> like<00:02:26.819> that<00:02:26.969> all<00:02:27.150> that<00:02:27.329> means

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
they worded it like that all that means

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.449 
they worded it like that all that means
is<00:02:27.659> it<00:02:27.840> overheats<00:02:28.379> lower<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.859> can<00:02:29.010> fire<00:02:29.189> more

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
is it overheats lower you can fire more

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.429 
is it overheats lower you can fire more
bullets<00:02:29.819> before<00:02:29.969> it<00:02:30.209> overheats<00:02:30.480> they<00:02:31.139> worded

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
bullets before it overheats they worded

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.809 
bullets before it overheats they worded
it<00:02:31.680> really<00:02:31.950> really<00:02:32.189> weird<00:02:32.340> in<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.519> patch<00:02:32.639> by

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
it really really weird in the patch by
