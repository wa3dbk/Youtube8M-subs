00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.740
 I'll show you today. 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.200
 water experience 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.379
 Angry 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.379
 [Music] 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:19.260
 this experience can be done at home 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.859
 provided you use gloves something 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.150
 to protect the clothing protective goggles 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:27.510
 it's an adult 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.920
 I'll start by separating 3 grams and a half 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:38.670
 caustic soda or sodium hydroxide 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:40.890
 then 100 grams of bicol 11 and I go 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.570
 separate 200 thousand liters of water I go 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:49.829
 use some of this water to dissolve 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:52.789
 both glucose and caustic soda and 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:57.360
 now comes a cooler ingredient than 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:01:02.640
 methylene subject you to 0.3 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:09.689
 dissolve 300 ml of water and then 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:18.119
 end is just to mix everything and put some 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:20.700
 This is 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.990
 our calming water 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.680
 but we have to mess with her with 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:28.920
 very careful not to be irritated because 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:43.100
 if we mess up this water 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:43.100
 she will be angry 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:02:01.490
 [Music] 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.740
 The great secret of this water is that it is 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.970
 moody when her daughter calms down 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:18.350
 she so almost crystalline white 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:20.810
 but as we imagine the blue water 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.620
 then just wait a little left up 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.370
 to calm down 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.260
 She's going to count to ten 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:34.190
 angry people you should know 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:36.200
 there we do not have to change 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:48.980
 container is just a shake up 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:52.310
 and the more it irritates the more 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.959
 Dark will stay longer she'll 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:03:00.620
 take time to get back calm but 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:01.549
 this is the male version of water 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.950
 Angry 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:06.320
 now I'm going to make a mix here that goes 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.400
 change the sex 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.490
 this water 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.490
 [Music] 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.019
 of course you must have imagined that 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.799
 this female water that is pink how much 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.870
 calm 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:29.499
 If we get nervous, she'll stay. 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.499
 [Music] 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:52.349
 purple and I know you'll want to know 

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:54.480
 How does the water look like this? 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.500
 moody 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.799
 What happens is that when people 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.590
 mixes the mycosis with caustic soda rossi 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.780
 reacts with methylene blue transforms 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.409
 methylene blue is a substance that 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.560
 flame leu cometi lena cast of white 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:12.629
 I back 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.819
 only when we shake the mixture the 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.919
 oxygen dissolves in the water and 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.799
 oxygen reacts with the 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.959
 makes the goal as he does not turn blue again 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.320
 of methylene is why the water is 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.849
 blue again only there the glucose react 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.860
 one more time with the last Chilean 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:31.349
 transformation, I did not even commit 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.510
 the substance becomes clear once again 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:36.599
 people shake life again the last 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.490
 the nouveau again becomes clear 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.900
 one more time and that's how it goes 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.930
 go straight to blue leave 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.550
 rest clear it is clear that water 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.860
 did not get female what I did was leave 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.360
 the mixture which was transparent 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.580
 mix pink how did i do this 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.650
 dripping a substance completely 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.470
 transparent, what I did was a 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.960
 I spoke at the new yard 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.810
 is a substance that turns pink when 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.870
 acts on a basis and our basis is the 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:08.110
 Caustic soda then the whole 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:12.440
 pink and when pink blends with blue 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.440
 [Music] 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:18.990
 it turns purple bad experiences with this 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.600
 here you find a special series 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:31.190
 super clinic 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:34.240
 [Music] 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:49.850
 was cool 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:49.850
