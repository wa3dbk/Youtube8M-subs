which<00:01:32.130> I<00:01:32.250> find<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.640> little<00:01:33.030> bit<00:01:33.150> expensive<00:01:33.570> but

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
which I find a little bit expensive but

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.230 
which I find a little bit expensive but
if<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.770> really<00:01:35.040> want<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.430> particular<00:01:35.939> color

if you really want the particular color

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.399 
if you really want the particular color
it<00:01:36.450> could<00:01:36.600> be<00:01:36.750> worth<00:01:36.930> it

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
it could be worth it

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.200 
it could be worth it
I<00:01:37.439> personally<00:01:38.009> don't<00:01:38.369> know<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.820> would<00:01:39.000> pay

that<00:01:39.240> much<00:01:39.840> for<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.170> because<00:01:40.530> it's<00:01:40.680> almost

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
that much for this because it's almost

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.800 
that much for this because it's almost
as<00:01:41.130> much<00:01:41.280> as<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:42.030> makeup<00:01:42.630> forever

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
just gonna get started on this hair I

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.539 
just gonna get started on this hair I
think<00:01:49.140> it'll<00:01:49.409> work<00:01:49.500> pretty<00:01:49.799> well<00:01:49.890> on<00:01:50.159> my<00:01:50.310> hair

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
think it'll work pretty well on my hair

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.340 
think it'll work pretty well on my hair
because<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:51.149> do<00:01:51.210> have<00:01:51.360> highlights<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
because I do have highlights on the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.149 
because I do have highlights on the
bottom<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.210> I<00:01:54.210> have<00:01:54.600> had<00:01:54.810> good<00:01:55.290> experiences

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
bottom and I have had good experiences

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.460 
bottom and I have had good experiences
in<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.759> past<00:01:56.909> with<00:01:57.180> having<00:01:57.509> dark<00:01:57.719> hair<00:01:57.780> and

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
in the past with having dark hair and

in the past with having dark hair and
using<00:01:58.710> hair<00:01:58.860> chalk<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.400> I<00:01:59.430> don't<00:01:59.640> think<00:01:59.820> it's

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
using hair chalk so I don't think it's

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:01.820 
using hair chalk so I don't think it's

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
silver is kind of weird iris which is a

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.390 
silver is kind of weird iris which is a
very<00:02:25.770> pretty<00:02:26.220> kind<00:02:26.640> of<00:02:26.820> periwinkle<00:02:27.450> color<00:02:28.400> do

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
preference but I'm just using this

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.370 
preference but I'm just using this
because<00:03:12.239> it's<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.450> cute<00:03:12.600> little<00:03:12.750> mini<00:03:12.959> bottle

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.910 

something<00:03:39.780> I<00:03:39.870> think<00:03:39.930> that<00:03:40.140> would<00:03:40.590> be<00:03:40.620> really

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.759 
something I think that would be really
cool<00:03:41.190> for<00:03:41.459> this<00:03:41.610> is<00:03:41.909> to<00:03:42.629> wear<00:03:43.049> it<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.379> like<00:03:43.620> a
