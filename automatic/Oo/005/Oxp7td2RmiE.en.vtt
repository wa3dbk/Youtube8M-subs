00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
of this is pretty much pointless though

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.889 
of this is pretty much pointless though
unless<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:01.649> add<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:01.980> health<00:01:02.340> team<00:01:02.699> um<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.750> can

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
unless you add a health team um you can

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.479 
unless you add a health team um you can
go<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.170> here<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.409> add<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> new<00:01:04.860> practice<00:01:05.100> if

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
go in here and add a new practice if

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.420 
go in here and add a new practice if
you'd<00:01:05.610> like<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.420> deal<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:07.439> don't

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
you'd like and the deal is you don't

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.429 
you'd like and the deal is you don't
have<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.939> have<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> practice<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.659> uses<00:01:10.110> max

calm<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:10.950> basically<00:01:11.250> you're<00:01:11.369> not<00:01:11.430> going<00:01:11.640> to

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
calm but basically you're not going to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.830 
calm but basically you're not going to
get<00:01:11.790> much<00:01:11.880> out<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.210> application<00:01:12.630> list

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
get much out of the application list

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.109 
get much out of the application list
they<00:01:13.020> do<00:01:13.080> too<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:14.100> if<00:01:14.220> your<00:01:14.340> doctor<00:01:14.520> happens<00:01:15.030> to

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
on the initial front load and then you

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.730 
on the initial front load and then you
can<00:03:04.230> go<00:03:04.380> in<00:03:04.530> later<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.100> then<00:03:05.340> add<00:03:06.030> things<00:03:06.810> if

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.210 
started and they have a basically

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:32.480 
started and they have a basically
recondition<00:03:30.810> under<00:03:30.990> the<00:03:31.080> Sun<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.470> course<00:03:31.800> so

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:32.490 
recondition under the Sun of course so

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.510 
recondition under the Sun of course so
no<00:03:33.090> lack<00:03:33.810> of<00:03:33.840> Florida<00:03:34.530> wanting<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:35.100> guess<00:03:35.280> I

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
no lack of Florida wanting I guess I

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.150 
no lack of Florida wanting I guess I
suppose<00:03:35.970> there<00:03:36.440> I'm<00:03:37.440> aside<00:03:37.740> from<00:03:37.830> that<00:03:37.920> you've

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
suppose there I'm aside from that you've

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.650 
suppose there I'm aside from that you've
also<00:03:38.280> got<00:03:38.490> medications<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:39.210> allergies<00:03:39.270> that

also got medications and allergies that

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.570 
also got medications and allergies that
you<00:03:39.900> gain<00:03:40.050> same<00:03:40.320> thing<00:03:40.560> loaded<00:03:40.800> database<00:03:41.280> tell

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
you gain same thing loaded database tell

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.190 
you gain same thing loaded database tell
em<00:03:41.640> what<00:03:41.730> you<00:03:41.850> got<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.240> then<00:03:42.360> you're<00:03:42.510> done<00:03:42.540> so

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
em what you got and then you're done so

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.690 
em what you got and then you're done so
essentially<00:03:43.500> you're<00:03:43.650> compiling<00:03:43.950> a<00:03:44.190> gigantic

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
essentially you're compiling a gigantic

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.730 
essentially you're compiling a gigantic
health<00:03:44.910> profile<00:03:45.360> in<00:03:45.540> history<00:03:45.960> of<00:03:46.200> your<00:03:46.530> health

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
health profile in history of your health

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.130 
health profile in history of your health
which<00:03:47.670> is<00:03:47.820> that<00:03:47.970> automatically<00:03:48.540> synced<00:03:48.990> up

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
which is that automatically synced up

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.900 
which is that automatically synced up
with<00:03:49.200> your<00:03:49.560> practice<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:50.190> they<00:03:50.310> can<00:03:50.490> go<00:03:50.640> in<00:03:50.790> at

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
with your practice so they can go in at

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.340 
with your practice so they can go in at
any<00:03:51.090> point<00:03:51.330> in<00:03:51.450> time<00:03:51.480> using<00:03:51.810> their<00:03:52.050> iPhones

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
any point in time using their iPhones

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.470 
any point in time using their iPhones
find<00:03:52.740> you<00:03:52.950> find<00:03:53.490> out<00:03:53.670> what's<00:03:53.850> going<00:03:53.910> on<00:03:54.240> and

find you find out what's going on and

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.210 
find you find out what's going on and
you're<00:03:54.780> good<00:03:54.990> to<00:03:55.020> go<00:03:55.140> if<00:03:55.590> you<00:03:55.950> have<00:03:56.070> any
