00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
from Bayer dynamics now and it comes in

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.380 
from Bayer dynamics now and it comes in
this<00:00:33.929> really<00:00:33.989> cool<00:00:35.120> you<00:00:36.120> know<00:00:38.030> carrying<00:00:39.030> case

this really cool you know carrying case
and<00:00:39.989> would<00:00:40.620> an<00:00:41.010> instruction<00:00:41.489> manual<00:00:41.910> and

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
and would an instruction manual and

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.029 
and would an instruction manual and
everything<00:00:42.449> it's<00:00:42.629> actually<00:00:43.019> pretty<00:00:43.170> cool<00:00:43.410> now

a few things to note about the MMX 300

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:48.470 
a few things to note about the MMX 300
that<00:00:46.890> makes<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.219> stand<00:00:47.429> out<00:00:47.670> from<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.239> rest

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
that makes it stand out from the rest

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.619 
that makes it stand out from the rest
now<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.780> MMX<00:00:49.230> 300<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.280> actually<00:00:50.820> designed<00:00:51.239> to

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
now the MMX 300 is actually designed to

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.579 
now the MMX 300 is actually designed to
actually<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.739> know<00:00:52.769> give<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.929> the<00:00:54.929> minimal

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
you have this headset on playing a game

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.300 
you have this headset on playing a game
now<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.720> have<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.229> have<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.409> specify<00:01:10.770> that

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
now I have to I have to specify that

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.210 
now I have to I have to specify that
this<00:01:11.490> headset<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.119> not<00:01:12.750> powered<00:01:13.530> headset<00:01:14.009> you

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
this headset is not powered headset you

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.490 
this headset is not powered headset you
just<00:01:14.399> have<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.880> regular<00:01:15.259> people<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.290> five

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
just have a regular people on five

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.889 
just have a regular people on five
millimeter<00:01:16.950> Jack<00:01:17.219> for<00:01:17.490> your<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:18.270> believe<00:01:18.750> this

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
millimeter Jack for your I believe this

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.450 
millimeter Jack for your I believe this
is<00:01:19.049> for<00:01:19.320> your<00:01:19.590> audio<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.880> your<00:01:21.600> microphone

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
is for your audio and your microphone

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.980 
is for your audio and your microphone
but<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.579> design<00:01:23.939> itself<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.689> weight<00:01:24.840> is

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
but the design itself the weight is

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.149 
but the design itself the weight is
designed<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.469> close<00:01:25.710> back<00:01:25.979> design

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
designed this close back design

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.630 
designed this close back design
basically<00:01:27.229> enables<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.469> to<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.610> know

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
basically enables you to you know

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.179 
basically enables you to you know
eliminate<00:01:30.390> all<00:01:30.899> of<00:01:31.229> all<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.680> noises<00:01:31.920> that

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
eliminate all of all the noises that

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.550 
eliminate all of all the noises that
would<00:01:32.310> otherwise<00:01:32.670> distract<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.450> now<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.320> as

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
would otherwise distract you now this as

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.730 
would otherwise distract you now this as
I<00:01:34.680> said<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:34.979> was<00:01:35.130> designed<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:36.270> give<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
I said this was designed to give you the

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.730 
I said this was designed to give you the
you<00:01:38.430> know<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.570> least<00:01:39.750> amounts<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.320> ambient

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
you know the least amounts of ambient

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.300 
you know the least amounts of ambient
noise<00:01:41.479> how<00:01:42.479> but<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.439> order<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.649> do<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.130> what

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
noise how but in order to do that what

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.740 
noise how but in order to do that what
they<00:01:44.399> had<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.700> do<00:01:44.820> with<00:01:45.000> basically<00:01:45.390> design

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
they had to do with basically design

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.370 
they had to do with basically design
this<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.140> work<00:01:47.060> basically<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.509> cockpit<00:01:48.960> it

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
this to work basically in the cockpit it

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.880 
this to work basically in the cockpit it
was<00:01:49.560> designed<00:01:50.100> for<00:01:50.600> aviation<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:51.780> took<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
was designed for aviation it took the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.649 
was designed for aviation it took the
lessons<00:01:53.340> learned<00:01:53.579> from<00:01:53.729> aviation<00:01:54.180> headset

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
lessons learned from aviation headset

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.260 
lessons learned from aviation headset
designs<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.469> applied<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.009> this<00:01:56.369> gaming

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
designs and applied it to this gaming

that is both comfortable functional and
depending<00:02:08.520> on<00:02:08.640> what<00:02:08.850> your<00:02:08.970> price<00:02:09.240> range<00:02:09.270> is

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
depending on what your price range is

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
volume to me it was really difficult to

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.870 
volume to me it was really difficult to
hear<00:02:53.810> them<00:02:53.989> simply<00:02:54.380> because<00:02:54.500> you<00:02:55.250> know<00:02:55.370> the

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
hear them simply because you know the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.500

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
sound is so immersive and the you know

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.850 
sound is so immersive and the you know
just<00:02:59.959> the<00:03:00.470> design<00:03:00.890> of<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.760> cups<00:03:02.030> are<00:03:02.470> just<00:03:03.470> so

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
just the design of the cups are just so

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.400 
just the design of the cups are just so
economically<00:03:04.670> sound<00:03:05.330> that<00:03:05.810> it<00:03:05.989> covers<00:03:06.380> the

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
economically sound that it covers the

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.960 
economically sound that it covers the
entire<00:03:06.650> ear<00:03:07.550> without<00:03:07.970> really<00:03:08.360> even<00:03:08.690> any<00:03:09.410> space

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
entire ear without really even any space

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.900 
entire ear without really even any space
you<00:03:11.080> know<00:03:12.080> to<00:03:12.140> have<00:03:12.470> that<00:03:12.530> ambient<00:03:13.340> sound<00:03:13.610> come
