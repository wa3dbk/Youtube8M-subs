animal<00:00:33.350> twist<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.590> out<00:00:34.880> so<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:35.910> get<00:00:36.210> once<00:00:36.510> and

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
animal twist it out so you get once and

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.310 
animal twist it out so you get once and
separated<00:00:38.059> put<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.239> short<00:00:39.600> end<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.020> Rope

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
separated put the short end of the Rope

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.240 
separated put the short end of the Rope
through<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:42.079> strand<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.440> make<00:00:43.620> an<00:00:43.770> eye<00:00:43.950> loop

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
through the strand to make an eye loop

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.790 
through the strand to make an eye loop
just<00:00:44.550> like<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.690> loop<00:00:46.050> should<00:00:46.289> be<00:00:46.530> about

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
just like this the loop should be about

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.360 
just like this the loop should be about
twice<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.219> size<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.000> rope<00:00:48.739> now<00:00:49.739> separate

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
twice the size of the rope now separate

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.670 
twice the size of the rope now separate
two<00:00:50.670> more<00:00:50.940> strands<00:00:51.329> from<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.079> short<00:00:52.350> end<00:00:52.530> of

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
two more strands from the short end of

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.270 
two more strands from the short end of
the<00:00:52.739> rope<00:00:53.070> next<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.940> one<00:00:54.120> strand<00:00:55.160> put<00:00:56.160> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the rope next to the one strand put the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.729 
the rope next to the one strand put the
long<00:00:56.520> end<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.090> rope<00:00:59.510> through<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:01.710> make

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
long end of the rope through it to make

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:16.490 
long end of the rope through it to make
a<00:01:02.190> smooth<00:01:02.820> side<00:01:03.149> of<00:01:03.449> three<00:01:03.989> strands<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:15.500> like

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
a smooth side of three strands just like

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.300 
a smooth side of three strands just like
this<00:01:17.479> now<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.540> want<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> make<00:01:19.320> three<00:01:19.740> loops<00:01:20.100> at

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
this now you want to make three loops at

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.370 
this now you want to make three loops at
the<00:01:20.460> short<00:01:20.759> end<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.210> rope<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.930> do<00:01:22.110> that

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the short end of the rope to do that

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.039 
the short end of the rope to do that
twist<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.310> push<00:01:23.850> together<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.750> three

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
twist and push together so the three

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.590 
twist and push together so the three
strands<00:01:25.439> separate<00:01:25.920> twist<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.060> opposite

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
strands separate twist in opposite

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.539 
strands separate twist in opposite
directions<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.470> make<00:01:29.130> three<00:01:29.549> loops<00:01:31.280> now<00:01:32.280> put

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
directions to make three loops now put

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:52.990 
directions to make three loops now put
the<00:01:32.700> long<00:01:32.939> end<00:01:33.210> of<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.509> rope<00:01:34.790> through<00:01:35.790> them

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.719 

this<00:01:54.000> forms<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.890> headband<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.190> goes<00:01:56.399> across

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
this forms the headband that goes across

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:09.229 
this forms the headband that goes across
the<00:01:57.119> back<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.630> head<00:02:07.550> now<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.610> make<00:02:09.030> the
