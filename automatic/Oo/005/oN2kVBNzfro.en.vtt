00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.770 
so today we're talking about the
gravedigger<00:00:02.010> fly<00:00:02.760> that's<00:00:02.970> worked<00:00:03.179> really

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
gravedigger fly that's worked really

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:04.400 
gravedigger fly that's worked really
well<00:00:03.870> for<00:00:04.020> us

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
well for us

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.980 
well for us
yeah<00:00:05.279> last<00:00:05.609> year<00:00:05.790> when<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.299> water<00:00:06.600> levels

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
yeah last year when the water levels

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.500 
yeah last year when the water levels
were<00:00:07.049> high<00:00:07.379> locally<00:00:08.069> it<00:00:08.340> really<00:00:09.000> cleaned<00:00:09.300> up

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
were high locally it really cleaned up

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.339 
were high locally it really cleaned up
yeah<00:00:10.380> it<00:00:10.800> really<00:00:10.920> did<00:00:11.099> good<00:00:11.340> I<00:00:11.519> think<00:00:11.849> maybe

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:12.349 
yeah it really did good I think maybe

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.289 
yeah it really did good I think maybe
one<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.500> reasons<00:00:13.799> why<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.009> because<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:15.179> was

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
one of the reasons why is because it was

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.689 
one of the reasons why is because it was
just<00:00:15.540> got<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:15.960> big<00:00:16.320> huge<00:00:16.650> size<00:00:17.010> for<00:00:17.310> mosquito

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
yeah I'm northern brothers exactly I

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:35.699 
yeah I'm northern brothers exactly I
like<00:02:33.970> what<00:02:34.209> you<00:02:34.330> do<00:02:34.480> with<00:02:34.660> your<00:02:34.690> yarn<00:02:34.989> before

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
like what you do with your yarn before

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:36.809 
like what you do with your yarn before
you<00:02:35.799> put<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.010> on<00:02:36.069> the<00:02:36.190> body<00:02:36.310> you<00:02:36.519> give<00:02:36.640> it<00:02:36.760> a

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
you put it on the body you give it a

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.449 
you put it on the body you give it a
couple<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.120> those<00:02:37.239> spins<00:02:37.569> yeah<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:39.160> spins

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
couple of those spins yeah and the spins

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.410 
couple of those spins yeah and the spins
there<00:02:39.940> I<00:02:40.299> think<00:02:40.660> do<00:02:41.470> do<00:02:41.799> two<00:02:42.430> things<00:02:42.610> one<00:02:42.940> they

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
there I think do do two things one they

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.050 
there I think do do two things one they
help<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.780> segment<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.290> little<00:02:44.650> bit<00:02:44.940> but<00:02:45.940> the

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
help the segment a little bit but the

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.670 
help the segment a little bit but the
reason<00:02:46.269> why<00:02:46.390> I<00:02:46.420> do<00:02:46.569> it<00:02:46.780> most<00:02:47.079> of<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.260> time<00:02:47.470> is

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
reason why I do it most of the time is

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.800 
reason why I do it most of the time is
just<00:02:47.709> to<00:02:48.099> make<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.310> more<00:02:48.579> robust<00:02:49.000> fly<00:02:49.299> that<00:02:49.660> can

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
just to make a more robust fly that can

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.229 
just to make a more robust fly that can
just<00:02:49.989> get<00:02:50.170> beat<00:02:50.769> up<00:02:51.010> and<00:02:51.310> have<00:02:51.670> those<00:02:51.849> little

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
just get beat up and have those little

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.789 
just get beat up and have those little
yarn<00:02:52.870> pieces<00:02:53.500> kinda<00:02:54.190> stay<00:02:54.489> yeah<00:02:55.000> there<00:02:55.769> yeah

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
yarn pieces kinda stay yeah there yeah

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.690 
yarn pieces kinda stay yeah there yeah
and<00:02:58.140> either<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.319> fly<00:02:59.500> is<00:02:59.560> kind<00:03:00.459> of<00:03:00.489> cool

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
and either the fly is kind of cool

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.080 
and either the fly is kind of cool
because<00:03:00.790> as<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:02.500> flight<00:03:02.709> gets<00:03:02.950> beat<00:03:03.160> up<00:03:03.370> the

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
because as the flight gets beat up the

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.110 
because as the flight gets beat up the
UV<00:03:04.780> chartreuse<00:03:05.709> thread<00:03:06.040> starts<00:03:06.640> showing

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
UV chartreuse thread starts showing

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.940 
UV chartreuse thread starts showing
through<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:07.720> it<00:03:07.840> kind<00:03:08.019> of<00:03:08.049> gives<00:03:08.230> it<00:03:08.379> a<00:03:08.650> whole

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
through and it kind of gives it a whole

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.729 
through and it kind of gives it a whole
new<00:03:09.129> life<00:03:09.340> yeah<00:03:09.760> almost<00:03:10.209> looks<00:03:10.599> blue<00:03:11.290> I<00:03:11.620> mean

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:24.609 
sure that they're really clamp in there

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.509 
sure that they're really clamp in there
and<00:03:25.540> don't<00:03:25.780> stab<00:03:26.049> yourself<00:03:26.290> either<00:03:27.069> with<00:03:27.340> that

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
and don't stab yourself either with that

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.150 
and don't stab yourself either with that
hook

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
hook

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.449 
hook
but<00:03:30.160> yeah<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.269> UV<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:32.109> the<00:03:32.769> thread<00:03:33.099> I

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
but yeah the the UV of the thread I

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.589 
but yeah the the UV of the thread I
think<00:03:33.940> is<00:03:34.120> really<00:03:35.019> good<00:03:35.290> it<00:03:36.299> gives<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:37.419> fish

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:37.599 
think is really good it gives the fish

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:39.120 
think is really good it gives the fish
something<00:03:37.840> to<00:03:38.109> look<00:03:38.260> at<00:03:38.440> and<00:03:38.650> who<00:03:38.799> knows<00:03:38.980> maybe
