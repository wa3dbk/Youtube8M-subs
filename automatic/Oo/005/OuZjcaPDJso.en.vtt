now if you take a look you see very very
dense<00:02:12.010> thin<00:02:13.010> structure<00:02:13.490> typically<00:02:14.390> that<00:02:14.510> is

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
dense thin structure typically that is

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.750 
dense thin structure typically that is
associated<00:02:15.320> with<00:02:15.350> radiators<00:02:16.190> that<00:02:16.220> perform

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
associated with radiators that perform

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.320 
associated with radiators that perform
better<00:02:16.790> with<00:02:17.180> higher<00:02:17.450> rpm<00:02:18.459> fans<00:02:19.459> however<00:02:20.030> the

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
better with higher rpm fans however the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.170 
better with higher rpm fans however the
e<00:02:20.360> X<00:02:20.660> 240<00:02:21.230> is<00:02:21.560> actually<00:02:22.100> optimized<00:02:22.640> for<00:02:22.910> lower

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
e X 240 is actually optimized for lower

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.550 
e X 240 is actually optimized for lower
rpm<00:02:23.780> efficiency

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
rpm efficiency

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.350 
rpm efficiency
it's<00:02:24.860> got<00:02:25.100> unique<00:02:25.489> heat<00:02:26.000> dissipation

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
it's got unique heat dissipation

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.690 
it's got unique heat dissipation
characteristics<00:02:27.350> that<00:02:27.769> actually<00:02:28.160> facilitate

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
characteristics that actually facilitate

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.030 
characteristics that actually facilitate
this<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:29.360> at<00:02:29.510> lower<00:02:29.720> rpms<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.500> are<00:02:30.709> going<00:02:30.950> to

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
this so at lower rpms you are going to

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.970 
this so at lower rpms you are going to
get<00:02:31.220> better<00:02:31.550> cooling<00:02:32.000> that<00:02:32.209> you<00:02:32.330> will<00:02:32.980> with

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
get better cooling that you will with

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.800 
get better cooling that you will with
other<00:02:34.220> radiators<00:02:34.880> now<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:36.970> X<00:02:37.970> 240<00:02:38.330> does<00:02:38.660> use

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
other radiators now the X 240 does use

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.330 
other radiators now the X 240 does use

split fins it has unique soldering used

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.160 
split fins it has unique soldering used
in<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.730> construction<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.450> enhance<00:02:44.870> heat

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170

really phenomenal coin at lower rpms on
the<00:03:47.849> fans<00:03:48.090> what<00:03:48.750> does<00:03:48.870> this<00:03:48.959> translate<00:03:49.200> to

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
the fans what does this translate to

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.539 
the fans what does this translate to
