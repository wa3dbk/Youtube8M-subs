mocked<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:13.849> here<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> model<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:16.039> we<00:00:17.039> have

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
mocked and here is a model of it we have

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.300 
mocked and here is a model of it we have
the<00:00:17.609> standard<00:00:19.039> 128<00:00:20.039> millimeter<00:00:20.460> gun<00:00:22.130> we<00:00:23.130> have

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
the standard 128 millimeter gun we have

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:31.510 
the standard 128 millimeter gun we have
the<00:00:24.380> enormous<00:00:25.380> 40<00:00:26.369> or<00:00:26.670> 50<00:00:27.090> ton<00:00:27.359> turret<00:00:30.410> with

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
the enormous 40 or 50 ton turret with

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:40.030 
the enormous 40 or 50 ton turret with
what<00:00:32.520> appears<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:32.969> be<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.149> commander's<00:00:33.719> cupola

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.670 

which<00:00:41.040> would<00:00:41.280> be<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:42.379> then<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.530> have<00:00:43.620> a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
which would be this then you have a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.799 
which would be this then you have a
periscope<00:00:44.190> dry<00:00:44.910> rectum<00:00:45.239> would<00:00:45.390> be<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:47.809> yep

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
periscope dry rectum would be this yep

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.430 
periscope dry rectum would be this yep
see<00:00:49.350> there<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.680> periscope<00:00:50.489> orifice<00:00:51.480> right

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
see there is the periscope orifice right

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.310 
see there is the periscope orifice right
there<00:00:53.180> that<00:00:54.180> is<00:00:54.360> pretty<00:00:54.600> neat<00:00:56.930> the<00:00:57.930> turret

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
there that is pretty neat the turret

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.080 
there that is pretty neat the turret
shape<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.890> different<00:00:59.070> from<00:00:59.370> what<00:00:59.609> I'm<00:00:59.699> used<00:00:59.730> to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
shape is different from what I'm used to

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.520 
shape is different from what I'm used to
it<00:01:02.449> was<00:01:03.449> supposed<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.170> something<00:01:04.379> that

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
it was supposed to be something that

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.370 
it was supposed to be something that
resembled<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.369> mouse<00:01:05.610> turf<00:01:06.090> but<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.750> seems<00:01:07.140> to

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
resembled a mouse turf but this seems to

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.820 
resembled a mouse turf but this seems to
have<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> different<00:01:08.549> structural<00:01:09.830> composition

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
have a different structural composition

have a different structural composition
or<00:01:12.080> different<00:01:13.080> construct

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.300 

there's<00:01:16.420> your<00:01:16.660> islets<00:01:17.380> or<00:01:17.590> hooks<00:01:18.360> on<00:01:19.360> turret

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
there's your islets or hooks on turret

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.660 
there's your islets or hooks on turret

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
links or camouflage get the rear port of

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.160

some<00:01:32.380> type<00:01:32.590> in<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:33.820> turret<00:01:35.670> see<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.930> kind<00:01:38.140> of

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
some type in the turret see just kind of

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.680 
some type in the turret see just kind of
like<00:01:38.290> a<00:01:38.940> is<00:01:39.940> a<00:01:40.590> turret<00:01:41.590> Traverse<00:01:42.130> but<00:01:42.690> it's

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
like a is a turret Traverse but it's

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.120 
like a is a turret Traverse but it's
kind<00:01:43.900> of<00:01:43.930> like<00:01:44.200> a<00:01:44.260> sticky<00:01:44.650> turret<00:01:45.160> Traverse<00:01:45.520> oh

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
kind of like a sticky turret Traverse oh

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.850 
kind of like a sticky turret Traverse oh
well<00:01:51.240> okay<00:01:52.240> now<00:01:52.509> for<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:52.840> hull<00:01:53.140> got<00:01:53.710> the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
well okay now for the hull got the

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.260 
well okay now for the hull got the
engine<00:01:54.009> deck<00:01:54.369> I<00:01:56.580> reckon<00:01:57.580> that<00:01:57.729> there<00:01:57.880> was<00:01:58.000> some

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
engine deck I reckon that there was some

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.749 
engine deck I reckon that there was some
type<00:01:58.479> of<00:01:58.509> heavier<00:01:59.430> Maybach<00:02:00.430> engine<00:02:01.410> construct

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
type of heavier Maybach engine construct

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.070 
type of heavier Maybach engine construct

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
power pack outgoing here and you have

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:18.210 
power pack outgoing here and you have
the<00:02:11.459> exhaust<00:02:12.459> pipes<00:02:15.239> there<00:02:17.220> reminiscent<00:02:18.220> of

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
the exhaust pipes there reminiscent of

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.870 
the exhaust pipes there reminiscent of
also<00:02:18.820> like<00:02:19.150> Panther<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:19.900> tiger<00:02:20.880> exhaust

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
also like Panther and tiger exhaust
