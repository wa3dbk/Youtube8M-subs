couple reviews where people have

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.569 
couple reviews where people have

seems<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.150> work<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.570> as<00:01:24.960> well<00:01:25.310> but<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.490> was

this<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.600> knows<00:01:31.380> how<00:01:31.619> good<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:32.009> works<00:01:32.220> I've

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
this and knows how good it works I've

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.760 
this and knows how good it works I've
also<00:01:32.850> seen<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.270> couple<00:01:33.659> people<00:01:33.840> including<00:01:34.590> one

R 12 substitute I know back in the 90s
they<00:02:38.740> used<00:02:38.920> to<00:02:39.040> make<00:02:39.600> R<00:02:40.600> 12<00:02:40.930> substitutes<00:02:41.740> that

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
they used to make R 12 substitutes that

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:46.170 
they used to make R 12 substitutes that
were<00:02:43.020> other<00:02:44.020> gases<00:02:44.950> like<00:02:45.190> butane<00:02:45.820> and

were other gases like butane and

were other gases like butane and
sometimes<00:02:47.140> propane<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:47.920> were<00:02:48.370> very

sometimes propane that were very

sometimes propane that were very

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
inexpensive but explosive I don't know

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.410 
inexpensive but explosive I don't know
if<00:02:53.230> they're<00:02:53.440> still<00:02:53.830> doing<00:02:54.220> that<00:02:54.430> probably<00:02:55.210> not

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
if they're still doing that probably not

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.740 
if they're still doing that probably not
but<00:02:56.250> they<00:02:57.250> had<00:02:57.430> generic<00:02:57.910> names<00:02:58.150> like<00:02:58.360> freeze

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
but they had generic names like freeze

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.949 
but they had generic names like freeze
on<00:02:59.020> and<00:02:59.590> I<00:03:00.300> think<00:03:01.300> there's<00:03:01.480> another<00:03:01.540> one

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
on and I think there's another one

on and I think there's another one
