00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
of time defending I I don't look at all

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.270

the statements to come out and say well
I'm<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.760> Catholic<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:30.510> therefore<00:02:30.959> I've<00:02:31.080> got<00:02:31.290> to

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
I'm a Catholic so therefore I've got to

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.980 
I'm a Catholic so therefore I've got to
defend<00:02:31.650> him<00:02:31.860> know<00:02:32.069> I<00:02:32.360> used<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:33.480> leave<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:33.840> to

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
defend him know I used to leave that to

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.390 
defend him know I used to leave that to
others<00:02:34.020> people<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.800> have<00:02:34.890> since<00:02:35.100> moved<00:02:35.340> on

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
others people that have since moved on

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.449 
others people that have since moved on
to<00:02:35.880> other<00:02:36.090> religions<00:02:36.560> but<00:02:37.560> let<00:02:38.069> me<00:02:38.100> just<00:02:38.220> say

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
to other religions but let me just say

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.710 
to other religions but let me just say
this<00:02:39.260> Mahmoud<00:02:40.260> Abbas<00:02:40.400> could<00:02:41.400> be<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.970> man<00:02:42.569> of

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
this Mahmoud Abbas could be a man of

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.370 
this Mahmoud Abbas could be a man of
peace<00:02:43.040> but<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.130> not<00:02:44.340> necessarily<00:02:45.270> a<00:02:45.630> man<00:02:46.200> of

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
peace but is not necessarily a man of

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.010 
peace but is not necessarily a man of
peace<00:02:46.560> right<00:02:46.860> now<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:48.060> what<00:02:48.240> makes<00:02:48.450> more<00:02:48.720> sense

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
peace right now so what makes more sense

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.960 
peace right now so what makes more sense
does<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.680> make<00:02:49.800> more<00:02:50.190> sense<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.670> Pope

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
does it make more sense that Pope

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.090 
does it make more sense that Pope
Francis<00:02:51.000> said<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.050> him<00:02:52.170> in<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.440> in<00:02:52.620> a<00:02:52.920> bit<00:02:53.069> of
