00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.330

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.440

 approximately 1.20 gigas or so 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.860
 because good is complete in all the 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.820
 game I have not uploaded mega for me so 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.820
 let's start 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:10.080
 [Music] 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:18.369
 I do not want to know them I show the 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.520
 first click process because as I said are 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.659
 four parts so there will be four and one 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.369
 Once you click on any of the 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.729
 links will offer you this page where 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.500
 we should wait 5 seconds is not that 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.929
 this is over skip this yellow button 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.360
 which is high publicity , we are going to give you a 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.549
 stand up and start loading what the page 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.560
 of league as it is also on your screen 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.370
 once here we should only wait for 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.730
 I finished loading the page 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.550
 like the one that finished loading and we'll see 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:51.990
 download files same 14 and we're going to 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:54.180
 be me part 1,350 mind we click on 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.990
 download and be automatically 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.810
 discharge nor regularly diamond 550 and 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.550
 150 kilobytes per second but the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.130
 dependent download speed 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.049
 Internet 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.679
 and this is the same process for 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.659
 other beings 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.370
 once you download the four parts 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:14.950
 they are going to nothing have been saved in my 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.120
 case of batteries have this folder what 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:23.510
 we'll see up to 14 I have 142 part 4 and 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.299
 These are all personally 350 each 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.519
 we just need to select the four 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.709
 parts right click on any of these 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.980
 four parts and extract files or 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:41.000
 exceeding here is the same but I'm going to 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:43.940
 extract the file a 14 has been extracted 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.769
 as you will see even in iso format and 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.780
 obviously we see until I get to 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:51.709
 100% of the starter bar and without 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.200
 process tells me that it lasts more or less 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.540
 two and a half minutes but also this 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.269
 It depends 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.769
 your computer while I do the 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.769
 video to not lengthen so much 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.300
 [Music] 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.120
 well here it's almost finished but 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:20.250
 take advantage of this small time to 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.660
 tell them they occupy the program 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.950
 installed if you do not have it 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.950
 in this video 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.810
 well here I finish to extract and so 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.780
 that will introduce my desktop because I 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.150
 there are selections that will be extracted once 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.400
 here we will find the files in 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.740
 a text document that is called more 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.280
 power for feet that this one if we like 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:47.380
 read then they open it and I thank you and 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.550
 You can visit these pages for more 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.440
 games 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.760
 good but what matters is this 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.190
 point and sun file that is 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.620
 selected and we were told then how 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.720
 sergio point did return to a point of 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.420
 interleague 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.280
 this simply gives you right click 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.590
 copy and paste it into the folder and that's what 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.020
 prevents this week that is up 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.060
 obviously his foot style is refugee 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.770
 so you can read the game if not 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.800

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.109
 peak version 6.60 or lower and I tried and 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.780
 is that for my taste but one of the 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.730
 better cases and this would be all friends
