00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 hello everyone with sky and in the comments 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.310
 under my first tutorial me very 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.910
 asked a lot how to use 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.889
 how to buy a paraglider and how much 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.889
 in general, it is worth it today to show you 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.639
 what you need to appear paraglider and where 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.639
 general buy 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.390
 so the main thing for the paraglider is 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.450
 to pump up the flight skill , that is, we press 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.880
 on x and here we have first line 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.560
 should appear climbing what should we 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.750
 roll on the five that is to crawl on 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.760
 walls speed and endurance before and 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.980
 after this post pyaterochka here we have 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.320
 the opportunity to download flights 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.370
 flight need to say well though 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.879
 would be a deuce and then you can 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.800
 more or less already fly why are we 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.660
 you will need about the plan itself as if 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.120
 click on and i have it here in 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.360
 line hurry and you can buy it in 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.379
 shop here so I do not even know 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:04.129
 what is it to throw the bag go here and 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:05.900
 here it is our paraglider more precisely here it stands 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.659
 he is only ten silver on theirs 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.120
 how you can accumulate them very quickly and 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.130
 it is very effective that is you can 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.290
 come down from the mountain and not 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.340
 spend the slightest hop 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.340
 I'll show you now 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.720
 let's try faces and so typical 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.700
 situation you breathe some kind of mountains 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.860
 from there being bosses and you 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.060
 abruptly ends hp and mana and khelki then 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.400
 you can eat from him faster 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.740
 avoid whether you run the end of the mountain and here 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.259
 it turns out to be open to escape from 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.090
 him you need to click on g and jump 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.560
 now from i hold punched then i 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.360
 rise up but as soon as his 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.280
 letting go we about the plan starts slowly 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.710
 fall don't delay it 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.869
 with buttons a and d so that he does not whirl and 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.880
 You can also align it with a space, but 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.600
 unfortunately she is not regenerated 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.580
 stamina until you land a battle 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.470
 now lost control and fell and how 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.950
 see we hp not lost me decided 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.920
 choked I fell out of fact 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.269
 tree well or somewhere in front of him so 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.250
 what about plant is a very useful thing 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.190
 buy sure it will be useful to you 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.230
 and you can also buy you a boat if you 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.610
 hit the ocean unfortunately me with you 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.830
 no, because as long as we are not afloat 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.690
 but she also very quickly gives you gives 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.100
 you are very fast moving around 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.330
 thanks for watching you was 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.330
