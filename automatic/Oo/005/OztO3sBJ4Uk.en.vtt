00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
much higher angle we're going to end up

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.270

the knife

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.350

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
however because we're using a higher

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.590 
however because we're using a higher
angle<00:01:33.600> we're<00:01:34.200> going<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.380> end<00:01:34.530> up<00:01:34.680> with<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> more

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
angle we're going to end up with a more

for<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.970> once<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.750> get<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:39.990> burr<00:01:40.320> we're<00:01:41.070> going

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
for that once you get a burr we're going

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.039 
for that once you get a burr we're going

because<00:01:56.380> you<00:01:56.560> already<00:01:56.770> got<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.070> burr<00:01:57.250> so<00:01:57.520> you

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
because you already got the burr so you

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.290 
because you already got the burr so you
don't<00:01:57.790> need<00:01:57.910> to<00:01:58.030> overwork<00:01:58.390> the<00:01:58.600> knife<00:01:58.750> and

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
don't need to overwork the knife and

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.730 
don't need to overwork the knife and
then<00:02:01.300> you're<00:02:01.450> ready<00:02:01.660> to<00:02:01.720> flip<00:02:01.990> over<00:02:02.170> to<00:02:02.650> the

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
then you're ready to flip over to the

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.880 
then you're ready to flip over to the

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
to get a burn much quicker because we're

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.300 
to get a burn much quicker because we're
using<00:02:44.830> a<00:02:45.010> higher<00:02:45.220> angle<00:02:45.630> if<00:02:46.950> you<00:02:47.950> don't<00:02:48.130> get<00:02:48.250> a

using a higher angle if you don't get a

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.120 
using a higher angle if you don't get a
burr<00:02:48.520> on<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.940> first<00:02:49.150> try<00:02:49.590> just<00:02:50.590> keep<00:02:50.830> going

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
burr on the first try just keep going

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.520 
burr on the first try just keep going
until<00:02:51.280> you<00:02:51.520> do<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:51.990> when<00:02:52.990> you're<00:02:53.110> doing<00:02:53.410> this

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
until you do and when you're doing this

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.170 
until you do and when you're doing this
you<00:02:53.770> want<00:02:53.950> to<00:02:54.010> make<00:02:54.160> sure<00:02:54.190> that<00:02:54.520> you<00:02:54.640> keep<00:02:54.910> the

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
you want to make sure that you keep the

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.229 
you want to make sure that you keep the
seven<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:56.020> three<00:02:56.230> ratio<00:02:56.530> so<00:02:57.280> for<00:02:57.489> every<00:02:57.730> three

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
seven to three ratio so for every three

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.960 
seven to three ratio so for every three
strokes<00:02:58.480> you<00:02:58.690> do<00:02:58.840> on<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.110> back<00:02:59.730> you<00:03:00.730> want<00:03:00.910> to

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
strokes you do on the back you want to

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.780 
strokes you do on the back you want to
do<00:03:01.090> seven<00:03:01.510> on<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:02.830> front<00:03:04.739> now<00:03:05.739> once<00:03:06.489> you<00:03:06.610> get<00:03:06.730> a

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
do seven on the front now once you get a

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.000 
do seven on the front now once you get a
bird<00:03:07.060> just<00:03:07.959> like<00:03:08.110> we<00:03:08.230> did<00:03:08.380> on<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.590> back<00:03:08.709> side

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
bird just like we did on the back side

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.920 
bird just like we did on the back side
because<00:03:09.459> we<00:03:09.850> started<00:03:10.209> with<00:03:10.270> three<00:03:10.600> pennies

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
because we started with three pennies

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.040 
because we started with three pennies
now<00:03:11.830> we're<00:03:12.010> going<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.250> do<00:03:12.459> two<00:03:12.970> pennies<00:03:13.360> to

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
now we're going to do two pennies to

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.010 
now we're going to do two pennies to
widen<00:03:14.290> that<00:03:14.560> bevel<00:03:14.890> again<00:03:15.690> but<00:03:16.690> since<00:03:16.900> you

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
widen that bevel again but since you

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.780 
widen that bevel again but since you
already<00:03:17.080> got<00:03:17.350> the<00:03:17.560> bird<00:03:17.770> you<00:03:18.340> don't<00:03:18.550> need<00:03:18.670> to

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
already got the bird you don't need to

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.420 
already got the bird you don't need to
work<00:03:18.940> on<00:03:19.180> it<00:03:19.300> for<00:03:19.480> too<00:03:19.630> long<00:03:19.660> just<00:03:20.140> a<00:03:21.010> couple<00:03:21.220> of

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
work on it for too long just a couple of

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:29.899 
work on it for too long just a couple of
strokes<00:03:23.130> will<00:03:24.130> do<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.370> trick

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.610 

once<00:03:30.909> you<00:03:31.060> do<00:03:31.180> that<00:03:31.209> then<00:03:31.810> you<00:03:32.080> are<00:03:32.110> done<00:03:32.440> with

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
once you do that then you are done with

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.259 
once you do that then you are done with
your<00:03:32.769> first<00:03:32.980> stone<00:03:33.220> then<00:03:33.610> we'll<00:03:33.790> move<00:03:33.909> on<00:03:34.090> to

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
your first stone then we'll move on to

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.190 
your first stone then we'll move on to
our<00:03:34.299> second<00:03:34.690> stone<00:03:36.569> with<00:03:37.569> the<00:03:37.690> second<00:03:38.019> stone

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
our second stone with the second stone

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.229 
our second stone with the second stone
in<00:03:38.409> this<00:03:38.590> case<00:03:38.769> which<00:03:38.950> is<00:03:38.980> a<00:03:39.129> medium<00:03:39.549> 1,000

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
in this case which is a medium 1,000

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.030 
in this case which is a medium 1,000
grit<00:03:40.360> you<00:03:41.080> want<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:41.319> do<00:03:41.379> the<00:03:41.470> same<00:03:41.650> thing<00:03:41.890> that

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
grit you want to do the same thing that

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.550 
grit you want to do the same thing that

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
you did on the previous stones so on the

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.070 
you did on the previous stones so on the

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
Ridge to form again starting at the tip

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:05.699 
Ridge to form again starting at the tip
you<00:03:57.040> want<00:03:57.129> to<00:03:57.280> pull<00:03:57.519> towards<00:03:57.970> you<00:04:04.440> check<00:04:05.440> for<00:04:05.680> a
