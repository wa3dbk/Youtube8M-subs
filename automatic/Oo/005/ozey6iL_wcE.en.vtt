technique I picked up is take a little

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.690 
technique I picked up is take a little
duct<00:00:35.550> tape<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.989> just<00:00:36.989> run<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:38.219> roller<00:00:38.399> cover

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
duct tape and just run the roller cover

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.030 
duct tape and just run the roller cover
over<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.210> duct<00:00:39.480> tape<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.840> couple<00:00:40.350> times<00:00:40.739> yep

over the duct tape a couple times yep

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.799 
over the duct tape a couple times yep
and<00:00:41.190> even<00:00:41.520> with<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.850> one<00:00:42.059> that's<00:00:42.210> advertised

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
and even with this one that's advertised

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.060 
and even with this one that's advertised

left over on the duct tape all right but

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.330 
left over on the duct tape all right but
I<00:00:48.930> take<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.469> one<00:00:49.590> step<00:00:49.620> further<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.129> actually

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.150 
I take it one step further I actually
dip<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:51.030> into<00:00:51.660> water<00:00:51.960> just<00:00:52.680> like<00:00:52.829> your<00:00:52.980> brush

right yeah great tool so again we're
starting<00:01:07.890> with<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> damp<00:01:08.520> surface<00:01:08.909> here<00:01:09.090> before

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
starting with a damp surface here before

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.450 
starting with a damp surface here before
latex<00:01:09.810> paint<00:01:10.080> yep<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.590> for<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.890> same<00:01:11.070> reasons

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
latex paint yep and for the same reasons

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.370 
latex paint yep and for the same reasons
it<00:01:11.640> cleans<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.210> easier<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.900> use<00:01:13.229> it

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
it cleans up easier I can use it

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.560 
it cleans up easier I can use it
multiple<00:01:13.530> times<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.340> then<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.880> applies<00:01:15.180> paint

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
multiple times and then it applies paint

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.600 
multiple times and then it applies paint
in<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.810> nice<00:01:15.990> uniform<00:01:16.619> fashion<00:01:16.860> so<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> finish

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
in a nice uniform fashion so the finish

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.469 
in a nice uniform fashion so the finish
is<00:01:17.820> really<00:01:18.090> sweet

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
here we go load it up my roller arm now

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.130 
here we go load it up my roller arm now
you're<00:01:23.820> not<00:01:23.880> using<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.270> tray<00:01:24.570> using<00:01:24.869> this

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
you're not using a tray using this

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.580 
you're not using a tray using this
bucket

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
bucket

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.410 
bucket
so<00:01:25.740> with<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:25.950> inverted<00:01:26.340> tray<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.909> roll<00:01:27.390> my

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
so with this inverted tray I roll my

so with this inverted tray I roll my
paint<00:01:28.049> onto<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.619> roller<00:01:28.890> cover<00:01:29.220> as<00:01:29.430> uniformly

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
paint onto the roller cover as uniformly

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.149 
paint onto the roller cover as uniformly
as<00:01:30.420> possible<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:31.079> really<00:01:31.409> want<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.590> saturate

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
as possible I really want to saturate

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.340 
as possible I really want to saturate

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the nap so let's come up to where my

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.640 
the nap so let's come up to where my
ceilings<00:01:34.920> cut<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.700> then<00:01:36.479> with<00:01:36.659> my<00:01:36.869> roller

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
handle before it starts to dry so I'm

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.490

keep everything as uniformly wet at the

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.160 
keep everything as uniformly wet at the
same<00:02:04.979> time<00:02:05.250> okay<00:02:05.700> so<00:02:05.880> now<00:02:06.659> I'm<00:02:06.750> going<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.960> chase

up before I can finish the wall and I do

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.710 
up before I can finish the wall and I do
work

fashion put it on as uniformly as I can

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.410 
fashion put it on as uniformly as I can
but<00:02:33.130> you<00:02:33.160> actually<00:02:33.580> wanted<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:33.970> stuff<00:02:34.270> that

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
but you actually wanted the stuff that

but you actually wanted the stuff that
you<00:02:34.510> cut<00:02:34.780> in<00:02:34.960> along<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.530> trim<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:35.950> dry<00:02:36.280> before

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
you cut in along the trim the dry before

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.460 
you cut in along the trim the dry before
you<00:02:37.090> put<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.330> roller<00:02:37.510> on<00:02:37.660> this<00:02:37.780> wall<00:02:37.990> that's

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
you put the roller on this wall that's

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.790 
you put the roller on this wall that's
right

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
right

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.020 
right
I'd<00:02:38.860> go<00:02:39.070> to<00:02:39.100> great<00:02:39.400> lengths<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:39.880> make<00:02:40.000> sure

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
I'd go to great lengths to make sure

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.450 
I'd go to great lengths to make sure
that<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.420> do<00:02:40.510> not<00:02:40.990> roll<00:02:41.710> out<00:02:41.740> the<00:02:42.010> wall<00:02:42.190> until

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
that I do not roll out the wall until

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.340 
that I do not roll out the wall until
the<00:02:42.760> perimeter<00:02:43.240> is<00:02:43.390> dry<00:02:43.600> completely<00:02:44.140> dry

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
the perimeter is dry completely dry

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.660 
the perimeter is dry completely dry
that's<00:02:44.650> right<00:02:44.890> because<00:02:44.980> if<00:02:45.160> I<00:02:45.280> don't<00:02:45.550> you

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
that's right because if I don't you

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.980 
that's right because if I don't you
don't<00:02:45.760> ends<00:02:46.000> up<00:02:46.090> happening<00:02:46.360> as<00:02:46.480> I'm<00:02:46.840> rolling

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
don't ends up happening as I'm rolling

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.410 
don't ends up happening as I'm rolling
along<00:02:47.440> that<00:02:47.950> brushed<00:02:48.280> in<00:02:48.430> area<00:02:48.700> it<00:02:48.940> starts<00:02:49.270> to

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
along that brushed in area it starts to

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.600 
along that brushed in area it starts to
lift<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:50.020> pill<00:02:50.620> and<00:02:50.860> do<00:02:50.950> the<00:02:51.070> same<00:02:51.250> thing<00:02:51.490> that

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
lift and pill and do the same thing that

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.160 
lift and pill and do the same thing that
happens<00:02:51.940> on<00:02:52.030> my<00:02:52.180> dry<00:02:52.360> brush<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.990> last

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
happens on my dry brush and the last

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.720 
happens on my dry brush and the last
little<00:02:53.410> technique<00:02:53.740> that<00:02:53.770> I<00:02:53.920> like<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:54.280> share<00:02:54.490> is

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
little technique that I like to share is

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.480 
little technique that I like to share is
I<00:02:55.360> come<00:02:56.170> from<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.440> bottom<00:02:56.770> and<00:02:56.920> do<00:02:57.220> one

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
I come from the bottom and do one

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.710 
I come from the bottom and do one
careful<00:02:58.590> controlled<00:02:59.590> tip<00:03:00.340> up<00:03:00.670> and<00:03:01.390> this<00:03:01.660> is

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
careful controlled tip up and this is

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.199 
careful controlled tip up and this is
evening<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.650> all<00:03:02.740> out<00:03:02.980> for<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.310> right<00:03:03.430> now

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.210 

so<00:03:07.209> each<00:03:07.420> upward<00:03:07.870> stroke<00:03:08.230> that<00:03:08.380> I<00:03:08.440> make<00:03:08.740> I<00:03:08.920> do<00:03:09.040> a

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
so each upward stroke that I make I do a

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:11.780 
so each upward stroke that I make I do a
slight<00:03:09.700> overlap<00:03:10.060> on<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.540> previous<00:03:11.020> stroke

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
slight overlap on the previous stroke

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.660 
slight overlap on the previous stroke
and<00:03:12.810> as<00:03:13.810> I'm<00:03:14.080> doing<00:03:14.230> that<00:03:14.440> I'm<00:03:14.650> also<00:03:14.890> just

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
and as I'm doing that I'm also just

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.120 
and as I'm doing that I'm also just
slightly<00:03:16.300> putting<00:03:17.230> pressure<00:03:17.530> on<00:03:17.830> the

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
slightly putting pressure on the

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.190 
slightly putting pressure on the
right-hand<00:03:18.760> side<00:03:18.910> lifting<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.720> left-hand

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
right-hand side lifting the left-hand

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.509 
right-hand side lifting the left-hand
side<00:03:20.470> up<00:03:20.620> a<00:03:20.739> little<00:03:20.920> bit<00:03:21.070> so<00:03:21.250> that<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.430> don't

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
side up a little bit so that I don't

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.690 
side up a little bit so that I don't
create<00:03:21.940> any<00:03:22.269> ridges<00:03:23.200> of<00:03:23.380> paint<00:03:23.709> all<00:03:24.550> right

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
create any ridges of paint all right

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.370 
create any ridges of paint all right
well<00:03:24.880> good<00:03:25.090> tip<00:03:25.390> and<00:03:25.600> beautiful<00:03:25.989> wall<00:03:26.170> mark

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
well good tip and beautiful wall mark

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.040 
well good tip and beautiful wall mark
