00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
of course this matchup is supposed to be

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.570 
of course this matchup is supposed to be
really<00:00:18.779> bad<00:00:19.140> for<00:00:19.199> Spencer<00:00:19.980> people<00:00:20.430> say<00:00:20.550> that

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
no there's no way that Wolverine loses

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.490 
no there's no way that Wolverine loses
dispensary<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.480> always<00:00:25.080> think<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.289> if<00:00:25.439> you

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
dispensary I always think that if you

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.929 
dispensary I always think that if you
just<00:00:25.680> run<00:00:25.949> at<00:00:26.099> Wolverine<00:00:26.519> and<00:00:26.670> you<00:00:26.730> hit<00:00:26.849> up

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
just run at Wolverine and you hit up

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.240 
just run at Wolverine and you hit up
with<00:00:27.060> bending<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.960> have<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.140> chance<00:00:28.380> why<00:00:29.070> not

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
with bending you have a chance why not

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.840 
with bending you have a chance why not
right<00:00:30.080> you<00:00:31.080> know<00:00:31.109> your<00:00:31.590> best<00:00:32.160> defense<00:00:32.640> is

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
right you know your best defense is

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.130 
right you know your best defense is
sometimes<00:00:33.270> they're<00:00:33.450> really<00:00:33.630> strong<00:00:33.780> offense

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
sometimes they're really strong offense

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.229 
sometimes they're really strong offense
that's<00:00:34.559> how<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:34.980> my<00:00:35.219> feeling<00:00:35.430> this<00:00:35.760> matchup

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
that's how it is my feeling this matchup

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.209 
that's how it is my feeling this matchup
it<00:00:36.780> definitely<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.350> an<00:00:37.469> offensive<00:00:37.920> match<00:00:38.040> if

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
it definitely is an offensive match if

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.410 
it definitely is an offensive match if
you<00:00:38.340> really<00:00:38.550> have<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.790> hit<00:00:38.879> Justin<00:00:39.210> first

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
you really have to hit Justin first

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.819 
you really have to hit Justin first
that's<00:00:39.629> what<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.750> feel<00:00:39.960> that<00:00:40.170> isn't<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.680> what

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
that's what I feel that isn't that what

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:41.930 
that's what I feel that isn't that what
happened<00:00:41.160> when<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.370> fought<00:00:41.489> against<00:00:41.820> his
