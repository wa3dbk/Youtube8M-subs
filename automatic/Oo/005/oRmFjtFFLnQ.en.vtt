and I'm pretty much just going to show
you<00:00:48.480> guys<00:00:48.660> how<00:00:48.719> they<00:00:49.020> install<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.649> very<00:00:50.160> easy

you guys how they install it very easy

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.279 
you guys how they install it very easy
but<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.090> reason<00:00:51.420> why<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:51.570> decide<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:51.930> go<00:00:52.170> with

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
but the reason why I decide to go with

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.680 
but the reason why I decide to go with
the<00:00:52.350> 2<00:00:52.649> terabyte<00:00:53.160> version<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:54.000> just<00:00:54.059> because

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
the 2 terabyte version it just because

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.350 
the 2 terabyte version it just because
that's<00:00:55.559> probably<00:00:56.010> all<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.370> space<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.879> needed

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
that's probably all the space I needed

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.450 
that's probably all the space I needed
on<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.930> Xbox<00:00:58.379> one<00:00:58.500> system<00:00:58.829> when<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.280> do

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
and you plug in your external hard drive

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.390 
and you plug in your external hard drive
via<00:02:22.070> USB<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:23.450> get<00:02:23.690> this<00:02:23.960> message<00:02:24.380> that<00:02:25.040> tells

via USB you get this message that tells
you<00:02:25.580> that<00:02:25.610> you're<00:02:25.940> gonna<00:02:26.090> need<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.420> format

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
you that you're gonna need to format

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.290 
you that you're gonna need to format
your<00:02:27.260> device<00:02:27.770> and<00:02:28.280> like<00:02:28.460> I<00:02:28.610> said<00:02:28.820> this<00:02:28.940> works

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
your device and like I said this works

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.480 
your device and like I said this works
on<00:02:29.570> any<00:02:30.430> external<00:02:31.430> hard<00:02:31.880> drive<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.360> is<00:02:32.510> over

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
on any external hard drive that is over

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.540 
on any external hard drive that is over
256<00:02:34.490> gigabytes<00:02:35.120> or<00:02:35.420> higher<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.620> then<00:02:36.890> you<00:02:37.430> will

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
256 gigabytes or higher so then you will

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.030 
256 gigabytes or higher so then you will
go<00:02:37.730> through<00:02:37.760> your<00:02:38.090> name<00:02:38.510> your<00:02:39.320> external<00:02:39.830> hard

go through your name your external hard
drive<00:02:40.310> and<00:02:40.580> then<00:02:40.910> you<00:02:41.150> will<00:02:41.360> select<00:02:41.960> whether

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590

I<00:03:43.250> decided<00:03:43.640> to<00:03:43.880> move<00:03:44.090> it<00:03:44.300> and<00:03:44.630> then<00:03:45.080> just<00:03:45.290> go

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
I decided to move it and then just go

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.380 
I decided to move it and then just go
ahead<00:03:45.500> and<00:03:45.950> move<00:03:46.190> it<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.489> the<00:03:46.519> external<00:03:47.150> hard

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
ahead and move it to the external hard

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.759 
ahead and move it to the external hard
drive<00:03:47.660> and<00:03:47.989> from<00:03:48.500> there<00:03:48.800> this<00:03:49.370> process<00:03:50.060> takes

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
drive and from there this process takes

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.310 
drive and from there this process takes
about<00:03:51.769> five<00:03:52.519> minutes<00:03:52.550> for<00:03:53.390> Metal<00:03:53.660> Gear<00:03:53.690> Solid

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
about five minutes for Metal Gear Solid

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.830 
about five minutes for Metal Gear Solid
when<00:03:54.769> I<00:03:54.800> did<00:03:55.190> grant<00:03:55.670> that<00:03:55.910> auto<00:03:56.209> that<00:03:56.570> took

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
when I did grant that auto that took

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.500 
when I did grant that auto that took
about<00:03:57.110> 20<00:03:57.709> minutes<00:03:58.010> so<00:03:58.090> obviously<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.300> bigger

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
about 20 minutes so obviously the bigger

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.390 
about 20 minutes so obviously the bigger
the<00:03:59.750> game<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.019> longer<00:04:00.860> is<00:04:00.920> going<00:04:01.100> to<00:04:01.190> take

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
the game the longer is going to take

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.759 
the game the longer is going to take
Grantham's<00:04:02.239> out<00:04:02.390> I<00:04:02.420> believe<00:04:02.690> is<00:04:03.019> 40<00:04:03.530> something

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
Grantham's out I believe is 40 something

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.520 
Grantham's out I believe is 40 something
gigs<00:04:04.190> so<00:04:04.519> that<00:04:05.239> is<00:04:05.420> obviously<00:04:05.810> going<00:04:06.019> to<00:04:06.110> be<00:04:06.170> a

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
gigs so that is obviously going to be a

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.229 
gigs so that is obviously going to be a
little<00:04:06.800> bit<00:04:06.950> longer<00:04:07.190> than<00:04:07.370> Metal<00:04:07.580> Gear<00:04:07.610> Solid

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
little bit longer than Metal Gear Solid

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:09.410 
little bit longer than Metal Gear Solid
which<00:04:08.390> is<00:04:08.510> only<00:04:08.660> four<00:04:09.019> point

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
which is only four point

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.020 
which is only four point
eight<00:04:09.569> gigs<00:04:10.050> so<00:04:10.740> that<00:04:11.310> that<00:04:11.700> that's

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
eight gigs so that that that's

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.000 
eight gigs so that that that's
everything<00:04:12.750> like<00:04:12.930> literally<00:04:13.290> this<00:04:13.530> is<00:04:13.590> as
