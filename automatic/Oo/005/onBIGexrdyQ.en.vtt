they need before by the way here's my
automatic<00:02:08.149> wheat<00:02:08.330> farm<00:02:08.690> that<00:02:08.840> I<00:02:08.899> made<00:02:09.170> I<00:02:09.410> can't

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
automatic wheat farm that I made I can't

automatic wheat farm that I made I can't
demonstrate<00:02:10.160> now<00:02:10.610> as<00:02:10.819> this<00:02:10.910> is<00:02:11.090> all<00:02:11.270> needs<00:02:11.540> to

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
demonstrate now as this is all needs to

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.020 
demonstrate now as this is all needs to
grow<00:02:11.959> but<00:02:12.590> it<00:02:12.709> works<00:02:12.860> pretty<00:02:13.100> well<00:02:13.220> it's<00:02:13.910> a

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
grow but it works pretty well it's a

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.970 
grow but it works pretty well it's a
pretty<00:02:14.180> nifty<00:02:14.450> system<00:02:14.959> I<00:02:15.140> haven't<00:02:15.680> made<00:02:15.770> this

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
pretty nifty system I haven't made this

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.370 
pretty nifty system I haven't made this
automatics<00:02:16.550> but<00:02:16.910> I<00:02:16.940> will<00:02:17.450> make<00:02:17.660> it<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:17.990> I<00:02:18.230> can

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
automatics but I will make it so I can

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.680 
automatics but I will make it so I can
pull<00:02:18.560> over<00:02:18.590> and<00:02:19.010> all<00:02:19.190> these<00:02:19.310> will<00:02:19.490> pop<00:02:19.670> up<00:02:19.700> I've

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
pull over and all these will pop up I've

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.790

phone sleepiness it's addictive
because<00:02:30.410> I'm<00:02:31.060> forcing<00:02:32.060> myself<00:02:32.240> to<00:02:32.480> stay<00:02:32.540> away

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
because I'm forcing myself to stay away

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.100 
because I'm forcing myself to stay away
for<00:02:33.080> a<00:02:33.110> long<00:02:33.290> long<00:02:33.590> period<00:02:33.650> of<00:02:34.220> time<00:02:34.870> and<00:02:35.870> its

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
for a long long period of time and its

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.230 
for a long long period of time and its
own<00:02:36.290> font<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:36.740> used<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.310> quickly<00:02:37.430> like

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
own font you used to it quickly like

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.510 
own font you used to it quickly like
basically<00:02:38.750> your<00:02:39.350> your<00:02:39.560> body<00:02:39.890> gets<00:02:40.130> used<00:02:40.400> to

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
basically your your body gets used to

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.780 
basically your your body gets used to
only<00:02:40.730> sleep<00:02:40.970> it<00:02:41.180> for<00:02:41.390> a<00:02:41.420> few<00:02:41.600> hours<00:02:41.660> i<00:02:42.550> abide<00:02:43.550> by

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
only sleep it for a few hours i abide by

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.540 
only sleep it for a few hours i abide by
the<00:02:43.850> end<00:02:44.120> so<00:02:45.250> it's<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.630> much<00:02:47.630> more<00:02:48.220> my<00:02:49.220> brain<00:02:49.460> is
