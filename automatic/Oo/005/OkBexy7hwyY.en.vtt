00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:16.769
 here has become degenerate to 1 2 of the subscribers special you have 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.019
 absolutely special desired from therefore it is 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:23.619
 yes of Detlef Mayer who already knows it for me as the first 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:24.830
 I want to thank you 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:27.149
 Years of course, of course, prevented 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.739
 where I have to say this is not mainly to get home to 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.670
 bring all this to have fun of course need to come then 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.410
 the whole 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.750
 a positive side effect 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.910
 but as I said "I do not primarily do it cool it is frosty 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.180
 So who said thank you for that 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.420
 New York, I would like to see about it on which list 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.740
 exactly 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.260
 I want the Tigers 3 90% yes why should know 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.570
 the Â«Davos rose 15 aesthetically Otegi had Sky Work Then there Holland 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.180
 Soldier 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.830
 the people you were earned 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.190
 every athletic strength 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.130
 critically addressed for thanks 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.330
 Furthermore, I still want to thank people why should not I know why 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.190
 I'm actually there where babble 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.390
 I feel the need so from that 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.540
 2 7 6 3 discovered by the city world war 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.260
 Frank Bayer and SAP for bright spots command 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.210
 Through him I became aware as well as the whole 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.220
 Without him I would not have been around here now where Dennis was between 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.030
 rotate 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.979
 so percent yes that was anticipated but that's not yet 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.520
 Undertaker that brings 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.340
 I had had 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.710
 Surprisingly, Vivien is right back on the fact that many are doing so 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.980
 continue with the special after one of you the menu will be familiar 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.190
 the appointment of the fence free-to-play command under the heading 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.000
 Multiplayer mode the brand and difficult to recognize 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.300
 yes there are many wonderful little options to finally own it there you can 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.000
 make his own cover 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.150
 or both are struck 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.620
 yes I wanted to show this option for a long time as I own my own 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.200
 Commander would ask and there is that fits and there were 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.770
 to introduce whole times 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.000
 July the choice between Timo Scheider and yet command 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.410
 The course great command decides he wants to be tragic of an important one 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.050
 believe here by that at best 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.209
 slimy corner 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.449
 at least no one does not want me to play 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:14.629
 from Kommander 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:17.959
 the veterans of the time so that we can see the whole game from scratch 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:22.659
 he has exactly the model as manager so the main color of the armor 

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:27.269
 The explosives expert 0 and the sniper should get you out of the 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.919
 cd player known occurrence 

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:32.209
 these models do not exist in single player mode either 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.889
 But the enlightener and its at night if it is particularly spectacular new 

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:40.439
 Unhindered command UBS has been forgiving options 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.619
 but I personally tend more towards 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:45.099
 Waltrops though 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.679
 Night nonsense though the reconnaissance commando 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:51.429
 even so its advantages i mean the rating blue-yellow that it already looks 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:52.550
 stylish 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.650
 here but 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.629
 fluent reasoning so something in itself 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.010
 Jana merges with the 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.590
 Do not even promise darkness 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.119
 now can 

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:03.949
 according to the Daily Mirror 

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:07.229
 yes we swallowed more here as well as for example both shoulders and 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:08.219
 which is not all 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:10.389
 because the head is off 

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.119
 the breathing apparatus 

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:16.249
 is a nice little option where I also primarily, however, left 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:17.510
 the poorly implemented 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.279
 have the recipe for it 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:21.129
 I absolutely must have 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.129
 Kirchner wants Schittenhelm me personally not for the course and fits 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.609
 not really going on to make up the rest of the armor from that fast on 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:31.499
 Percent will be the same way here 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:35.399
 and the warrior Helmes that I feel so far but that is 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.369
 I do not have long hair and it looks like you have a quick pass 

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:41.029
 Offer long hair 

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:44.329
 So I do not need to have space under pressure 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.390
 The rangefinder is on the ground floor nice idea but not so 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:49.640
 Really nice translated 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.039
 Therefore, the classic variant is completely without 

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:56.209
 but it looks different when the shoulders are lit so there was that 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:56.840
 we can 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.239
 yes why that 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.510
 a what is really different here than that 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.529
 yes it is so minimal difference 

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:07.079
 So I keep on watching the Thermal Scanner 8 meters 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:07.960
 far out 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.680
 can easily be shot down, you can hang anywhere is not really 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.719
 fast but practical 

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.079
 around 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:15.409
 and here 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.139
 great then find and what is there 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:19.939
 Yates had claimed 

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:21.859
 protect opulently 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.509
 if I'm just going to do it, it's really going to make a comeback 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:27.740
 that is also I have hired 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.939
 personally not so stylish for that reason 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:32.069
 that warrior shield 

00:04:32.069 --> 00:04:34.660
 is just gigantic yellow 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:35.569
 and cold 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:37.439
 Peter Danckert 

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:39.860
 four more chances to pack 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.740
 yes, because their efforts LP have pursued know that only with the 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.819
 Sniper rifle Robert her 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:46.680
 out 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.380
 that is why also that sniper Park and Unger and 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:52.520
 do that with me looks more beautiful 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.569
 around 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:57.199
 but Wohlert I'm allowed oh yes down there Jarod investor topic 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.439
 Euro and all around so that even from behind can see 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:01.559
 tender quotes 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:02.589
 the poor 

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:06.010
 we have a wonderfully huge blue Baghdad cardboard sign 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.440
 "It certainly pretty useful if you paint hits right there is 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.949
 Just party yourself out of hiring fast way here 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:13.270
 the hollow emitter 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.150
 yes, there we have helped one of our subtitles and I have to 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.150
 and obviously regenerating so we really need that 

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:24.400
 and completely without them, they will be out in spite of yours 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.189
 therefore attended the game and at 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:30.759
 should I again forward exactly at both now also nice option 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.169
 that suited the park too 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.750
 but since both these two goals when sticking a year is certainly very 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.319
 the useful kamber look 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:41.449
 the games are that 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:42.900
 Percent per animal 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.479
 Century further grants Gaillard ammunition 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.419
 Hansa has its advantages but I am now betraying that too not really 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:51.729
 from Bayer 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:54.729
 limit ourselves to the glass packs there 

00:05:55.869 --> 00:05:59.179
 Complaining constantly about Juliette getting involved, so it is 

00:05:59.179 --> 00:06:02.559
 Ali Carter has got his leg up 

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:07.309
 and after the back is in a body image wonder Red 

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:08.900
 nobody cares 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.330
 you can choose a communication parkour the one yes me 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.040
 think that communication problems with armaments are unnecessarily difficult 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.879
 but relatively stylus and 

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:21.319
 Of course it will change but that will no longer be that problem for our consultant 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:23.610
 are consistent and so is the can not hear us 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:24.470
 therefore 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:26.409
 for options 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:30.590
 and the voice over the sample rich think the Horber anyway of 

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:31.460
 therefore 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.930
 That would be my choice of iPad like command 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.520
 during my fall a line dreams if you can call 

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:42.719
 in which he has a chamber pot with communication point percent 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:44.949
 AR I do not remember exactly how sniper grabs 

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:47.150
 around Gloucester ammo on the leg 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:50.770
 that is, have ammunition maximization and there should not be that easy 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.430
 Run out of ammunition 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.699
 this initiative would fall ways i hope you like too 

00:06:56.699 --> 00:06:59.580
 I liked you better than you did us 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.780
 that's how we are from the one year background from a "special t" 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.339
 MÃ¼nter and yet I follow 

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:09.599
 So I just want to finish my training gas and two me 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:12.379
 There are still many more questions to be answered 

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:14.009
 with what I work with and so 

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:15.279
 just keep going 

00:07:15.279 --> 00:07:18.479
 I've said it in several places and spread even further 

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:21.240
 and reports that they use the program 

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.440
 He's the same one a month but Dennis Blech and it's still standing 

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.230
 my the channel by description 

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:28.319
 I invite you to promise me 

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:30.759
 the journey then you find that more exactly 

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:34.039
 I did not say electoral programs to Alexa 

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:38.580
 I use them and the outside is nevertheless reached at the end of the buffalo 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.400
 it is 

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.560
 extended sixteen had just been scheduled but a consultation and 

00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:45.169
 from therefore I thank you 

00:07:45.169 --> 00:07:48.979
 thanks for watching thank you for having looked books thank you for having me 

00:07:48.979 --> 00:07:52.590
 but now have thanks for everything stays tuned I hope I will still 

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.259
 Uncertainty can persist until the next episode after 

00:07:55.259 --> 00:07:55.750
 See you
