00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
yesterday and II got a couple of walleye

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.240 
yesterday and II got a couple of walleye
pre-fishing<00:00:48.090> here<00:00:48.480> that<00:00:49.080> the<00:00:49.470> waters<00:00:49.950> as

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
pre-fishing here that the waters as

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.729 
pre-fishing here that the waters as
clear<00:00:50.700> as<00:00:50.879> milk<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.900> this<00:00:52.050> guy<00:00:52.230> really<00:00:52.440> walked

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
clear as milk so this guy really walked

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.140

it<00:00:52.920> he's<00:00:53.010> got<00:00:53.160> both<00:00:53.370> hooks<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.790> it<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.030> my

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
it he's got both hooks in it so my

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.549 
it he's got both hooks in it so my
strategy<00:00:54.629> is<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.720> take<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.080> hooks<00:00:55.230> out<00:00:55.350> of<00:00:55.470> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
strategy is to take the hooks out of the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.140 
strategy is to take the hooks out of the
fish<00:00:55.739> first<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.280> then<00:00:56.460> I'll<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.820> treble

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
fish first and then I'll get the treble

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:58.820 
fish first and then I'll get the treble
hook<00:00:57.269> out<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.540> net<00:00:57.780> helps<00:00:58.290> to<00:00:58.409> be<00:00:58.530> equipped

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:54.359 
have the sonar in this particular ocean

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:57.289 
have the sonar in this particular ocean
kayak<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.100> fishing<00:01:56.490> models<00:01:56.909> so<00:01:57.210> it

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
kayak is one of the fishing models so it

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.090 
kayak is one of the fishing models so it
has<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.479> built-in<00:01:57.960> sonar<00:01:58.469> I'm<00:01:58.859> just<00:01:59.009> gonna

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
has a built-in sonar I'm just gonna

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.709 
has a built-in sonar I'm just gonna
paddle<00:01:59.549> up<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.759> little<00:01:59.939> bit<00:02:00.119> towards<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.630> to

been looking for a structure that goes
up<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:44.879> down<00:02:44.970> we've<00:02:45.239> just<00:02:45.420> marked<00:02:45.690> some

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
up and down we've just marked some

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.660 
up and down we've just marked some
baitfish<00:02:46.019> see<00:02:46.590> these<00:02:46.769> lines<00:02:47.040> up<00:02:47.250> here

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
baitfish see these lines up here

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.520 
baitfish see these lines up here
those<00:02:47.940> are<00:02:48.090> baitfish<00:02:48.300> suspended<00:02:49.050> at<00:02:49.170> 2<00:02:49.379> and<00:02:49.500> a

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
those are baitfish suspended at 2 and a

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.229 
those are baitfish suspended at 2 and a
half<00:02:49.680> feet<00:02:49.860> below<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.160> surface<00:02:50.459> there's

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
half feet below the surface there's

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:53.630 
half feet below the surface there's
another<00:02:51.540> ball<00:02:51.780> of<00:02:51.810> baitfish<00:02:52.110> right<00:02:52.530> there<00:02:52.800> you

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
another ball of baitfish right there you

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.070 
another ball of baitfish right there you
know<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.880> nice<00:02:54.030> thing<00:02:54.269> about<00:02:54.360> this<00:02:54.630> unit<00:02:54.989> is

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
know the nice thing about this unit is

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.750 
know the nice thing about this unit is
that<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.440> transducer<00:02:56.069> isn't<00:02:56.430> mounted

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
that the transducer isn't mounted

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.100 
that the transducer isn't mounted
through<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.000> hull<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.269> the<00:02:57.330> kayak<00:02:57.810> you

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
through the hull of the kayak you

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.250 
through the hull of the kayak you
actually<00:02:59.010> use<00:02:59.250> it's<00:02:59.519> like<00:02:59.640> a<00:02:59.670> cement<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.360> so

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
actually use it's like a cement and so

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.900 
actually use it's like a cement and so
it's<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.470> through-hole<00:03:01.920> transducer<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.849> the

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
it's a through-hole transducer and the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.430 
it's a through-hole transducer and the
transducer<00:03:03.239> is<00:03:03.540> literally<00:03:03.810> right<00:03:04.019> below<00:03:04.290> the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
transducer is literally right below the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.650 
transducer is literally right below the
unit<00:03:04.590> and<00:03:04.860> there's<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.489> nice<00:03:05.730> small<00:03:06.060> 12-volt

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
unit and there's a nice small 12-volt

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.289 
unit and there's a nice small 12-volt
battery<00:03:07.049> that's<00:03:07.590> suspended<00:03:08.400> in<00:03:08.640> an<00:03:08.819> ice<00:03:08.970> bag

has this propeller on the back and when
it<00:03:38.579> sits<00:03:38.790> evenly<00:03:38.970> in<00:03:39.389> the<00:03:39.540> water<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:40.530> kicks<00:03:40.829> up

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
it sits evenly in the water it kicks up

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.580 
it sits evenly in the water it kicks up
water<00:03:41.340> from<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.850> back<00:03:42.350> which<00:03:43.350> draws

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
water from the back which draws

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.099 
water from the back which draws
attention<00:03:43.739> to<00:03:44.069> it<00:03:44.280> and<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:45.090> sits<00:03:45.540> on<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.750> level

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:46.109 
attention to it and it sits on a level

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:48.289 
attention to it and it sits on a level
profile<00:03:46.590> now<00:03:47.310> you<00:03:47.370> also<00:03:47.549> notice<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.030> this

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
profile now you also notice that this

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.120 
profile now you also notice that this
particular<00:03:48.510> top<00:03:49.049> water<00:03:49.290> lure<00:03:49.530> doesn't<00:03:49.980> have<00:03:50.100> a

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
particular top water lure doesn't have a

particular top water lure doesn't have a
lip<00:03:50.430> at<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:50.670> front<00:03:50.940> to<00:03:51.090> make<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.359> go<00:03:51.480> from<00:03:51.630> side

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
lip at the front to make it go from side

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.620 
lip at the front to make it go from side
to<00:03:51.930> side<00:03:52.109> or<00:03:52.590> even<00:03:53.010> pop<00:03:53.489> to<00:03:54.060> push<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.450> water

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
to side or even pop to push the water

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.990 
to side or even pop to push the water
ahead<00:03:54.989> it's<00:03:55.530> got<00:03:55.739> a<00:03:55.769> very<00:03:55.980> smooth<00:03:56.370> bottom<00:03:56.880> so

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
ahead it's got a very smooth bottom so

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.059 
ahead it's got a very smooth bottom so
it's<00:03:57.120> designed<00:03:57.450> to<00:03:57.510> actually<00:03:57.600> glide<00:03:58.350> so<00:03:58.920> it's

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 
it's designed to actually glide so it's

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.039 
it's designed to actually glide so it's
the<00:03:59.190> propeller<00:03:59.609> that<00:04:00.150> kicks<00:04:00.420> all<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.840> water

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
the propeller that kicks all the water

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.960 
the propeller that kicks all the water
up<00:04:01.319> and<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:01.709> works<00:04:01.950> really<00:04:02.340> well<00:04:02.489> if<00:04:02.850> you

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
up and it works really well if you

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.000 
up and it works really well if you
continuously<00:04:03.540> pull<00:04:04.019> it<00:04:04.170> that<00:04:04.560> way<00:04:04.709> the<00:04:04.829> fish

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
continuously pull it that way the fish

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.480 
continuously pull it that way the fish
can<00:04:05.250> track<00:04:05.489> it<00:04:05.700> really<00:04:06.060> nail<00:04:06.269> it
