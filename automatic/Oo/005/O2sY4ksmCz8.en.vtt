hi after an email that I just received

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.869 
hi after an email that I just received
about<00:00:04.680> five<00:00:04.859> minutes<00:00:05.069> ago<00:00:05.190> somebody<00:00:05.759> was

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
asking if I could do a breakdown of a

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.160 
asking if I could do a breakdown of a
summer<00:00:08.550> wind<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:09.030> cotton<00:00:09.389> dress<00:00:09.420> by<00:00:09.750> reaching

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
summer wind a cotton dress by reaching

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.209 
summer wind a cotton dress by reaching
down<00:00:10.580> so<00:00:11.580> it's<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:12.530> there<00:00:13.530> are<00:00:13.590> only<00:00:13.710> few<00:00:13.920> very

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
down so it's a there are only few very

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.640 
down so it's a there are only few very
few<00:00:14.400> parts<00:00:14.700> to<00:00:14.759> it<00:00:14.969> and<00:00:15.750> it's<00:00:15.990> relatively

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
few parts to it and it's relatively

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.670 
few parts to it and it's relatively
simple<00:00:16.830> once<00:00:17.160> you<00:00:17.690> get<00:00:18.690> through<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.050> so<00:00:19.380> I'll

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
simple once you get through it so I'll

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.140 
simple once you get through it so I'll
try<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.160> as<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.210> say<00:00:21.359> simply<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.100> easily<00:00:23.150> I'm

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
try to it as I say simply and easily I'm

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.759 
try to it as I say simply and easily I'm
sure<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.900> won't<00:00:25.050> tell<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.320> how<00:00:25.439> long<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.710> get

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
sure it won't tell you how long to get

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.759 
sure it won't tell you how long to get
the<00:00:25.859> hang<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.099> it

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
the hang of it

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.710 
the hang of it
if<00:00:28.769> you<00:00:29.250> check<00:00:29.670> my<00:00:29.699> other<00:00:29.939> videos<00:00:30.330> you'll<00:00:30.510> find

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
if you check my other videos you'll find

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.590 
if you check my other videos you'll find
the<00:00:30.840> out<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.080> full<00:00:31.289> song<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:32.000> recorded<00:00:33.000> many

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the out of the full song I recorded many

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.010 
the out of the full song I recorded many
years<00:00:33.840> ago<00:00:35.210> but<00:00:36.210> basically<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.630> think<00:00:36.719> from

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
years ago but basically I think from

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.889 
years ago but basically I think from
memory<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.559> need<00:00:38.040> your<00:00:38.160> capo<00:00:38.489> on<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:38.899> 2nd

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
memory you need your capo on the 2nd

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.160 
memory you need your capo on the 2nd
fret<00:00:40.020> and<00:00:41.120> anywhere<00:00:42.120> anywhere<00:00:42.660> works<00:00:42.899> for

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
fret and anywhere anywhere works for

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:44.479 
fret and anywhere anywhere works for
wherever<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.710> your<00:00:43.829> vocal<00:00:44.160> range<00:00:44.190> if

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
wherever is in your vocal range if

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.119 
wherever is in your vocal range if
that's<00:00:44.640> what<00:00:44.730> you<00:00:44.789> do<00:00:44.930> and<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.110> drop<00:00:46.320> D<00:00:46.500> so

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
that's what you do and it's drop D so

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.860 
that's what you do and it's drop D so
the<00:00:47.940> lowest<00:00:48.120> e<00:00:48.510> tuned<00:00:49.320> down<00:00:49.469> toward<00:00:49.739> easy<00:00:52.699> and

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
the lowest e tuned down toward easy and

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.750 
the lowest e tuned down toward easy and
so<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> main<00:00:55.170> riff<00:00:55.469> which<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:56.190> something<00:00:56.460> like

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
so the main riff which is something like

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:09.700 
so the main riff which is something like
this

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.630 

that's<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.800> only<00:01:10.890> bit<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.160> get<00:01:11.280> hang<00:01:11.520> on

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
that's the only bit to get hang on

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.460 
that's the only bit to get hang on
really<00:01:11.940> er<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.120> rest<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.390> cords<00:01:12.810> so

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
really er the rest is just cords so

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.260 
really er the rest is just cords so
we've<00:01:13.620> got<00:01:13.800> if<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.190> can<00:01:14.310> show<00:01:14.460> you<00:01:14.520> both<00:01:15.060> at<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
we've got if I can show you both at the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.930 
we've got if I can show you both at the
same<00:01:15.450> time<00:01:15.660> we've<00:01:16.440> got<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.680> D<00:01:16.830> shape<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.310> if

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
same time we've got the D shape and if

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.600 
same time we've got the D shape and if
you<00:01:18.060> give<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.360> low<00:01:18.570> D<00:01:18.950> to<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.520> you've

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
you give the low D to the that you've

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.730 
you give the low D to the that you've
got<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.030> low<00:01:21.180> D<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.380> D<00:01:22.410> above<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:23.540> and<00:01:24.740> then

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
got the low D to the D above it and then

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.469 
got the low D to the D above it and then
to<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.920> high<00:01:26.070> string<00:01:26.370> so<00:01:26.490> you

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.420 

then<00:01:31.479> you're<00:01:31.600> not<00:01:31.690> moving<00:01:31.960> that<00:01:32.320> D<00:01:32.470> shape<00:01:32.770> so

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
then you're not moving that D shape so

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.790 
then you're not moving that D shape so
all<00:01:33.490> you're<00:01:33.700> doing<00:01:33.729> is<00:01:33.970> getting<00:01:34.210> low<00:01:34.690> D<00:01:34.960> for

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
all you're doing is getting low D for

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.880 
all you're doing is getting low D for
the<00:01:35.890> string<00:01:36.190> third<00:01:36.850> string<00:01:37.619> sixth<00:01:38.619> string

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
the string third string sixth string

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.109 
the string third string sixth string
fifth<00:01:39.820> string<00:01:40.180> and<00:01:41.190> then<00:01:42.190> you<00:01:42.430> can<00:01:42.610> strum

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 
fifth string and then you can strum

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.320 
fifth string and then you can strum
across<00:01:43.510> the<00:01:43.690> whole<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:45.610> whole<00:01:45.640> fretboard

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
across the whole the whole fretboard

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.380 
across the whole the whole fretboard
when<00:01:47.020> you<00:01:47.140> move<00:01:47.320> into<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:48.520> next<00:01:48.820> shape<00:01:49.000> which

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
when you move into the next shape which

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.040 
when you move into the next shape which
is<00:01:50.400> the<00:01:51.400> second<00:01:51.850> string<00:01:52.119> second<00:01:52.570> fret

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
is the second string second fret

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.430 
is the second string second fret
this<00:01:53.560> is<00:01:53.740> thinking<00:01:54.040> of<00:01:54.190> this<00:01:55.119> obviously<00:01:55.509> with

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
this is thinking of this obviously with

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.830 
this is thinking of this obviously with
the<00:01:56.650> the<00:01:56.920> capo<00:01:57.250> in<00:01:57.340> mind<00:01:57.520> so<00:01:58.030> fifth<00:01:58.540> string

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
the the capo in mind so fifth string

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.800 
the the capo in mind so fifth string
second<00:01:59.229> fret<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.670> then<00:02:00.670> all<00:02:00.940> other<00:02:01.000> fingers

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
second fret and then all other fingers

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.920 
second fret and then all other fingers
often<00:02:02.110> but<00:02:03.070> you've<00:02:03.460> got<00:02:03.700> your<00:02:04.149> third<00:02:04.479> finger

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
often but you've got your third finger

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.279 
often but you've got your third finger
third<00:02:05.140> fret<00:02:05.950> and<00:02:06.640> you've<00:02:07.119> got<00:02:07.240> a<00:02:07.270> finger<00:02:07.570> third

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289

third fret and you've got a finger third
fret<00:02:08.470> as<00:02:08.649> well<00:02:08.769> so<00:02:08.920> you<00:02:08.979> got

string<00:02:36.709> fourth<00:02:37.040> fret<00:02:37.130> and<00:02:38.709> then<00:02:39.709> third<00:02:39.980> string

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:54.950 

and<00:02:45.610> it's<00:02:45.760> fitting<00:02:45.970> that<00:02:46.090> into

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.020 

as<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.740> repeat<00:02:56.130> of<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.280> station<00:02:56.730> then<00:02:56.880> your

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
as a repeat of that station then your

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.870 
as a repeat of that station then your
next<00:02:57.180> chord<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.600> I<00:02:57.690> put<00:02:57.900> in<00:02:58.050> is<00:02:58.650> just<00:02:59.160> again

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
next chord that I put in is just again

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.200 
next chord that I put in is just again
keeping<00:03:00.270> it<00:03:00.360> all<00:03:00.510> or<00:03:01.080> pretty<00:03:01.320> open<00:03:01.710> but<00:03:02.640> second

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
keeping it all or pretty open but second

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.990 
keeping it all or pretty open but second
string<00:03:03.450> fourth<00:03:03.900> fret<00:03:04.100> third<00:03:05.100> string<00:03:05.130> second

string fourth fret third string second

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.920 
string fourth fret third string second
fret<00:03:06.120> and<00:03:07.070> fifth<00:03:08.070> string<00:03:08.730> third<00:03:08.790> fret<00:03:11.930> sounds

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
fret and fifth string third fret sounds

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.150 
fret and fifth string third fret sounds
a<00:03:12.960> bit<00:03:13.080> odd<00:03:13.140> as<00:03:13.350> it<00:03:13.380> is<00:03:13.560> but<00:03:13.740> when<00:03:13.830> you<00:03:13.860> put<00:03:14.070> it

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
a bit odd as it is but when you put it

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:27.800 
a bit odd as it is but when you put it
into<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.430> hole

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.540 

so<00:03:28.680> there's<00:03:28.830> a<00:03:28.860> couple<00:03:29.069> of<00:03:29.130> bits<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.430> can

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
so there's a couple of bits that you can

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.920 
so there's a couple of bits that you can
see<00:03:29.700> that<00:03:29.819> I'm<00:03:29.910> missing<00:03:30.060> out<00:03:30.300> on<00:03:30.360> the<00:03:30.630> second

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
see that I'm missing out on the second

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.960 
see that I'm missing out on the second
time<00:03:31.080> around<00:03:31.160> and<00:03:32.160> but<00:03:32.310> that's<00:03:32.459> about<00:03:32.610> it

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
time around and but that's about it

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.350 
time around and but that's about it
as<00:03:33.780> for<00:03:33.930> the<00:03:34.020> rest<00:03:34.170> of<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:35.030> you've<00:03:36.030> got<00:03:36.209> the

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
as for the rest of it and you've got the

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:51.740 
as for the rest of it and you've got the
the<00:03:36.630> verses<00:03:36.990> just<00:03:37.080> follow<00:03:37.319> that<00:03:37.530> so<00:03:48.140> on<00:03:50.750> and

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
the verses just follow that so on and

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.449 
the verses just follow that so on and
then<00:03:51.900> it<00:03:52.020> changes<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.440> end<00:03:52.680> of<00:03:53.580> each<00:03:53.790> verse<00:03:54.030> to

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
then it changes the end of each verse to

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.800 
then it changes the end of each verse to
live<00:03:56.459> for<00:03:56.910> down

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
live for down

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.130 
live for down
get<00:03:58.319> up<00:03:58.920> somehow<00:03:59.420> and<00:04:00.420> then<00:04:00.540> he<00:04:00.600> goes<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.780> the

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
get up somehow and then he goes to the

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.020 
get up somehow and then he goes to the
wall<00:04:01.500> was<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.680> cheese<00:04:01.980> shape<00:04:02.220> so<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:02.820> then

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
wall was the cheese shape so you then

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.650 
wall was the cheese shape so you then
going<00:04:03.300> up<00:04:03.390> to<00:04:03.630> I<00:04:03.840> just<00:04:04.110> play<00:04:04.260> it<00:04:04.440> as<00:04:05.660> this

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
going up to I just play it as this

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.240 
going up to I just play it as this
because<00:04:06.870> it's<00:04:07.019> got<00:04:07.110> a<00:04:07.170> nice<00:04:07.320> ring<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.709> it<00:04:07.920> so

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
because it's got a nice ring to it so

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.270 
because it's got a nice ring to it so
that's<00:04:08.540> first<00:04:09.540> string<00:04:09.959> fifth<00:04:10.200> fret<00:04:10.290> and<00:04:10.950> mute

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
that's first string fifth fret and mute

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.840 
that's first string fifth fret and mute
the<00:04:12.269> second<00:04:12.660> string<00:04:12.930> let<00:04:13.800> the<00:04:13.980> open<00:04:14.550> string

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
the second string let the open string

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.420 
the second string let the open string
for<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:15.300> third<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.290> fourth<00:04:16.530> and<00:04:16.769> then

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
for the third and the fourth and then

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.990 
for the third and the fourth and then
third<00:04:17.850> fret<00:04:18.269> fifth<00:04:18.810> string<00:04:19.220> fifth<00:04:20.220> fret<00:04:20.430> -<00:04:20.790> six

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
third fret fifth string fifth fret - six

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.910 
third fret fifth string fifth fret - six
strings<00:04:21.299> again

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:34.400 

so<00:04:27.550> that's<00:04:27.700> just<00:04:27.880> fifth<00:04:28.240> to<00:04:28.450> fourth<00:04:30.780> factor

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:39.960 

okay<00:04:35.410> so<00:04:35.470> those<00:04:35.740> are<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.890> first<00:04:36.040> parts<00:04:38.970> the

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
okay so those are the first parts the

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:45.750 
okay so those are the first parts the
chorus<00:04:40.390> is<00:04:42.060> an<00:04:43.060> a<00:04:43.300> shape<00:04:43.950> which<00:04:44.950> I<00:04:45.100> usually<00:04:45.250> bar

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
chorus is an a shape which I usually bar

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.980 
chorus is an a shape which I usually bar
the<00:04:46.000> a<00:04:46.800> with<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:48.330> whatever<00:04:49.330> the<00:04:49.420> third<00:04:49.660> finger

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
the a with the whatever the third finger

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.130 
the a with the whatever the third finger
on<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.140> third<00:04:50.290> fret<00:04:50.590> of<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.390> fifth<00:04:52.390> string<00:04:52.510> so

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
on the third fret of the fifth string so

00:04:53.140 --> 00:05:01.380 
on the third fret of the fifth string so
you<00:04:53.200> get<00:04:57.060> some<00:04:58.060> wind<00:04:58.450> and<00:04:59.170> then<00:04:59.410> bad<00:05:00.100> B<00:05:00.700> D<00:05:01.120> minor

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
you get some wind and then bad B D minor

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.280 
you get some wind and then bad B D minor
seventh

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
seventh

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:28.930 
seventh
and<00:05:03.380> then<00:05:04.100> it<00:05:04.220> rolls<00:05:04.400> down<00:05:04.520> quite

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:45.840 

to<00:05:29.630> the<00:05:29.690> B<00:05:29.840> minor<00:05:30.050> again

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:45.850 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.430 

but<00:05:46.850> a<00:05:46.880> lager<00:05:47.330> to<00:05:47.389> be<00:05:47.479> honest<00:05:47.690> a<00:05:47.750> lot<00:05:47.780> of<00:05:47.930> the<00:05:48.050> is

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
but a lager to be honest a lot of the is

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.350 
but a lager to be honest a lot of the is
the<00:05:48.560> picking<00:05:48.770> in<00:05:49.039> there

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.700 

what<00:05:53.360> was<00:05:53.509> your<00:05:53.690> hands<00:05:53.960> on<00:05:54.050> as<00:05:54.410> long<00:05:54.560> as<00:05:54.620> your

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
what was your hands on as long as your

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.200 
what was your hands on as long as your
things<00:05:54.830> up<00:05:54.979> this<00:05:55.130> side<00:05:55.340> doing<00:05:56.000> the<00:05:56.090> right

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
things up this side doing the right

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.629 
things up this side doing the right
thing<00:05:56.470> then<00:05:57.470> it<00:05:57.590> kind<00:05:58.100> of<00:05:58.190> doesn't<00:05:58.400> matter

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
thing then it kind of doesn't matter

00:05:58.639 --> 00:05:59.860 
thing then it kind of doesn't matter
what<00:05:58.759> you<00:05:58.850> do<00:05:59.000> with<00:05:59.150> this<00:05:59.240> side<00:05:59.449> as<00:05:59.570> long<00:05:59.720> as

00:05:59.860 --> 00:05:59.870 
what you do with this side as long as

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.189 
what you do with this side as long as
you<00:06:00.020> hitting<00:06:00.919> the<00:06:00.979> bits<00:06:01.160> that<00:06:01.310> you<00:06:01.370> need<00:06:01.580> to<00:06:01.759> be

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 
you hitting the bits that you need to be

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.469 
you hitting the bits that you need to be
that<00:06:03.199> probably<00:06:03.500> sounds<00:06:03.770> like<00:06:03.830> it's<00:06:04.130> very

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:04.479 
that probably sounds like it's very

00:06:04.479 --> 00:06:08.590 
that probably sounds like it's very
obvious<00:06:05.479> but<00:06:05.750> that's<00:06:06.680> true<00:06:06.860> I<00:06:07.419> hope<00:06:08.419> that

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600 
obvious but that's true I hope that

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.439 
obvious but that's true I hope that
helps<00:06:08.870> and<00:06:09.740> I<00:06:10.460> may<00:06:10.759> well<00:06:10.940> do<00:06:11.120> something

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:11.449 
helps and I may well do something

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:12.909 
helps and I may well do something
similar<00:06:11.690> to<00:06:11.840> this<00:06:11.960> for<00:06:12.410> some<00:06:12.560> of<00:06:12.590> the<00:06:12.710> songs

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:12.919 
similar to this for some of the songs

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.680 
similar to this for some of the songs
