00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
pointed stick coming out of it and it's

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.729 
pointed stick coming out of it and it's
kind<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.090> cool<00:00:45.239> looking<00:00:45.420> kind<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.230> interesting

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
kind of cool looking kind of interesting

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.830 
kind of cool looking kind of interesting
it's<00:00:47.280> been<00:00:47.370> fun<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.670> watch<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:48.120> grows<00:00:48.360> about<00:00:48.629> an

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
it's been fun to watch it grows about an

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.939 
it's been fun to watch it grows about an
inch<00:00:49.590> every<00:00:50.660> every<00:00:51.660> two<00:00:51.870> weeks<00:00:52.110> probably<00:00:52.440> so

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
inch every every two weeks probably so

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.340 
inch every every two weeks probably so
it's<00:00:53.070> real<00:00:53.309> slow<00:00:53.719> but<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.140> know<00:00:55.230> it's

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
it's real slow but on you know it's

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.069 
it's real slow but on you know it's
propagating<00:00:56.010> like<00:00:56.039> crazy<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.789> so<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.660> got

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
propagating like crazy and so I got

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.599 
propagating like crazy and so I got
another<00:00:58.289> guy<00:00:58.410> back<00:00:58.800> there<00:00:59.039> somewhere<00:00:59.309> you

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
another guy back there somewhere you

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.330 
another guy back there somewhere you
really<00:00:59.850> can't<00:01:00.090> see<00:01:00.300> him<00:01:00.920> but<00:01:01.920> yeah<00:01:02.160> these

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
really can't see him but yeah these

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.860 
really can't see him but yeah these
things<00:01:02.399> are<00:01:02.730> just<00:01:02.850> looking<00:01:03.149> good<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.420> got<00:01:03.719> them

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
things are just looking good I got them

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.280 
things are just looking good I got them
in<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:05.450> would<00:01:06.450> say<00:01:06.600> medium<00:01:07.020> light<00:01:07.430> 104<00:01:08.430> Watts

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
in on I would say medium light 104 Watts

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.359 
in on I would say medium light 104 Watts
t5<00:01:10.290> high<00:01:10.320> output<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:11.750> 55<00:01:12.750> gallon<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.369> decently

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
t5 high output on 55 gallon so decently

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.390 
t5 high output on 55 gallon so decently
good<00:01:14.460> lighting<00:01:14.850> good<00:01:15.650> substrate<00:01:16.650> got<00:01:16.920> root

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
good lighting good substrate got root

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.370 
good lighting good substrate got root
tabs<00:01:17.700> underneath<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.270> Eco<00:01:18.630> complete<00:01:19.080> and

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
tabs underneath the Eco complete and

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.890 
tabs underneath the Eco complete and
then<00:01:20.189> I'm<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:21.180> GH<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.900> KH<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:23.070> have<00:01:23.790> gh<00:01:24.240> at<00:01:24.570> about

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
then I'm for GH in KH I have gh at about

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.050 
then I'm for GH in KH I have gh at about
I<00:01:25.229> think<00:01:26.270> seven<00:01:27.270> or<00:01:27.330> eight<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.979> on<00:01:28.979> KH<00:01:29.790> is

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
I think seven or eight and on KH is

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.310 
I think seven or eight and on KH is
about<00:01:30.390> four<00:01:30.780> pH<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.500> about<00:01:31.770> seven<00:01:32.310> point<00:01:32.729> six

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
about four pH is about seven point six

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.830 
about four pH is about seven point six
so<00:01:34.320> I'm<00:01:35.000> obviously<00:01:36.000> under<00:01:36.540> those<00:01:36.659> conditions

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
so I'm obviously under those conditions

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.780 
so I'm obviously under those conditions
they<00:01:37.290> do<00:01:37.350> really<00:01:37.619> well<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:37.890> Drive<00:01:38.280> for<00:01:38.990> I<00:01:39.990> use

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
they do really well I Drive for I use

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.149 
they do really well I Drive for I use
the<00:01:41.790> just<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.600> three<00:01:42.869> basics<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.619> then<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:43.920> use

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
the just the three basics and then I use

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.819 
the just the three basics and then I use
a<00:01:44.189> little<00:01:44.430> bit<00:01:44.610> iron<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.240> I'm<00:01:46.049> so<00:01:46.350> far<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:46.799> good

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
a little bit iron and I'm so far so good

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.770 
a little bit iron and I'm so far so good
and<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.460> can<00:01:47.610> see<00:01:47.820> from<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.180> results<00:01:48.329> that

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
and you can see from the results that

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.899 
and you can see from the results that
the<00:01:48.930> crypts<00:01:49.170> look<00:01:49.409> fantastic

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
the crypts look fantastic

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.120 
the crypts look fantastic
let<00:01:51.180> me<00:01:51.270> see<00:01:51.450> what<00:01:51.570> they<00:01:51.689> look<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:51.899> from<00:01:52.259> up

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
let me see what they look like from up

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.179 
let me see what they look like from up
here<00:01:53.460> well<00:01:54.140> waters<00:01:55.140> bad<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.740> can't<00:01:55.979> really

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
here well waters bad so you can't really

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.209 
here well waters bad so you can't really
tell<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.700> nice<00:01:57.570> little<00:01:57.810> turn<00:01:58.049> but<00:01:58.380> um<00:01:58.530> yeah<00:01:59.189> so

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
tell a nice little turn but um yeah so

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.910 
tell a nice little turn but um yeah so
if<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.549> guys<00:01:59.670> are<00:01:59.729> look<00:02:00.000> into<00:02:00.439> da<00:02:01.439> crypts

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
if you guys are look into da crypts

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.249 
if you guys are look into da crypts
looking<00:02:02.880> on<00:02:02.969> how<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.180> propagate<00:02:03.509> them<00:02:03.990> what

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
looking on how to propagate them what

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.709 
looking on how to propagate them what
you<00:02:04.500> know<00:02:04.590> what<00:02:04.770> conditions<00:02:05.219> work<00:02:05.430> well<00:02:05.719> right

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
you know what conditions work well right

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.330 
you know what conditions work well right
now<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.930> conditions<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.680> work<00:02:07.890> well<00:02:08.129> are

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
now the conditions that work well are

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.500 
now the conditions that work well are
slightly<00:02:09.030> soft<00:02:09.390> water<00:02:09.720> and<00:02:10.790> you<00:02:11.790> know<00:02:11.910> dry

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
slightly soft water and you know dry

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.760 
slightly soft water and you know dry
firts<00:02:12.810> decent<00:02:13.470> lady

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
so that's what's working for me um if

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.320 
so that's what's working for me um if
you<00:02:16.590> guys<00:02:16.710> have<00:02:16.980> harder<00:02:17.550> water<00:02:17.760> or<00:02:17.940> softer

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
you guys have harder water or softer

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.610 
you guys have harder water or softer
water<00:02:18.510> there's<00:02:18.780> stuff<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.020> can<00:02:19.260> add<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.530> the

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
water there's stuff you can add to the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.970 
water there's stuff you can add to the
water

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
water

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.760 
water
um<00:02:20.390> for<00:02:21.390> really<00:02:21.510> hard<00:02:21.780> water<00:02:21.990> I<00:02:22.110> would<00:02:22.260> add<00:02:22.500> RO

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
um for really hard water I would add RO

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.940 
um for really hard water I would add RO
water<00:02:23.130> to<00:02:23.760> get<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:24.000> down<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.270> the<00:02:24.680> KH<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.890> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
water to get it down to the KH and the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.280
