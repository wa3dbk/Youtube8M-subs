hi<00:00:01.110> everybody<00:00:01.380> this<00:00:01.709> is<00:00:02.159> the<00:00:02.280> first<00:00:02.550> video<00:00:02.850> in

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
hi everybody this is the first video in

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.430 
hi everybody this is the first video in
a<00:00:03.030> series<00:00:03.060> of<00:00:03.330> videos<00:00:03.629> dealing<00:00:03.840> with<00:00:04.080> the<00:00:04.140> ARMA

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
a series of videos dealing with the ARMA

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.380 
a series of videos dealing with the ARMA
box<00:00:04.680> assembly<00:00:05.279> and<00:00:05.640> just<00:00:05.850> putting<00:00:06.060> this<00:00:06.120> car

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
box assembly and just putting this car

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:07.909 
box assembly and just putting this car
together<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:06.960> so<00:00:07.170> we've<00:00:07.440> done<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.680> few

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
together and so we've done a few

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.190 
together and so we've done a few
assemblies<00:00:08.429> in<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.639> past<00:00:08.910> like<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.019> puzzle

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
assemblies in the past like the puzzle

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.930 
assemblies in the past like the puzzle
cubes<00:00:10.620> for<00:00:10.889> instance<00:00:11.219> we<00:00:11.370> put<00:00:11.550> our<00:00:11.639> puzzle

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
cubes for instance we put our puzzle

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.970 
cubes for instance we put our puzzle
cubes<00:00:12.179> together<00:00:12.360> using<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.080> flush<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.590> mate

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
cubes together using the flush and mate

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.880 
cubes together using the flush and mate
constraints<00:00:14.849> just<00:00:15.330> as<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> reminder<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:16.440> might

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
constraints just as a reminder you might

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.170 
constraints just as a reminder you might
and<00:00:17.070> by<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.190> way<00:00:17.340> your<00:00:17.520> menu<00:00:17.789> might<00:00:17.940> look<00:00:18.060> a

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
and by the way your menu might look a

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.090 
and by the way your menu might look a
little<00:00:18.210> bit<00:00:18.449> different<00:00:18.720> i'm<00:00:18.810> using<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.170> 2014

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
little bit different i'm using the 2014

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.830 
little bit different i'm using the 2014
version<00:00:20.310> of<00:00:20.550> inventor<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:21.060> it's<00:00:21.480> still<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
version of inventor but it's still the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.029 
version of inventor but it's still the
same<00:00:21.869> concept

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
same concept

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.130 
same concept
remember<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.730> mate<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.150> whenever<00:00:24.420> i<00:00:24.600> take<00:00:24.869> two

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
remember the mate is whenever i take two

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.320 
remember the mate is whenever i take two
faces<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.980> i<00:00:26.039> push<00:00:26.369> them<00:00:26.609> together<00:00:26.820> squeeze

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
faces and i push them together squeeze

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.790 
faces and i push them together squeeze
them<00:00:27.539> together<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:27.960> they<00:00:28.080> can't<00:00:28.289> move<00:00:28.410> apart

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
them together so they can't move apart

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.800 
them together so they can't move apart
and<00:00:28.980> flush<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.820> where<00:00:29.939> i<00:00:30.000> take<00:00:30.150> two<00:00:30.330> surfaces

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
and flush is where i take two surfaces

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.240 
and flush is where i take two surfaces
and<00:00:30.869> line<00:00:31.140> them<00:00:31.289> up<00:00:31.439> right<00:00:31.650> now<00:00:31.920> make<00:00:32.099> them

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
and line them up right now make them

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.220 
and line them up right now make them
flush<00:00:32.550> with<00:00:32.850> each<00:00:32.880> other<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.540> we're<00:00:34.079> going<00:00:34.170> to

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
flush with each other so we're going to

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.229 
flush with each other so we're going to
rely<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.530> lot<00:00:34.829> on<00:00:34.890> that<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.730> autumn<00:00:36.000> box

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
rely a lot on that in this autumn box

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.700 
rely a lot on that in this autumn box
assembly<00:00:36.570> I'll<00:00:36.989> have<00:00:37.200> some<00:00:37.380> later<00:00:37.590> videos

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
assembly I'll have some later videos

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.130 
assembly I'll have some later videos
dealing<00:00:38.579> with<00:00:38.700> angle<00:00:39.180> constraints<00:00:39.780> ordering

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
dealing with angle constraints ordering

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.440 
dealing with angle constraints ordering
this<00:00:40.290> menu<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.890> insert<00:00:41.760> constraints<00:00:42.329> which

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
this menu and insert constraints which

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.389 
this menu and insert constraints which
are<00:00:42.570> great<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:42.960> anything<00:00:43.200> circular<00:00:43.920> like<00:00:44.160> say

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
are great for anything circular like say

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.040 
are great for anything circular like say
for<00:00:44.460> instance<00:00:44.579> your<00:00:45.000> axles<00:00:45.360> wheels<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.899> tires

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
for instance your axles wheels and tires

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.690 
for instance your axles wheels and tires
okay<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.250> video<00:00:47.520> we're<00:00:47.640> gonna

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
okay but in this video we're gonna

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.880 
okay but in this video we're gonna
concentrate<00:00:48.059> on<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> flush<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.780> mate<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.289> so

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
concentrate on the flush and mate and so

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.709 
concentrate on the flush and mate and so
I<00:00:49.920> noticed<00:00:50.820> my<00:00:50.910> students<00:00:51.329> whenever<00:00:51.539> they're

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
I noticed my students whenever they're

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.150 
I noticed my students whenever they're
working<00:00:51.989> on<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.199> they<00:00:52.710> just<00:00:52.739> really

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
working on this they just really

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.560 
working on this they just really
struggle<00:00:53.520> with<00:00:53.640> like<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:53.940> one<00:00:54.149> block<00:00:54.390> at

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
struggle with like this one block at

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.160 
struggle with like this one block at
suck<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.530> shouldn't<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:55.890> hard<00:00:56.309> to

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
suck it and it shouldn't be that hard to

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.000 
suck it and it shouldn't be that hard to
should<00:00:58.170> be<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.379> hard<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.590> put<00:00:58.649> these<00:00:58.859> two

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
should be that hard to put these two

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.400 
should be that hard to put these two
things<00:00:59.219> together<00:00:59.370> okay<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:01.230> some

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
things together okay but it is for some

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.139 
things together okay but it is for some
reason<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.890> think<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.190> lot<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.609> probably<00:01:03.000> has

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
reason I think a lot of it probably has

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.979 
reason I think a lot of it probably has
to<00:01:03.180> do<00:01:03.359> with<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> fact<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.780> there's

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
to do with the fact that there's

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.960 
to do with the fact that there's
actually<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> lip<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.949> see<00:01:05.159> right<00:01:05.700> there's

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
actually a lip if you see right there's

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.609 
actually a lip if you see right there's
a<00:01:06.030> lip<00:01:06.240> on<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.479> front<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.780> this<00:01:06.869> green<00:01:07.110> surface

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
a lip on the front of this green surface

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.810 
a lip on the front of this green surface
and<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.860> kind<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.130> throws<00:01:08.310> things<00:01:08.549> off<00:01:08.790> a

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
and that kind of throws things off a

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.980 
and that kind of throws things off a
little<00:01:08.970> bit<00:01:09.240> and<00:01:09.390> then<00:01:09.479> there's<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.720> lot<00:01:09.869> of

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
little bit and then there's a lot of

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.750 
little bit and then there's a lot of
things<00:01:10.200> like<00:01:10.409> you're<00:01:10.560> trying<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.580> like

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
over here I've kind of expanded parts of

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.060 
over here I've kind of expanded parts of
it<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:24.810> basically<00:01:24.960> in<00:01:25.439> these<00:01:25.590> drop-down

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
it but basically in these drop-down

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.660 
it but basically in these drop-down
menus

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
menus

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.700 
menus
whenever<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.420> see<00:01:27.720> each<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.170> these<00:01:28.290> parts

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
whenever you see each of these parts

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.050 
whenever you see each of these parts
let's<00:01:29.009> go<00:01:29.159> back<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.460> what<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.670> looks<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:29.909> at

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
let's go back to what it looks like at

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.460 
let's go back to what it looks like at
the<00:01:30.119> beginning<00:01:30.240> you'll<00:01:30.900> see<00:01:31.049> something<00:01:31.380> like

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
the beginning you'll see something like

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.350 
the beginning you'll see something like
this<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:31.950> have<00:01:32.130> my<00:01:32.250> one<00:01:32.490> my<00:01:32.909> passenger

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
this and I have my one my passenger

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.480 
this and I have my one my passenger
section<00:01:33.600> my<00:01:33.810> one-block<00:01:34.170> socket<00:01:34.590> within<00:01:35.310> each

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
section my one-block socket within each

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.130 
section my one-block socket within each
of<00:01:35.520> these<00:01:35.759> if<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.090> expand<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> menu<00:01:36.750> there's<00:01:37.020> an

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
of these if I expand the menu there's an

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.350 
of these if I expand the menu there's an
Origin<00:01:37.560> folder<00:01:37.860> let's<00:01:38.700> go<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> step<00:01:38.939> farther

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
Origin folder let's go a step farther

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.240 
Origin folder let's go a step farther
and<00:01:39.689> expand<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> origin<00:01:40.740> folder<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.159> what

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
and expand the origin folder and what

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.639 
and expand the origin folder and what
you'll<00:01:41.400> notice<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.909> is<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.810> planes<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.500> were

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
you'll notice is is the planes that were

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.499 
you'll notice is is the planes that were
used<00:01:43.890> when<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.189> first<00:01:44.520> built<00:01:44.970> these<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
used when you first built these and the

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.240 
used when you first built these and the
reason<00:01:45.840> these<00:01:45.930> are<00:01:45.990> awesome<00:01:46.290> is<00:01:46.710> because<00:01:47.009> like

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
reason these are awesome is because like

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.340 
reason these are awesome is because like
in<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.520> case<00:01:47.790> see<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.240> plane<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.780> can

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
in this case see this plane I can

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.630 
in this case see this plane I can
right-click<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.040> can<00:01:50.220> make<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.490> visible

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
right-click and I can make it visible

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.630 
right-click and I can make it visible
and<00:01:51.200> now<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.229> have<00:01:52.680> a<00:01:52.710> plane<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.280> cuts<00:01:53.460> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
and now I have a plane that cuts the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.819 
and now I have a plane that cuts the
thing<00:01:53.820> right<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.210> half<00:01:54.420> I<00:01:54.720> also<00:01:55.290> have<00:01:55.619> well

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
thing right in half I also have well

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.200 
thing right in half I also have well
it's<00:01:55.979> not<00:01:56.130> gonna<00:01:56.250> do<00:01:56.460> me<00:01:56.579> much<00:01:56.700> good<00:01:56.759> but<00:01:57.090> look

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
it's not gonna do me much good but look

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.209 
it's not gonna do me much good but look
at<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.390> one<00:01:57.570> up<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.049> down<00:01:58.200> right<00:01:58.500> okay<00:01:59.070> it

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
at this one up and down right okay it

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.850 
at this one up and down right okay it
cuts<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.610> in<00:01:59.820> half<00:01:59.850> going<00:02:00.570> vertically<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.680> so

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
cuts it in half going vertically and so

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.800 
cuts it in half going vertically and so
if<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.040> look<00:02:02.219> at<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.490> from<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:02.759> side<00:02:02.820> here<00:02:03.659> I

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
if I look at it from this side here I

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.929 
if I look at it from this side here I
noticed<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.530> have<00:02:04.680> some<00:02:04.890> crosshairs<00:02:05.460> right<00:02:05.549> in

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
noticed I have some crosshairs right in

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.399 
noticed I have some crosshairs right in
the<00:02:06.030> middle<00:02:06.210> of<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.540> section<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.140> want

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
the middle of that section that I want

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:08.869 
the middle of that section that I want
to<00:02:07.469> use<00:02:07.649> right<00:02:07.979> right<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.550> middle<00:02:08.729> of<00:02:08.789> that

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
to use right right in the middle of that

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.300 
to use right right in the middle of that
cutout<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.899> if<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.200> come<00:02:10.410> over<00:02:10.440> here<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.129> I

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
cutout and if I come over here and I

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.770 
cutout and if I come over here and I
look<00:02:11.340> at<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.790> origin

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
look at the origin

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.660 
look at the origin
for<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.200> one<00:02:13.380> block<00:02:13.590> socket<00:02:14.070> look<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.400> got<00:02:14.550> the

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
for the one block socket look I got the

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.670 
for the one block socket look I got the
same<00:02:14.910> thing<00:02:15.210> right<00:02:15.510> sometimes<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.320> works<00:02:16.500> out

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
same thing right sometimes it works out

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.200 
same thing right sometimes it works out
that<00:02:16.740> way<00:02:17.040> sometimes<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:17.700> doesn't<00:02:17.910> sometimes

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
that way sometimes it doesn't sometimes

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.820 
that way sometimes it doesn't sometimes
you<00:02:18.570> have<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.750> go<00:02:18.840> create<00:02:19.140> your<00:02:19.230> own<00:02:19.500> work

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
you have to go create your own work

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.440 
you have to go create your own work
planes<00:02:20.220> that<00:02:20.550> cut<00:02:20.760> through<00:02:21.030> these<00:02:21.180> pieces

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
planes that cut through these pieces

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.720 
planes that cut through these pieces
okay<00:02:21.990> that's<00:02:22.710> very<00:02:22.800> easy<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.250> do<00:02:23.370> by<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.580> way

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
okay that's very easy to do by the way

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.490 
okay that's very easy to do by the way
let<00:02:23.940> me<00:02:23.970> just<00:02:24.060> I<00:02:24.420> know<00:02:24.870> I'm<00:02:25.080> getting<00:02:25.230> off<00:02:25.470> a

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
let me just I know I'm getting off a

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.930 
let me just I know I'm getting off a
little<00:02:25.770> bit<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.070> tangent<00:02:26.340> but<00:02:26.580> let<00:02:26.730> me<00:02:26.820> show

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
little bit of a tangent but let me show

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.370 
little bit of a tangent but let me show
you<00:02:27.030> how<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.180> create<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.480> new<00:02:27.660> work<00:02:27.810> plane<00:02:28.080> okay

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
you how to create a new work plane okay

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.020 
you how to create a new work plane okay
if<00:02:28.830> I<00:02:28.890> wanted<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.220> create<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.550> work<00:02:29.700> plan<00:02:29.940> on

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
if I wanted to create a work plan on

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.130 
if I wanted to create a work plan on
this<00:02:30.150> part<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.540> let's<00:02:30.660> say<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:30.959> just

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
this part and let's say that I just

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.260 
this part and let's say that I just
didn't<00:02:31.410> have<00:02:31.500> what<00:02:31.680> I<00:02:31.709> wanted<00:02:32.100> okay<00:02:32.310> I<00:02:32.670> go<00:02:33.150> and

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
didn't have what I wanted okay I go and

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.030 
didn't have what I wanted okay I go and
I<00:02:33.330> double<00:02:33.660> click<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.990> part<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.620> Grey's<00:02:34.860> out

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
I double click the part it Grey's out

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.530 
I double click the part it Grey's out
everything<00:02:35.400> else<00:02:35.520> see<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:35.940> it's<00:02:36.090> great<00:02:36.360> okay

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
everything else see that it's great okay

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.480 
everything else see that it's great okay
they're<00:02:37.200> all<00:02:37.230> grayed<00:02:37.650> out<00:02:37.680> over<00:02:38.010> here<00:02:38.190> as<00:02:38.310> well

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
they're all grayed out over here as well

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.820 
they're all grayed out over here as well
so<00:02:38.700> I'm<00:02:38.820> working<00:02:39.180> actually<00:02:39.540> on<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.990> IPT<00:02:40.560> file

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
so I'm working actually on the IPT file

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.590 
so I'm working actually on the IPT file
at<00:02:41.160> this<00:02:41.310> point<00:02:41.580> in<00:02:41.670> time<00:02:41.850> I'm<00:02:42.150> not<00:02:42.209> in<00:02:42.510> the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
at this point in time I'm not in the

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.720 
at this point in time I'm not in the
assembly<00:02:43.050> I'm<00:02:43.140> in<00:02:43.260> an<00:02:43.350> IP<00:02:43.530> T<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:44.070> I<00:02:44.459> can<00:02:44.610> go

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
assembly I'm in an IP T and I can go

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.580 
assembly I'm in an IP T and I can go
through<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.180> can<00:02:45.209> do<00:02:45.420> things<00:02:45.600> like<00:02:45.780> add<00:02:46.140> a

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
through and I can do things like add a

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.880 
through and I can do things like add a
work<00:02:46.830> plane<00:02:47.570> say<00:02:48.570> mid<00:02:49.080> plane<00:02:49.350> between<00:02:49.530> two

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
work plane say mid plane between two

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.500 
work plane say mid plane between two
very<00:02:50.130> long<00:02:50.310> planes<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:50.910> let's<00:02:51.060> say<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:51.270> want<00:02:51.480> to

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
very long planes and let's say I want to

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.900 
very long planes and let's say I want to
do<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:51.750> halfway<00:02:52.170> between<00:02:52.350> this<00:02:53.010> one<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:55.910> this

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
do it halfway between this one and this

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.150 
do it halfway between this one and this
one<00:02:56.970> here<00:02:57.540> right<00:02:57.780> so<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:57.989> just<00:02:58.320> created<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.980> new

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
one here right so I just created a new

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.740 
one here right so I just created a new
work<00:02:59.310> plane<00:02:59.640> that<00:02:59.820> cut<00:03:00.030> this<00:03:00.270> thing<00:03:00.540> this

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
work plane that cut this thing this

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.930 
work plane that cut this thing this
rectangular<00:03:01.230> half<00:03:01.560> cut<00:03:01.950> out<00:03:02.070> in<00:03:02.190> half<00:03:02.400> right

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
rectangular half cut out in half right

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.910 
rectangular half cut out in half right
something<00:03:03.450> that<00:03:03.570> didn't<00:03:03.780> exist<00:03:03.900> before<00:03:04.080> fact

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
something that didn't exist before fact

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.110 
something that didn't exist before fact
I'm<00:03:05.040> gonna<00:03:05.130> go<00:03:05.220> ahead<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.370> save<00:03:05.640> that<00:03:05.670> because

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
I'm gonna go ahead and save that because

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.490 
I'm gonna go ahead and save that because
we're<00:03:06.270> gonna<00:03:06.360> use<00:03:06.450> that<00:03:06.750> for<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:07.020> windshield

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
we're gonna use that for the windshield

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.370 
we're gonna use that for the windshield
later<00:03:07.770> on<00:03:07.950> that's<00:03:08.160> a<00:03:08.280> huge<00:03:08.489> hint<00:03:08.730> okay<00:03:09.030> so<00:03:10.020> when

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
later on that's a huge hint okay so when

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.920 
later on that's a huge hint okay so when
I'm<00:03:10.500> done<00:03:10.709> I<00:03:10.980> right-click<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:12.510> finished

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
I'm done I right-click and I finished

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.229 
I'm done I right-click and I finished
the<00:03:13.020> Edit<00:03:13.370> now<00:03:14.370> I'm<00:03:14.489> back<00:03:14.640> in<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:14.850> assembly

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
the Edit now I'm back in the assembly

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.570 
the Edit now I'm back in the assembly
file<00:03:15.390> right<00:03:15.690> so<00:03:16.470> now<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.980> whole<00:03:17.160> point<00:03:17.430> of

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
file right so now the whole point of

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.949 
file right so now the whole point of
this<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:18.030> whole<00:03:18.150> point<00:03:18.360> of<00:03:18.390> doing<00:03:18.480> this<00:03:18.720> work

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
this the whole point of doing this work

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.509 
this the whole point of doing this work
plane<00:03:19.260> thing<00:03:19.500> is<00:03:19.650> because<00:03:19.890> now<00:03:20.070> when<00:03:20.250> I<00:03:20.280> go<00:03:20.489> to

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
plane thing is because now when I go to

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.400 
plane thing is because now when I go to
constrain<00:03:21.150> instead<00:03:21.660> of<00:03:21.750> trying<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.049> constrain

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
constrain instead of trying to constrain

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:23.479 
constrain instead of trying to constrain
the<00:03:22.560> pieces<00:03:22.890> to<00:03:22.980> each<00:03:23.010> other<00:03:23.250> I'm<00:03:23.340> going<00:03:23.430> to

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
the pieces to each other I'm going to

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.910 
the pieces to each other I'm going to
constrain<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:23.850> work<00:03:24.060> planes<00:03:24.390> okay<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.230> so

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
constrain the work planes okay and so

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.009 
constrain the work planes okay and so
sorry<00:03:26.400> my<00:03:26.610> zoom<00:03:26.880> is<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.209> opposite<00:03:27.660> of<00:03:27.750> what<00:03:27.810> am

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
sorry my zoom is the opposite of what am

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.710 
sorry my zoom is the opposite of what am
i<00:03:28.080> school<00:03:28.470> computer<00:03:28.860> does<00:03:29.010> here<00:03:29.420> notice<00:03:30.420> that

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
i school computer does here notice that

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.330 
i school computer does here notice that
the<00:03:30.840> right<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.380> arrow<00:03:31.560> points<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.130> right

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
the right the arrow points to the right

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.310 
the right the arrow points to the right
here<00:03:32.580> okay<00:03:33.060> which<00:03:33.660> is<00:03:33.810> important<00:03:34.260> because

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
here okay which is important because

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.440 
here okay which is important because
when<00:03:34.590> I<00:03:34.680> go<00:03:34.830> hover<00:03:35.010> over<00:03:35.280> this<00:03:35.430> thing<00:03:35.700> see<00:03:36.420> how

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
when I go hover over this thing see how

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.990 
when I go hover over this thing see how
it<00:03:36.570> also<00:03:36.750> points<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.320> right<00:03:37.560> okay

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
it also points to the right okay

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.890 
it also points to the right okay
sometimes<00:03:39.000> you'll<00:03:39.269> put<00:03:39.450> these<00:03:39.570> two<00:03:39.720> work

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
sometimes you'll put these two work

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.150 
sometimes you'll put these two work
planes<00:03:40.170> together<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:40.680> it'll<00:03:40.769> turn<00:03:40.950> your

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
planes together and it'll turn your

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.979 
planes together and it'll turn your
pieces<00:03:41.400> around<00:03:41.670> that'll<00:03:42.269> be<00:03:42.329> backwards<00:03:42.810> from

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
pieces around that'll be backwards from

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.180 
pieces around that'll be backwards from
what<00:03:43.140> you<00:03:43.230> want<00:03:43.410> them<00:03:43.530> so<00:03:43.620> I<00:03:43.650> want<00:03:43.890> you<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.070> just

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
what you want them so I want you to just

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:46.100 
what you want them so I want you to just
watch<00:03:44.370> this<00:03:44.610> ready<00:03:44.910> I'm<00:03:45.120> on<00:03:45.540> mate<00:03:45.780> right<00:03:45.989> now

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
watch this ready I'm on mate right now

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.259 
watch this ready I'm on mate right now
if<00:03:46.290> I<00:03:46.350> click<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.680> flush<00:03:46.920> law<00:03:47.730> it<00:03:47.850> doesn't<00:03:48.060> do

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
if I click the flush law it doesn't do

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.160 
if I click the flush law it doesn't do
anything<00:03:48.600> right<00:03:48.780> now

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
anything right now

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.810 
anything right now
you<00:03:49.320> can't<00:03:49.530> see<00:03:49.769> it<00:03:49.860> right<00:03:50.010> now<00:03:50.040> you'll<00:03:50.579> see<00:03:50.730> it

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
you can't see it right now you'll see it

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.170 
you can't see it right now you'll see it
later<00:03:50.940> on<00:03:51.090> okay<00:03:51.450> we're<00:03:51.959> one<00:03:52.110> click<00:03:52.380> apply

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
later on okay we're one click apply

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.580 
later on okay we're one click apply
actually<00:03:54.180> it's<00:03:54.299> gonna<00:03:54.660> be<00:03:54.840> a<00:03:54.870> flush<00:03:55.170> because

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
actually it's gonna be a flush because

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.840 
actually it's gonna be a flush because
both<00:03:55.769> the<00:03:55.920> airs<00:03:56.070> are<00:03:56.280> pointing<00:03:56.519> to<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:56.700> right

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
both the airs are pointing to the right

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.400 
both the airs are pointing to the right
and<00:03:57.150> that's<00:03:57.209> the<00:03:57.480> situation<00:03:57.690> that<00:03:58.049> I<00:03:58.230> have

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
and that's the situation that I have

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.319 
and that's the situation that I have
here<00:03:58.650> right<00:03:58.860> I'm<00:03:59.549> gonna<00:03:59.640> click<00:03:59.850> apply

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
here right I'm gonna click apply

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.090 
here right I'm gonna click apply
okay<00:04:00.810> let<00:04:01.260> me<00:04:01.320> get<00:04:01.440> out<00:04:01.560> of<00:04:01.620> this<00:04:01.680> for<00:04:01.860> just<00:04:01.950> a

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
okay let me get out of this for just a

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.560 
okay let me get out of this for just a
second<00:04:02.459> show<00:04:02.610> you<00:04:02.670> what's<00:04:02.820> going<00:04:02.880> on<00:04:03.150> right<00:04:03.390> it

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
second show you what's going on right it

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.729 
second show you what's going on right it
looks<00:04:03.720> like<00:04:03.780> it's<00:04:03.989> moving<00:04:04.140> all<00:04:04.380> over<00:04:04.410> the

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
looks like it's moving all over the

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.710 
looks like it's moving all over the
place<00:04:04.980> but<00:04:05.610> just<00:04:05.850> understand<00:04:06.360> that<00:04:06.510> whenever

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
place but just understand that whenever

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.660 
place but just understand that whenever
I<00:04:06.870> go<00:04:07.019> to<00:04:07.049> a<00:04:07.170> front<00:04:07.440> view<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:07.829> can<00:04:08.190> see<00:04:08.340> that

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
I go to a front view I can see that

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.460 
I go to a front view I can see that
actually<00:04:09.090> those<00:04:09.299> those<00:04:09.720> two<00:04:09.900> work<00:04:10.019> planes<00:04:10.320> are

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
actually those those two work planes are

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.840 
actually those those two work planes are
lined<00:04:10.650> up<00:04:10.799> I<00:04:10.950> can't<00:04:11.160> move<00:04:11.310> it<00:04:11.459> left<00:04:11.670> to<00:04:11.760> right

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
lined up I can't move it left to right

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.300 
lined up I can't move it left to right
anymore<00:04:12.269> right<00:04:12.840> so<00:04:13.709> it's<00:04:13.829> an<00:04:13.920> optical

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
anymore right so it's an optical

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.479 
anymore right so it's an optical
illusion<00:04:14.690> let's<00:04:15.690> come<00:04:15.840> back<00:04:15.870> here<00:04:16.229> okay<00:04:16.829> let's

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
illusion let's come back here okay let's

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.340 
illusion let's come back here okay let's
do<00:04:17.669> the<00:04:17.790> same<00:04:18.000> thing<00:04:18.060> let's<00:04:18.510> constrain<00:04:19.079> now

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
do the same thing let's constrain now

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.409 
do the same thing let's constrain now
the<00:04:19.890> up<00:04:20.010> and<00:04:20.220> down<00:04:20.340> planes<00:04:20.729> right<00:04:21.030> so<00:04:21.299> let's

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
the up and down planes right so let's

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:24.770 
the up and down planes right so let's
come<00:04:21.599> over<00:04:21.630> here<00:04:22.820> there<00:04:23.849> this<00:04:24.180> one's<00:04:24.419> pointing

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
come over here there this one's pointing

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.720 
come over here there this one's pointing
up

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
up

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.150 
up
this<00:04:26.090> one<00:04:26.360> is<00:04:26.660> pointing<00:04:27.170> come<00:04:28.070> on<00:04:28.220> grab<00:04:28.640> it

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
this one is pointing come on grab it

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.630 
this one is pointing come on grab it
there<00:04:31.160> we<00:04:31.280> go

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
there we go

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.040 
there we go
that<00:04:31.790> one's<00:04:31.940> also<00:04:32.120> pointing<00:04:32.630> up<00:04:32.750> that<00:04:32.900> means

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
that one's also pointing up that means

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.600 
that one's also pointing up that means
this<00:04:33.230> is<00:04:33.380> gonna<00:04:33.560> be<00:04:33.680> a<00:04:33.710> flush<00:04:34.010> constraint<00:04:34.490> now

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
this is gonna be a flush constraint now

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.190 
this is gonna be a flush constraint now
look<00:04:34.820> what<00:04:35.030> happened<00:04:35.360> okay<00:04:35.600> right<00:04:35.840> now<00:04:35.990> I'm<00:04:36.110> on

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
look what happened okay right now I'm on

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.700 
look what happened okay right now I'm on
mate<00:04:37.600> let<00:04:38.600> me<00:04:38.720> move<00:04:38.870> these<00:04:39.050> things<00:04:39.290> there<00:04:39.620> we

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
mate let me move these things there we

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.760 
mate let me move these things there we
go<00:04:39.860> okay<00:04:40.280> right<00:04:41.150> now<00:04:41.270> it's<00:04:41.420> on<00:04:41.540> mate<00:04:41.780> and<00:04:42.080> it

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
go okay right now it's on mate and it

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.050 
go okay right now it's on mate and it
turned<00:04:42.980> around<00:04:43.070> backwards<00:04:43.460> and<00:04:43.940> that's

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
turned around backwards and that's

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.310 
turned around backwards and that's
really<00:04:44.210> frustrating<00:04:44.840> but<00:04:44.930> if<00:04:45.020> I<00:04:45.080> come<00:04:45.290> over

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
really frustrating but if I come over

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.650 
really frustrating but if I come over
here<00:04:45.530> and<00:04:45.680> I<00:04:45.800> click<00:04:45.980> on<00:04:46.100> flush<00:04:46.370> oh<00:04:46.640> okay<00:04:47.480> look

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
here and I click on flush oh okay look

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.460 
here and I click on flush oh okay look
it<00:04:47.930> was<00:04:48.080> fine

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
it was fine

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.870 
it was fine
all<00:04:48.530> right<00:04:48.710> okay<00:04:49.100> so<00:04:49.160> what<00:04:49.370> happened<00:04:49.730> it<00:04:49.790> was

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
all right okay so what happened it was

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.550 
all right okay so what happened it was
upside<00:04:50.240> down<00:04:50.270> and<00:04:50.660> that<00:04:50.750> caused<00:04:50.990> my<00:04:51.230> arrows

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
upside down and that caused my arrows

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:52.780 
upside down and that caused my arrows
look<00:04:51.800> at<00:04:51.890> my<00:04:51.980> arrows<00:04:52.250> they're<00:04:52.370> opposite

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:52.790 
look at my arrows they're opposite

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.390 
look at my arrows they're opposite
directions<00:04:53.060> down<00:04:53.510> and<00:04:53.840> up<00:04:53.960> I<00:04:54.170> really<00:04:55.130> want<00:04:55.310> her

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
directions down and up I really want her

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.800 
directions down and up I really want her
to<00:04:55.520> be<00:04:55.640> up<00:04:55.850> and<00:04:56.090> up<00:04:56.180> because<00:04:56.300> that's<00:04:56.600> the<00:04:56.690> way

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
to be up and up because that's the way

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.640 
to be up and up because that's the way
it<00:04:56.900> was<00:04:57.020> when<00:04:57.170> I<00:04:57.260> chose<00:04:57.470> him<00:04:57.620> so<00:04:58.570> why<00:04:59.570> now<00:05:00.440> all<00:05:00.470> I

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
it was when I chose him so why now all I

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.930 
it was when I chose him so why now all I
have<00:05:00.800> to<00:05:00.830> do<00:05:01.010> is<00:05:01.130> get<00:05:01.280> this<00:05:01.400> thing<00:05:01.460> to<00:05:01.790> be

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
have to do is get this thing to be

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:03.670 
have to do is get this thing to be
inserted<00:05:02.450> into<00:05:02.660> it<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:03.110> correct<00:05:03.350> amount

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
inserted into it the correct amount

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.920 
inserted into it the correct amount
right<00:05:03.980> the<00:05:04.580> correct<00:05:04.970> depth<00:05:05.270> right<00:05:05.570> now<00:05:05.720> I<00:05:05.750> can

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
right the correct depth right now I can

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.840 
right the correct depth right now I can
move<00:05:06.080> in<00:05:06.170> and<00:05:06.320> out<00:05:06.410> and<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:07.430> easiest<00:05:07.670> way<00:05:07.820> to

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
move in and out and the easiest way to

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.310 
move in and out and the easiest way to
do<00:05:08.030> that<00:05:08.180> I<00:05:08.420> don't<00:05:08.600> need<00:05:08.690> a<00:05:08.720> work<00:05:08.900> plane<00:05:09.140> for

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
do that I don't need a work plane for

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.780 
do that I don't need a work plane for
that<00:05:09.440> let's<00:05:09.620> just<00:05:09.770> do<00:05:09.920> a<00:05:09.950> flush<00:05:10.310> and<00:05:10.340> let's<00:05:10.670> get

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:10.790 
that let's just do a flush and let's get

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.590 
that let's just do a flush and let's get
the<00:05:10.910> front<00:05:11.180> two<00:05:11.330> faces<00:05:11.780> right<00:05:12.140> here<00:05:12.410> and<00:05:13.600> right

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
the front two faces right here and right

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.110 
the front two faces right here and right
yeah<00:05:15.530> let's<00:05:16.220> zoom<00:05:16.460> in<00:05:16.730> a<00:05:16.790> little<00:05:16.880> bit<00:05:17.090> right

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
yeah let's zoom in a little bit right

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.190 
yeah let's zoom in a little bit right
there<00:05:17.300> those<00:05:18.290> two<00:05:18.320> faces<00:05:18.860> need<00:05:19.100> to<00:05:19.190> be<00:05:19.280> flush

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
there those two faces need to be flush

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.770 
there those two faces need to be flush
get<00:05:21.200> out<00:05:21.380> let's<00:05:21.650> go<00:05:21.770> back<00:05:21.920> to<00:05:22.070> our<00:05:22.160> home<00:05:22.340> view

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
get out let's go back to our home view

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.020 
get out let's go back to our home view
voila<00:05:23.900> it's<00:05:24.200> done<00:05:24.380> right<00:05:24.620> and<00:05:25.490> what<00:05:25.910> I<00:05:25.940> would

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
voila it's done right and what I would

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.610 
voila it's done right and what I would
suggest<00:05:26.210> to<00:05:26.540> you<00:05:26.720> so<00:05:26.960> that's<00:05:27.140> using<00:05:27.320> work

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
suggest to you so that's using work

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.050 
suggest to you so that's using work
planes<00:05:27.920> to<00:05:28.070> make<00:05:28.190> constraints<00:05:28.700> that<00:05:28.850> thing<00:05:28.970> is

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.060 
planes to make constraints that thing is

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.790 
planes to make constraints that thing is
a<00:05:29.090> lot<00:05:29.240> completely<00:05:29.750> in<00:05:29.870> place<00:05:29.990> that's<00:05:30.350> awesome

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
a lot completely in place that's awesome

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.200 
a lot completely in place that's awesome
I'm<00:05:30.920> done<00:05:31.160> with<00:05:31.280> that<00:05:31.340> part<00:05:31.640> it<00:05:31.910> only<00:05:32.030> took

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
I'm done with that part it only took

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.200 
I'm done with that part it only took
three<00:05:32.270> or<00:05:32.630> four<00:05:32.900> clicks<00:05:33.200> which<00:05:33.680> is

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
three or four clicks which is

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.250 
three or four clicks which is
significantly<00:05:35.210> less<00:05:35.420> than<00:05:35.480> what<00:05:35.810> many<00:05:36.020> of<00:05:36.170> my

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
significantly less than what many of my

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.510 
significantly less than what many of my
students<00:05:36.620> would<00:05:36.740> take<00:05:36.770> the<00:05:37.070> first<00:05:37.190> time<00:05:37.400> they

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
students would take the first time they

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.190 
students would take the first time they
would<00:05:37.640> do<00:05:37.730> it<00:05:37.880> and<00:05:38.090> it's<00:05:38.690> really<00:05:38.930> going<00:05:39.080> to<00:05:39.140> be

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
would do it and it's really going to be

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.360 
would do it and it's really going to be
helpful<00:05:39.470> when<00:05:39.740> you<00:05:39.860> get<00:05:39.980> them<00:05:40.070> to<00:05:40.190> more

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
helpful when you get them to more

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
between two parallel planes and let's

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.899 
between two parallel planes and let's
get<00:06:49.289> it<00:06:49.379> between<00:06:49.500> I<00:06:49.860> need<00:06:50.039> an<00:06:50.159> ankle<00:06:50.430> view<00:06:50.699> hold

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:06.990 
crosshairs in the bottom of the little

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.230 
crosshairs in the bottom of the little
rectangle<00:07:07.560> right<00:07:07.740> here<00:07:07.800> so<00:07:08.759> I<00:07:08.789> can<00:07:08.879> line

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240
