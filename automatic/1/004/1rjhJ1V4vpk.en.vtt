00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:41.719 
growing up all over the land and then

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:46.089 
growing up all over the land and then
the<00:02:42.620> last<00:02:42.859> plant<00:02:43.310> I<00:02:43.549> have<00:02:43.879> in<00:02:44.060> here<00:02:44.389> is<00:02:45.099> these

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099 
the last plant I have in here is these

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.209 
the last plant I have in here is these
little<00:02:46.719> vine<00:02:47.719> kind<00:02:48.200> of<00:02:48.290> things<00:02:48.500> that<00:02:48.950> are<00:02:49.099> in

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:49.219 
little vine kind of things that are in

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.959 
little vine kind of things that are in
the<00:02:49.340> water<00:02:50.260> which<00:02:51.260> grow<00:02:51.829> really<00:02:52.219> fast<00:02:52.370> with

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:52.969 
the water which grow really fast with

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.929 
the water which grow really fast with
all<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.269> sunlight<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.930> get<00:02:54.139> in<00:02:54.319> this<00:02:54.469> tank<00:02:54.939> so

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:55.939 
all the sunlight I get in this tank so

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:59.379 
all the sunlight I get in this tank so
there's<00:02:56.150> just<00:02:56.359> a<00:02:56.420> ton<00:02:56.599> of<00:02:56.659> this<00:02:56.900> in<00:02:57.049> here<00:02:58.389> and

00:02:59.379 --> 00:02:59.389 
there's just a ton of this in here and

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:03.759 
there's just a ton of this in here and
then<00:02:59.919> also<00:03:00.919> in<00:03:01.280> here<00:03:01.519> I<00:03:01.730> have<00:03:02.500> over<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.530> hundred

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
then also in here I have over a hundred

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.050 
then also in here I have over a hundred
Guppies<00:03:04.430> they're<00:03:04.879> just<00:03:04.909> breeding<00:03:05.659> super<00:03:06.470> fast

Guppies they're just breeding super fast

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:09.699 
Guppies they're just breeding super fast
you<00:03:08.060> can<00:03:08.239> kind<00:03:08.389> of<00:03:08.540> see<00:03:08.599> them<00:03:08.959> I'm<00:03:09.349> swimming

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
you can kind of see them I'm swimming

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.629 
you can kind of see them I'm swimming
all<00:03:09.980> over<00:03:10.280> back<00:03:10.459> under<00:03:11.090> there<00:03:12.129> but<00:03:13.129> yeah

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:13.639 
all over back under there but yeah

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:16.119 
all over back under there but yeah
there's<00:03:13.969> definitely<00:03:14.510> over<00:03:15.319> 100<00:03:15.709> Guppies<00:03:16.099> in

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
there's definitely over 100 Guppies in

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:21.159 
there's definitely over 100 Guppies in
here<00:03:18.219> because<00:03:19.219> the<00:03:20.090> one<00:03:20.329> turtle<00:03:20.599> I<00:03:20.750> have<00:03:20.989> in

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
here because the one turtle I have in

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:27.220 
here because the one turtle I have in
here<00:03:21.500> doesn't<00:03:22.219> really<00:03:22.579> eat<00:03:23.120> Guppies<00:03:23.540> a<00:03:23.569> lot<00:03:26.230> so

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
here doesn't really eat Guppies a lot so

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.500 
here doesn't really eat Guppies a lot so
that<00:03:27.739> brings<00:03:27.950> me<00:03:28.159> to<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.639> next<00:03:28.669> study<00:03:29.150> which

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
them to hide in a lot of places for them

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.339 
them to hide in a lot of places for them
to<00:04:05.180> just<00:04:05.299> sit<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:05.930> stick<00:04:06.650> their<00:04:06.829> head<00:04:06.979> out<00:04:08.349> so

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
to just sit and stick their head out so

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.270 
to just sit and stick their head out so
then<00:04:09.680> in<00:04:10.099> here<00:04:10.459> i<00:04:10.489> also<00:04:10.790> have<00:04:11.180> I<00:04:11.629> think<00:04:12.079> 100<00:04:13.009> or

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
then in here i also have I think 100 or

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.409 
then in here i also have I think 100 or
150<00:04:13.939> watt<00:04:14.299> here<00:04:14.750> down<00:04:15.079> there<00:04:15.609> and<00:04:16.609> then<00:04:17.030> I<00:04:17.329> also

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
150 watt here down there and then I also

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.729 
150 watt here down there and then I also
have<00:04:17.989> a<00:04:19.449> filter<00:04:20.449> in<00:04:20.720> here<00:04:21.019> which<00:04:21.409> you<00:04:21.560> can<00:04:21.709> see

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
have a filter in here which you can see

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.879 
have a filter in here which you can see
them<00:04:22.099> in<00:04:22.280> kind<00:04:22.520> of<00:04:22.780> but<00:04:23.780> i<00:04:24.020> think<00:04:24.590> it's<00:04:24.770> the

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:24.889 
them in kind of but i think it's the

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.460 
them in kind of but i think it's the
fluval<00:04:25.580> 3<00:04:26.060> plus<00:04:26.360> maybe<00:04:27.289> the<00:04:27.650> four<00:04:27.860> plus<00:04:28.870> but<00:04:29.870> so

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
fluval 3 plus maybe the four plus but so

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.840 
fluval 3 plus maybe the four plus but so
that's<00:04:30.650> pretty<00:04:31.159> much

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
that's pretty much

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.850 
that's pretty much
it
