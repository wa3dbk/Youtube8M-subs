00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.110
 He is Carlos Moreno at 46 years old. 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.290
 had to face the problem of the 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.360
 baldness for me was something terrible is not 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.490
 vanity is more a matter of pride 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.200
 personal I thought that it only happened to 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.930
 the people to the people who had 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.880
 between 50 and 60 years of age but when 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.720
 I began to realize that I had some 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.449
 sites that I lacked hair and here 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.850
 I started to worry about the issue of 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:40.220
 Alopecia in Carlos is genetic as in 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.170
 the vast majority of men but he 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.769
 I expected this to happen at a stage 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.960
 most advanced of your life if my dad and my 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:49.549
 maternal grandfather were bald but I did not 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.320
 I paid a lot of attention but with my day 

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:54.350
 friends started to bother telling me 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.930
 that my head looked like a 60-year-old 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.850
 years I started to worry was so much for 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.489
 marc that he had that he used caps 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.739
 I look at the studio I started to feel that 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:08.130
 I was missing some hair in me 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.439
 in my head fortunately Carlos 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.470
 met capi I followed a novel product 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.560
 that contains stem cells extracted with 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.539
 the most modern Swiss capital technology 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.479
 helps recovery and the 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:24.600
 hair strengthening I met him because 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.330
 when the friends bothered me that 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.460
 called me bald he recommended me and I can 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.340
 say that it serves in the parts that had 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.560
 the clearings I had in my head and here 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.159
 I can say what product really serves 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.619
 100% natural capital is made with 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.170
 the highest Swiss technology what has 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.030
 allowed to extract the stem cells with 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.729
 the regenerative properties of 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.100
 hair follicle studies in switzerland 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.140
 they prove it by feeding the 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.090
 stem cells of the hair bulb that are 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.330
 Those responsible for producing new hair 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.149
 the follicle is recovered in only 14 days 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.369
 you were given something sacred 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.560
 every morning after showering the 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:09.679
 articulation of cancer in the hair 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.679
 it was perfectly to love me calm
