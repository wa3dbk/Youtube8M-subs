that<00:00:42.329> was<00:00:42.540> one<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> combos<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.530> was<00:00:43.620> pretty

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
that was one of the combos it was pretty

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.010 
that was one of the combos it was pretty
heavily<00:00:44.520> favored<00:00:45.210> last<00:00:45.390> time<00:00:45.600> around<00:00:45.719> and

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
heavily favored last time around and

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.690 
heavily favored last time around and
actually<00:00:46.140> looks<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:46.739> team<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.190> so<00:00:47.250> gone<00:00:47.550> for

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
actually looks like team I so gone for

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.510 
actually looks like team I so gone for
the<00:00:47.760> double<00:00:48.090> 8d<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.620> big<00:00:49.710> strategy

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
the double 8d so this is a big strategy

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.799 
the double 8d so this is a big strategy
by<00:00:50.670> both<00:00:50.910> teams<00:00:50.940> obviously<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.629> range

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
by both teams obviously the range

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.540 
by both teams obviously the range
advantage<00:00:51.960> with<00:00:52.410> ice<00:00:52.559> but<00:00:52.829> there's<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.280> big

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
advantage with ice but there's a big

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.760 
advantage with ice but there's a big
kill<00:00:53.879> Lane<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.390> any<00:00:54.600> brand<00:00:54.899> yeah<00:00:55.379> it's<00:00:55.620> gonna

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
kill Lane in any brand yeah it's gonna

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.840 
kill Lane in any brand yeah it's gonna
be<00:00:55.949> fire<00:00:56.250> versus<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.030> guess<00:00:57.210> purple<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.230> long

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
be fire versus I guess purple is so long

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.630 
be fire versus I guess purple is so long
if<00:00:59.850> we<00:00:59.879> want<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.239> stretch<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.780> but<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:02.129> fire

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
if we want to stretch it but this fire

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.179 
if we want to stretch it but this fire
lane<00:01:03.059> actually<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.960> believe<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.320> was<00:01:04.500> used<00:01:04.890> in

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
lane actually I believe it was used in

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.000 
lane actually I believe it was used in
competitive<00:01:05.580> play<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:06.150> Korea<00:01:06.860> money<00:01:07.860> will

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
competitive play in Korea money will

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.780 
competitive play in Korea money will
correct<00:01:08.220> me<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.369> I'm<00:01:08.460> wrong<00:01:08.490> but<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.760> think

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
correct me if I'm wrong but I think

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.380 
correct me if I'm wrong but I think
frost<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.720> kt<00:01:10.680> rolster<00:01:10.920> used<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.760> actually

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
frost and kt rolster used it actually

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.530 
frost and kt rolster used it actually
and<00:01:13.369> one<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.580> teams<00:01:14.790> want<00:01:15.030> with<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.360> I

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
and one of the teams want with it I

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.109 
and one of the teams want with it I
think<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.409> was<00:01:16.470> rolster<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
think it was rolster that one so the

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.289 
think it was rolster that one so the
great<00:01:18.360> thing<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.990> course<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.500> you've<00:01:19.680> got

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
great thing is of course that you've got

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.120 
great thing is of course that you've got
masses<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.330> stone<00:01:21.509> going<00:01:22.290> in<00:01:22.409> there<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.830> some

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
masses of stone going in there and some

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.310 
masses of stone going in there and some
really<00:01:23.759> focused<00:01:24.360> our<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:24.840> specially<00:01:25.200> when

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
really focused our just specially when

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.710 
really focused our just specially when
he<00:01:25.409> gets<00:01:25.590> level<00:01:25.920> six<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.310> back<00:01:26.729> okay<00:01:27.299> Gangnam

he gets level six and back okay Gangnam
one<00:01:27.900> shoulders<00:01:28.290> up<00:01:28.439> maybe<00:01:28.680> we're<00:01:28.979> not<00:01:29.159> gonna

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
one shoulders up maybe we're not gonna

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.890 
one shoulders up maybe we're not gonna
see<00:01:29.520> too<00:01:29.700> much<00:01:29.880> level<00:01:30.240> six<00:01:30.479> playing<00:01:30.750> these

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900

games<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.740> second<00:01:32.189> one<00:01:32.310> said<00:01:32.640> okay<00:01:33.329> we

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
games the second one said okay we

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.420 
games the second one said okay we
probably<00:01:33.780> are<00:01:34.049> good<00:01:34.200> as<00:01:34.259> an<00:01:34.439> thinking<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.950> 2v2

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
probably are good as an thinking the 2v2

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.370 
probably are good as an thinking the 2v2
when<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.970> have<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.240> get<00:01:36.390> two<00:01:36.659> kills<00:01:37.020> rather

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
when you have to get two kills rather

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.170
