00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.650 
we're a lot better at corp than we were
in<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.949> first<00:00:20.130> episode<00:00:20.310> like<00:00:20.730> we<00:00:21.510> were

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
in the first episode like we were

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.029 
in the first episode like we were
actually<00:00:21.810> pretty<00:00:22.050> bad<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.470> first<00:00:22.650> episode

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
actually pretty bad the first episode

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.070 
actually pretty bad the first episode
for<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.340> first<00:00:23.519> like<00:00:23.730> 70<00:00:24.180> kills<00:00:24.390> and<00:00:24.600> then<00:00:24.990> we

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
for the first like 70 kills and then we

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.380 
for the first like 70 kills and then we
kind<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.410> got<00:00:25.529> used<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:25.949> after<00:00:26.189> like<00:00:26.820> skill

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
kind of got used to it after like skill

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.349 
kind of got used to it after like skill
number<00:00:27.599> 72<00:00:28.170> or<00:00:28.320> something<00:00:28.590> like<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.760> but<00:00:29.760> now

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
number 72 or something like that but now

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.030 
number 72 or something like that but now
we're<00:00:30.539> much<00:00:30.900> better<00:00:30.929> with<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.470> core<00:00:31.710> much

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
we're much better with the core much

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.310 
we're much better with the core much
better<00:00:32.250> with<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.550> corp<00:00:32.790> we're<00:00:33.329> dying<00:00:33.870> much

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
better with the corp we're dying much

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.380 
better with the corp we're dying much
less<00:00:34.590> than<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:34.860> did<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.130> first<00:00:35.309> episode<00:00:35.460> so

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
less than we did in the first episode so

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.540 
less than we did in the first episode so
everything's<00:00:36.899> going<00:00:37.140> well<00:00:37.260> with<00:00:37.380> corp<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.890> if

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
everything's going well with corp and if

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.590 
everything's going well with corp and if
you<00:00:38.670> guys<00:00:38.760> are<00:00:38.910> wondering<00:00:39.030> each<00:00:39.390> episode

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
you guys are wondering each episode

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.290 
you guys are wondering each episode
takes<00:00:40.170> around<00:00:40.710> five<00:00:41.070> hours<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.579> kill<00:00:41.760> 100

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
takes around five hours to kill 100

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.970 
takes around five hours to kill 100
obviously<00:00:42.930> some<00:00:43.140> kills<00:00:43.350> are<00:00:43.469> faster<00:00:43.800> some

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
obviously some kills are faster some

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.369 
obviously some kills are faster some
kills<00:00:44.190> are<00:00:44.340> slower<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.809> if<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.079> do<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
kills are slower and if you do the

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.290 
kills are slower and if you do the
fastest<00:00:46.800> kills<00:00:47.039> per<00:00:47.280> hour<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.820> entire<00:00:48.059> time

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
fastest kills per hour the entire time

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.670 
fastest kills per hour the entire time
it<00:00:48.510> probably<00:00:48.660> would<00:00:48.960> be<00:00:48.989> only<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.410> four

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
it probably would be only like four

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.920 
it probably would be only like four
hours<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:50.370> we're<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:50.969> including<00:00:51.420> bank<00:00:51.690> time

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
hours but we're like including bank time

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.470 
hours but we're like including bank time
on<00:00:52.260> any<00:00:52.969> discrepancies<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.000> our<00:00:54.270> kills

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
on any discrepancies in our kills

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.600 
on any discrepancies in our kills
anything<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.710> yeah<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:56.489> has<00:00:56.579> a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
anything like that so yeah just has a

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.160 
anything like that so yeah just has a
rule<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.850> thumb<00:00:57.090> each<00:00:57.329> episode<00:00:57.510> takes<00:00:57.899> five

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
rule of thumb each episode takes five

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.349 
rule of thumb each episode takes five
hours<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.770> so<00:00:58.949> yeah<00:00:59.460> at<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.730> end<00:00:59.760> justified

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
hours to do so yeah at the end justified

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.260 
hours to do so yeah at the end justified
by<00:01:00.809> how<00:01:01.410> many<00:01:01.469> hours<00:01:02.070> we've<00:01:02.550> done<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.059> that's

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
by how many hours we've done and that's

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.509 
by how many hours we've done and that's
the<00:01:03.480> hourly<00:01:03.840> profit<00:01:04.290> as<00:01:04.409> for<00:01:04.830> any<00:01:04.979> rare<00:01:05.220> drops

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the hourly profit as for any rare drops

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.399 
the hourly profit as for any rare drops
this<00:01:05.700> up<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.030> there<00:01:06.270> wasn't<00:01:06.570> really<00:01:06.810> any<00:01:07.080> just

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
this up so there wasn't really any just

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.170 
this up so there wasn't really any just
like<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.619> first<00:01:07.799> episode<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.520> did<00:01:08.729> get<00:01:08.909> one

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
like the first episode we did get one

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.789 
like the first episode we did get one
holy<00:01:09.450> elixir<00:01:09.930> though<00:01:10.080> which<00:01:10.380> was<00:01:10.590> kind<00:01:10.770> of

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
holy elixir though which was kind of

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.080 
holy elixir though which was kind of
cool<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.130> was<00:01:11.189> actually<00:01:11.369> really<00:01:11.520> early<00:01:11.939> on<00:01:12.060> i

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
cool that was actually really early on i

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.570 
cool that was actually really early on i
think<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.510> was<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.890> within<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.100> first<00:01:14.280> 20

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
think it was in within the first 20

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.219 
think it was in within the first 20
kills<00:01:14.790> or<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.570> was<00:01:15.659> actually<00:01:15.900> kind<00:01:16.200> of

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
kills or so so that was actually kind of

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.320 
kills or so so that was actually kind of
cool<00:01:16.380> obviously<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:17.310> not<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.460> sigil<00:01:17.670> but<00:01:18.150> you

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
cool obviously it's not a sigil but you

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.330 
cool obviously it's not a sigil but you
really<00:01:18.479> can't<00:01:18.659> complain<00:01:18.930> i<00:01:19.049> mean<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.619> 800<00:01:20.159> k

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
really can't complain i mean it is 800 k

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.130 
really can't complain i mean it is 800 k
and<00:01:20.580> that's<00:01:21.180> nothing<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.810> complain<00:01:22.020> about

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
and that's nothing to complain about

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.050 
and that's nothing to complain about
because<00:01:22.770> we<00:01:23.130> do<00:01:23.490> want<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.820> get<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
because we do want to get the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.760 
because we do want to get the
cannonballs<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.780> onyx<00:01:25.200> bolts<00:01:25.470> which<00:01:25.619> are

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
cannonballs and onyx bolts which are

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.440 
cannonballs and onyx bolts which are
relatively<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.430> same<00:01:26.549> amount<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:27.000> price<00:01:27.180> as

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
relatively the same amount of price as

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.530 
relatively the same amount of price as
the<00:01:28.020> holy<00:01:28.170> elixir<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.280> puts<00:01:29.520> us<00:01:29.610> at<00:01:29.850> two

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
the holy elixir so that puts us at two

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.319 
the holy elixir so that puts us at two

holy elixirs now and as for other drops

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.230 
holy elixirs now and as for other drops
we<00:01:33.509> did<00:01:33.689> get<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.560> ton<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.799> Onyx<00:01:35.430> bolt<00:01:35.670> drops

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
we did get a ton of Onyx bolt drops

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.060 
we did get a ton of Onyx bolt drops
like<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.170> first<00:01:37.350> episode<00:01:37.500> we<00:01:37.799> only<00:01:37.920> got

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
like in the first episode we only got

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.039 
like in the first episode we only got
two<00:01:38.280> but<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.670> this<00:01:38.759> episode<00:01:38.909> we<00:01:39.270> added<00:01:39.570> four<00:01:39.930> to

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
two but in this episode we added four to

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.050 
two but in this episode we added four to
that<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.650> was<00:01:40.799> pretty<00:01:41.070> lucky<00:01:41.549> for<00:01:41.790> onyx

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
that so that was pretty lucky for onyx

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.030 
that so that was pretty lucky for onyx
bolts<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.570> we<00:01:42.869> got<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.140> same<00:01:43.350> amount<00:01:43.619> of

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
bolts and we got the same amount of

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.590 
bolts and we got the same amount of
cannonballs<00:01:44.640> as<00:01:45.000> we<00:01:45.119> did<00:01:45.270> in<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> first

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
cannonballs as we did in the first

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.600 
cannonballs as we did in the first

tan is awesome level 99 anyways oh no

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.289 
tan is awesome level 99 anyways oh no
corp<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.829> pretty<00:02:02.040> fun<00:02:02.219> I'd<00:02:02.399> say<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.820> mean<00:02:03.090> I

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
corp is pretty fun I'd say I mean I

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.060 
corp is pretty fun I'd say I mean I
haven't<00:02:03.869> really<00:02:04.140> gotten<00:02:04.290> bored<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:04.710> yet<00:02:04.890> it

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
haven't really gotten bored of it yet it

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.100 
haven't really gotten bored of it yet it
just<00:02:05.340> can<00:02:05.700> be<00:02:05.820> tedious<00:02:06.000> after<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.630> while<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.960> mean

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
just can be tedious after a while I mean

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.570 
just can be tedious after a while I mean
it's<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.320> same<00:02:07.590> mechanics<00:02:08.160> over<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.520> over

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
it's the same mechanics over and over

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.979 
it's the same mechanics over and over
and<00:02:08.729> over<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.090> he's<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.239> really<00:02:09.479> simple<00:02:09.840> boss

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
and over and he's a really simple boss

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.600 
and over and he's a really simple boss
so<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:10.319> not<00:02:10.440> like<00:02:10.649> anything's<00:02:11.099> different<00:02:11.310> or

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
so it's not like anything's different or

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.050 
so it's not like anything's different or
anything

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
anything

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.880 
anything
the<00:02:12.330> only<00:02:12.540> hard<00:02:12.840> part<00:02:12.959> of<00:02:13.290> corporate<00:02:13.590> base<00:02:13.680> is

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
the only hard part of corporate base is

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.500 
the only hard part of corporate base is
really<00:02:14.130> the<00:02:14.280> core<00:02:14.580> when<00:02:14.760> he<00:02:14.819> comes<00:02:14.970> out<00:02:15.150> but

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
really the core when he comes out but

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.790 
really the core when he comes out but
I've<00:02:15.630> noticed<00:02:15.959> we've<00:02:16.110> gotten<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.500> core

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
I've noticed we've gotten the core

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.860 
I've noticed we've gotten the core
pretty<00:02:17.280> late<00:02:17.610> on<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:17.940> kills<00:02:18.150> usually<00:02:18.569> like

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
pretty late on the kills usually like

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.050 
pretty late on the kills usually like
the<00:02:19.319> earliest<00:02:19.739> we've<00:02:19.860> gotten<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.280> maybe<00:02:20.640> was<00:02:20.940> I

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
the earliest we've gotten it maybe was I

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.660 
the earliest we've gotten it maybe was I
think<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.390> DK<00:02:21.720> I'm<00:02:22.590> is<00:02:22.739> super<00:02:23.040> early<00:02:23.160> but<00:02:23.550> we

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
think a DK I'm is super early but we

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.880 
think a DK I'm is super early but we
don't<00:02:23.819> get<00:02:23.940> that<00:02:23.970> often<00:02:24.450> and<00:02:24.690> but<00:02:25.680> for<00:02:25.830> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
don't get that often and but for the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.309 
don't get that often and but for the
most<00:02:26.010> part<00:02:26.099> we<00:02:26.340> get<00:02:26.459> it<00:02:26.550> around<00:02:26.790> 42<00:02:27.330> 30k<00:02:27.930> HP<00:02:28.290> I

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
most part we get it around 42 30k HP I

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.360 
most part we get it around 42 30k HP I
don't<00:02:28.560> know<00:02:28.620> if<00:02:28.709> that's<00:02:28.860> like<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.130> normal

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
don't know if that's like the normal

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.059 
don't know if that's like the normal
range<00:02:30.209> but<00:02:30.720> we've<00:02:31.290> actually<00:02:31.319> gotten<00:02:31.800> it<00:02:31.950> all

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
range but we've actually gotten it all

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.220 
range but we've actually gotten it all
the<00:02:32.160> way<00:02:32.250> down<00:02:32.459> to<00:02:32.489> like<00:02:32.760> 7k<00:02:33.209> HP<00:02:33.750> before<00:02:34.110> the

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
the way down to like 7k HP before the

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.160 
the way down to like 7k HP before the
core<00:02:34.590> even<00:02:34.920> comes<00:02:35.099> out<00:02:35.450> on<00:02:36.450> this<00:02:36.660> episode<00:02:36.900> for

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
core even comes out on this episode for

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.490 
core even comes out on this episode for
example<00:02:37.769> we<00:02:37.860> did<00:02:38.040> get<00:02:38.190> down<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.610> like<00:02:38.640> 15k

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
example we did get down to like 15k

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.540 
example we did get down to like 15k
until<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.590> core<00:02:40.769> came<00:02:40.920> out<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:41.220> like<00:02:41.430> we

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
until the core came out so like we

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.250 
until the core came out so like we
literally<00:02:41.849> killed<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.599> corp<00:02:42.930> right<00:02:43.110> before

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
literally killed the corp right before

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.080 
literally killed the corp right before
the<00:02:43.530> quarry<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:43.860> then<00:02:43.980> try<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.160> attack<00:02:44.430> us<00:02:44.640> so

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
the quarry and then try to attack us so

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.240 
the quarry and then try to attack us so

a thousand Corp I'll see if I can put
his<00:02:53.940> channel<00:02:54.360> in<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.660> description<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:55.350> maybe

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
his channel in the description and maybe

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.490

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
he'll probably get more sigils than me

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:02.839 
he'll probably get more sigils than me
because<00:03:00.950> he<00:03:01.950> seems<00:03:02.190> to<00:03:02.310> have<00:03:02.340> more<00:03:02.640> luck<00:03:02.819> than

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
because he seems to have more luck than

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.550 
because he seems to have more luck than
me<00:03:03.060> but<00:03:03.330> it'd<00:03:03.569> be<00:03:03.660> kind<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:03.870> cool<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.200> guys<00:03:04.290> can

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
me but it'd be kind of cool you guys can

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.400 
me but it'd be kind of cool you guys can
compare<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.099> two<00:03:05.220> series<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.849> yeah<00:03:06.750> so<00:03:07.140> I

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
compare the two series and yeah so I

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.949 
compare the two series and yeah so I
don't<00:03:07.769> know<00:03:07.830> when<00:03:07.980> he'll<00:03:08.069> start<00:03:08.340> that<00:03:08.519> but

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
don't know when he'll start that but

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.240 
don't know when he'll start that but
definitely<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:10.140> would<00:03:10.319> check<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.709> out<00:03:10.739> if<00:03:10.860> he

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
definitely I would check that out if he

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.070 
definitely I would check that out if he
starts<00:03:11.489> making<00:03:11.640> them<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.239> think<00:03:12.780> that<00:03:12.900> covers

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
starts making them I think that covers

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.360 
starts making them I think that covers
most<00:03:13.349> of<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.590> things<00:03:13.739> that<00:03:13.799> happened<00:03:14.250> with

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
most of the things that happened with

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.460 
most of the things that happened with
corporal<00:03:14.700> beast<00:03:14.790> in<00:03:15.090> episode<00:03:15.510> 2<00:03:15.690> so<00:03:16.350> I<00:03:16.380> think

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
corporal beast in episode 2 so I think

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.770 
corporal beast in episode 2 so I think

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
have noticed she has gotten a few more

have noticed she has gotten a few more
blues<00:03:32.400> than<00:03:32.579> me<00:03:32.700> but<00:03:33.180> she<00:03:33.329> has<00:03:33.450> gotten

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
blues than me but she has gotten

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.750 
blues than me but she has gotten
considerable<00:03:34.560> amount<00:03:34.980> of<00:03:35.100> golds<00:03:35.549> and<00:03:35.700> greens

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
considerable amount of golds and greens

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.599 
considerable amount of golds and greens
as<00:03:36.180> well<00:03:36.359> so<00:03:37.319> i<00:03:37.350> mean<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:37.859> kind<00:03:38.069> of<00:03:38.130> evens<00:03:38.340> it

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
as well so i mean it kind of evens it

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:40.520 
as well so i mean it kind of evens it
out<00:03:38.700> i<00:03:38.760> guess<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.420> another<00:03:39.959> thing<00:03:40.049> is<00:03:40.290> kind<00:03:40.470> of

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
out i guess and another thing is kind of

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.500 
out i guess and another thing is kind of
surprising<00:03:40.620> we<00:03:41.069> have<00:03:41.250> not<00:03:41.430> gotten<00:03:41.700> one<00:03:42.060> spirit

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
surprising we have not gotten one spirit

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.300 
surprising we have not gotten one spirit
shield<00:03:42.690> troll<00:03:43.019> yet<00:03:43.260> which<00:03:43.530> is<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:43.859> top<00:03:44.040> left

relatively uncommon it's actually more

common than the Holy elixir so it's kind

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:16.540 
is where the money is probably coming

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.200

from but either way 33 mill is really
nice<00:05:19.360> for<00:05:19.420> only<00:05:19.810> the<00:05:19.990> second<00:05:20.710> episode<00:05:20.920> and<00:05:21.220> if

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
nice for only the second episode and if

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.210 
nice for only the second episode and if
this<00:05:21.460> keeps<00:05:21.730> up<00:05:21.940> we'll<00:05:22.120> get<00:05:22.270> around<00:05:23.040> 167<00:05:24.040> mill

stream<00:05:54.760> Corp<00:05:55.090> at<00:05:55.270> all<00:05:55.630> because<00:05:55.810> of<00:05:55.960> crashers

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
stream Corp at all because of crashers

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.770 
stream Corp at all because of crashers
but<00:05:56.500> we've<00:05:57.310> had<00:05:57.460> some<00:05:57.790> decent<00:05:58.030> luck<00:05:58.330> with<00:05:58.480> corp

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
but we've had some decent luck with corp

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.840 
but we've had some decent luck with corp
and<00:05:58.990> crashing<00:05:59.470> so<00:05:59.770> i<00:05:59.980> think<00:06:00.160> i<00:06:00.400> can<00:06:00.460> stream<00:06:00.820> it

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:00.850 
and crashing so i think i can stream it

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:02.400 
and crashing so i think i can stream it

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880
