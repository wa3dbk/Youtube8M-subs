now<00:01:38.329> this<00:01:38.479> is<00:01:38.600> a<00:01:38.630> very<00:01:39.020> very<00:01:39.469> blunt<00:01:39.859> knife<00:01:40.039> so

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
now this is a very very blunt knife so

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.469 
now this is a very very blunt knife so
I'm<00:01:40.369> gonna<00:01:40.520> drill<00:01:40.759> draw<00:01:41.090> it<00:01:41.210> through<00:01:41.390> about

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
I'm gonna drill draw it through about

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.539 
I'm gonna drill draw it through about
four<00:01:41.929> times<00:01:42.350> Pippa<00:01:42.740> that's<00:01:42.950> all<00:01:43.069> I<00:01:43.100> need<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:43.399> do

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
four times Pippa that's all I need to do

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.669 
four times Pippa that's all I need to do
and<00:01:43.819> you<00:01:43.880> can<00:01:44.060> see<00:01:44.090> it's<00:01:44.780> just<00:01:45.079> gently

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
and you can see it's just gently

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:47.859 
and you can see it's just gently
sharpening<00:01:46.429> that<00:01:46.490> blade<00:01:46.880> against<00:01:47.749> the

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
sharpening that blade against the

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.580 
sharpening that blade against the
tungsten<00:01:48.289> carbide<00:01:48.499> guides<00:01:49.600> that<00:01:50.600> you<00:01:50.659> do<00:01:50.840> you

tungsten carbide guides that you do you

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.379 
tungsten carbide guides that you do you
know<00:01:51.619> I<00:01:51.710> I<00:01:51.889> do<00:01:52.100> I'm<00:01:52.579> just<00:01:52.609> gonna<00:01:52.880> wipe<00:01:53.210> this

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:53.389 
know I I do I'm just gonna wipe this

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:55.840 
know I I do I'm just gonna wipe this

much now that's been sharpened you'll

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.879 
much now that's been sharpened you'll
notice<00:02:02.840> that<00:02:02.990> it<00:02:03.109> was<00:02:04.389> same<00:02:05.389> lemon<00:02:05.780> same<00:02:06.560> lemon

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
the type of knife you're sharpening it

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.809 
the type of knife you're sharpening it
will<00:02:18.209> sharpen<00:02:18.480> serrated<00:02:19.200> knives<00:02:19.379> it<00:02:20.189> will

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
will sharpen serrated knives it will

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.670 
will sharpen serrated knives it will
sharpen<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.569> coarse<00:02:21.810> serrated<00:02:22.260> knives<00:02:22.409> I<00:02:22.560> got

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.690 
in front of navel shop in your bread
knife<00:02:24.360> it'll<00:02:24.930> sharpen<00:02:25.170> these<00:02:25.920> really

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
knife it'll sharpen these really

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.030 
knife it'll sharpen these really
professional<00:02:27.269> start<00:02:27.480> hardened<00:02:28.079> steel<00:02:28.709> knives

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
professional start hardened steel knives

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.140 
professional start hardened steel knives
now<00:02:29.220> they're<00:02:29.400> always<00:02:29.579> tougher<00:02:30.030> because

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
now they're always tougher because

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.360 
now they're always tougher because
they're<00:02:30.540> hardened<00:02:31.290> steel<00:02:31.590> yeah<00:02:31.950> they're

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
they're hardened steel yeah they're

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.740 
they're hardened steel yeah they're
obviously<00:02:32.730> much<00:02:32.970> harder<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.569> if<00:02:33.629> you're

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
obviously much harder and if you're

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.210 
obviously much harder and if you're
using<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:34.140> steel<00:02:34.439> knife<00:02:34.650> sharpener<00:02:35.040> with<00:02:35.129> the

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
using a steel knife sharpener with the

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.429 
using a steel knife sharpener with the
disks<00:02:35.640> its<00:02:36.510> fighting<00:02:36.810> against<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.290> same

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
disks its fighting against the same

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:38.300 
disks its fighting against the same
thing<00:02:37.620> it's<00:02:37.739> like<00:02:37.859> rubber<00:02:38.129> and<00:02:38.189> rubber

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
thing it's like rubber and rubber

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.530 
thing it's like rubber and rubber
together<00:02:38.790> they're<00:02:39.000> almost<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.510> same

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
together they're almost the same

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.429 
together they're almost the same
hardness

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:40.439 
hardness

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:42.319 
hardness
these<00:02:40.950> are<00:02:41.129> tungsten<00:02:41.549> carbide<00:02:41.760> now<00:02:42.120> they're

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
these are tungsten carbide now they're

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.509 
these are tungsten carbide now they're
much<00:02:42.780> much<00:02:43.079> harder<00:02:43.349> than<00:02:43.650> steel<00:02:43.950> these<00:02:44.159> edges

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
much much harder than steel these edges

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.970 
much much harder than steel these edges
here<00:02:44.549> so<00:02:44.930> when<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.079> sharpen<00:02:46.409> against<00:02:46.890> the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
here so when you sharpen against the

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.670 
here so when you sharpen against the
tungsten<00:02:47.370> carbide<00:02:47.609> it<00:02:48.480> literally<00:02:49.049> just

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
tungsten carbide it literally just

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.069 
tungsten carbide it literally just
drawing<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.700> blade<00:02:50.909> through<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.569> tungsten

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
drawing the blade through the tungsten

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.920 
drawing the blade through the tungsten
carbide<00:02:52.409> guides<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.879> onto<00:02:54.150> this<00:02:54.299> polymer<00:02:54.720> top

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
carbide guides and onto this polymer top

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.420 
carbide guides and onto this polymer top
which<00:02:55.170> is<00:02:55.349> very<00:02:55.560> safe<00:02:55.859> for<00:02:55.889> the<00:02:56.099> edge<00:02:56.190> if<00:02:56.340> it

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
which is very safe for the edge if it

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.009 
which is very safe for the edge if it
drops<00:02:56.670> onto<00:02:56.879> the<00:02:57.030> top<00:02:57.239> of<00:02:57.389> the<00:02:57.599> only<00:02:57.780> sharp

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
drops onto the top of the only sharp

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.750 
drops onto the top of the only sharp
don't<00:02:58.170> worry<00:02:58.470> because<00:02:59.010> that's<00:02:59.370> designed<00:02:59.670> to

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
don't worry because that's designed to

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.580 
don't worry because that's designed to
be<00:02:59.909> softer<00:03:00.450> than<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:00.780> blade<00:03:00.930> so<00:03:01.109> it<00:03:01.230> cushions

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
be softer than the blade so it cushions

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.860 
be softer than the blade so it cushions
the<00:03:01.709> blade<00:03:01.859> as<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.099> drops<00:03:02.310> onto<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.639> top<00:03:02.870> four

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870

the blade as it drops onto the top four
guides<00:03:04.530> through<00:03:04.799> there<00:03:04.980> for<00:03:05.159> a<00:03:05.189> really<00:03:05.609> blunt

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:05.879 
guides through there for a really blunt

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.970 
guides through there for a really blunt
blade<00:03:06.150> as<00:03:06.329> you<00:03:06.420> know<00:03:06.540> this<00:03:06.689> is<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.409> let's<00:03:07.859> do

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
blade as you know this is and let's do

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.559 
blade as you know this is and let's do
it<00:03:08.099> tomorrow<00:03:08.189> at<00:03:08.579> tomatoes<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.209> all<00:03:09.329> four

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
it tomorrow at tomatoes and all four

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.629 
it tomorrow at tomatoes and all four
because<00:03:09.959> they're<00:03:10.139> squashy<00:03:10.530> yes<00:03:11.099> see<00:03:11.280> that's<00:03:11.459> a

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
because they're squashy yes see that's a

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:15.500 
because they're squashy yes see that's a
really<00:03:12.120> squatchy<00:03:12.359> bump<00:03:13.340> look<00:03:14.340> at<00:03:14.459> that<00:03:14.609> that

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
really squatchy bump look at that that

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
the bin the shards disappear there's a

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.110 
the bin the shards disappear there's a
little<00:04:34.050> guide<00:04:34.350> which<00:04:35.010> actually<00:04:35.370> traps<00:04:35.790> them

little guide which actually traps them

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.909 
little guide which actually traps them
so<00:04:36.660> that<00:04:36.810> they're<00:04:36.990> on<00:04:37.020> the<00:04:37.230> other<00:04:37.380> side<00:04:37.650> of<00:04:37.830> the
