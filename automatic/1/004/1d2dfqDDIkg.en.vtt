 Here in my case I already am with my dvd 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.430
 inserted my pen drive is also good 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.130
 What do you do first after

 insert here on this little screen you can 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.360
 watching the movie you want

 record 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.800
 You can be in a play with a pause. 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.290
 here is regulating the sound then here 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.440
 on this side you can see the 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:43.480
 movie or seriously what you have in this 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:46.150

 We'll be loading the content 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.970
 so I come here the download and dvd

 selecting here the name of my dvd tÃ¡ 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:04.390
 from that moment I loaded the 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:08.290
 content inside here on my cold dvd 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.360
 here I can give a pause you can give 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:14.310
 or rather a play might be 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.310
 viewing all content 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:23.260
 so I can preview the content and 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.299
 here personal in this part of audio you 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.530
 you may be selecting the audio type 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:34.180
 what do you want 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:38.160
 ok if you have the audio aac will appear 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.160
 for example have some movies that have 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.489
 I do not know many types of audio 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.890
 Portuguese / Spanish you select the 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.600
 audio you want 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.880
 here we move're not one 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.769
 very important setting here this 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.350
 Cop is where we'll be 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:58.930
 selecting the format that people 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:04.290
 want of the dvd I'll be opening here and 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:13.239
 so I have several mp4 formats 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:15.400
 wmv and also various avi audio formats 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.849
 also in a widely used format 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.040
 among others using this video lesson 

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:24.580
 that wmv 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.860
 not too heavy and is also a format 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.260
 that any of the media player supports 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.790
 I'm not going to select here I'm just here. 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:32.890
 remembering staff you select the 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:35.770
 format you want 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.170
 If your media is recorded then I will 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.360
 select wmv 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:43.540
 I came here also selects posta 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.590
 selecting here are personal 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:50.890
 so I'll select which windows wmv and 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.440
 jet here and select which one 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:55.270
 destination which my file output the 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.130
 My case and the pendrive so I'll come here. 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:59.140
 in brasilia 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:01.630
 here is the personal secret put 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:03.700
 Selecting My Computer Pen Drive 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.830
 a mobile memory card any 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:08.620
 device that you have connected to the 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:11.680
 your machine then here in my case I 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:15.430
 I want to shoot the contents of the DVD is 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.170
 passing the pen drive I came here I go 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:21.130
 select the thumb drive 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:23.890
 I came here the sbt that the device g 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.580
 I'll give you an ok after this I'll apply 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:26.580
 on start 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.030
 from that moment I will is 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.830
 initiating the process or be voting 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.920
 removing all content that is on the DVD 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.620
 is not getting back copying content 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:43.120
 of the DVD to my pen drive that was my 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:44.800
 media select the personnel that 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.540
 procedure takes a little bit like 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.290
 You can see that it will take in 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.810
 around 22 minutes depending on the 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:55.210
 size of your of your media 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:59.670
 in my case an average of two hours 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:02.310
 so it will take around 20 minutes 

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:06.220
 come back here for using the video lesson 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:08.110
 As soon as I'm finished, I'll be right back. 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.380
 and showing you how it was 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:15.160
 Good after a few minutes. 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:17.410
 Here we conclude the process of copying the 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.180
 movie drives drive now i will be 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:24.430
 checking here if I came here in my 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:25.930
 the pen drive folder is opening it to 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:28.420
 that here I have a movie that the 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.710
 father of my dvd or pendrive 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.520
 then just remembering that this procedure 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:35.310
 could have been could have 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:38.789
 happened via pen drive or I also 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.699
 could you copy it to my computer? 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:42.860
 I simply came here. 

00:06:40.699 --> 00:06:46.020
 changing the path I want is 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.699
 copying can be a good Easter, my 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.690
 desktop to anywhere you 

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:51.419
 to specify 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:53.370
 so not only the pendrive port 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:56.610
 making this copy 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:58.110
 staff is helping to disclose 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:07:00.419
 Did you like sharing on networks? 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.759
 Social maybe this video probably 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:05.490
 will help more people who are also 

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:07.590
 with this doubt if you do not write the 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.539
 our channel subscribes following
