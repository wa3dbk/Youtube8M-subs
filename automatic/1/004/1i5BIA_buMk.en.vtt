 Hi, I'm the mother, as many of you will already know playstation users 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.690
 they have available in the nuisance 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.070
 the web service fights that is the compensation that happened to us or for the 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.469
 20 days that the network split was down 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.800
 once we got in after a couple of tries per hundred as many users 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.210
 entering at the same time causing an overload of the server 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.390
 we find this feeling 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.439
 where we can find all five games that we have to download from the 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.000
 which we have to choose two 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.860
 a special section of the 30 days of free subscription to playstation plus 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.180
 from lakua we can also download things but they will end once 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.410
 finish the pre-enrollment period plus 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.910
 and not that 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.460
 we extend it 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.620
 we will be left without 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.050
 in this section several games are included various dynamic themes 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:01.380
 several avatars and a demo 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.260
 did not include too much and some of the things in this section are 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.540
 of payment 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.280
 so it does not matter too much what is really interesting we are five 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.610
 games 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.770
 what is the race so clear the dean littlebigplanet edition 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.250
 the smallest if biel 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.250
 a racing game now I remember the name 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.200
 many of you will ask what happens that way in the download section of 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.690
 games without having downloaded everything 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.600
 for this you have to follow the procedures on the screen 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.780
 you have to go to my account action 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.780
 and look for this section playstation network promotions 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.420
 here we enter and we find 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.860
 this little box that leads us to the rough 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.050
 and once in history 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.330
 note to download another of the games 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.330
 remember you only have two so I chose the giants 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.840
 that has been everything I hope I have been of help if you forget us and have replaced 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:09.860
