like this and coming all the way back

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.389 
like this and coming all the way back
around<00:00:51.449> okay<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.320> want<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.590> go<00:00:53.010> around<00:00:53.190> the

around okay so you want to go around the

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.700 
around okay so you want to go around the
vehicle<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.969> couple<00:00:54.300> times<00:00:54.510> clockwise<00:00:54.840> and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
vehicle a couple times clockwise and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.619 
vehicle a couple times clockwise and
then<00:00:55.800> couple<00:00:56.129> times<00:00:56.309> counterclockwise

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
then couple times counterclockwise

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.680 
then couple times counterclockwise
really<00:00:58.079> help<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.190> learn<00:00:59.609> how<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.269> do<00:01:00.570> this

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
really help you to learn how to do this

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.249 
really help you to learn how to do this
okay<00:01:01.579> the<00:01:02.579> next<00:01:02.879> step<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:03.960> try<00:01:04.170> to

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
okay the next step is to just try to

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.109 
okay the next step is to just try to
become<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> little<00:01:04.860> bit<00:01:05.009> more<00:01:05.280> independent<00:01:05.610> as

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
become a little bit more independent as

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.399 
become a little bit more independent as
you<00:01:06.150> go<00:01:06.420> around<00:01:06.690> so<00:01:06.869> keep<00:01:07.020> going<00:01:07.080> around

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
you go around so keep going around

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.200 
you go around so keep going around
clockwise<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.700> then<00:01:08.850> do<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> couple

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
clockwise and then do a couple

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.990 
clockwise and then do a couple
counterclockwise<00:01:09.840> okay<00:01:10.590> but<00:01:11.340> as<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.850> get

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
counterclockwise okay but as you get

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.580 
counterclockwise okay but as you get
better<00:01:12.119> try<00:01:12.509> to<00:01:12.570> let<00:01:12.810> go<00:01:12.840> for<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.259> little<00:01:13.470> bit

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
better try to let go for a little bit

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.420 
better try to let go for a little bit
longer<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.100> pull<00:01:14.280> them<00:01:14.399> on<00:01:14.490> yourself<00:01:16.430> you're

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
longer and pull them on yourself you're

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.060 
longer and pull them on yourself you're
gonna<00:01:17.520> fall<00:01:17.789> grab<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.360> again<00:01:18.420> we<00:01:19.350> try<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.680> be<00:01:20.039> a

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
gonna fall grab it again we try to be a

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.090 
gonna fall grab it again we try to be a
little<00:01:20.399> bit<00:01:20.520> more<00:01:20.670> independent<00:01:21.710> okay<00:01:22.710> once

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
little bit more independent okay once

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.310 
little bit more independent okay once
you've<00:01:23.250> got<00:01:23.430> back<00:01:23.640> down<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.750> you're<00:01:24.930> feeling

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
you've got back down and you're feeling

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.889 
you've got back down and you're feeling
like<00:01:25.560> you're<00:01:25.710> ready<00:01:25.860> for<00:01:26.039> another<00:01:26.100> step<00:01:26.899> start

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
like you're ready for another step start

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:30.859 
like you're ready for another step start
at<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.289> back<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.590> your<00:01:28.770> vehicle<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.970> ride

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
at the back of your vehicle and ride

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.620 
at the back of your vehicle and ride
along<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.649> side<00:01:31.970> touching<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.300> little<00:01:33.509> bit

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
along one side touching it a little bit

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.180 
along one side touching it a little bit
then<00:01:34.229> when<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.440> get<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.649> end<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:34.860> try<00:01:35.130> to

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
then when you get to the end just try to

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.399 
then when you get to the end just try to
keep<00:01:35.369> going<00:01:35.670> as<00:01:36.300> far<00:01:36.630> as<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.929> can<00:01:37.080> okay<00:01:37.350> so

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
keep going as far as you can okay so

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.930 
keep going as far as you can okay so
it's<00:01:37.590> probably<00:01:37.800> gonna<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.009> like<00:01:38.190> a<00:01:38.310> meter<00:01:38.550> the

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
it's probably gonna be like a meter the

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.010 
it's probably gonna be like a meter the
first<00:01:39.149> couple<00:01:39.360> of<00:01:39.390> times<00:01:39.450> before<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.929> you

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
first couple of times before the you

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.040 
first couple of times before the you
know<00:01:40.080> sort<00:01:40.289> of<00:01:40.319> shoot<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.800> like<00:01:41.610> ah<00:01:41.729> min<00:01:42.300> not

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
know sort of shoot so like ah min not

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.330 
know sort of shoot so like ah min not
getting<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.440> well<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:43.860> gonna<00:01:43.979> take<00:01:44.069> some

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
getting this well it's gonna take some

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.919 
getting this well it's gonna take some
time

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
time

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:48.230 
time
okay<00:01:45.929> so<00:01:46.440> just<00:01:46.470> keep<00:01:46.830> doing<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.240> that's

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
okay so just keep doing that that's

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.899 
okay so just keep doing that that's
handy<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.899> set<00:01:49.170> yourself<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.619> goal<00:01:49.649> okay<00:01:50.340> so

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
handy and set yourself a goal okay so

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.999 
handy and set yourself a goal okay so
let's<00:01:51.569> say<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.780> did<00:01:51.990> one<00:01:52.200> meter<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.590> want<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.860> do<00:01:52.979> a

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
let's say I did one meter I want to do a

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.320 
let's say I did one meter I want to do a
metre<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.399> half<00:01:53.429> I'm<00:01:53.909> gonna<00:01:54.060> take<00:01:54.240> these

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
metre and a half I'm gonna take these

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:55.850 
metre and a half I'm gonna take these
three<00:01:54.539> more<00:01:54.659> tries<00:01:54.929> but<00:01:55.229> I'm<00:01:55.380> gonna<00:01:55.530> make<00:01:55.709> it

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
three more tries but I'm gonna make it

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.529 
three more tries but I'm gonna make it
to<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.130> metre<00:01:56.429> and<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.610> half<00:01:56.640> before<00:01:56.970> they<00:01:57.330> fall

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539 
to a metre and a half before they fall

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.510 
to a metre and a half before they fall
off<00:01:58.280> okay<00:01:59.280> and<00:02:01.100> once<00:02:02.100> you've<00:02:02.310> done<00:02:02.460> that
