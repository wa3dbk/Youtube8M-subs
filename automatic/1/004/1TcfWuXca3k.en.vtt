reverse apparently all you have to do is
this<00:00:25.599> is<00:00:25.779> the<00:00:25.900> cable<00:00:26.110> that<00:00:26.320> pulls<00:00:26.739> on<00:00:27.070> the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
this is the cable that pulls on the

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.950 
this is the cable that pulls on the
lever<00:00:28.410> that<00:00:29.410> lets<00:00:29.830> you<00:00:29.949> go<00:00:30.099> into<00:00:30.310> reverse<00:00:30.960> you

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
lever that lets you go into reverse you

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.110 
lever that lets you go into reverse you
just<00:00:32.259> adjust<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:34.210> out<00:00:35.199> further

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
just adjust this out further

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.369 
just adjust this out further
so<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:37.269> lever<00:00:37.510> is<00:00:38.040> pulled<00:00:39.040> up<00:00:39.280> all<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:40.059> time

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
so the lever is pulled up all the time

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.139 
so the lever is pulled up all the time
okay<00:00:41.379> the<00:00:41.410> little<00:00:41.680> lever<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:44.820> right<00:00:45.820> down

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
okay the little lever is right down

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.490 
okay the little lever is right down

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
there the back of the engine at the

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.049 
there the back of the engine at the
bottom<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:54.010> kind<00:00:54.219> of<00:00:54.250> a<00:00:54.370> side<00:00:54.609> where<00:00:54.879> the

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
bottom it's kind of a side where the

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.709 
bottom it's kind of a side where the
rear<00:00:56.050> driveshaft<00:00:56.379> comes<00:00:56.980> out<00:00:57.300> as<00:00:58.300> you<00:00:58.480> see

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
millimeter wrench I loosened off this

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.650 
millimeter wrench I loosened off this
lock<00:01:36.399> nut<00:01:37.890> unthreaded<00:01:38.890> this<00:01:39.670> part<00:01:40.119> from<00:01:40.450> this

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
lock nut unthreaded this part from this

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
lengthening that it effectively pulled

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.800 
lengthening that it effectively pulled
the<00:01:51.190> cable<00:01:51.520> tighter<00:01:53.069> and<00:01:54.069> now<00:01:54.369> I<00:01:54.700> don't<00:01:55.660> have

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
the cable tighter and now I don't have

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.040 
the cable tighter and now I don't have

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
and pull the lever anymore to get into

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.029 
and pull the lever anymore to get into
reverse<00:02:01.330> I<00:02:01.660> just<00:02:02.080> push<00:02:02.259> down<00:02:02.289> on<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.679> shifter
