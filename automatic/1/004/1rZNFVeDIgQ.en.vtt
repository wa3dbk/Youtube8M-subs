let's<00:01:24.530> see<00:01:24.800> how<00:01:25.039> it<00:01:25.190> handles<00:01:25.369> the<00:01:25.759> heap<00:01:26.000> test<00:01:26.300> a

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
let's see how it handles the heap test a

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:28.029 
let's see how it handles the heap test a
little<00:01:26.899> change<00:01:27.170> in<00:01:27.319> the<00:01:27.440> heat<00:01:27.619> test<00:01:27.830> we've

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
little change in the heat test we've

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:29.620 
little change in the heat test we've
decided<00:01:28.429> in<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:28.850> interest<00:01:29.179> of<00:01:29.299> all<00:01:29.450> of<00:01:29.600> that

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
decided in the interest of all of that

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.109 
decided in the interest of all of that
plastic<00:01:30.080> very<00:01:30.679> close<00:01:30.979> to<00:01:31.159> heat<00:01:31.310> sources<00:01:31.610> we're

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
plastic very close to heat sources we're

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.730 
plastic very close to heat sources we're
going<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.270> try<00:01:32.450> wrapping<00:01:32.840> these<00:01:33.200> in<00:01:33.380> a<00:01:33.470> towel

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
going to try wrapping these in a towel

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.550 
going to try wrapping these in a towel
so<00:01:34.190> that<00:01:34.459> we<00:01:34.670> get<00:01:34.819> a<00:01:34.880> lot<00:01:35.240> of<00:01:35.299> heat<00:01:35.750> but<00:01:36.350> maybe

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
so that we get a lot of heat but maybe

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.050 
so that we get a lot of heat but maybe
not<00:01:36.709> so<00:01:36.890> much<00:01:37.009> melting<00:01:38.319> so<00:01:39.549> we'll<00:01:40.549> wrap<00:01:40.789> it<00:01:40.819> up

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
not so much melting so we'll wrap it up

a case iphone 5 is already a little
dinged<00:03:49.720> up<00:03:49.900> but<00:03:50.200> it<00:03:50.470> is<00:03:50.650> time<00:03:50.920> for<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.190> drop

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
dinged up but it is time for the drop

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.180 
dinged up but it is time for the drop
test<00:03:51.610> again<00:03:52.150> so<00:03:52.570> light<00:03:52.870> so<00:03:52.900> easy<00:03:53.470> to<00:03:53.860> just<00:03:53.890> sort

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
test again so light so easy to just sort

of lose track of while I'm at the

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:05.460 
of lose track of while I'm at the
playground<00:03:56.170> oh<00:03:56.350> no<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.950> bee<00:04:02.340> the<00:04:03.340> concrete<00:04:04.470> we

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
playground oh no a bee the concrete we

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.840 
playground oh no a bee the concrete we
have<00:04:05.620> some<00:04:05.860> ship<00:04:06.370> being<00:04:06.850> on<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.209> front<00:04:08.850> we've

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
have some ship being on the front we've

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.120 
have some ship being on the front we've
actually<00:04:10.060> cracked<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.959> glass<00:04:11.140> on<00:04:11.709> the<00:04:11.739> back

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
actually cracked the glass on the back

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.040 
actually cracked the glass on the back
it<00:04:12.430> could<00:04:12.640> have<00:04:12.760> been<00:04:12.970> already<00:04:13.390> in<00:04:13.600> a<00:04:13.660> weakened

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:14.050 
it could have been already in a weakened

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.979 
it could have been already in a weakened
condition<00:04:14.200> but<00:04:14.830> that<00:04:15.100> was<00:04:15.280> only<00:04:15.519> one<00:04:15.880> drop<00:04:16.120> but

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
condition but that was only one drop but

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.680 
condition but that was only one drop but
I<00:04:17.320> think<00:04:17.829> we<00:04:17.950> need<00:04:18.070> to<00:04:18.190> keep<00:04:18.310> dropping<00:04:18.700> it<00:04:18.820> how

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
I think we need to keep dropping it how

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:27.300 
I think we need to keep dropping it how
about<00:04:19.870> shoulder<00:04:20.260> height<00:04:25.710> okay<00:04:26.710> looks<00:04:26.979> like<00:04:27.040> no

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:36.390 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.940 

if<00:04:37.390> you<00:04:37.600> only<00:04:37.810> looked<00:04:38.170> at<00:04:38.290> it<00:04:38.410> from<00:04:38.500> the<00:04:38.680> front

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
if you only looked at it from the front

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.030 
if you only looked at it from the front
you<00:04:39.280> would<00:04:39.430> say<00:04:39.580> this<00:04:39.820> bone<00:04:40.030> is<00:04:40.060> amazing<00:04:41.040> this

on by the way very similar to our iphone
4s<00:05:33.270> bubbling<00:05:34.800> probably<00:05:35.800> get<00:05:35.919> it<00:05:36.010> out<00:05:36.100> a<00:05:36.130> little

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
4s bubbling probably get it out a little

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.770 
4s bubbling probably get it out a little
faster<00:05:36.760> than<00:05:36.910> that<00:05:37.030> if<00:05:37.180> you<00:05:37.330> really<00:05:37.600> drop

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
faster than that if you really drop

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.020 
faster than that if you really drop
yours<00:05:38.020> in<00:05:38.230> the<00:05:38.290> toilet<00:05:38.620> but<00:05:38.770> this<00:05:39.550> is<00:05:39.790> one

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.030 
yours in the toilet but this is one

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.280 
yours in the toilet but this is one
thing<00:05:40.240> that's<00:05:40.419> pretty<00:05:40.630> amazing<00:05:40.840> about<00:05:41.140> the

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.290 
thing that's pretty amazing about the

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.260 
thing that's pretty amazing about the
iphone<00:05:41.560> actually<00:05:41.890> both<00:05:42.070> the<00:05:42.280> 4s<00:05:42.640> and<00:05:42.880> the<00:05:43.060> five

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
iphone actually both the 4s and the five

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
of immediate shorting and that's with

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.260 
of immediate shorting and that's with
some<00:05:50.979> pretty<00:05:51.250> severe<00:05:51.550> damage<00:05:51.910> on<00:05:52.030> the<00:05:52.120> back

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270

on<00:05:54.850> the<00:05:54.880> safe<00:05:55.120> side<00:05:55.150> I'm<00:05:55.510> going<00:05:55.540> to<00:05:55.690> power<00:05:55.840> it

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
on the safe side I'm going to power it

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.940 
sure we really get drying on the insides
but<00:06:04.300> it's<00:06:05.020> not<00:06:05.140> really<00:06:05.290> acting<00:06:05.500> like<00:06:05.740> it<00:06:05.830> has

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:05.950

for about 36 hours just to be safe now
you<00:06:17.380> remember<00:06:17.590> it<00:06:17.830> was<00:06:17.890> on<00:06:18.040> when<00:06:18.640> it<00:06:18.729> came<00:06:18.880> out

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 
the drop test at the end when I was a

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.860 
the drop test at the end when I was a
little<00:06:48.860> bit<00:06:49.070> shocked<00:06:49.460> by<00:06:50.150> all<00:06:50.180> the<00:06:50.480> damage

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870 
little bit shocked by all the damage

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.630 
little bit shocked by all the damage
that<00:06:50.900> we<00:06:51.230> had<00:06:51.320> caused<00:06:51.530> by<00:06:51.740> dropping<00:06:52.100> the<00:06:52.130> Sun<00:06:52.400> I

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:52.640 
that we had caused by dropping the Sun I

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:56.770 
that we had caused by dropping the Sun I
declared<00:06:52.790> it<00:06:53.540> a<00:06:53.660> failure<00:06:55.180> but<00:06:56.180> on<00:06:56.330> second

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:56.780 
declared it a failure but on second

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.900 
declared it a failure but on second
thought<00:06:56.990> I<00:06:57.260> think<00:06:57.740> I<00:06:58.070> have<00:06:58.190> to<00:06:58.310> take<00:06:58.490> that<00:06:58.520> back

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:58.910 
thought I think I have to take that back

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.600 
thought I think I have to take that back
I<00:06:59.270> mean<00:06:59.690> it's<00:07:00.020> totally<00:07:00.440> functional<00:07:01.100> if<00:07:01.490> you

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610 
I mean it's totally functional if you

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.070 
I mean it's totally functional if you
put<00:07:01.790> a<00:07:01.820> case<00:07:02.060> on<00:07:02.240> the<00:07:02.390> back<00:07:02.540> you'd<00:07:02.780> still<00:07:03.050> be

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
put a case on the back you'd still be

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.400 
put a case on the back you'd still be
perfectly<00:07:03.680> happy<00:07:03.770> to<00:07:04.040> have<00:07:04.280> it<00:07:04.310> so<00:07:05.120> on<00:07:05.450> second

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:06.410 
perfectly happy to have it so on second

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.420 
perfectly happy to have it so on second
thought<00:07:06.560> it's<00:07:07.400> a<00:07:07.520> pass<00:07:08.950> overall<00:07:09.950> I'd<00:07:10.160> say<00:07:10.190> the

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.430 
thought it's a pass overall I'd say the

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.330 
thought it's a pass overall I'd say the
iPhone<00:07:10.730> 5<00:07:10.910> is<00:07:10.940> very<00:07:11.600> tough<00:07:11.960> but<00:07:12.320> also<00:07:12.500> not<00:07:13.070> that

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:13.340 
iPhone 5 is very tough but also not that

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.550 
iPhone 5 is very tough but also not that
tough<00:07:13.610> compared<00:07:14.360> to<00:07:14.450> the<00:07:14.540> samsung<00:07:14.930> galaxy<00:07:14.960> s3

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560 
tough compared to the samsung galaxy s3

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.830 
tough compared to the samsung galaxy s3
which<00:07:16.160> went<00:07:16.370> through<00:07:16.550> all<00:07:16.820> the<00:07:17.120> same<00:07:17.330> tests

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 
which went through all the same tests
