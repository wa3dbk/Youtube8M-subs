00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:17.570
 So I try too much 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:17.570
 a room on thursday evening again in the 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:24.259
 setting evening light as he now 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.550
 has cleaned 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:33.480
 he is fully clean that he will be then 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.690
 if he says they are so on 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.870
 trunk is so relatively small because 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:44.460
 right here under this rubber stock 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:48.140
 blackies there is too there you have as a place 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.760
 I have no big tears 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:55.160
 spare wheel no space for spare wheel 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.790
 that's why many of these mature 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:05.219
 extension cable when cross 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:09.200
 shopping bag that will make you 

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:09.200
 that it understands behind who is driving 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.159
 four doors in summer it works 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.810
 perfect 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.289
 So now is not cleaned as I said 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.749
 I let the leather seats build rows 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:24.179
 the come from the two-door one 16 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:26.880
 That's why I do not have the valves 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:32.189
 leather interior trim for the doors that 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:35.130
 is just normal in winter that's just 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:38.549
 so peugeot 106 illness can times 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.639
 a rear door bit worse too 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.709
 Go as she does but then she leaves 

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:45.780
 again as I said he is exactly that 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:47.609
 is this damned side 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.039
 estimate of citroen wants 

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:51.139
 vorhafen ago that is so 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.100
 inner space 

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:58.560
 I so from halter to still inside 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.029
 radio from bavaria here once took 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.289
 So what makes cd and the usb connection 

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:08.250
 but taken especially for me 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:11.610
 because the separation sharpness is good that is 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.390
 You have no parasites from the engine 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.390
 the indication 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:24.920
 this is the next deep in here 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.920
 France december 2013 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.180
 So that's the front view 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.569
 bonnet on so that's this 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:42.209
 whose grandma she is the one on the board 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:43.019
 is on it and it makes it here 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.470
 delle rows 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:50.760
 which can be seen below yes that's squad 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.549
 as much salt and centimeters deep that 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.819
 you can do it to me 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:03:00.150
 until thursday that can fix it 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:03.060
 then no sound but the price 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:10.620
 do not go on forever down 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:13.140
 the bonnet on the right of the emblem 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.170
 emblem is swapped that too 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.069
 properly shined 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:23.770
 here 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:26.180
 the mother sequence here is the prop 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:30.680
 especially the four different ones 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:38.150
 water cycles refills the 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:44.180
 additional battery the regulator that is the 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:47.330
 color code number 83 43 7 o'clock 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.989
 that shows a us has been built the 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.600
 rest can of course be found here 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:57.530
 the water pump is exchanged for 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:00.380
 this brushless brushless that 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.239
 is this part here what is down there 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.120
 I have to go through the whole thing 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:07.040
 for that decrease the focus because 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.360
 the original one has no big one 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:18.049
 trust after 34,000 kilometers was the 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:19.940
 statistically in the bucket as an accessory that is 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.060
 for an installation here 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:28.550
 I have one up here in the height 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:32.800
 canister with hole for minerals 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:35.540
 free water in there is such a cock 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.100
 There is such a fish tank then 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.979
 I can do it and the other one 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.790
 then page from the hose I do ans 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.550
 turn it on 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.130
 with that, I support that one 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.020
 if you look at the 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.419
 inside and on the flat part of it 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.240
 then presses the foot releases and the 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:57.110
 exactly these four are based on it 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.240
 I've shown from the click 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.130
 engine compartment 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:06.090
 This is 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:10.650
 where is the small that is the keys where 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:12.330
 one has the information about himself on the 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:13.890
 then press the other side of it 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.670
 are two times press it and then it is 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:20.040
 the thing is done by the consumer 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:23.010
 light-emitting diodes to fill with water 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:27.510
 before the corresponding charge 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:29.550
 provoke us this if the 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.060
 warning light shows up just watching 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.770
 can 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:37.050
 that's the other side of the plug and 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:42.150
 there is still this lex year here 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:44.120
 Three this device always via USB cable 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.950
 can connect to the computer 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.360
 I give that to where others are 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:55.050
 read out things 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:06:00.060
 So this little plug you do in 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.810
 vehicle behind the steering wheel under the 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:05.790
 driver's seat 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:10.470
 I do not know if this is down here 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:16.790
 turn on the cable access to the cable and then 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:16.790
 may something to plug wyler
