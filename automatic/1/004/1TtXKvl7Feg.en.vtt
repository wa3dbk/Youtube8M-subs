going<00:02:34.940> to<00:02:35.000> flip<00:02:35.240> this<00:02:35.270> over<00:02:35.600> to<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.590> ugly<00:02:37.010> side

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
going to flip this over to the ugly side

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.740 
going to flip this over to the ugly side
or<00:02:37.400> these<00:02:37.610> times<00:02:37.850> that<00:02:37.940> I<00:02:38.030> don't<00:02:38.150> really<00:02:38.480> want

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
or these times that I don't really want

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.630 
or these times that I don't really want
to<00:02:38.810> use<00:02:38.870> and<00:02:39.440> I'm<00:02:40.070> just<00:02:40.220> going<00:02:40.340> to<00:02:40.430> start

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
to use and I'm just going to start

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.690 
to use and I'm just going to start
folding<00:02:41.000> in<00:02:41.470> all<00:02:42.470> of<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.770> edges<00:02:43.160> like<00:02:43.459> this

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
folding in all of the edges like this

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.390 
folding in all of the edges like this
just<00:02:46.700> making<00:02:46.940> sure<00:02:47.000> that's<00:02:47.239> even<00:02:51.040> then<00:02:52.040> I'm

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
just making sure that's even then I'm

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.460 
just making sure that's even then I'm
folding<00:02:52.700> in<00:02:53.080> these<00:02:54.080> sides<00:02:54.410> as<00:02:54.650> well<00:02:55.540> and<00:02:56.540> then

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
folding in these sides as well and then

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.690 
folding in these sides as well and then
I'm<00:02:57.590> just<00:02:57.709> going<00:02:57.860> to<00:02:57.890> kind<00:02:58.100> of<00:02:58.160> measure<00:02:58.430> my

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
I'm just going to kind of measure my

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.930 
I'm just going to kind of measure my
bando<00:02:59.120> see<00:02:59.450> if<00:02:59.570> it's<00:02:59.720> too<00:02:59.930> small<00:03:00.080> or<00:03:00.410> too<00:03:00.440> big

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
bando see if it's too small or too big

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.360 
bando see if it's too small or too big
mine<00:03:01.940> was<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.180> little<00:03:02.269> bit<00:03:02.630> wide<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.320> so<00:03:03.620> I<00:03:04.010> cut

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
mine was a little bit wide and so I cut

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.970 
mine was a little bit wide and so I cut
off<00:03:04.489> a<00:03:04.519> few<00:03:04.910> inches<00:03:05.500> just<00:03:06.500> so<00:03:06.650> it<00:03:06.769> wouldn't

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
off a few inches just so it wouldn't

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.479 
off a few inches just so it wouldn't
overlap<00:03:07.400> in<00:03:07.580> the<00:03:07.670> middle<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.150> then<00:03:08.330> I<00:03:09.280> fold<00:03:10.280> it

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
overlap in the middle and then I fold it

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.040 
overlap in the middle and then I fold it
a<00:03:10.519> little<00:03:10.790> bit<00:03:10.970> more<00:03:11.180> in<00:03:11.390> just<00:03:11.690> so<00:03:11.750> it<00:03:11.810> would<00:03:11.870> be

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
a little bit more in just so it would be

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.310 
a little bit more in just so it would be
a<00:03:12.080> little<00:03:12.350> bit<00:03:12.470> smaller<00:03:12.860> so<00:03:13.930> you<00:03:14.930> can<00:03:15.110> really

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:15.320 
a little bit smaller so you can really

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.890 
a little bit smaller so you can really
just<00:03:15.350> adjust<00:03:15.920> this<00:03:16.100> to<00:03:16.519> however<00:03:17.150> big<00:03:17.300> or<00:03:17.510> bando

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
just adjust this to however big or bando

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.040 
just adjust this to however big or bando
is<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.920> next<00:03:19.400> I'm<00:03:19.700> just<00:03:19.760> going<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.360> sew<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:20.870> shut

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
is so next I'm just going to sew it shut

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.920 
is so next I'm just going to sew it shut
and<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:21.830> I'm<00:03:21.920> going<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.130> sew<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.580> top<00:03:22.880> and<00:03:23.180> the

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
and so I'm going to sew the top and the

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.990 
and so I'm going to sew the top and the
bottom<00:03:24.230> of<00:03:25.390> the<00:03:26.390> fabric<00:03:27.230> and<00:03:27.820> here<00:03:28.820> you<00:03:28.910> can

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
bottom of the fabric and here you can

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000 
bottom of the fabric and here you can
see<00:03:29.180> I<00:03:29.209> started<00:03:29.660> from<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.900> very<00:03:30.290> edge<00:03:30.410> but

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
see I started from the very edge but

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.640 
see I started from the very edge but
you'll<00:03:31.130> see<00:03:31.340> later<00:03:31.580> that<00:03:31.940> I<00:03:32.150> later<00:03:33.080> fixed<00:03:33.530> that

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
you'll see later that I later fixed that

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.759 
you'll see later that I later fixed that
I<00:03:33.860> stopped<00:03:34.340> about<00:03:34.820> two<00:03:35.450> inches<00:03:36.080> away<00:03:36.350> from<00:03:36.560> the

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
I stopped about two inches away from the

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.060 
I stopped about two inches away from the
edge<00:03:36.950> so<00:03:36.980> so<00:03:37.700> it'll<00:03:38.060> be<00:03:38.989> more<00:03:39.140> open<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:39.739> looked

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
edge so so it'll be more open and looked

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.120 
edge so so it'll be more open and looked
like<00:03:40.280> a<00:03:40.550> bando<00:03:41.000> and<00:03:41.450> so<00:03:42.440> I<00:03:42.470> stopped<00:03:42.890> right

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
like a bando and so I stopped right

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.590 
like a bando and so I stopped right
there<00:03:43.400> and<00:03:43.700> then

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
there and then

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.800 
there and then
and<00:03:44.690> I<00:03:44.870> tied<00:03:45.650> that<00:03:45.860> up<00:03:46.010> and<00:03:46.190> then<00:03:46.370> I<00:03:46.610> fixed<00:03:47.510> the

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
and I tied that up and then I fixed the

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.160 
and I tied that up and then I fixed the
other<00:03:47.990> side<00:03:48.290> a<00:03:48.590> little<00:03:48.800> bit<00:03:48.890> later<00:03:50.140> which<00:03:51.140> is

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
other side a little bit later which is

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.370 
other side a little bit later which is
what<00:03:51.380> I'm<00:03:51.470> doing<00:03:51.590> now<00:03:51.710> and<00:03:55.540> then<00:03:56.540> I'm<00:03:56.930> just

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
what I'm doing now and then I'm just

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:10.210 
what I'm doing now and then I'm just
going<00:03:57.680> to<00:03:57.710> sew<00:03:58.160> the<00:03:58.430> other<00:03:58.460> side<00:04:08.710> okay<00:04:09.710> so<00:04:09.770> now

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
going to sew the other side okay so now

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.420 
going to sew the other side okay so now
I'm<00:04:10.370> flipping<00:04:10.670> that<00:04:10.790> over<00:04:11.060> and<00:04:11.300> once<00:04:11.960> again

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
I'm flipping that over and once again

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.000 
I'm flipping that over and once again
I'm<00:04:13.430> just<00:04:13.490> going<00:04:13.880> to<00:04:14.090> take<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.600> bando<00:04:15.010> make

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
I'm just going to take the bando make

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.010 
I'm just going to take the bando make
sure<00:04:16.190> that<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:16.820> fabric<00:04:17.090> covers<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.810> whole

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.020 
sure that the fabric covers the whole

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:21.010 
sure that the fabric covers the whole
bando<00:04:18.410> and<00:04:18.739> then<00:04:19.010> I'm<00:04:19.370> going<00:04:19.760> to<00:04:19.880> flip<00:04:20.750> it<00:04:20.780> over

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:21.020 
bando and then I'm going to flip it over

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.450 
bando and then I'm going to flip it over
and<00:04:21.790> then<00:04:22.790> start<00:04:23.180> sewing<00:04:23.450> the<00:04:24.230> bando<00:04:24.590> to<00:04:25.010> the

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
and then start sewing the bando to the

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:32.050 
and then start sewing the bando to the
fabric<00:04:26.150> and<00:04:26.570> make<00:04:28.120> sure<00:04:29.120> you<00:04:29.330> only<00:04:29.570> so<00:04:31.060> one

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
fabric and make sure you only so one

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.940

layer<00:04:32.420> of<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.880> fabric<00:04:34.880> so<00:04:35.120> that<00:04:35.150> it<00:04:35.330> doesn't

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
layer of the fabric so that it doesn't

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.580 
layer of the fabric so that it doesn't
look<00:04:36.950> closed<00:04:37.310> off<00:04:37.550> or<00:04:37.760> anything<00:04:37.970> and<00:04:38.470> here<00:04:39.470> I'm

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
look closed off or anything and here I'm

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.110 
look closed off or anything and here I'm
just<00:04:39.620> showing<00:04:39.830> you<00:04:40.070> guys<00:04:40.220> that<00:04:40.280> I<00:04:40.460> am<00:04:40.790> probably

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
just showing you guys that I am probably

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.010 
just showing you guys that I am probably
the<00:04:41.480> most<00:04:41.840> amateurs<00:04:42.410> sower<00:04:43.000> ever<00:04:44.000> or<00:04:44.510> Taylor<00:04:44.990> I

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
the most amateurs sower ever or Taylor I

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.850 
the most amateurs sower ever or Taylor I
guess<00:04:45.940> look<00:04:46.940> at<00:04:47.090> that<00:04:47.300> that's<00:04:47.510> really<00:04:47.860> really

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
guess look at that that's really really

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.030 
guess look at that that's really really
bad<00:04:49.130> but<00:04:49.490> it<00:04:49.700> still<00:04:49.970> worked<00:04:50.530> so<00:04:51.530> if<00:04:51.800> you<00:04:51.890> have<00:04:52.010> a

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
bad but it still worked so if you have a

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.230 
bad but it still worked so if you have a
sewing<00:04:52.250> machine<00:04:52.370> or<00:04:52.640> if<00:04:52.850> you're<00:04:52.970> a<00:04:53.000> better

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
sewing machine or if you're a better

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.930 
sewing machine or if you're a better
sower<00:04:53.480> than<00:04:53.750> I<00:04:53.840> am<00:04:54.250> then<00:04:55.250> it'll<00:04:55.730> work<00:04:55.850> out

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
sower than I am then it'll work out

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:56.410 
sower than I am then it'll work out
better

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
better
