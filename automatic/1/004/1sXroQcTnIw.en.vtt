okay right here you see a 1994 Komatsu
PC<00:00:03.330> 1000<00:00:03.959> front<00:00:04.200> shovel<00:00:04.589> now<00:00:05.370> these<00:00:05.520> old<00:00:05.670> PC

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
PC 1000 front shovel now these old PC

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.880 
PC 1000 front shovel now these old PC
1000s<00:00:06.720> are<00:00:06.810> pretty<00:00:07.020> hard<00:00:07.259> machines<00:00:07.589> to<00:00:07.710> come

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
1000s are pretty hard machines to come

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.040 
1000s are pretty hard machines to come
across<00:00:08.099> anymore<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:09.000> basically<00:00:09.840> that's

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
across anymore and basically that's

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.330 
across anymore and basically that's
because<00:00:10.440> being<00:00:10.769> that<00:00:10.920> they're<00:00:11.040> an<00:00:11.130> older

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
because being that they're an older

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.310 
because being that they're an older
machine<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:11.880> over<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.540> years<00:00:12.750> Komatsu

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
machine and over the years Komatsu

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.140 
machine and over the years Komatsu
gradually<00:00:14.130> update<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.670> replace<00:00:15.000> this

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
gradually update and replace this

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.420 
gradually update and replace this
machine<00:00:15.509> with<00:00:15.660> them<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.320> PC<00:00:16.680> 1100<00:00:17.310> and

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
machine with them the PC 1100 and

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.029 
machine with them the PC 1100 and
finally<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.970> PC<00:00:18.300> 1250<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:19.470> don't<00:00:19.650> see<00:00:19.830> many

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
finally the PC 1250 you don't see many

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.429 
finally the PC 1250 you don't see many
of<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.279> old<00:00:20.400> 1000<00:00:21.119> seni<00:00:21.300> more<00:00:21.570> but<00:00:22.080> to<00:00:22.199> find

protects<00:01:52.079> them<00:01:52.229> more

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.080 

now<00:01:56.860> round<00:01:57.010> back<00:01:57.250> here<00:01:59.760> here<00:02:00.760> you<00:02:00.850> can<00:02:00.970> see

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
now round back here here you can see

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.230 
now round back here here you can see
your<00:02:01.240> counterweight<00:02:01.750> on<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.990> 1000<00:02:03.240> now

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
your counterweight on the 1000 now

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.360 
your counterweight on the 1000 now
you'll<00:02:04.660> notice<00:02:04.870> that<00:02:04.990> the<00:02:05.260> crawler<00:02:05.650> pads<00:02:06.010> are

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
you'll notice that the crawler pads are

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.029 
you'll notice that the crawler pads are
really<00:02:06.790> narrow<00:02:07.320> shovel<00:02:08.320> fronts<00:02:08.649> this<00:02:08.830> size

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
really narrow shovel fronts this size

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.690 
really narrow shovel fronts this size
always<00:02:09.460> have<00:02:09.880> really<00:02:10.330> narrow<00:02:10.690> crawler<00:02:11.110> pads

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
always have really narrow crawler pads

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.080 
always have really narrow crawler pads
if<00:02:12.700> this<00:02:13.030> PC<00:02:13.630> 1000<00:02:14.260> were<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.470> mass<00:02:14.740> excavator<00:02:15.430> it

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
if this PC 1000 were a mass excavator it

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.910 
if this PC 1000 were a mass excavator it
would<00:02:16.270> have<00:02:16.420> much<00:02:16.840> wider<00:02:17.200> pads<00:02:17.560> now<00:02:17.860> the

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
would have much wider pads now the

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.970 
would have much wider pads now the
reason<00:02:18.310> why<00:02:18.400> you'd<00:02:18.610> want<00:02:18.910> narrow<00:02:19.720> pads<00:02:20.110> for<00:02:20.920> a

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
reason why you'd want narrow pads for a

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.670 
reason why you'd want narrow pads for a
shovel<00:02:21.910> front<00:02:22.150> configuration<00:02:23.020> like<00:02:23.140> this<00:02:23.440> is

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
shovel front configuration like this is

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.470 
shovel front configuration like this is
because<00:02:24.520> being<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:24.970> machine<00:02:25.240> is<00:02:25.360> meant

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
because being that the machine is meant

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.710 
because being that the machine is meant
to<00:02:25.660> work<00:02:25.810> in<00:02:26.020> rocky<00:02:26.680> or<00:02:27.100> solid<00:02:27.880> conditions<00:02:28.360> you

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
to work in rocky or solid conditions you

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.720 
to work in rocky or solid conditions you
don't<00:02:28.750> really<00:02:29.110> need<00:02:29.350> white<00:02:29.590> pads<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.280> the<00:02:30.459> bad

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
don't really need white pads and the bad

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.520 
don't really need white pads and the bad
thing<00:02:30.970> about<00:02:31.030> having<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.600> crawler<00:02:32.230> pads

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
thing about having the crawler pads

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.770 
thing about having the crawler pads
wider<00:02:32.920> is<00:02:33.250> that<00:02:33.820> this<00:02:33.940> machine's<00:02:34.300> working<00:02:34.390> in

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
wider is that this machine's working in

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.840 
wider is that this machine's working in
rocky<00:02:34.989> conditions<00:02:35.260> which<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:36.070> can<00:02:36.310> see<00:02:36.489> here

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
rocky conditions which you can see here

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.199 
rocky conditions which you can see here
it<00:02:37.270> was<00:02:38.250> basically<00:02:39.250> if<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.520> pads<00:02:39.730> are<00:02:39.940> wider

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
it was basically if the pads are wider

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:42.030 
it was basically if the pads are wider
if<00:02:40.510> it's<00:02:40.810> going<00:02:40.959> to<00:02:41.020> be<00:02:41.140> turning<00:02:41.560> and<00:02:41.650> crawling

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
if it's going to be turning and crawling

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.740 
if it's going to be turning and crawling
around<00:02:42.130> on<00:02:42.310> rocks<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:43.120> rocks<00:02:43.270> are<00:02:43.510> just<00:02:43.660> going

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
around on rocks the rocks are just going

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.660 
around on rocks the rocks are just going
to<00:02:43.810> bend<00:02:44.050> the<00:02:44.200> pads<00:02:44.440> on<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.800> machine<00:02:45.130> so<00:02:45.640> you

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
to bend the pads on the machine so you

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.640 
to bend the pads on the machine so you
want<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.300> crawler<00:02:46.570> pads<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:47.020> be<00:02:47.140> smaller<00:02:47.470> on

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
want the crawler pads to be smaller on

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.080 
want the crawler pads to be smaller on
the<00:02:47.739> machine<00:02:48.010> like<00:02:48.190> this<00:02:50.459> and<00:02:51.459> underneath<00:02:51.640> it

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090
