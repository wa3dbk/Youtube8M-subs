second<00:02:34.810> and<00:02:35.489> show<00:02:36.489> you<00:02:36.550> some<00:02:36.819> of<00:02:36.910> the

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
second and show you some of the

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.340 
second and show you some of the
prototypes<00:02:38.819> takes<00:02:39.819> a<00:02:39.940> lot<00:02:40.120> of<00:02:40.150> time<00:02:40.480> to<00:02:41.050> design

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
prototypes takes a lot of time to design

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.840 
prototypes takes a lot of time to design
something<00:02:41.680> like<00:02:41.800> this<00:02:42.100> this<00:02:42.310> was<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:42.610> first

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
something like this this was the first

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.559 
something like this this was the first
prototype<00:02:43.330> I<00:02:43.450> laid<00:02:43.630> out<00:02:43.810> in<00:02:44.380> a<00:02:44.500> fly<00:02:44.709> very<00:02:44.860> well

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
prototype I laid out in a fly very well

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.720 
prototype I laid out in a fly very well
so<00:02:46.569> you<00:02:46.630> know<00:02:46.959> through<00:02:47.200> flight<00:02:47.440> testing<00:02:47.730> I

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
so you know through flight testing I

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.780 
so you know through flight testing I
figure<00:02:49.600> out<00:02:49.720> what<00:02:49.870> to<00:02:49.989> change<00:02:50.640> one<00:02:51.640> of<00:02:51.700> the

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
figure out what to change one of the

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.050 
figure out what to change one of the
things<00:02:51.940> I<00:02:52.120> learned<00:02:52.540> early<00:02:52.870> on<00:02:53.050> is<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:54.060> foam

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
things I learned early on is the foam

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.660 
things I learned early on is the foam
struts<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.660> convene<00:02:55.989> aren't<00:02:56.890> very<00:02:57.190> strong

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
struts and convene aren't very strong

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.430 
struts and convene aren't very strong
and<00:02:58.090> so<00:02:58.239> I<00:02:58.269> forget<00:02:58.630> how<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.810> reinforce<00:02:59.080> them

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
and so I forget how to reinforce them

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.170 
and so I forget how to reinforce them
you<00:02:59.530> see<00:02:59.769> this<00:02:59.920> one<00:03:00.100> totally<00:03:00.850> grenaded<00:03:01.890> so

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
you see this one totally grenaded so

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.340 
you see this one totally grenaded so
several<00:03:04.180> prototypes<00:03:04.480> these<00:03:04.989> are<00:03:05.110> just<00:03:05.260> a

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
several prototypes these are just a

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.990 
several prototypes these are just a
couple<00:03:05.560> I<00:03:05.769> think<00:03:05.980> I<00:03:06.100> ended<00:03:06.310> up<00:03:06.430> with<00:03:06.610> seven<00:03:06.880> or

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
couple I think I ended up with seven or

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.720 
couple I think I ended up with seven or
eight<00:03:07.060> different<00:03:07.720> variations<00:03:08.320> awesome<00:03:09.190> so

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
eight different variations awesome so

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.410 
eight different variations awesome so
the<00:03:09.910> way<00:03:10.030> this<00:03:10.209> works<00:03:10.480> is<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:11.650> graphics<00:03:12.420> are

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
the way this works is the graphics are

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.500 
the way this works is the graphics are
printed<00:03:13.720> on<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:14.019> full<00:03:14.260> sheet<00:03:14.440> label<00:03:15.299> you<00:03:16.299> take<00:03:16.480> a

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
printed on a full sheet label you take a

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.470 
printed on a full sheet label you take a
piece<00:03:16.870> of<00:03:16.900> dollar-store<00:03:17.680> foam<00:03:18.280> board<00:03:18.579> this

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
piece of dollar-store foam board this

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.289 
piece of dollar-store foam board this
paper<00:03:19.810> peels<00:03:20.230> off<00:03:20.440> really<00:03:20.829> easily<00:03:21.040> so<00:03:21.519> that

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
paper peels off really easily so that

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.479 
paper peels off really easily so that
you're<00:03:22.450> left<00:03:22.660> with<00:03:22.810> just<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.109> foam<00:03:23.380> and<00:03:23.650> then

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
you're left with just the foam and then

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.259 
you're left with just the foam and then
you'll<00:03:25.060> head<00:03:25.959> roughly<00:03:26.590> around<00:03:26.910> decals<00:03:27.910> stick

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
you'll head roughly around decals stick

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.030 
you'll head roughly around decals stick
them<00:03:28.420> on<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:28.810> then<00:03:28.930> with<00:03:29.109> an<00:03:29.230> exacto<00:03:29.709> cut<00:03:29.920> out

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
them on and then with an exacto cut out

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.590 
them on and then with an exacto cut out
shaped<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:32.200> just<00:03:32.920> use<00:03:33.130> some<00:03:33.459> metal<00:03:34.030> washers

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
shaped and I just use some metal washers

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.349 
shaped and I just use some metal washers
stack<00:03:35.200> up<00:03:35.380> five<00:03:35.650> but<00:03:36.489> any<00:03:36.640> nose<00:03:36.880> for<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.209> nose

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
stack up five but any nose for the nose

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.220 
stack up five but any nose for the nose
way<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:39.010> that<00:03:39.220> is<00:03:39.400> project<00:03:39.700> number<00:03:40.150> 65<00:03:40.810> the

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
way so that is project number 65 the

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.349 
way so that is project number 65 the
first<00:03:41.530> in<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:41.920> series<00:03:42.130> called<00:03:42.670> foam<00:03:43.060> board

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
first in the series called foam board

is<00:03:53.859> the<00:03:54.070> christen<00:03:54.430> eagle<00:03:54.549> so<00:03:55.329> this<00:03:55.630> project<00:03:55.900> is

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
is the christen eagle so this project is

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.900 
is the christen eagle so this project is
going<00:03:56.560> to<00:03:56.680> be<00:03:56.769> a<00:03:56.799> skill<00:03:57.220> level<00:03:57.489> six<00:03:57.760> a

going to be a skill level six a
supersonic<00:03:58.390> expert<00:03:59.350> project<00:03:59.799> it's<00:04:00.670> about<00:04:01.090> a

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
supersonic expert project it's about a

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.720 
supersonic expert project it's about a
like<00:04:01.450> I<00:04:01.480> said<00:04:01.780> it<00:04:01.870> two<00:04:01.930> and<00:04:02.049> a<00:04:02.109> half<00:04:02.260> hour<00:04:02.410> bill

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
like I said it two and a half hour bill

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.970 
like I said it two and a half hour bill
and<00:04:03.730> made<00:04:03.970> from<00:04:04.209> foam<00:04:04.480> core<00:04:04.780> board<00:04:04.810> some<00:04:05.709> craft

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
and made from foam core board some craft

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.729 
and made from foam core board some craft
foam<00:04:06.160> for<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.430> nose<00:04:06.670> washers<00:04:07.660> for<00:04:08.410> the<00:04:08.530> nose

to build a lot of work to got a ton of
hours<00:04:20.580> and<00:04:20.940> design<00:04:21.510> on<00:04:21.690> this<00:04:21.870> one<00:04:22.080> no<00:04:22.470> I'm

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
hours and design on this one no I'm

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.400 
hours and design on this one no I'm
tired<00:04:22.980> of<00:04:23.130> working<00:04:23.430> on<00:04:23.550> it

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
tired of working on it

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.170 
tired of working on it
yeah<00:04:25.410> probably<00:04:26.070> tired<00:04:26.490> of<00:04:26.610> hearing<00:04:26.670> me<00:04:26.940> whine
