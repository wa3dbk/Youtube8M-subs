00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.970
 The main advantages are those of being able to do research and development in 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.410
 really massive way 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.380
 then counting on the fact that our logistic presence here starts 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.230
 direct contact with, not only car manufacturers, but also with 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.550
 the protagonists of the motor sports and I don't speak only of the pilots but also 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.180
 of view engineers who are sometimes more important to us because 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.450
 by creating collaborations with them we can actually understand them 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.780
 cars how they react on the track, performance 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.899
 the type of setup that is applied on the cars this then 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.460
 in the development of the video game it allows us to 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.250
 being able to create an experience even from a merely physical point of view 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.080
 and technical 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.720
 in short, at high levels 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.880
 the career mode starting from the last question will come with the release candidate 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.290
 of the game that is expected soon 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.130
 and will give the possibility to start a whole series of events, starting of course 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.510
 from the less performing cars for then 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.710
 to reach the most interesting ones at the championships with the most built GTs for 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.510
 with regard to the new methods, we foresee the release, also for next year 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.150
 of new additional contents not only for payment but also content 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.470
 integrated into the game new special events, a career more 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.270
 built, to a whole series of 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.910
 game options that in version 1.0 are not present but will be developed later 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.520
 and will be available as free updates such as 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.390
 l extension of the pit stop system, from multiplayer to mobality 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.290
 single player 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.420
 regarding career mode 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.119
 we will have a series of events that 

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:45.229
 return the typical family feeling of Gran Turismo games 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:47.799
 to interest 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.630
 and make the game more usable and intuitive for casual gamers 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.270
 and there will be a whole series of special events that you can select in 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.060
 so as not to build a purely linear career 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.930
 but to be able to proceed schemes or 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.730
 let's take different directions than what 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.850
 the main career thread could suggest 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.370
 as for the damage model, the version that will be released soon 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.829
 it will include the total management of both aesthetic and mechanical damages and all damage 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.339
 they can be activated or deactivated 

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:33.449
 and there are different types of damage: not just the suspension, the engine, the gearbox 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:34.500
 according to 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.260
 of driving style or the collisions and collisions that may exist but 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.259
 will be influenced above all by what the pilot does 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:46.699
 this means that there may also be punctures when you go into 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:50.289
 too aggressive and continuous on the curbs, for example the machines 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:55.389
 roads that are not normally used for that type of approach e 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.550
 this will return an experience 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:02.430
 to the pilot and to the players who assimilates a lot to reality 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.849
 over time when publishers began to notice us 

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:17.309
 and Assetto Corsa. Several proposals have arrived and continue to arrive. what 

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:20.859
 that we did an Assetto Corsa especially with regard to the 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:21.889
 pc version 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.430
 it was continuing on the line that we had given ourselves at the beginning. 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.890
 Steam's Early Access program went incredibly well 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.870
 has exceeded our most optimistic expectations 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.500
 and this has obviously brought many revenues and we have decided to 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.469
 continue to follow the strategy we followed from the beginning 

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:47.659
 or that of reinvesting a good part of these revenues and 

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:51.339
 the acquisition of new licenses for new contents and also widening the team of 

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:52.360
 development that by now 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.300
 from the initial six when we started working on the project they became fifteen 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.430
 people, fifteen really very good and very important elements for development 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.279
 of the game 

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:07.649
 our idea is to continue perhaps to collaborate also with the big houses but 

00:05:07.649 --> 00:05:11.939
 maintaining our independence from the point of view of the game design of the type of strategy and of 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:14.159
 policy that we want to implement in such a way as to 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:18.219
 continue to give users the players what enthusiasts expect from us
