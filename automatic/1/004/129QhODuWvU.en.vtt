viruses<00:01:13.000> each<00:01:13.510> of<00:01:13.750> these<00:01:13.870> will<00:01:14.229> respond<00:01:14.770> to

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
viruses each of these will respond to

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.730 
viruses each of these will respond to
the<00:01:15.100> animals<00:01:15.490> at<00:01:15.940> different<00:01:16.390> times<00:01:16.659> and<00:01:16.930> in

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
different manners so what we do is

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.820 
different manners so what we do is
follow<00:01:19.690> very<00:01:19.990> regimented<00:01:20.229> proach

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830
