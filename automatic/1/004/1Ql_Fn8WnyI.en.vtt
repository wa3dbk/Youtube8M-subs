00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
update DLC does finally release now I

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.910 
update DLC does finally release now I
was<00:01:17.420> thinking<00:01:17.780> that<00:01:17.930> this<00:01:18.110> will<00:01:18.350> probably<00:01:18.650> be

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
was thinking that this will probably be

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.280 
was thinking that this will probably be
the<00:01:19.130> biggest<00:01:19.430> update<00:01:19.880> DLC<00:01:20.720> so<00:01:20.990> far

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
the biggest update DLC so far

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.680 
the biggest update DLC so far
considering<00:01:22.130> it<00:01:22.520> is<00:01:22.700> actually<00:01:22.910> taking<00:01:23.480> so

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
considering it is actually taking so

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.600 
considering it is actually taking so
long<00:01:23.720> to<00:01:23.960> be<00:01:24.230> released<00:01:24.620> it's<00:01:25.100> been<00:01:25.340> well<00:01:25.580> over

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
long to be released it's been well over

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.090 
long to be released it's been well over
a<00:01:25.970> month<00:01:26.240> since<00:01:26.600> we've<00:01:26.810> had<00:01:26.930> our<00:01:27.140> previous<00:01:27.560> DLC

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
a month since we've had our previous DLC

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.460 
a month since we've had our previous DLC
and<00:01:28.250> like<00:01:29.150> I<00:01:29.180> said<00:01:29.450> I'm<00:01:29.630> thinking<00:01:30.230> this<00:01:30.350> is

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
and like I said I'm thinking this is

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.170 
and like I said I'm thinking this is
possibly<00:01:30.920> one<00:01:31.190> of<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.430> biggest<00:01:31.670> if<00:01:32.000> not<00:01:32.030> the

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
possibly one of the biggest if not the

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.170 
possibly one of the biggest if not the
biggest<00:01:32.270> DLC<00:01:32.990> update<00:01:33.020> we<00:01:33.920> have<00:01:34.100> gotten<00:01:34.550> so<00:01:34.850> far

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
biggest DLC update we have gotten so far

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.510 
biggest DLC update we have gotten so far
I<00:01:35.540> really<00:01:36.320> honestly<00:01:36.560> think<00:01:37.100> we'll<00:01:37.280> be<00:01:37.310> getting

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
I really honestly think we'll be getting

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.970 
I really honestly think we'll be getting
the<00:01:37.790> casino<00:01:38.270> DLC<00:01:38.510> or<00:01:38.840> maybe<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.380> pilot<00:01:39.710> school

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
the casino DLC or maybe the pilot school

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.010 
the casino DLC or maybe the pilot school
DLC<00:01:40.520> or<00:01:40.550> maybe<00:01:40.850> just<00:01:40.910> the<00:01:41.120> Hydra<00:01:41.540> or<00:01:41.720> attack

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
DLC or maybe just the Hydra or attack

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.680 
DLC or maybe just the Hydra or attack
helicopter<00:01:42.710> in<00:01:42.950> the<00:01:43.160> next<00:01:43.790> book<00:01:43.970> data<00:01:44.210> I<00:01:44.420> think

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
helicopter in the next book data I think

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.630 
helicopter in the next book data I think
we<00:01:44.810> have<00:01:44.840> a<00:01:44.960> very<00:01:45.290> high<00:01:45.590> chance<00:01:45.620> of<00:01:46.160> getting

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
we have a very high chance of getting

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.450 
we have a very high chance of getting
them<00:01:46.790> one<00:01:47.420> because<00:01:47.660> like<00:01:48.020> i<00:01:48.050> said<00:01:48.200> this<00:01:48.560> dlc<00:01:49.340> is

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
them one because like i said this dlc is

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.700 
them one because like i said this dlc is
being<00:01:49.670> delayed<00:01:50.030> for<00:01:50.780> quite<00:01:51.080> a<00:01:51.110> long<00:01:51.170> time<00:01:51.290> now

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
being delayed for quite a long time now

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.380 
being delayed for quite a long time now
so<00:01:51.980> possibly<00:01:52.460> meaning<00:01:52.820> it<00:01:52.910> could<00:01:53.000> be<00:01:53.120> a<00:01:53.150> big

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
so possibly meaning it could be a big

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.530 
so possibly meaning it could be a big
deal<00:01:53.540> see<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:53.960> they<00:01:54.080> are<00:01:54.200> all<00:01:54.350> big<00:01:54.590> DLCs<00:01:55.220> and

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
deal see and they are all big DLCs and

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.870 
deal see and they are all big DLCs and
also<00:01:56.540> we've<00:01:57.050> had<00:01:57.230> so<00:01:57.470> many<00:01:57.680> leaks<00:01:58.070> recently

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
also we've had so many leaks recently

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.960 
also we've had so many leaks recently
about<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.510> casino<00:02:00.020> DLC<00:02:00.290> and<00:02:00.860> you<00:02:01.670> know<00:02:01.790> the

hydra the powerschool deal soo about so

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.830 
hydra the powerschool deal soo about so
many<00:02:04.070> leaks<00:02:04.340> about<00:02:04.550> that<00:02:04.880> that<00:02:05.360> I<00:02:05.390> think<00:02:05.690> we're

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
many leaks about that that I think we're

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.360 
many leaks about that that I think we're
coming<00:02:05.960> very<00:02:06.290> close<00:02:06.500> to<00:02:06.770> actually<00:02:07.070> having

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
coming very close to actually having

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.009 
coming very close to actually having
that<00:02:07.490> being<00:02:07.730> brought<00:02:08.000> into<00:02:08.269> the<00:02:08.539> game<00:02:08.750> if<00:02:08.899> we

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
that being brought into the game if we

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.229 
that being brought into the game if we
don't<00:02:09.229> get<00:02:09.379> them<00:02:09.590> next<00:02:10.129> Tuesday<00:02:10.729> or<00:02:10.910> when<00:02:11.090> Lee

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
don't get them next Tuesday or when Lee

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.560 
don't get them next Tuesday or when Lee
1.16<00:02:12.019> what<00:02:12.290> date<00:02:12.530> does<00:02:12.769> come<00:02:13.099> out<00:02:13.220> then<00:02:13.910> no

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
1.16 what date does come out then no

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:16.630 
1.16 what date does come out then no
doubt<00:02:14.810> about<00:02:15.020> it<00:02:15.170> we<00:02:15.530> are<00:02:15.650> just<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.130> couple<00:02:16.400> of

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
doubt about it we are just a couple of

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.940 
doubt about it we are just a couple of
weeks<00:02:16.790> away<00:02:17.000> until<00:02:17.870> we<00:02:18.050> do<00:02:18.170> actually<00:02:18.530> get<00:02:18.710> them

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
weeks away until we do actually get them

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.260 
weeks away until we do actually get them
or<00:02:19.250> maybe<00:02:19.550> even<00:02:19.700> the

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
or maybe even the

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.970 
or maybe even the
heist<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:21.050> that's<00:02:21.230> what<00:02:21.380> I<00:02:21.410> think<00:02:21.680> we<00:02:21.770> could<00:02:21.860> be

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
heist so that's what I think we could be

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.620 
heist so that's what I think we could be
getting<00:02:22.070> guys<00:02:22.340> but<00:02:22.550> the<00:02:22.640> question<00:02:23.000> is<00:02:23.180> what<00:02:23.540> do

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
getting guys but the question is what do

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.510 
getting guys but the question is what do
you<00:02:23.660> think<00:02:24.020> we'll<00:02:24.140> be<00:02:24.170> getting<00:02:24.350> in<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.680> 1.16

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
you think we'll be getting in the 1.16

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.850 
you think we'll be getting in the 1.16
updates<00:02:26.090> also<00:02:26.300> do<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:26.810> think<00:02:27.050> this<00:02:27.170> dlc<00:02:27.650> for
