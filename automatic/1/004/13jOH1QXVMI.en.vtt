00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
into the the corners of it so we can

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.830 
into the the corners of it so we can

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:32.319 
so often this broad here is the practice
hunting<00:01:16.360> out<00:01:16.660> of<00:01:16.690> it

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.039 

now<00:01:33.329> what<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.600> want<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.899> do<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:36.049> cook

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
them more monkey it's kind of cool top

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.770 
them more monkey it's kind of cool top
on<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.710> very<00:01:40.920> top<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:42.299> just<00:01:42.509> take<00:01:42.750> that

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
on the very top of you just take that

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.210 
on the very top of you just take that
and<00:01:43.289> pull<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.509> until<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.840> snaps<00:01:46.080> there<00:01:46.950> goes

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
and pull it until it snaps there goes

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.969 
and pull it until it snaps there goes
snaps<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.270> top<00:01:48.479> works<00:01:48.780> ratings<00:01:49.229> each

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
snaps and so the top works ratings each

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.080 
snaps and so the top works ratings each
side<00:01:50.520> has<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.780> pull<00:01:52.350> up<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:53.520> just<00:01:53.729> pull<00:01:53.970> it
