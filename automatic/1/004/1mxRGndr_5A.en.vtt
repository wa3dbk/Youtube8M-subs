00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580
 do you know that too are too long 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.350
 have launched mobile phone or naked 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.730
 Suddenly , what hurts smartphones 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.200
 to do our health around it 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.130
 go today I am philipp and that 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.110
 the Basque it has the potential to 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.460
 new folk disease, the text is not 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.410
 Above all, people are at risk 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.510
 constantly hanging from the pc or permanent 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.100
 So you all had your smartphone 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.750
 with text becomes weak and 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.640
 called chromed neck and this 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.710
 arises from his head 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.180
 keeps lowered just because you're on 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.590
 look at the pc or on a smartphone 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.390
 this attitude is unhealthy and 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.830
 Candidates permanently harm that 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.420
 sounds a little bit abstruse though 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.070
 Imagine an average 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.809
 head of an adult so my 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.489
 example like a whole five kilos and if 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.710
 you constantly bent five kilos forward 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.629
 So then the spine becomes too 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.399
 heavily loaded that leads to a broken 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.320
 neck shoulder and also head fast 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.670
 in extreme cases can also muscle strain 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.379
 pinched nerves and the 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.820
 herniated disc be the result 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.230
 but that's not enough 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.000
 Curved posture also complicates the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.649
 breathing that in turn affects the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.899
 Lungs out can actually get out 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.660
 reduce lung capacity by 30 percent 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.370
 by 30 percent and if too little 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.019
 Oxygen in the blood is then that can 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.610
 in turn lead to vascular disease 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.080
 a crooked attitude will also change 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.820
 still negative on the back and on the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.770
 Internal organs when the body 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.780
 constantly slightly bent forward is 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.340
 put pressure on the organs that can 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.990
 lead to stomach and intestinal complaints 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.909
 By the way, the text mac and all 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.820
 Consequential no new knowledge 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.930
 in 2008, us chiropractor dr 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.580
 the fishman the concept of 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.500
 public he had presented 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.450
 at that time a 17 year old female patient 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.250
 the head and neck pain plagues 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.659
 conversation with the mother and observation 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.400
 like the year old sitting diligently in the 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.220
 grope their smartphones today made 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.329
 the diagnosis klartext mac 2012 proved 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.130
 a British study of 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.049
 Physiotherapist union that the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.670
 using mobile devices and computers too 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.590
 damage to health 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.600
 2,000 workers were examined for this 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.549
 especially longer working hours and the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.960
 private use of pcs and mobile 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.509
 Terminals led to the physical 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.369
 Overload of the nowadays yes pcs and 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.259
 smartphones are not just our privacy 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.210
 but also our everyday work 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.070
 Determining more also reduces the risk of 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.479
 physical long-term damage to only before 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.430
 recently became over 35 years old 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.649
 Taiwanese reports one's neck 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.329
 70 years old man had those on 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.160
 three hours spent at his 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.509
 smartphone to play well that this 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.920
 can not be very healthy 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.690
 somehow logical but that it too 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.170
 Extreme physical damage is the result 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.209
 but first 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.010
 other typical smartphone symptoms 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.200
 are the mobile arms of the chatting hump 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.730
 and the whatsapp pete is who knows her 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.930
 not the osze is one 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.150
 Tendinitis by 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.680
 excessive cities caused the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.360
 Handy arms writes the one-sided 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.800
 Strain on wrist thumb and 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.000
 shoulder of the pest hump is one 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.739
 nicer description for the hunchback 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.989
 Notre Dame speaks of the bowed one 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.580
 back also by excessive 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.910
 Chat or write emails are created 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.440
 can 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.000
 but all these diseases do not come 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.950
 like an unstoppable avalanche on us 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.080
 Rolls up because you can prevent 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.610
 regular breaks stretches shoulder 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.709
 circles give the body ever 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.940
 a breather 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.410
 theoretically you should every 20 minutes 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.120
 get up and stretch 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.260
 it is practical that in labor and 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.209
 school day but not really 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.310
 you should also be able to implement it 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:01.709
 neck and neck not more than 15 to 30 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.510
 grad crumble about one way or the other 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.799
 Similar to sports like cycling 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.269
 Swimming and yoga are good 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.860
 compensation for the body so that we 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.150
 We know how to use our smartphone correctly 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.310
 There is even an app now 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.080
 this is called the text indicator 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.640
 was invented by dr serving fishman 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.080
 this app will let you know immediately 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.640
 if you keep your smartphone wrong 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.290
 can lead to body damage 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.150
 so that the user knows when he will be 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.650
 Smartphone right and wrong 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.280
 the app works with a simple one 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.840
 color system green good and red evil 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.060
 If you keep your phone wrong, it lights up 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.079
 on the left upper red spot were on if that 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.310
 but not enough is still possible 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.980
 additionally a vibration alarm 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.570
 without a signal tone you have 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.280
 the position of the smartphone correctly 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.079
 corrected, the red dot changes its 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.280
 color in green I want to have my part 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.660
 are now a bit used 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.700
 surprising to see when i put everything in 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.450
 a smartphone case switch here it works 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.340
 By the way, to another 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.690
 medical app and this is about 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.190
 to do the search 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.570
 what do you think the app would do to the app 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.620
 now change your attitude and have 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.209
 you might already complain 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.870
 Write us the whole happy in the 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.910
 Comments 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.910
 and I would say nice evening yet
