00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 the fifa proves luxury only that helicopter 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:09.540
 black ops 3 new lp drive direct from e3 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.330
 today we can play both big 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.460
 fifa 16 and pro digital soccer games 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.509
 evolution soccer 2010 16 let's talk 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.789
 fifa first 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.490
 it follows the previous game recipe that 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.230
 increased the speed a bit and made 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.939
 some graphic changes obviously 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.130
 because he was the first to be totally 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.349
 made for this new generation of consoles 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.119
 but the biggest news is women 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.740
 inside the game and I was able to play a 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.570
 with them and cool is that they do not 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.770
 simply put women in the 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.020
 place of players 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.180
 they did another mode is 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.160
 much slower they have a past 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.020
 different and soon after when I moved to 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.210
 playing in male mode wants to hear a 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.770
 very big difference in the changes 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.930
 gameplay are very simple and the 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.489
 best in my opinion were the pass 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.530
 stronger than now instead of you 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.570
 squeeze the guy a lot of strength you can 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.250
 simply tighten the left seat 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.840
 he will give a pass rasante 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.760
 the other is that the kicks from outside the area 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.739
 became better and the defense was a 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.359
 little smarter by 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.820
 attacker at times was a luxury 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.040
 only in 2016 it is also here in e3 ea 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.590
 people played and I'll tell you that it's not 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.020
 great thing the players are very 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.450
 and the response to commands 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.189
 remains slow at various times when 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.869
 I was with the ball was running for 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.939
 attack looked like the players were 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.549
 with hand brake pulled models 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.200
 too heavy then too slow 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.090
 it seems that they are all in a 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.530
 speed back the goalkeepers 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.689
 continue to be very 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.090
 automatic several times I kicked the goal 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.220
 and it simply spread were 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.350
 moving like robots not much 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.670
 intelligent and finally the graphic change 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.100
 that they promised of more 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.990
 realist and everything else did not happen 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.909
 player models and 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.369
 stadiums that they are quite square 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.200
 until then for now 2016 feet still 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.600
 needs to evolve to reach the level of 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.700
 black ops 3 was a 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.530
 grateful surprise despite repeating the 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.420
 clear formula of its predecessors in 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.619
 some interesting changes in the 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.140
 multiplayer that we can play 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.969
 for about 20-30 minutes 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.799
 here at e3 we saw that everything was a 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.840
 little faster there are several 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.819
 special skills and even new 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.800
 character classes like everything now 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.050
 involves a high technology you can 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.670
 jump very large distances 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.230
 punch the ground and kill the people who 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.810
 are around you can also 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.250
 hacking a certain type of vehicle with your 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.470
 hand then you are practically one 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.420
 You are a super soldier who 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.460
 can do many things at the same time. 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.930
 time to study a fantasy medium 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.240
 black ops and we'll be able to see this one 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.700
 little more in the single player campaign than 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.650
 This time it will gather four people going 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.810
 be a glass of up to four players who 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.820
 will be able to play online or local and this 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.620
 For me it's better than the novelty of the game. 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.020
 will be able to let play with all four 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.040
 friends on the couch and this is really cool if 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.750
 Do you also want to continue these 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.700
 news of call of duty fifa and pes 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.810
 enjoy the video and so on the channel because 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.810
 people are going to talk about a lot of game yet
