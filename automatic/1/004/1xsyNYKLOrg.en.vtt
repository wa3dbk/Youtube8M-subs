truly a better way to run your equipment
I<00:02:40.610> mean<00:02:40.909> the<00:02:41.060> ease-of-use<00:02:41.239> the<00:02:41.959> reductions<00:02:42.469> in

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
I mean the ease-of-use the reductions in

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.569 
I mean the ease-of-use the reductions in
particulates

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
particulates

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.360

there's<00:02:44.079> 97%<00:02:45.079> less<00:02:45.109> particulates<00:02:46.010> in<00:02:46.159> this

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
there's 97% less particulates in this

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.479 
there's 97% less particulates in this
and<00:02:46.730> particulates<00:02:47.569> is<00:02:47.780> a<00:02:47.890> reason<00:02:48.890> for<00:02:49.069> a<00:02:49.129> lot

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
and particulates is a reason for a lot

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.539 
and particulates is a reason for a lot
of<00:02:49.670> health<00:02:49.969> disease<00:02:50.359> we've<00:02:50.540> had<00:02:51.079> the<00:02:51.590> good
