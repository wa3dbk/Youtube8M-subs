the<00:00:38.160> next<00:00:38.430> video<00:00:38.700> I'll<00:00:38.820> be<00:00:38.910> doing<00:00:39.239> here<00:00:39.600> is

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
the next video I'll be doing here is

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.780 
the next video I'll be doing here is
McPherson<00:00:40.739> strut<00:00:41.070> which<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.550> next

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
McPherson strut which is the next

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.420 
McPherson strut which is the next
segment<00:00:42.149> in<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.829> sort<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.950> suspension

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
segment in this sort of suspension

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.529 
segment in this sort of suspension
series<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.870> McPherson<00:00:46.590> strut<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.360> basic<00:00:48.360> idea

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
series so McPherson strut a basic idea

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.319 
series so McPherson strut a basic idea
is<00:00:49.230> you've<00:00:49.680> got<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> single<00:00:50.399> control<00:00:50.850> arm<00:00:51.120> which

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
is you've got a single control arm which

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.790 
is you've got a single control arm which
is<00:00:51.360> going<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.629> connect<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.199> bottom<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
is going to connect to the bottom of the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.279 
is going to connect to the bottom of the
wheel<00:00:52.949> hub<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.460> then<00:00:54.390> you're<00:00:54.989> going<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.140> have

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
wheel hub and then you're going to have

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.619 
wheel hub and then you're going to have
a<00:00:55.350> shock<00:00:55.739> spring<00:00:56.190> combination<00:00:57.059> which

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
a shock spring combination which

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.069 
a shock spring combination which
connects<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.230> top<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> wheel<00:00:58.949> hub<00:00:59.190> and

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
connects to the top of the wheel hub and

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.399 
connects to the top of the wheel hub and
so<00:01:01.190> this<00:01:02.190> shock<00:01:02.789> spring<00:01:03.180> or<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> strut<00:01:04.229> is

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
so this shock spring or a strut is

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.679 
so this shock spring or a strut is
connected<00:01:05.010> directly<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.119> body<00:01:06.299> at<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
connected directly to the body at the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.179 
connected directly to the body at the
top<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.170> that's<00:01:07.320> what<00:01:07.500> what<00:01:07.890> kind<00:01:08.130> of

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
top so that's what what kind of

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.130 
top so that's what what kind of
separates<00:01:08.610> McPherson<00:01:09.360> strut<00:01:09.600> apart<00:01:09.960> from

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
separates McPherson strut apart from

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.109 
separates McPherson strut apart from
other<00:01:10.350> suspension<00:01:11.130> setups<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.970> it's

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
other suspension setups is that it's

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.600 
other suspension setups is that it's
directly<00:01:12.600> connected<00:01:13.049> here<00:01:13.229> at<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.350> top<00:01:13.610> with

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
directly connected here at the top with

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.300 
directly connected here at the top with
this<00:01:14.790> shock<00:01:15.360> spring<00:01:15.659> combo<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.409> then<00:01:17.070> you're

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
this shock spring combo and then you're

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.740 
this shock spring combo and then you're
going<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.640> steering<00:01:18.090> link<00:01:18.299> come<00:01:18.570> in

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
going to have a steering link come in

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.899 
going to have a steering link come in
that<00:01:18.930> connects<00:01:19.229> also<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.830> hub<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.340> it

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
that connects also to this hub and it

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.060 
that connects also to this hub and it
can<00:01:21.090> connect<00:01:21.420> right<00:01:21.630> where<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.229> shock<00:01:22.860> and

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
can connect right where the shock and

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.410 
can connect right where the shock and
spring<00:01:23.280> combo<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.759> coming<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.210> so<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:26.420> essence

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
spring combo is coming in so in essence

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.770 
spring combo is coming in so in essence
then<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.869> can<00:01:28.020> think<00:01:28.320> of<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:29.210> strut<00:01:30.210> here<00:01:30.600> as

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
then you can think of the strut here as

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.480 
then you can think of the strut here as
the<00:01:31.470> also<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.310> steering<00:01:32.670> axis<00:01:33.119> for<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:33.869> tire

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
the also the steering axis for this tire

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.890 
the also the steering axis for this tire
so<00:01:35.490> that's<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.000> basic<00:01:36.299> setup<00:01:36.479> you've<00:01:36.720> got

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
so that's the basic setup you've got

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.719 
so that's the basic setup you've got
this<00:01:37.049> bottom<00:01:37.500> controller<00:01:38.490> which<00:01:38.700> is

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
this bottom controller which is

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.270 
this bottom controller which is
connected<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.390> car<00:01:39.540> body<00:01:39.720> or<00:01:39.930> frame<00:01:40.280> and

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
connected to the car body or frame and

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.730 
connected to the car body or frame and
that's<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.360> one<00:01:42.810> once<00:01:43.049> again<00:01:43.320> then<00:01:43.590> you've

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
that's just one once again then you've

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.350 
that's just one once again then you've
got<00:01:43.890> this<00:01:44.009> open<00:01:44.220> space<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.909> center<00:01:45.180> which

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
got this open space in the center which

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.649 
got this open space in the center which
is<00:01:45.540> beneficial<00:01:45.960> as<00:01:46.439> i/o<00:01:46.619> point<00:01:47.009> help<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
is beneficial as i/o point help so the

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.139 
is beneficial as i/o point help so the
good<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.530> McPherson<00:01:50.159> strut<00:01:50.490> what's<00:01:50.939> so

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
good of a McPherson strut what's so

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.990 
good of a McPherson strut what's so
great<00:01:51.329> about<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.780> design<00:01:52.369> well<00:01:53.369> it's<00:01:53.610> cheap

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
great about this design well it's cheap

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.510 
great about this design well it's cheap
it's<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:54.630> fairly<00:01:54.930> simple<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.860> it's<00:01:56.159> lighter

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
it's it's fairly simple and it's lighter

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.160 
it's it's fairly simple and it's lighter
than<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.880> double-a<00:01:57.479> arm<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:57.810> there's<00:01:57.990> benefits

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
than a double-a arm so there's benefits

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.350 
than a double-a arm so there's benefits
there<00:01:58.619> with<00:01:58.829> weight<00:01:59.040> savings<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.790> cost

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
there with weight savings and cost

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.690 
there with weight savings and cost
savings<00:02:00.780> as<00:02:00.930> well<00:02:01.110> many<00:02:01.399> companies<00:02:02.399> will<00:02:02.579> go

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
savings as well many companies will go

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.819 
savings as well many companies will go
to<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.909> McPherson<00:02:03.450> strut<00:02:04.110> simply<00:02:04.409> because<00:02:04.680> it

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
to the McPherson strut simply because it

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.800 
to the McPherson strut simply because it
can<00:02:05.009> get<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.250> job<00:02:05.430> done<00:02:05.640> for<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> cheaper<00:02:06.780> price

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
can get the job done for a cheaper price

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.389 
can get the job done for a cheaper price
and<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.469> consumer<00:02:07.860> will<00:02:07.979> notice<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
and the consumer will notice the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.809 
and the consumer will notice the
difference<00:02:08.959> um<00:02:09.959> it's<00:02:10.619> great<00:02:10.860> for<00:02:11.190> front<00:02:11.550> wheel

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
difference um it's great for front wheel

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:14.300 
difference um it's great for front wheel
drive<00:02:11.969> because<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.719> the<00:02:12.810> space<00:02:13.109> it<00:02:13.319> allows<00:02:13.560> so

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
drive because of the space it allows so

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.369 
drive because of the space it allows so
as<00:02:14.609> you<00:02:14.760> can<00:02:14.909> see<00:02:15.150> here<00:02:15.540> there's<00:02:15.810> nothing<00:02:16.049> in

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
as you can see here there's nothing in

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.289 
as you can see here there's nothing in
this<00:02:16.499> center<00:02:16.769> area<00:02:16.799> so<00:02:17.519> you<00:02:17.609> can<00:02:17.760> easily<00:02:17.939> put

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
this center area so you can easily put

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.959 
this center area so you can easily put
in<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.510> drive<00:02:18.780> drive<00:02:19.530> shaft<00:02:19.739> here<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.249> have<00:02:20.939> a

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:20.969 
in a drive drive shaft here and have a

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:22.819 
in a drive drive shaft here and have a
CV<00:02:21.329> joint<00:02:21.599> that<00:02:21.840> goes<00:02:22.019> right<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.349> this<00:02:22.560> tire

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
CV joint that goes right to this tire

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.759 
CV joint that goes right to this tire
and<00:02:23.329> rotates<00:02:24.329> this<00:02:24.569> wheel<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.139> it's<00:02:25.260> right<00:02:25.530> for

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
and rotates this wheel so it's right for

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.709 
and rotates this wheel so it's right for
front-wheel<00:02:26.189> drive<00:02:26.219> in<00:02:26.760> that<00:02:27.150> sense<00:02:27.480> because

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
front-wheel drive in that sense because

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.289 
front-wheel drive in that sense because
it<00:02:28.049> accommodates<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.650> space<00:02:28.950> if<00:02:29.219> you<00:02:29.730> had<00:02:29.969> a

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 
it accommodates the space if you had a

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.660 
it accommodates the space if you had a
double<00:02:31.170> control<00:02:31.709> arm<00:02:32.010> then<00:02:32.189> you'd<00:02:32.340> have<00:02:32.459> two

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
double control arm then you'd have two

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.569 
double control arm then you'd have two
year<00:02:32.939> two<00:02:33.389> control<00:02:33.719> arms<00:02:33.930> here<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.409> then<00:02:34.950> you

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
year two control arms here and then you

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.520 
year two control arms here and then you
might<00:02:35.760> have<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:36.030> spring<00:02:36.420> or<00:02:36.569> shock<00:02:36.599> in<00:02:37.170> between

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
might have a spring or shock in between

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.869 
might have a spring or shock in between
these<00:02:37.739> two<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.280> that<00:02:38.370> would<00:02:38.489> eliminate<00:02:38.669> that

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
these two and that would eliminate that

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.629 
these two and that would eliminate that
space<00:02:39.359> for<00:02:39.900> putting<00:02:40.169> in<00:02:40.349> a<00:02:40.560> drive<00:02:40.799> shaft<00:02:41.040> which

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
space for putting in a drive shaft which

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:43.190 
space for putting in a drive shaft which
you<00:02:41.819> can<00:02:42.060> change<00:02:42.450> but<00:02:42.719> it's<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.900> little<00:02:43.019> more

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
you can change but it's a little more

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.170 
you can change but it's a little more
complicated<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:44.219> that<00:02:44.340> my<00:02:44.430> fierson<00:02:44.819> Strutz<00:02:45.060> an

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
complicated so that my fierson Strutz an

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.479 
complicated so that my fierson Strutz an
easy<00:02:45.329> way<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.569> doing<00:02:45.719> it<00:02:47.329> another<00:02:49.459> benefit<00:02:50.459> of

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
easy way of doing it another benefit of

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.750 
easy way of doing it another benefit of
a<00:02:51.000> McPherson<00:02:51.840> strut<00:02:52.169> is<00:02:52.349> it's<00:02:52.980> narrower<00:02:53.370> than

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
a McPherson strut is it's narrower than

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.789 
a McPherson strut is it's narrower than
double<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.299> arm<00:02:54.480> or<00:02:54.750> double<00:02:55.019> control<00:02:55.349> arm<00:02:55.560> or

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
double a arm or double control arm or

double a arm or double control arm or
double<00:02:56.099> wishbone<00:02:56.400> whatever<00:02:56.730> you'd<00:02:56.849> like<00:02:56.879> to

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
double wishbone whatever you'd like to

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.309 
double wishbone whatever you'd like to
call<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.239> so<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.620> space<00:02:59.329> from<00:03:00.329> the<00:03:00.689> tire<00:03:00.959> to

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
call it so the space from the tire to

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.789 
call it so the space from the tire to
the<00:03:01.349> car<00:03:01.680> itself<00:03:02.099> is<00:03:02.629> minimized<00:03:03.629> so<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.650> can

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
the car itself is minimized so you can

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.890 
the car itself is minimized so you can
really<00:03:05.129> you<00:03:05.340> can<00:03:05.459> really<00:03:05.699> locate<00:03:06.090> this<00:03:06.299> in<00:03:06.599> in

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
really you can really locate this in in

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.409 
really you can really locate this in in
smaller<00:03:07.290> areas<00:03:07.889> and<00:03:08.129> you<00:03:08.549> can<00:03:08.730> with<00:03:08.909> these<00:03:09.000> two

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:09.419 
smaller areas and you can with these two

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:11.089 
smaller areas and you can with these two
control<00:03:09.840> arms<00:03:10.139> you've<00:03:10.260> got<00:03:10.290> one<00:03:10.620> long<00:03:10.799> one<00:03:10.980> at

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
control arms you've got one long one at

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.649 
control arms you've got one long one at
the<00:03:11.159> bottom<00:03:11.310> and<00:03:11.609> a<00:03:11.879> shorter<00:03:12.150> one<00:03:12.269> at<00:03:12.389> the<00:03:12.449> top

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
the bottom and a shorter one at the top

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.599 
the bottom and a shorter one at the top
and<00:03:12.959> you<00:03:13.319> have<00:03:13.469> this<00:03:13.590> large<00:03:13.859> space<00:03:14.069> that<00:03:14.250> you

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
and you have this large space that you

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.539 
and you have this large space that you
need<00:03:14.780> in<00:03:15.780> your<00:03:15.840> vehicle<00:03:16.530> for<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:17.040> be<00:03:17.310> able<00:03:17.400> to

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
need in your vehicle for to be able to

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.439 
need in your vehicle for to be able to
do<00:03:17.669> this<00:03:17.819> so<00:03:18.479> that's<00:03:18.689> one<00:03:19.069> negative<00:03:20.180> side<00:03:21.180> of

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449 
do this so that's one negative side of

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:26.210 
do this so that's one negative side of
the<00:03:22.790> double<00:03:23.790> wishbone<00:03:24.120> suspension<00:03:24.919> so<00:03:25.919> what's

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
the double wishbone suspension so what's

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.640 
the double wishbone suspension so what's
the<00:03:26.370> bad<00:03:26.489> part<00:03:26.549> of<00:03:27.030> a<00:03:27.269> McPherson<00:03:27.810> strut<00:03:28.139> well

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
the bad part of a McPherson strut well

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.119 
the bad part of a McPherson strut well
it's<00:03:28.949> taller<00:03:29.430> than<00:03:29.909> a<00:03:30.290> double<00:03:31.290> can<00:03:31.560> double

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
it's taller than a double can double

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.670 
it's taller than a double can double
wishbone<00:03:32.489> suspension<00:03:32.900> what<00:03:33.900> I<00:03:33.930> mean<00:03:34.169> there<00:03:34.409> is

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
wishbone suspension what I mean there is

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.589 
wishbone suspension what I mean there is
it<00:03:35.189> takes<00:03:35.519> up<00:03:35.669> a<00:03:35.729> lot<00:03:35.759> of<00:03:35.970> vertical<00:03:36.299> space<00:03:36.569> so

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
it takes up a lot of vertical space so

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.179 
it takes up a lot of vertical space so
with<00:03:36.930> two<00:03:37.079> control<00:03:37.470> arms<00:03:37.709> you<00:03:37.769> don't<00:03:37.949> have<00:03:38.069> to

00:03:38.179 --> 00:03:38.189 
with two control arms you don't have to

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:40.249 
with two control arms you don't have to
have<00:03:38.310> that<00:03:38.430> vertical<00:03:38.669> space<00:03:39.120> requirement<00:03:39.720> so

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:40.259 
have that vertical space requirement so

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:42.649 
have that vertical space requirement so
in<00:03:40.590> some<00:03:41.159> ways<00:03:41.340> it<00:03:41.549> can<00:03:41.699> fit<00:03:41.939> better<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.269> in

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:42.659 
in some ways it can fit better and in

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:44.809 
in some ways it can fit better and in
some<00:03:42.930> ways<00:03:43.109> it<00:03:43.379> won't<00:03:43.709> fit<00:03:43.979> as<00:03:44.129> well<00:03:44.340> so

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
some ways it won't fit as well so

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.670 
some ways it won't fit as well so
there's<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.209> pros<00:03:45.449> and<00:03:45.659> cons<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:46.109> that<00:03:46.169> side<00:03:46.650> of

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
there's a pros and cons to that side of

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.689 
there's a pros and cons to that side of
it

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
it

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.390 
it
small<00:03:48.689> camber<00:03:49.139> changes<00:03:49.530> with<00:03:49.680> body<00:03:49.919> roll<00:03:50.220> and

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
small camber changes with body roll and

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.809 
small camber changes with body roll and
unlike<00:03:51.299> a<00:03:51.449> double<00:03:52.199> control<00:03:52.620> arm<00:03:52.859> you<00:03:53.549> don't

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
unlike a double control arm you don't

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.110 
unlike a double control arm you don't
have<00:03:54.299> camber<00:03:54.840> gain<00:03:54.979> so<00:03:55.979> in<00:03:56.370> cornering<00:03:56.909> when

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
have camber gain so in cornering when

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.729 
have camber gain so in cornering when
you<00:03:57.209> have<00:03:57.359> a<00:03:57.389> lot<00:03:57.569> of<00:03:57.599> body<00:03:57.870> roll<00:03:57.989> this<00:03:58.560> is<00:03:58.709> a

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
you have a lot of body roll this is a

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.879 
you have a lot of body roll this is a
downside<00:03:59.310> of<00:03:59.669> the<00:04:00.269> McPherson<00:04:00.810> strut<00:04:01.199> whereas

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
downside of the McPherson strut whereas

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.659 
downside of the McPherson strut whereas
the<00:04:02.900> double<00:04:03.900> wishbone<00:04:04.709> suspension<00:04:04.739> will

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:05.669 
the double wishbone suspension will

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.399 
the double wishbone suspension will
maintain<00:04:05.879> contact<00:04:06.719> with<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.989> road<00:04:07.139> better

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
maintain contact with the road better

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:12.469 
maintain contact with the road better
with<00:04:08.099> heavy<00:04:08.549> body<00:04:08.849> roll<00:04:09.979> and<00:04:10.979> this<00:04:11.969> is<00:04:12.150> because

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:12.479 
with heavy body roll and this is because

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:13.879 
with heavy body roll and this is because
of<00:04:12.599> the<00:04:12.689> strut<00:04:12.959> being<00:04:13.139> mounted<00:04:13.560> directly<00:04:13.650> to

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
of the strut being mounted directly to

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.499 
of the strut being mounted directly to
the<00:04:14.039> body<00:04:14.250> so<00:04:14.789> you<00:04:14.819> don't<00:04:14.909> have<00:04:15.150> that<00:04:15.329> control

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:15.509 
the body so you don't have that control

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:17.569 
the body so you don't have that control
arm<00:04:15.840> where<00:04:15.959> you<00:04:16.049> can<00:04:16.259> move<00:04:16.829> the<00:04:17.070> tire<00:04:17.280> up<00:04:17.430> and

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
arm where you can move the tire up and

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.589 
arm where you can move the tire up and
down<00:04:17.699> as<00:04:17.789> much<00:04:17.969> you<00:04:18.180> only<00:04:18.329> have<00:04:18.509> the

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
down as much you only have the

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:22.670 
down as much you only have the
compression<00:04:19.229> of<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.440> shock<00:04:20.599> and<00:04:21.599> so<00:04:22.440> one

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
compression of the shock and so one

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.120 
compression of the shock and so one
final<00:04:22.979> thing<00:04:23.250> is<00:04:23.520> that

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
final thing is that

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.610 
final thing is that
this<00:04:24.550> must<00:04:24.910> mount<00:04:25.090> to<00:04:25.300> a<00:04:25.330> body<00:04:25.630> so<00:04:26.050> a<00:04:26.080> unibody

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
this must mount to a body so a unibody

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.980 
this must mount to a body so a unibody
is<00:04:26.830> basically<00:04:27.250> necessary<00:04:27.970> you<00:04:28.480> can't<00:04:28.750> just

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
is basically necessary you can't just

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.540 
is basically necessary you can't just
have<00:04:29.140> a<00:04:29.170> frame<00:04:29.560> in<00:04:29.770> a<00:04:29.800> body<00:04:30.040> because<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.520> body

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
have a frame in a body because the body

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.850 
have a frame in a body because the body
won't<00:04:30.850> be<00:04:30.970> rigid<00:04:31.330> enough<00:04:31.600> to<00:04:31.780> mount<00:04:31.900> to<00:04:32.170> but

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
won't be rigid enough to mount to but

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.590 
won't be rigid enough to mount to but
most<00:04:33.400> of<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.640> time<00:04:33.850> this<00:04:34.060> isn't<00:04:34.270> a<00:04:34.420> problem

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
most of the time this isn't a problem

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.720 
most of the time this isn't a problem
especially<00:04:34.930> since<00:04:35.410> nowadays<00:04:35.830> almost<00:04:36.520> all

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
especially since nowadays almost all

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.870 
especially since nowadays almost all
vehicles<00:04:37.210> are<00:04:37.300> unibody<00:04:37.720> design<00:04:38.220> so<00:04:39.220> that's<00:04:39.520> a

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
vehicles are unibody design so that's a

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.690 
vehicles are unibody design so that's a
basic<00:04:40.300> overview<00:04:40.720> of<00:04:41.200> the<00:04:41.440> McPherson<00:04:42.220> strut

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
basic overview of the McPherson strut

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.940 
basic overview of the McPherson strut
and<00:04:42.910> my<00:04:43.540> next<00:04:43.870> video<00:04:44.110> which<00:04:44.500> will<00:04:44.650> be<00:04:44.710> coming

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
and my next video which will be coming

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.120 
and my next video which will be coming
up<00:04:45.190> in<00:04:45.400> about<00:04:45.580> a<00:04:45.730> week<00:04:45.970> should<00:04:46.600> be<00:04:46.810> on<00:04:47.130> solid

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
up in about a week should be on solid

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.280 
up in about a week should be on solid
rear<00:04:48.490> axle<00:04:48.520> solid<00:04:49.300> axle<00:04:49.630> type<00:04:49.840> suspensions<00:04:50.530> so

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
rear axle solid axle type suspensions so

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.260 
rear axle solid axle type suspensions so
here<00:04:53.290> we<00:04:53.410> have<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:53.830> basic<00:04:54.070> McPherson<00:04:54.910> strut

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.270 
here we have the basic McPherson strut

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.380 
here we have the basic McPherson strut
suspension<00:04:55.540> setup<00:04:56.320> you<00:04:56.920> can<00:04:57.160> see<00:04:57.460> the<00:04:57.850> spring

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
suspension setup you can see the spring

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.200 
suspension setup you can see the spring
shot<00:04:58.750> combination<00:04:59.440> which<00:04:59.680> is<00:04:59.980> mounted<00:05:00.250> to<00:05:00.790> the
