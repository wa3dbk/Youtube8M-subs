00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
further ado let's get straight to the

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.429 
further ado let's get straight to the
unboxing<00:00:25.090> looking<00:00:25.810> around<00:00:25.929> the<00:00:26.199> box

so the standard three-pin adapter that
we've<00:02:22.640> gotten<00:02:22.940> here<00:02:23.210> with<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:23.810> USB<00:02:24.290> input

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
we've gotten here with the USB input

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.850 
we've gotten here with the USB input
which<00:02:25.160> you<00:02:25.700> can<00:02:25.880> connect<00:02:26.210> on<00:02:26.450> so<00:02:27.170> let's<00:02:27.560> move

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
believe and then there's the SIM card

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:28.810 
believe and then there's the SIM card
ejector<00:03:26.930> tray<00:03:27.260> so<00:03:27.800> that's<00:03:28.250> where<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.580> SIM

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
card is gonna go in I'm not exactly sure

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:31.540 
card is gonna go in I'm not exactly sure
what<00:03:30.350> SIM<00:03:30.650> card<00:03:30.830> it<00:03:30.890> uses<00:03:31.100> I<00:03:31.160> believe<00:03:31.370> it's

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
what SIM card it uses I believe it's

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.610 
what SIM card it uses I believe it's
nano<00:03:31.820> micro<00:03:32.600> but<00:03:32.930> we'll<00:03:33.110> see<00:03:33.260> that<00:03:33.290> in<00:03:33.530> the
