transmitter steering in hand grip it's

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.750 
transmitter steering in hand grip it's
got<00:00:33.879> a<00:00:33.909> little<00:00:34.120> flip<00:00:34.329> up<00:00:35.339> access<00:00:36.339> panel<00:00:36.609> here

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
got a little flip up access panel here

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.340 
got a little flip up access panel here
you<00:00:36.789> can<00:00:36.940> so<00:00:37.239> you<00:00:37.300> can<00:00:37.420> access<00:00:37.600> the<00:00:37.899> off<00:00:38.199> switch

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
you can so you can access the off switch

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.799 
you can so you can access the off switch
trims<00:00:38.920> things<00:00:39.280> like<00:00:39.399> that<00:00:39.609> the<00:00:40.389> boat<00:00:40.539> itself

00:00:40.799 --> 00:00:40.809 
trims things like that the boat itself

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:42.450 
trims things like that the boat itself
is<00:00:40.989> kind<00:00:41.170> of<00:00:41.229> cool<00:00:41.350> it<00:00:41.499> actually<00:00:41.739> has<00:00:41.889> a<00:00:42.069> double

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
is kind of cool it actually has a double

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.790 
is kind of cool it actually has a double
hatch<00:00:42.670> system<00:00:43.300> so<00:00:43.420> you<00:00:43.510> pop<00:00:43.719> off<00:00:43.899> the<00:00:44.079> top<00:00:44.109> and

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
hatch system so you pop off the top and

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.039 
hatch system so you pop off the top and
then<00:00:44.920> there's<00:00:45.129> an<00:00:45.249> inner<00:00:45.489> hatch<00:00:45.819> and<00:00:46.749> both

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:47.049 
then there's an inner hatch and both

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:49.770 
then there's an inner hatch and both
these<00:00:47.229> actually<00:00:47.589> have<00:00:47.649> a<00:00:48.149> seal<00:00:49.149> on<00:00:49.210> them<00:00:49.569> and

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
these actually have a seal on them and

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.189 
these actually have a seal on them and
then<00:00:49.960> this<00:00:50.260> just<00:00:50.589> helps<00:00:51.159> keep<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:52.449> extremely

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:53.199 
then this just helps keep it extremely

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:54.660 
then this just helps keep it extremely
waterproof<00:00:53.739> so<00:00:53.859> you<00:00:53.949> take<00:00:54.100> off<00:00:54.280> that<00:00:54.309> inner

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
waterproof so you take off that inner

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.239 
waterproof so you take off that inner
one<00:00:54.879> and<00:00:55.089> then<00:00:55.839> from<00:00:56.289> there<00:00:56.469> you<00:00:56.649> can<00:00:56.859> reveal

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:57.249 
one and then from there you can reveal

00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:59.879 
one and then from there you can reveal
the<00:00:58.179> brushless<00:00:58.629> motor<00:00:59.409> it's<00:00:59.589> actually<00:00:59.859> a

00:00:59.879 --> 00:00:59.889 
the brushless motor it's actually a

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:01.410 
the brushless motor it's actually a
small<00:01:00.039> outrunner<00:01:00.609> motor<00:01:00.699> which<00:01:01.089> is<00:01:01.119> nice<00:01:01.389> for

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
small outrunner motor which is nice for

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.759 
small outrunner motor which is nice for
boats<00:01:01.749> because<00:01:01.959> you<00:01:02.019> get<00:01:02.139> plenty<00:01:02.350> of<00:01:02.440> torque

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769 
boats because you get plenty of torque

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:05.340 
boats because you get plenty of torque
it<00:01:03.489> has<00:01:03.850> a<00:01:03.879> water<00:01:04.299> cooled<00:01:04.600> aluminum<00:01:05.080> motor

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
it has a water cooled aluminum motor

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.510 
it has a water cooled aluminum motor
mount<00:01:05.620> as<00:01:06.340> well<00:01:06.400> as<00:01:06.730> the<00:01:06.850> water-cooled<00:01:07.620> ESC<00:01:08.620> so

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
mount as well as the water-cooled ESC so

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.970 
mount as well as the water-cooled ESC so
you<00:01:10.210> know<00:01:10.330> in<00:01:10.540> that<00:01:10.600> tight<00:01:11.260> confined<00:01:11.650> space<00:01:11.950> of

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 
you know in that tight confined space of

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.220 
you know in that tight confined space of
the<00:01:12.370> boat<00:01:12.550> it<00:01:12.850> still<00:01:13.210> does<00:01:13.480> get<00:01:13.870> plenty<00:01:14.110> of

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:14.230 
the boat it still does get plenty of

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.480 
the boat it still does get plenty of
cooling<00:01:14.530> since<00:01:14.740> there<00:01:14.860> wouldn't<00:01:15.070> be<00:01:15.100> any<00:01:15.280> air

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490

it a great model you
the<00:02:15.520> running<00:02:15.790> footage<00:02:16.120> that<00:02:16.390> for<00:02:16.569> a<00:02:16.599> model<00:02:16.870> the

the running footage that for a model the

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.070 
the running footage that for a model the
size<00:02:17.110> it<00:02:17.319> is<00:02:17.440> actually<00:02:17.830> quite<00:02:18.010> fast<00:02:18.870> one<00:02:19.870> thing

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
size it is actually quite fast one thing

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.040 
size it is actually quite fast one thing
we<00:02:20.200> like<00:02:20.349> about<00:02:20.530> this<00:02:20.830> is<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:22.209> motor<00:02:22.480> set<00:02:22.780> very

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
we like about this is the motor set very

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.559 
we like about this is the motor set very
very<00:02:23.260> low<00:02:23.500> in<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:23.980> hall<00:02:24.160> which<00:02:24.640> makes<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.480> very

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569 
very low in the hall which makes it very

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.630 
very low in the hall which makes it very
difficult<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:26.020> flip<00:02:26.440> over<00:02:26.590> if<00:02:27.099> you<00:02:27.280> do<00:02:27.430> happen

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
difficult to flip over if you do happen

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.520 
difficult to flip over if you do happen
to<00:02:27.790> flip<00:02:28.030> it<00:02:28.150> over<00:02:28.270> as<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.569> result<00:02:29.020> it<00:02:29.260> actually

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
to flip it over as a result it actually

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.220 
to flip it over as a result it actually
gives<00:02:29.650> it<00:02:29.770> a<00:02:29.830> very<00:02:29.980> high<00:02:30.220> CG<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.599> it<00:02:32.080> actually

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
gives it a very high CG so it actually

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.199 
gives it a very high CG so it actually
has<00:02:32.500> a<00:02:32.530> tendency<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.160> want<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.400> self<00:02:33.970> write

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
has a tendency to want to self write

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.300 
has a tendency to want to self write
itself<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:35.170> when<00:02:35.410> it's<00:02:35.530> doing<00:02:35.739> that<00:02:35.860> just<00:02:36.010> blip

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
itself so when it's doing that just blip

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.670 
itself so when it's doing that just blip
the<00:02:36.400> throttle<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.910> that'll<00:02:37.360> help<00:02:37.480> self<00:02:38.470> write

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
the throttle and that'll help self write

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.920 
the throttle and that'll help self write
it<00:02:38.830> real<00:02:39.160> easily<00:02:39.400> so<00:02:39.910> let's<00:02:40.120> pop<00:02:40.300> this<00:02:40.480> back<00:02:40.750> in

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
it real easily so let's pop this back in

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.320 
it real easily so let's pop this back in
place<00:02:41.230> pop<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.680> hatch<00:02:41.860> on<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.760> battery<00:02:43.269> pack
