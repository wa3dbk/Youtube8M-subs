00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
you get all parallel quests is it pretty

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.539 
you get all parallel quests is it pretty
easy<00:01:50.880> pretty<00:01:51.750> simple<00:01:52.200> there's<00:01:52.500> no<00:01:52.799> big<00:01:53.130> super

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
easy pretty simple there's no big super

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.580 
easy pretty simple there's no big super
steps<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.119> do<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.329> just<00:01:54.750> find<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.200> people<00:01:55.350> in
