00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:16.029
 Yes Hi, I 'm a pallet brain I tried to attack this placement this time, so I will explain 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.330
 I think 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:23.810
 There is a crew on the cat placement side 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:27.050
 Though there is babaa money below 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:32.320
 Oh I'd want to attack from the direction of Chakuin 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.320
 Because the range of Acha Queen comes out of the wall 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:41.810
 Golems will come to an early age when you go out here too, so I'm not that much 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.270
 I don't like it, so I'm from the bottom 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.450
 I made it 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:51.840
 It looks like a goal for this cannon 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:51.840
 In in place to out golem two bodies is such as Acha 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.500
 I tried to form an organization 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.760
 Yes 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:05.230
 We want to gorem well Necro want 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:10.190
 I put a neck at the location of this cannon 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:12.170
 I think that I should go ahead to the mortar and put in a thought and thinking 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.150
 Wizard 12 bodies of 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:21.270
 I put the Ho glider 10 bodies 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:25.650
 The reason why I got 2 orders is also coming from this side 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.810
 I wanted to Otoso the jump to the place of the anti-aircraft gun 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:33.170
 チ ャ ン チ ャ ン バ ー バ ー キ ン 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:39.049
 I thought it would be good if I could defeat the Archer Queen 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:41.000
 If only one side of this side golem will be done before it gets to the middle , maybe it's a single shot 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:47.680
 is 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:51.450
 After that I tried to look at correcting think Fu that Dekirukana the last time in the country writer of the back unit 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.450
 Let's go in and see 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.640
 First annual also three major expansion 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.540
 Deploy Wizard 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.060
 Necromancer threatens 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:10.310
 Open the lower side wall 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:13.750
 I put Archer Quinn on my right hand and dropped a poison as reinforcements came out here 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.750
 Share split right 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:27.760
 3 days or barely where it is good if you should get in during Necromancer with this well 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.860
 I've made a little mistake with the type 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:37.200
 The wall rushing has been delayed a bit 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.840
 Well here on the left a little bit in the wrong direction and I thought it was dangerous 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.810
 I made it a hero 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:50.720
 I used a clock with a hero and an unfair and unreasonable 9th place clock 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:53.870
 It feels like my teeth are all right, but I jump to here and charge to the 9th place in Asia 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.930
 I was able to do 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.280
 Because I hit that weak 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:04.480
 You can use the iron fist 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:09.760
 It was a feeling of development, but I was able to break it somehow 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:13.010
 Expand the manufacturer's hoglider from 9 o'clock and 10 o'clock 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.940
 It will return the snow 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.410
 Yes 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.410
 The rest is only one cannon 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:29.230
 I was able to fully open the defense equipment like this 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:35.049
 I like this as my royal road pattern 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:37.180
 If there is a zone of the house that is the place of the first cannon , make that as the main 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:41.840
 Straight one side 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:47.060
 I think in a way of promoting the Necromancer, I will be calm 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:48.110
 Sail glider the back to break the rest of the zone at this with as the line 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.569
 Pack up 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.409
 This is a royal road pattern 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:57.439
 Though it's a little is this that Rekuromansa had strayed 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:04:02.540
 Well this Kata guard because lg zone 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:05.599
 It is a joint portion of the opposite side of the lg crushed in the arena 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:08.160
 Straight with the Necromancer against here 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:13.350
 Because the Necromancer can advance 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.620
 I think Fu that neatly wonder if blame Nde beans not try you how 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.870
 Is not it 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.870
 Thank you for watching over Bye Bye
