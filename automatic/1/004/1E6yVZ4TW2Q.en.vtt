00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
second incipio atlas case because the

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.050 
second incipio atlas case because the
first<00:00:19.170> one<00:00:19.260> at<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> very<00:00:20.100> bottom<00:00:20.430> here<00:00:20.820> there

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
first one at the very bottom here there

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.990 
first one at the very bottom here there
was<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> hole<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.320> was<00:00:22.439> not<00:00:22.619> waterproof

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
was a hole and so it was not waterproof

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.490 
was a hole and so it was not waterproof
so<00:00:24.000> incipio<00:00:24.539> was<00:00:24.660> nice<00:00:24.840> enough<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.109> send<00:00:25.320> us

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
so incipio was nice enough to send us

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.929 
so incipio was nice enough to send us
another<00:00:25.590> case<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.250> so<00:00:26.400> we're<00:00:26.519> going<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.699> dunk

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
another case and so we're going to dunk

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.480 
another case and so we're going to dunk
into<00:00:27.119> this<00:00:27.240> tiny<00:00:27.480> tank<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.869> water<00:00:27.900> in

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
into this tiny tank of water in

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.060 
into this tiny tank of water in
hopefully<00:00:29.490> it's<00:00:29.820> waterproof<00:00:30.740> so<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.830> problem

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
hopefully it's waterproof so the problem

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.430 
hopefully it's waterproof so the problem
that<00:00:32.250> we<00:00:32.279> had<00:00:32.610> for<00:00:33.090> was<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:34.079> little

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
that we had for was that this little

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.160 
that we had for was that this little
plug<00:00:34.649> here<00:00:34.890> right<00:00:35.070> beside<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.960> speaker<00:00:36.960> port

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
plug here right beside the speaker port

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.990 
plug here right beside the speaker port
there<00:00:37.350> was<00:00:37.500> it's<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.860> wire<00:00:38.040> mesh<00:00:38.370> that's<00:00:38.670> kind

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
there was it's a wire mesh that's kind

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.639 
there was it's a wire mesh that's kind
of<00:00:39.030> what<00:00:39.180> keeps<00:00:39.420> out<00:00:39.600> some<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.260> water<00:00:40.410> i'm

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
of what keeps out some of the water i'm

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.369 
of what keeps out some of the water i'm
assuming<00:00:40.920> but<00:00:41.790> there<00:00:41.879> was<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> hole<00:00:42.270> in<00:00:42.510> this

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
assuming but there was a hole in this

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.850 
assuming but there was a hole in this
one<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.090> this<00:00:45.090> one<00:00:45.149> does<00:00:45.450> not<00:00:45.680> I've<00:00:46.680> got<00:00:46.829> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
one so this one does not I've got a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.010 
one so this one does not I've got a
little<00:00:47.039> tub<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.399> water<00:00:47.719> there's<00:00:48.719> a<00:00:48.809> piece<00:00:48.989> of

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
little tub of water there's a piece of

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.690 
little tub of water there's a piece of
facial<00:00:49.440> tissue<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:49.860> here<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.160> see<00:00:50.340> if<00:00:50.489> it's

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
facial tissue in here to see if it's

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.479 
facial tissue in here to see if it's
going<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.239> be<00:00:51.500> to<00:00:52.500> see<00:00:52.649> if<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.890> gets<00:00:53.010> wet<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.370> the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
going to be to see if it gets wet on the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.869 
going to be to see if it gets wet on the
inside<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.149> case<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.719> we're<00:00:54.989> going<00:00:55.140> to

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
inside of the case and we're going to

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.889 
inside of the case and we're going to
dump<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.149> there<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.360> I'm<00:00:57.539> going<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.719> weigh

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
dump it in there and I'm going to weigh

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.590 
dump it in there and I'm going to weigh
it<00:00:57.960> down<00:00:58.050> using<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.859> nondescript<00:00:59.789> bottle<00:01:00.510> of

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
it down using this nondescript bottle of

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.779 
it down using this nondescript bottle of
hand<00:01:00.780> sanitizer<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.800> we're<00:01:02.370> going<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.550> let<00:01:02.640> us

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
hand sanitizer so we're going to let us

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.090 
hand sanitizer so we're going to let us
sit<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.059> there<00:01:03.210> for<00:01:03.239> will<00:01:04.110> say<00:01:04.260> 30<00:01:04.559> minutes<00:01:04.860> and

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
sit in there for will say 30 minutes and

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.679 
sit in there for will say 30 minutes and
then<00:01:05.159> we're<00:01:05.700> going<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.850> crack<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.330> open<00:01:06.390> and

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
then we're going to crack it open and

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:16.620 
then we're going to crack it open and
see<00:01:06.950> how<00:01:07.950> well<00:01:08.130> it<00:01:08.159> performs

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.920 

so<00:01:17.500> we've<00:01:17.860> just<00:01:17.890> pulled<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.759> this<00:01:19.539> case<00:01:19.750> out

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
so we've just pulled the this case out

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.800 
so we've just pulled the this case out
of<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.079> water<00:01:20.259> and<00:01:21.210> initially<00:01:22.210> looking<00:01:22.659> at

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
of the water and initially looking at

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.480 
of the water and initially looking at
the<00:01:22.930> tissue<00:01:23.140> it<00:01:23.439> looks<00:01:23.590> like<00:01:23.950> it's<00:01:24.100> completely

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
the tissue it looks like it's completely

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.630 
the tissue it looks like it's completely
dry<00:01:24.640> so<00:01:24.939> we're<00:01:25.119> going<00:01:25.329> to<00:01:26.039> crack<00:01:27.039> it<00:01:27.220> open<00:01:27.310> and

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
dry so we're going to crack it open and

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.399 
dry so we're going to crack it open and
see<00:01:27.700> if<00:01:27.909> there's<00:01:28.090> n<00:01:28.210> any<00:01:28.450> water<00:01:28.750> on<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.079> inside

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
see if there's n any water on the inside

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:30.779 
see if there's n any water on the inside
this<00:01:29.860> test<00:01:30.130> actually<00:01:30.460> looks<00:01:30.610> way<00:01:30.759> more

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
this test actually looks way more

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:32.249 
this test actually looks way more
promising<00:01:31.329> the<00:01:31.450> last<00:01:31.630> test<00:01:31.840> that<00:01:32.020> we<00:01:32.110> did

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
promising the last test that we did

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.350 
promising the last test that we did
since<00:01:32.530> you<00:01:33.009> know<00:01:33.130> there's<00:01:33.759> no<00:01:33.850> water<00:01:34.090> in<00:01:34.179> it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
since you know there's no water in it

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.940 
since you know there's no water in it
from<00:01:35.200> what<00:01:35.350> we<00:01:35.500> can<00:01:35.619> tell<00:01:36.840> now<00:01:37.840> this<00:01:38.590> is<00:01:38.649> the

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
from what we can tell now this is the

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.870 
from what we can tell now this is the
case<00:01:39.159> that<00:01:39.189> actually<00:01:39.880> has<00:01:40.060> a<00:01:40.140> flappy<00:01:41.140> flap

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
case that actually has a flappy flap

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.249 
case that actually has a flappy flap
let's<00:01:42.880> get<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.030> little<00:01:43.210> weird<00:01:43.299> that<00:01:43.420> way<00:01:43.689> comes

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
let's get a little weird that way comes

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:45.840 
let's get a little weird that way comes
a<00:01:44.350> flappy<00:01:44.710> flap<00:01:44.890> it<00:01:45.039> also<00:01:45.280> has<00:01:45.399> a<00:01:45.429> glass<00:01:45.700> screen

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
a flappy flap it also has a glass screen

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.460 
a flappy flap it also has a glass screen
protector<00:01:46.329> which<00:01:46.479> makes<00:01:46.720> a<00:01:46.810> little<00:01:46.990> different

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
protector which makes a little different

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.809 
protector which makes a little different
than<00:01:47.679> all<00:01:47.829> the<00:01:47.860> other<00:01:47.979> cases<00:01:48.340> that<00:01:48.490> we've
