00:00:30.149 --> 00:00:36.000
 how did you decide to start in this adventure 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.860
 since childhood our dads my sister and 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.890
 me that the truth we devote a lot to 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.770
 art introduced us to the world of 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.980
 arts nothing more plastic salt 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.260
 dance to music I played piano violin 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.630
 yes since when are you doing these 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.140
 accessories is said good really already 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.360
 as a trademark as a business I have 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.670
 four years but to make sculpture already 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.940
 since I finished the race that already 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.190
 according to a little while hearts what 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.500
 mean to you as I mentioned 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.510
 nothing else is the heart of love 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.940
 couple go good the broken heart 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.340
 here you have not broken your heart is the 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.640
 love your children what is usually a 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.650
 little more white more with more tenderness the 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.649
 passionate good I think there are thousands 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.240
 in ways that paper mache from 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.770
 I learned it from my daughter's age 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.590
 my daughter is seven years old I think that I 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.470
 the six and did things I have not 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.910
 Experienced with other materials but 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.690
 definitely the paper is the most 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.149
 kind have one to be this have 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.200
 experience in material handling 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:45.120
 because it is capricious but it is very noble 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.150
 you can really 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:51.000
 modify the material until it is converted 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.070
 in something that does not seem like paper it seems something 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.040
 as heavier I did not tell you right now 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.900
 yes yes indeed many people who in 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.180
 my sculptures are like much more pieces 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.670
 great because they can not imagine that they are 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.260
 paper when they are touched, the 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.320
 they are as impressed that they do not 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.320
 It is a metal figure neither of nor of mud 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.990
 or plaster you know light and then it's the 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:16.500
 paper and I no longer have so many foundling and 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.110
 art exhibitions but I'm going to 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.750
 exhibitions of fashion accessories in 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.240
 where I take the art to those parts 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.220
 eddie and now what future plans do you have 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.170
 I have projects to highlight in the new 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.870
 collection year after year took out something 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.360
 different very different from the previous one and 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.400
 well I'm just right now it's in the 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.100
 creative stage to start designing that 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.620
 is what's coming how many people are 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.020
 here with you work they help you here in 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.970
 what about the accessories in the jewelry I have 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.920
 two girls who help me who are me 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.740
 two are my right hand 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.690
 and when a good bit of work came together 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.300
 hired someone else to help us 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.239
 also for when when you deliver 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.450
 they are big and also in a matter of the 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.599
 sculpture good there yes I work alone 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:07.459
 I alone says I alone I choose pinto and 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:11.250
 I do everything you feel when you see your 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:14.209
 I work until I do what I like and 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.459
 to buy it from me that a person arrives 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.220
 pay for it and put it on or do it 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.800
 of a very special gift to me is a 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.220
 very great satisfaction because right now we 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.080
 is going to show some of his sculptures 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.780
 so let's see let's go let's see it 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.450
 Well this is like it's a building 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.030
 on the seabed as if it were there 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.370
 for a long time and it began to fill up 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.200
 the best of some some animals 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.240
 but a little more surreal this is 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.980
 another of his sculptures series of my 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.500
 favorite yes the truth is that 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.760
 they represent good the female body and 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.800
 apart it's like it's raining 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.780
 melting and also the blue tones 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.000
 they can not be missed as well 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.700
 we see that we do not end earrings too 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.460
 well these are very big the truth is 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.260
 which are also from the collection 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.910
 a portable sculpture that good equal 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.260
 you wear the earrings and you do not need 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.320
 nothing more 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.900
 she is stefani and from the beginning what 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.180
 I started teaching him was to paint and 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.070
 decorate if she handles the brush 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.850
 good as you can see very is very 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.620
 delicate the stroke because the piece is very 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.600
 small we have to be very thin 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.240
 It needs a lot of pulse 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.340
 patience and above all be like that in 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.140
 connection with the pieces so they remain 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.390
 beautiful to be transmitted what 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.690
 angelica is good here 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:40.180
 in the whole assembly process that is 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.790

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.120
 finished you put all the chains

 the little stones are hung we gave the 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.810
 final touch makes it angelic too 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:55.210

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:56.710
