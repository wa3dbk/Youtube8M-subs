00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
Oskar Van Deventer now I'm going to do a

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.520 
Oskar Van Deventer now I'm going to do a
time-lapse<00:00:11.940> video<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.929> and<00:00:13.080> that's<00:00:13.320> what

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
time-lapse video of it and that's what

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.690 
time-lapse video of it and that's what
you're<00:00:13.650> going<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:13.860> watch<00:00:14.009> right<00:00:14.219> now<00:00:14.280> first

you're going to watch right now first
I'm<00:00:14.849> going<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.059> scramble<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.540> then<00:00:16.049> I'm<00:00:16.170> going

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
I'm going to scramble it then I'm going

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.160 
I'm going to scramble it then I'm going
to<00:00:16.379> solve<00:00:16.619> it<00:00:16.770> and<00:00:17.150> I'm<00:00:18.150> also<00:00:18.449> going<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:18.840> upload

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
to solve it and I'm also going to upload

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.640 
to solve it and I'm also going to upload
the<00:00:19.380> entire<00:00:19.710> video<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.840> YouTube<00:00:21.840> without<00:00:22.380> any

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
the entire video to YouTube without any

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.130 
the entire video to YouTube without any
time<00:00:22.980> lapse<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.609> whole<00:00:23.789> full<00:00:24.240> video<00:00:24.779> and

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
time lapse so the whole full video and

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.380 
time lapse so the whole full video and
it's<00:00:25.769> going<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.010> be<00:00:26.160> like<00:00:26.369> something<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:27.119> don't

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
it's going to be like something I don't

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.140 
it's going to be like something I don't
know<00:00:27.510> how<00:00:27.720> many<00:00:27.960> hours<00:00:28.050> but<00:00:29.010> it's<00:00:29.640> going<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.880> be

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
know how many hours but it's going to be

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.820 
know how many hours but it's going to be
a<00:00:30.330> very<00:00:30.599> long<00:00:30.779> video<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.109> definitely<00:00:31.529> check

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
a very long video so definitely check

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.639 
a very long video so definitely check
that<00:00:32.130> video<00:00:32.250> out<00:00:32.570> I'm<00:00:33.570> going<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:33.989> upload<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.380> as

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
that video out I'm going to upload it as

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.709 
that video out I'm going to upload it as
soon<00:00:35.219> as<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.489> can<00:00:35.760> but<00:00:35.790> it's<00:00:36.059> taken<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.570> long<00:00:36.660> time

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
soon as I can but it's taken a long time

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.750 
soon as I can but it's taken a long time
to<00:00:37.170> encode<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.800> video<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:38.579> going<00:00:38.700> to

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
to encode the video and it's going to

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.160 
to encode the video and it's going to
take<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> long<00:00:39.180> time<00:00:39.329> for<00:00:39.390> YouTube<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:39.960> process

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
take a long time for YouTube to process

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.560 
take a long time for YouTube to process
this<00:00:40.500> video<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.280> when<00:00:41.969> it's<00:00:42.090> available

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
this video so when it's available

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:43.940 
this video so when it's available
I'll<00:00:42.690> put<00:00:42.899> put<00:00:43.350> it<00:00:43.440> up<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.770> there'll<00:00:43.920> be

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
I'll put put it up and there'll be

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.440 
I'll put put it up and there'll be
annotations<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.789> this<00:00:44.940> video<00:00:45.210> if<00:00:45.329> it's

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
annotations in this video if it's

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.630 
annotations in this video if it's
already<00:00:45.690> up<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.920> should<00:00:47.070> go<00:00:47.160> check<00:00:47.399> that

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
already up and you should go check that

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.459 
already up and you should go check that
out<00:00:47.820> too<00:00:48.059> obviously<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.020> don't<00:00:49.170> watch<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
out too obviously you don't watch the

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.950 
out too obviously you don't watch the
whole<00:00:49.680> thing<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.730> see<00:00:51.210> how<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.660> turns

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
whole thing but you can see how it turns

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.200 
whole thing but you can see how it turns
better<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.680> see<00:00:53.250> what<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.610> really<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:53.910> like

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
better and see what it really is like

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.660 
better and see what it really is like
solving<00:00:54.629> a<00:00:54.930> 17<00:00:55.320> by<00:00:55.440> 17<00:00:55.860> by<00:00:55.980> watching<00:00:56.190> that<00:00:56.370> one

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
solving a 17 by 17 by watching that one

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.760 
solving a 17 by 17 by watching that one
or<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.239> one<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.480> need<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.809> see<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.109> be<00:00:58.559> done<00:00:58.739> a

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
or this one you need to see it be done a

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.670 
or this one you need to see it be done a
lot<00:00:59.129> quicker<00:00:59.160> so<00:01:00.020> anyway<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.320> video<00:01:01.590> I'm

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
lot quicker so anyway in this video I'm

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.950 
lot quicker so anyway in this video I'm
going<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> just<00:01:02.309> briefly<00:01:02.579> talk<00:01:03.180> about<00:01:03.570> solving

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
going to just briefly talk about solving

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.870 
going to just briefly talk about solving
it<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.379> then<00:01:04.589> I'll<00:01:04.799> let<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.129> go<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.610> guys

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
it and then I'll let it go and you guys

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.640 
it and then I'll let it go and you guys
can<00:01:06.150> watch<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.049> I'll<00:01:07.140> play<00:01:07.350> some<00:01:07.560> music

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
can watch it and I'll play some music

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.820 
can watch it and I'll play some music
and<00:01:08.040> hopefully<00:01:08.549> it's<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.909> little<00:01:09.000> relaxing<00:01:09.830> but

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
and hopefully it's a little relaxing but

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.179 
and hopefully it's a little relaxing but
anyway<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.760> way<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.939> solve<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.479> 17<00:01:12.900> by<00:01:12.990> 17<00:01:13.409> is

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
anyway the way you solve a 17 by 17 is

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.280 
anyway the way you solve a 17 by 17 is
just<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.970> would<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> seven<00:01:15.630> by<00:01:15.750> seven<00:01:16.140> or

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
just like you would a seven by seven or

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.289 
just like you would a seven by seven or
five<00:01:16.590> by<00:01:16.830> five<00:01:17.130> if<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.670> can<00:01:17.820> solve<00:01:18.000> one<00:01:18.210> of

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
five by five if you can solve one of

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.170 
five by five if you can solve one of
those<00:01:18.450> than<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> 17<00:01:19.200> by<00:01:19.320> 17<00:01:19.740> isn't<00:01:20.400> that<00:01:20.729> hard

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
those than the 17 by 17 isn't that hard

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.160 
those than the 17 by 17 isn't that hard
but<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.110> very<00:01:22.439> very<00:01:22.650> tedious<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
but it is very very tedious and so the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.050 
but it is very very tedious and so the
way<00:01:25.320> I'm<00:01:25.619> solving<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.280> using<00:01:26.759> the

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
way I'm solving it is using the

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.969 
way I'm solving it is using the
reduction<00:01:27.869> method<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.409> basically<00:01:28.740> you

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
reduction method and basically you

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.580 
reduction method and basically you
reduce<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.939> cube<00:01:30.270> into<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.840> three<00:01:31.409> by<00:01:31.560> three

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
reduce the cube into a three by three

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.370 
reduce the cube into a three by three
and<00:01:31.860> then<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.369> solve<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.880> 3x3<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.659> first<00:01:33.900> I'm

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
and then you solve the 3x3 so first I'm

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.280 
and then you solve the 3x3 so first I'm
reducing<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.159> centers<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.290> every

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
reducing the centers so that every

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.280 
reducing the centers so that every
Center<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.860> fully<00:01:38.250> solved<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.030> then<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.810> reduce

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
Center is fully solved and then I reduce

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.609 
Center is fully solved and then I reduce
the<00:01:40.470> edges<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.610> edge<00:01:42.570> pieces<00:01:43.020> are<00:01:43.380> all

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
the edges so the edge pieces are all

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.310 
the edges so the edge pieces are all
solved<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.399> then<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.570> big<00:01:45.899> rubik's

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
solved and then it's like a big rubik's

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.520 
solved and then it's like a big rubik's
cube<00:01:46.590> with<00:01:46.979> huge<00:01:47.399> centers<00:01:47.820> long<00:01:48.540> skinny<00:01:49.020> edges

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
cube with huge centers long skinny edges

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.800 
cube with huge centers long skinny edges
and<00:01:49.680> tiny<00:01:50.369> corners<00:01:50.790> although<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.509> corners

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
and tiny corners although the corners

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.120 
and tiny corners although the corners
are<00:01:51.930> pretty<00:01:52.110> big<00:01:52.290> compared<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:52.920> other

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
are pretty big compared to the other

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.700 
are pretty big compared to the other
pieces<00:01:53.369> but<00:01:54.119> using<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.750> reduction<00:01:55.170> method<00:01:55.530> it

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
pieces but using the reduction method it

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.310 
pieces but using the reduction method it
took<00:01:55.950> me<00:01:56.189> five<00:01:56.670> days<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.540> solve<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:58.049> puzzle

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
took me five days to solve this puzzle

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.190 
took me five days to solve this puzzle
and<00:01:59.030> the<00:02:00.030> first<00:02:00.299> day<00:02:00.479> i<00:02:00.509> solved<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.020> red

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
and the first day i solved the red

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.260 
and the first day i solved the red
center<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.770> second<00:02:02.189> day<00:02:02.369> i<00:02:02.430> solved<00:02:03.090> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
center the second day i solved the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.090 
center the second day i solved the
orange<00:02:04.020> center<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.590> opposite<00:02:04.890> side<00:02:05.040> of

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
orange center of the opposite side of

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.980 
orange center of the opposite side of
red<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.430> orange<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:05.939> then<00:02:06.390> i<00:02:06.420> did<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.840> white

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
red is orange and then i did the white

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.919 
red is orange and then i did the white
center<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.610> day<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.149> third<00:02:09.330> day<00:02:09.390> i<00:02:09.599> did

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
center on that day the third day i did

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.410 
center on that day the third day i did
the<00:02:10.229> green<00:02:10.619> center<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.489> fourth<00:02:11.819> day<00:02:12.030> i<00:02:12.060> did

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
the green center the fourth day i did

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.790 
the green center the fourth day i did
the<00:02:12.540> last<00:02:12.780> two<00:02:12.989> centers<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.470> blue

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
the last two centers the blue

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.680 
the last two centers the blue
and<00:02:13.890> yellow<00:02:14.190> ones<00:02:14.430> and<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.730> probably<00:02:15.480> was

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
and yellow ones and that probably was

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.740 
and yellow ones and that probably was
the<00:02:15.840> longest<00:02:16.320> step<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.490> took<00:02:17.550> was<00:02:18.360> doing<00:02:18.600> those

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
the longest step I took was doing those

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.720 
the longest step I took was doing those
two<00:02:19.110> centers<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.920> then<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:21.420> final<00:02:21.810> day<00:02:22.020> I

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
two centers and then the final day I

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.390 
two centers and then the final day I
solved<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:24.060> first<00:02:24.750> eight<00:02:24.990> edges<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.740> then<00:02:26.280> I

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
solved the first eight edges and then I

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.520 
solved the first eight edges and then I
took<00:02:26.490> a<00:02:26.670> break<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:26.970> came<00:02:27.330> back<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.020> solved

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
took a break and came back and I solved

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.040 
took a break and came back and I solved
the<00:02:28.860> last<00:02:28.890> four<00:02:29.490> edges<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.090> then<00:02:30.450> finally<00:02:31.020> I

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
the last four edges and then finally I

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.270 
the last four edges and then finally I
solved<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.650> puzzle<00:02:31.980> like<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.190> giant<00:02:32.760> 3x3<00:02:33.600> and

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
solved the puzzle like a giant 3x3 and

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.300 
solved the puzzle like a giant 3x3 and
mostly<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.340> solved<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:36.030> at<00:02:36.180> night<00:02:36.710> but<00:02:37.710> except

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
mostly I solved it at night but except

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.680 
mostly I solved it at night but except
for<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.460> last<00:02:38.700> day<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:38.940> solved<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.360> during<00:02:39.600> the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
for the last day I solved it during the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.040 
for the last day I solved it during the
daytime<00:02:40.100> and<00:02:41.100> by<00:02:41.820> far<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.150> hardest<00:02:42.540> part<00:02:42.930> was

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
daytime and by far the hardest part was

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.550 
daytime and by far the hardest part was
solving<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.470> 17<00:02:43.890> by<00:02:44.040> 17<00:02:44.490> is<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:45.180> like<00:02:45.360> find<00:02:45.870> the

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
solving a 17 by 17 is to like find the

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.610 
solving a 17 by 17 is to like find the
piece<00:02:47.100> you're<00:02:47.310> looking<00:02:47.670> for<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.300> so<00:02:48.750> it's<00:02:49.500> not

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
piece you're looking for and so it's not

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.860 
piece you're looking for and so it's not
really<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.130> it's<00:02:50.760> hard<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.180> find<00:02:51.420> but<00:02:51.690> when

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
really that it's hard to find but when

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.240 
really that it's hard to find but when
when<00:02:52.170> you're<00:02:52.320> looking<00:02:52.560> for<00:02:52.770> little<00:02:53.040> pieces

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
when you're looking for little pieces

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.940 
when you're looking for little pieces
like<00:02:53.610> near<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.120> center<00:02:54.450> of<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.780> puzzle<00:02:55.200> you

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
like near the center of the puzzle you

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.070 
like near the center of the puzzle you
can<00:02:56.100> easily<00:02:56.400> mistake<00:02:57.120> them<00:02:57.360> for<00:02:57.390> ones<00:02:57.810> right

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
can easily mistake them for ones right

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.170 
can easily mistake them for ones right
next<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.830> so<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.400> have<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.820> be<00:02:59.940> real

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
next to it and so you have to be real

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.690 
next to it and so you have to be real
careful<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.780> count<00:03:01.050> like<00:03:01.320> four<00:03:01.650> over<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.280> six

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
careful to count like four over and six

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.610 
careful to count like four over and six
down<00:03:03.030> something<00:03:03.810> like<00:03:03.960> that<00:03:04.290> and<00:03:04.470> make<00:03:04.590> sure

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
down something like that and make sure

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.310 
down something like that and make sure
you're<00:03:05.130> looking<00:03:05.490> for<00:03:05.730> that<00:03:05.910> piece<00:03:06.270> instead<00:03:07.140> of

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
you're looking for that piece instead of

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.530 
you're looking for that piece instead of
maybe<00:03:07.770> five<00:03:08.100> down<00:03:08.370> instead<00:03:08.730> of<00:03:08.850> six<00:03:09.060> down<00:03:09.270> so

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
maybe five down instead of six down so

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.960 
maybe five down instead of six down so
you<00:03:09.870> can<00:03:10.020> really<00:03:10.200> easily<00:03:10.560> mistake<00:03:11.310> pieces

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
you can really easily mistake pieces

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.340 
you can really easily mistake pieces
that<00:03:12.150> are<00:03:12.300> right<00:03:12.510> next<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:12.840> each<00:03:12.960> other<00:03:13.170> and

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
that are right next to each other and

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.700 
that are right next to each other and
the<00:03:14.160> hardest<00:03:14.520> part<00:03:14.760> was<00:03:14.910> definitely<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.840> last

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
the hardest part was definitely the last

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.460 
the hardest part was definitely the last
two<00:03:17.010> centers<00:03:17.460> and<00:03:17.730> I<00:03:18.000> don't<00:03:18.390> solve<00:03:18.810> big<00:03:19.110> cubes

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
two centers and I don't solve big cubes

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.680 
two centers and I don't solve big cubes
very<00:03:19.890> often<00:03:20.340> and<00:03:20.550> when<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.150> learned<00:03:21.420> how<00:03:21.630> to

very often and when I learned how to

very often and when I learned how to

then<00:03:26.160> I<00:03:26.640> just<00:03:27.060> kind<00:03:27.300> of<00:03:27.330> figured<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:28.020> out<00:03:28.140> and

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
then I just kind of figured it out and

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.979 
then I just kind of figured it out and
so<00:03:28.950> I<00:03:28.980> don't<00:03:29.250> know<00:03:29.489> if<00:03:29.700> I'm<00:03:29.940> solving<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.570> last

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
so I don't know if I'm solving the last

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.300 
so I don't know if I'm solving the last
two<00:03:31.200> centers<00:03:31.530> very<00:03:31.709> efficiently<00:03:32.220> but

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
two centers very efficiently but

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.070 
two centers very efficiently but
basically<00:03:32.790> I'm<00:03:32.970> just<00:03:33.030> using<00:03:33.360> communicators

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
basically I'm just using communicators

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.100 
basically I'm just using communicators
to<00:03:34.320> put<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.310> pieces<00:03:35.700> where<00:03:36.270> they<00:03:36.390> belong<00:03:36.780> and

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
to put the pieces where they belong and

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.020 
to put the pieces where they belong and
so<00:03:37.500> it's<00:03:37.650> very<00:03:37.680> inefficient<00:03:38.160> and<00:03:38.640> so<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:38.850> just

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
so it's very inefficient and so it just

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.550 
so it's very inefficient and so it just
took<00:03:39.150> a<00:03:39.209> very<00:03:39.390> long<00:03:39.510> time<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:40.020> do<00:03:40.140> those<00:03:40.350> last

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
took a very long time to do those last

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.140 
took a very long time to do those last
two<00:03:40.770> centers<00:03:41.070> which<00:03:41.220> I'm<00:03:41.370> doing<00:03:41.459> right<00:03:41.610> here

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
two centers which I'm doing right here

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.000 
two centers which I'm doing right here
now<00:03:42.870> I'm<00:03:42.930> going<00:03:43.050> to<00:03:43.140> stop<00:03:43.320> talking<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:43.890> let

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
now I'm going to stop talking and let

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.220 
now I'm going to stop talking and let
you<00:03:44.130> guys<00:03:44.280> enjoy<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.820> video<00:03:44.970> at<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.840> very<00:03:46.020> end

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
you guys enjoy the video at the very end

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.870 
you guys enjoy the video at the very end
I'll<00:03:46.350> play<00:03:46.530> the<00:03:46.739> last<00:03:46.890> couple<00:03:47.310> moves<00:03:47.489> in<00:03:47.700> real

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
I'll play the last couple moves in real

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.910 
I'll play the last couple moves in real
time<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.450> then<00:03:48.750> you'll<00:03:48.930> hear<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.200> audio<00:03:49.650> of

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
time and then you'll hear the audio of

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.830 
time and then you'll hear the audio of
me<00:03:50.250> actually<00:03:50.459> finishing<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.300> puzzle<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:51.750> you

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
me actually finishing the puzzle and you

00:03:51.840 --> 00:04:13.480 
me actually finishing the puzzle and you
can<00:03:51.989> hear<00:03:52.350> my<00:03:52.380> excitement<00:03:52.980> so<00:03:53.190> enjoy

you

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:21.540 

look<00:05:10.600> at<00:05:10.690> this<00:05:12.870> last<00:05:13.870> move<00:05:14.290> and<00:05:17.040> I<00:05:18.040> did<00:05:18.250> it<00:05:19.980> Wow

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
look at this last move and I did it Wow

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.850 
look at this last move and I did it Wow
finally<00:05:22.770> I've<00:05:23.770> done<00:05:24.070> I<00:05:24.400> can't<00:05:24.790> believe<00:05:25.060> it

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
finally I've done I can't believe it

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.440 
finally I've done I can't believe it
can't<00:05:26.860> believe<00:05:27.130> how<00:05:27.250> quickly<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:27.850> edges<00:05:28.240> went

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
can't believe how quickly the edges went

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.290 
can't believe how quickly the edges went
together<00:05:28.600> after<00:05:29.560> spending<00:05:30.070> so<00:05:30.340> many<00:05:30.460> hours<00:05:30.610> on

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
together after spending so many hours on

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.210 
together after spending so many hours on
the<00:05:31.510> center's<00:05:31.870> the<00:05:32.440> edges<00:05:32.770> were<00:05:32.920> actually

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
the center's the edges were actually

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.410 
the center's the edges were actually
pretty<00:05:33.400> quick<00:05:33.810> so<00:05:34.810> I'm<00:05:35.200> really<00:05:36.150> happy<00:05:37.150> with

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.420 
pretty quick so I'm really happy with

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.170 
pretty quick so I'm really happy with
how<00:05:37.570> quickly<00:05:37.870> the<00:05:38.110> edges<00:05:38.350> went<00:05:38.530> in<00:05:38.650> and<00:05:38.880> yeah<00:05:39.880> I

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
how quickly the edges went in and yeah I

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.680 
how quickly the edges went in and yeah I
can't<00:05:40.480> believe<00:05:40.690> I<00:05:40.780> did<00:05:40.930> the<00:05:40.990> whole<00:05:41.140> thing<00:05:41.610> I'm

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:42.690 
can't believe I did the whole thing I'm

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.690 
can't believe I did the whole thing I'm
happy<00:05:43.690> I<00:05:43.720> actually<00:05:44.170> attempted<00:05:44.800> it<00:05:44.890> it's<00:05:45.550> not

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
happy I actually attempted it it's not

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.670 
happy I actually attempted it it's not

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
every day you get a play with the world

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.450 
every day you get a play with the world
record<00:05:48.010> largest<00:05:48.520> cube<00:05:48.850> and<00:05:50.040> yeah<00:05:51.040> I'm<00:05:51.160> really

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
record largest cube and yeah I'm really

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.780 
record largest cube and yeah I'm really
happy<00:05:51.820> that<00:05:52.590> Aaron<00:05:53.590> let<00:05:53.770> me<00:05:53.860> borrow<00:05:54.070> his<00:05:54.190> so

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
happy that Aaron let me borrow his so

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.600 
happy that Aaron let me borrow his so
that<00:05:54.910> I<00:05:54.940> can<00:05:55.120> make<00:05:55.270> this<00:05:55.450> video<00:05:55.810> and<00:05:56.050> I'm<00:05:56.950> glad

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:57.610 
that I can make this video and I'm glad

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.430 
that I can make this video and I'm glad
I<00:05:57.850> took<00:05:58.300> the<00:05:58.450> opportunity<00:05:58.480> to<00:05:59.020> solve<00:05:59.260> it

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
I took the opportunity to solve it

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.940 
I took the opportunity to solve it
because<00:05:59.500> I<00:05:59.770> almost<00:05:59.920> didn't<00:06:00.580> solve<00:06:00.790> it<00:06:00.940> because

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
because I almost didn't solve it because

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.870 
because I almost didn't solve it because
you<00:06:02.950> know<00:06:03.040> I<00:06:03.070> was<00:06:03.190> worried<00:06:03.430> how<00:06:03.520> long<00:06:03.700> it<00:06:03.820> was

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
you know I was worried how long it was

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.240 
you know I was worried how long it was
going<00:06:04.000> to<00:06:04.090> take<00:06:04.330> but<00:06:04.540> I'm<00:06:05.500> glad<00:06:05.650> I<00:06:05.740> went<00:06:05.950> for<00:06:06.220> it

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.250 
going to take but I'm glad I went for it

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.070 
going to take but I'm glad I went for it
so<00:06:06.520> that's<00:06:07.000> it<00:06:07.180> for<00:06:07.360> this<00:06:07.420> video<00:06:07.540> thanks<00:06:07.900> for

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
so that's it for this video thanks for

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:21.420 
so that's it for this video thanks for
