00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.830 
it as nice as I'd like it and I curve it
under<00:02:43.850> cuz<00:02:44.450> I<00:02:44.750> just<00:02:45.020> think<00:02:45.290> that's<00:02:45.380> used<00:02:45.620> to<00:02:45.800> us

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
under cuz I just think that's used to us

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.840 
under cuz I just think that's used to us
and<00:02:47.840> just<00:02:47.959> repeat<00:02:48.290> that<00:02:48.350> to<00:02:48.770> that<00:02:48.980> same<00:02:49.280> exact

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
and just repeat that to that same exact

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.280 
and just repeat that to that same exact
way<00:02:50.090> I'm<00:02:50.209> doing<00:02:50.450> it<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.080> other<00:02:51.230> side

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
way I'm doing it to the other side

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.800 
way I'm doing it to the other side
take<00:02:52.500> my<00:02:52.680> bags<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.340> I<00:02:53.849> basically<00:02:54.060> just<00:02:54.420> do<00:02:54.780> a

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
take my bags and I basically just do a

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.660 
take my bags and I basically just do a
two<00:02:55.110> strand<00:02:55.409> twist<00:02:55.769> which<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.129> basically<00:02:56.549> a

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
two strand twist which is basically a

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.520 
two strand twist which is basically a
French<00:02:57.000> braid<00:02:57.239> but<00:02:57.599> you<00:02:57.780> know<00:02:57.870> what<00:02:58.049> only<00:02:58.349> two

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
French braid but you know what only two

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.130 
French braid but you know what only two
strands<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.219> I<00:03:00.120> because<00:03:00.420> it's<00:03:00.599> way<00:03:00.719> easier

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
strands and I because it's way easier

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.780 
strands and I because it's way easier
