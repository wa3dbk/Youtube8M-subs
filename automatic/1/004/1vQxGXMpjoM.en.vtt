00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.600 
yes what that looks like I'll do one
more<00:01:32.140> time<00:01:32.320> from<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.500> sides<00:01:32.860> you<00:01:33.220> can<00:01:33.280> see<00:01:33.580> a

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.850 
middle of millions so doesn't get noice
let's<00:01:52.540> just<00:01:52.690> charge<00:01:52.900> it<00:01:53.080> up<00:01:53.140> and<00:01:53.380> do<00:01:53.590> it<00:01:53.620> on

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
let's just charge it up and do it on

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.410 
let's just charge it up and do it on
nothing

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.090
