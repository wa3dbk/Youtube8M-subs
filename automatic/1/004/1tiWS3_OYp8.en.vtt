remain<00:02:01.770> engage<00:02:02.250> with<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> person<00:02:03.060> who<00:02:03.420> doesn't

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
remain engage with a person who doesn't

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.410 
remain engage with a person who doesn't
have<00:02:03.810> severe<00:02:04.290> symptoms<00:02:04.909> we're<00:02:05.909> listening<00:02:06.390> to

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
have severe symptoms we're listening to

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.389 
have severe symptoms we're listening to
what<00:02:06.750> they're<00:02:06.930> thinking<00:02:07.229> saying<00:02:08.039> we're

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
what they're thinking saying we're

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.919 
what they're thinking saying we're
picking<00:02:08.759> up<00:02:08.879> what<00:02:09.090> they're<00:02:09.300> feeling

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
picking up what they're feeling

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.490 
picking up what they're feeling
we're<00:02:10.289> picking<00:02:10.590> up<00:02:10.830> mean

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
we're picking up mean

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.980 
we're picking up mean
behind<00:02:11.950> what<00:02:12.250> they<00:02:12.400> say<00:02:12.730> these<00:02:13.240> are<00:02:13.300> referred

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
behind what they say these are referred

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.440 
behind what they say these are referred
to<00:02:14.050> as<00:02:14.320> complex<00:02:14.920> reflections<00:02:15.640> versus<00:02:16.060> simple

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
to as complex reflections versus simple

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.350 
to as complex reflections versus simple
ones<00:02:16.660> so<00:02:17.560> in<00:02:17.710> reflective<00:02:18.340> listening<00:02:18.550> just<00:02:19.180> the

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
ones so in reflective listening just the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.090 
ones so in reflective listening just the
way<00:02:19.510> we<00:02:19.720> would<00:02:19.930> reflect<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.560> a<00:02:20.590> person<00:02:20.980> who

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
way we would reflect to a person who

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.460 
way we would reflect to a person who
doesn't<00:02:21.310> have<00:02:21.460> severe<00:02:22.000> mental<00:02:22.030> illness<00:02:22.690> we

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
doesn't have severe mental illness we

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.890 
doesn't have severe mental illness we
reflect<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.520> meaning<00:02:25.000> behind<00:02:25.150> what<00:02:25.480> people

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
reflect the meaning behind what people

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.490 
reflect the meaning behind what people
are<00:02:26.020> saying

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
are saying

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.850 
are saying
feeling<00:02:27.540> etc<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:28.840> would<00:02:29.170> that<00:02:29.590> would<00:02:29.770> be

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
feeling etc and that would that would be

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.580 
feeling etc and that would that would be
the<00:02:30.010> distinction<00:02:30.400> between<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:31.330> simple<00:02:32.110> and<00:02:32.530> a

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
the distinction between a simple and a

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.740 
the distinction between a simple and a
complex<00:02:33.130> reflection<00:02:33.550> and<00:02:34.000> in<00:02:34.120> motivational

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
complex reflection and in motivational

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.410 
complex reflection and in motivational
interviewing<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.640> proficient<00:02:36.640> practitioner

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
interviewing a proficient practitioner

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.810 
interviewing a proficient practitioner
does<00:02:37.600> more<00:02:37.870> complex<00:02:38.620> reflections<00:02:39.400> than

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
does more complex reflections than

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.510 
does more complex reflections than
simple<00:02:40.390> ones<00:02:40.570> so<00:02:41.200> here's<00:02:41.560> where<00:02:41.800> that<00:02:42.340> would

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
simple ones so here's where that would

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.820 
simple ones so here's where that would
be<00:02:42.550> very<00:02:42.880> useful<00:02:43.450> if<00:02:43.930> someone<00:02:44.500> is<00:02:44.650> not

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
be very useful if someone is not

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.270 
be very useful if someone is not
speaking<00:02:45.520> in<00:02:46.020> reality<00:02:47.020> terms<00:02:47.410> etc<00:02:47.800> but<00:02:48.220> let's

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
speaking in reality terms etc but let's

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.280 
speaking in reality terms etc but let's
look<00:02:48.550> at<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.760> person<00:02:49.120> who<00:02:49.270> is<00:02:49.330> in<00:02:49.480> reality<00:02:49.660> and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
look at a person who is in reality and

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.360 
look at a person who is in reality and
person<00:02:51.070> who<00:02:51.100> says<00:02:51.430> something<00:02:51.820> like<00:02:51.850> you<00:02:53.370> know

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
person who says something like you know

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.300 
person who says something like you know
everybody's<00:02:55.170> trying<00:02:56.170> to<00:02:56.380> get<00:02:56.560> me<00:02:56.950> to<00:02:56.980> stop

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
everybody's trying to get me to stop

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.460 
everybody's trying to get me to stop

do about your drinking but you're not
doing<00:03:09.520> it<00:03:09.850> because<00:03:10.240> other<00:03:10.510> people<00:03:10.930> are

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
doing it because other people are

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.620 
doing it because other people are
nagging<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:11.830> about<00:03:11.860> it

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
nagging you about it

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.990 
nagging you about it
the<00:03:13.630> person<00:03:13.990> did<00:03:14.170> not<00:03:14.350> say<00:03:14.680> that<00:03:14.950> but<00:03:15.850> I've

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
the person did not say that but I've

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.520 
the person did not say that but I've
picked<00:03:16.300> up<00:03:16.480> another<00:03:16.780> meaning<00:03:17.230> that<00:03:17.350> would

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
picked up another meaning that would

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.220 
picked up another meaning that would
make<00:03:17.709> that<00:03:17.890> a<00:03:17.950> complex<00:03:18.580> reflection<00:03:19.080> so<00:03:20.080> when

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
make that a complex reflection so when

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.050 
make that a complex reflection so when
you're<00:03:20.380> picking<00:03:20.590> up<00:03:20.920> meaning<00:03:21.250> that<00:03:21.670> that

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
you're picking up meaning that that

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.030 
you're picking up meaning that that
clients<00:03:22.540> are<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.870> meaning<00:03:23.260> can<00:03:23.470> be<00:03:23.530> in

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
clients are and the meaning can be in

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.640 
clients are and the meaning can be in
when<00:03:24.640> you<00:03:24.760> get<00:03:24.880> really<00:03:25.269> therapeutic<00:03:25.500> can<00:03:26.500> be

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
when you get really therapeutic can be

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.380 
when you get really therapeutic can be
something<00:03:26.860> that<00:03:27.010> the<00:03:27.220> client<00:03:27.580> really<00:03:27.730> has<00:03:28.030> no

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
something that the client really has no

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.690 
something that the client really has no
idea<00:03:29.230> of<00:03:29.290> what<00:03:29.560> as<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:29.739> begin<00:03:30.040> to<00:03:30.220> talk<00:03:30.430> to<00:03:30.489> you

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
idea of what as I begin to talk to you

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.990 
idea of what as I begin to talk to you
they<00:03:30.820> could<00:03:31.510> be<00:03:31.630> talking<00:03:31.930> about<00:03:32.970> areas<00:03:33.970> that

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
they could be talking about areas that

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.120 
they could be talking about areas that
are<00:03:34.450> really<00:03:34.810> not<00:03:35.019> strongly<00:03:35.620> in<00:03:35.950> their

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
are really not strongly in their

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:37.800 
are really not strongly in their
consciousness<00:03:36.910> you<00:03:37.090> know<00:03:37.120> but<00:03:37.360> we<00:03:37.600> are

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
consciousness you know but we are

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.540 
consciousness you know but we are
beginning<00:03:37.989> to<00:03:38.320> pick<00:03:38.560> that<00:03:38.769> meaning<00:03:39.190> up<00:03:39.370> and

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
beginning to pick that meaning up and

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.090 
beginning to pick that meaning up and
they<00:03:39.610> could<00:03:39.910> actually<00:03:40.140> you<00:03:41.140> know<00:03:41.230> surprise

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
they could actually you know surprise

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.680 
they could actually you know surprise
people<00:03:42.430> with<00:03:42.580> some<00:03:42.910> of<00:03:43.030> their<00:03:43.180> thinking<00:03:43.390> and

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
people with some of their thinking and

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.050 
people with some of their thinking and
reflective<00:03:44.200> listening<00:03:44.620> so<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.489> reflective

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
reflective listening so the reflective

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.670 
reflective listening so the reflective
process<00:03:46.269> whether<00:03:46.720> or<00:03:46.930> not<00:03:47.019> the<00:03:47.200> person<00:03:47.590> is

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
process whether or not the person is

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.610 
process whether or not the person is
grounded<00:03:48.190> in<00:03:48.280> reality<00:03:48.910> or<00:03:49.030> not<00:03:49.110> we<00:03:50.110> can<00:03:50.350> pick

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
grounded in reality or not we can pick

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.590 
grounded in reality or not we can pick
up<00:03:50.830> perhaps<00:03:51.070> some<00:03:51.519> meaning<00:03:52.030> behind<00:03:52.060> what

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
up perhaps some meaning behind what

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.449 
up perhaps some meaning behind what
they're<00:03:52.870> saying<00:03:53.230> even<00:03:53.620> in<00:03:53.769> a<00:03:53.799> delusional

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
they're saying even in a delusional

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:57.979 
they're saying even in a delusional
statements<00:03:55.180> or<00:03:55.360> we'll<00:03:55.989> certainly<00:03:56.430> begin<00:03:57.430> to

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
statements or we'll certainly begin to

statements or we'll certainly begin to
consider<00:03:58.989> what<00:03:59.320> that<00:03:59.350> might<00:03:59.769> mean<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.370> the

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
consider what that might mean to the

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.250 
consider what that might mean to the
person<00:04:00.910> like<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.269> example<00:04:01.870> of<00:04:02.049> you're

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
person like the example of you're

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.930 
person like the example of you're
thinking<00:04:02.620> about<00:04:02.739> your<00:04:03.040> family<00:04:03.549> which<00:04:03.760> is<00:04:03.910> a

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
thinking about your family which is a

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.050 
thinking about your family which is a
simple<00:04:04.720> basic<00:04:05.040> validation<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.130> I<00:04:06.280> heard<00:04:06.640> you

simple basic validation of I heard you

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.229 
simple basic validation of I heard you
you<00:04:07.450> know<00:04:07.570> we<00:04:08.290> may<00:04:08.680> not<00:04:08.709> be<00:04:08.890> communicating

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
you know we may not be communicating

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.600 
you know we may not be communicating
precisely<00:04:10.239> but<00:04:10.630> I<00:04:10.660> heard<00:04:10.959> that<00:04:11.200> from<00:04:11.440> you

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
precisely but I heard that from you

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.060 
precisely but I heard that from you
but<00:04:13.209> also<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:13.780> feeling<00:04:14.230> and<00:04:14.470> picking<00:04:14.920> up<00:04:15.010> the

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
but also the feeling and picking up the

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:19.050 
but also the feeling and picking up the
feelings<00:04:15.519> so<00:04:15.640> that<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:18.489> difference<00:04:18.970> between

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
feelings so that the difference between

feelings so that the difference between
a<00:04:19.560> complex<00:04:20.560> reflection<00:04:20.919> is<00:04:21.370> that<00:04:21.580> one<00:04:22.150> is

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:22.330 
a complex reflection is that one is

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.240 
a complex reflection is that one is
either<00:04:22.650> adding<00:04:23.650> more<00:04:23.860> meaning<00:04:24.250> to<00:04:24.460> it<00:04:24.640> adding

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
either adding more meaning to it adding

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.940 
either adding more meaning to it adding
to<00:04:25.700> it<00:04:25.820> versus<00:04:26.210> a<00:04:26.240> simple<00:04:26.750> reflection<00:04:27.020> where<00:04:27.920> I

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
to it versus a simple reflection where I

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.040 
to it versus a simple reflection where I
would<00:04:28.280> simply<00:04:28.820> reflect<00:04:29.360> what<00:04:29.570> the<00:04:29.660> person

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
would simply reflect what the person

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.890 
would simply reflect what the person
said<00:04:30.230> without<00:04:30.410> any<00:04:30.560> changes<00:04:31.310> so<00:04:32.120> I<00:04:32.150> might<00:04:32.660> say

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
said without any changes so I might say

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.400 
said without any changes so I might say
to<00:04:32.930> that<00:04:33.280> delusional<00:04:34.280> person<00:04:34.930> so<00:04:35.930> your<00:04:36.170> wife

to be here they forced me to come to

to be here they forced me to come to
your<00:04:49.520> clinic<00:04:49.940> and<00:04:50.240> I'm<00:04:50.330> not<00:04:50.510> even<00:04:50.780> sick<00:04:51.110> and<00:04:51.590> I

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
your clinic and I'm not even sick and I

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.500 
your clinic and I'm not even sick and I
might<00:04:52.160> just<00:04:52.370> repeat<00:04:52.760> back<00:04:52.970> what<00:04:53.150> they<00:04:53.270> said

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
might just repeat back what they said

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.940 
might just repeat back what they said
you<00:04:53.750> don't<00:04:53.930> want<00:04:54.110> to<00:04:54.200> be<00:04:54.350> here<00:04:54.560> somebody

you don't want to be here somebody

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.530 
you don't want to be here somebody
forced<00:04:55.370> you<00:04:55.460> to<00:04:55.490> come<00:04:55.730> to<00:04:55.880> this<00:04:56.000> clinic<00:04:56.270> and

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:56.540 
forced you to come to this clinic and

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.780 
forced you to come to this clinic and
you<00:04:56.630> don't<00:04:56.810> think<00:04:56.960> you're<00:04:57.170> sick<00:04:57.610> that<00:04:58.610> would

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:58.790 
you don't think you're sick that would

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:03.150 
you don't think you're sick that would
be<00:04:58.910> a<00:04:58.940> simple<00:04:59.270> reflection<00:05:00.190> versus<00:05:01.190> a<00:05:01.370> more

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
be a simple reflection versus a more

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.150 
be a simple reflection versus a more
complex<00:05:04.160> one<00:05:04.460> which<00:05:04.640> may<00:05:04.910> be<00:05:05.650> so<00:05:06.650> it<00:05:06.830> seems

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:07.160 
complex one which may be so it seems

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.680 
complex one which may be so it seems
that<00:05:07.460> other<00:05:07.790> people<00:05:08.150> think<00:05:08.419> that<00:05:08.540> you're

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
that other people think that you're

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:10.630 
that other people think that you're
having<00:05:08.840> mental<00:05:09.410> health<00:05:09.620> problems<00:05:10.310> and<00:05:10.490> that

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
having mental health problems and that

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.790 
having mental health problems and that
you<00:05:10.760> need<00:05:11.000> some<00:05:11.240> kind<00:05:11.270> of<00:05:11.570> help<00:05:11.630> for<00:05:12.110> it<00:05:12.320> but

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
you need some kind of help for it but

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.890 
you need some kind of help for it but
you<00:05:12.919> don't<00:05:13.160> agree<00:05:13.400> with<00:05:13.520> them<00:05:13.820> I've<00:05:14.600> added

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
you don't agree with them I've added

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.870 
you don't agree with them I've added
more<00:05:15.260> than<00:05:15.440> what<00:05:15.560> the<00:05:15.680> client<00:05:16.070> gave<00:05:16.220> me<00:05:16.460> okay

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
more than what the client gave me okay

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.330 
more than what the client gave me okay
so<00:05:17.510> those<00:05:17.990> are<00:05:18.200> the<00:05:18.290> two<00:05:18.440> distinction<00:05:18.950> I<00:05:19.100> think

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
so those are the two distinction I think

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.760 
so those are the two distinction I think
that<00:05:19.630> when<00:05:20.630> people<00:05:20.870> have<00:05:21.110> acute<00:05:21.500> symptoms

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
that when people have acute symptoms

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.530 
that when people have acute symptoms
that<00:05:22.100> one<00:05:22.340> could<00:05:22.610> add<00:05:22.820> meaning<00:05:23.120> to<00:05:23.390> what

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
that one could add meaning to what

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.540 
that one could add meaning to what
they're<00:05:23.750> saying<00:05:23.990> pick<00:05:24.380> up<00:05:24.560> on<00:05:24.770> their<00:05:25.010> feelings

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
they're saying pick up on their feelings

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.820 
they're saying pick up on their feelings
and<00:05:25.820> and<00:05:26.000> reflect<00:05:26.720> that<00:05:26.870> back<00:05:27.110> and<00:05:27.290> try<00:05:27.800> to

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
and and reflect that back and try to

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.800 
and and reflect that back and try to
remain<00:05:28.340> engaged<00:05:28.610> with<00:05:29.030> them<00:05:29.300> as<00:05:29.450> much<00:05:29.600> as

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
remain engaged with them as much as

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.000 
remain engaged with them as much as
possible<00:05:29.870> and<00:05:30.560> not<00:05:30.979> let<00:05:31.310> that<00:05:31.720> relationship

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
possible and not let that relationship

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.850 
possible and not let that relationship
become<00:05:34.010> disconnected<00:05:35.590> considering<00:05:36.590> that<00:05:36.740> it

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
become disconnected considering that it
