00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 do not 

00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.010
 in the travel recipe with me with 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.410
 your 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:13.290
 daniela user that will prepare us a 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.049
 delicious caramel flan for the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.200
 recipe there will be two parts for the 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.960
 candy will also be used by about 100 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.560
 grams of water and 200 grams of sugar 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:29.039
 to make the flan as such will use 4 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.830
 egg yolks half a liter of milk 100 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.260
 grams of white sugar and two grams of 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.320
 vanilla essence let's start with 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.280
 the expensive - we add the sugar on a 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.470
 pan and bring it to the fire 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.989
 stirring very slowly until 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.719
 take a dark golden color now 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.750
 we continue with the plan we put the 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.240
 whole milk 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.950
 there is life 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.950
 with half the sugar 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.050
 and we take them to the fire 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.500
 and the radius of the milk whitened the 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.500
 with half the remaining sugar 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.840
 you have to stir it well so that the 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.240
 sugar is integrated with the yolks here 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.000
 we see that we already have the boiled milk and 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.750
 then add the mixture of 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.850
 Eggs with the application stir well 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.940
 and constantly so that they integrate 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.520
 all the ingredients and we add little 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.799
 little the essence of vanilla and 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.979
 we start to smell and we see how it takes 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.610
 consistency here is ready to 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.020
 add it in the mold already with the candy 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.970
 here we see that we already have the candy 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:48.850
 dark we add water little by little 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:52.110
 quickly stirring here what 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:55.090
 we add over the mold immediately 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.920
 we add the flan mixture when 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.440
 we have it ready we take it to the oven 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.030
 per hour and a half approximately 90 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.800
 degrees centigrade in the oven when 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.790
 come out the oven what we are going to take cold 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.190
 approximately 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.540
 for two hours and then we take them out and 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.540
 we dismantled it in the following way 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.080
 and here we already have our plan 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.120
 candy ready to taste is very 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.110
 quick easy and simple so that what 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.110
