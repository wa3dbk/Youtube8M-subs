00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:14.680
 Now let's look at how to remotely control the robot 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:18.190
 In order to operate the robot with the remote control, 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.330
 The Rohnose remote control depth block must be fitted 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.070
 second 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.970
 Also in the cpu block of all 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:33.420
 Remote control adjustment program must be downloaded 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:35.720
 Third, the ID of the remote control and the ID of the remote control receiving block must be the same 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.720
 fourth 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:45.770
 All of the cpu blocks must be in the download location, not in the run 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:51.700
 This is a series of 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.700
 No-that we'll look at how to adjust the remote control first, 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.800
 Turn on the remote 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.020
 Enter the program mode 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:08.580
 So press and hold the STOP button until it is cool. 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.580
 After checking out the Tefal program 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:18.600
 Turn on the cpu block on the robot and select download mode In download mode 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.829
 Connect the cables 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.050
 Then press and hold the ok button 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.540
 The program will be transferred. If the program is normally transferred 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.510
 Unplug cable 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.010
 Next, enter remote control mode 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:52.030
 I will try to freeze the ID. 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.030
 I 'll use ID three here. 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:02:00.860
 I tried to use id 3 of remote control, 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.580
 It is set to 7 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.580
 ok button 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.970
 Press and hold to confirm ID is set to 3 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:17.810
 Such a right 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.810
 Change the mode of the remote control's cpu block to 17-line mode instead of download 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.900
 You can fix it with the remote control. 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:33.990
 I have learned how to operate the robot with the remote control. 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.990
 We'll take a closer look at the details in other videos
