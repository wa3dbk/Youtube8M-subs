00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 the craft terminal development team 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.950
 Atomic program was again an update 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.810
 missed and we show you in this 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.120
 video we are all new in the 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.120
 version 3.5 point 4 of the program 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.900
 since we only show you in this video 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.880
 Updates of the current version 3.5 4 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.919
 show we recommend you clearly 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.259
 before our complete tutorial for 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.609
 craften terminal now catch 

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:33.739
 However, we English with the 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.329
 new versions of the new version on 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.710
 It can not be done right away 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.809
 you come when you are 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.100
 have selected some mods and these 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.140
 then minecraft starts the whole thing 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.030
 somehow everything does not work because 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.860
 you will now see which mods 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.720
 are incompatible with each other and 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.940
 at which mortier which loader 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.410
 needed at one or the other of 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.210
 you may already wear one 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.489
 problems with the forces terminal up 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.289
 and now you should fix in the problem 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.149
 window can find a solution 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.800
 because you can both catch it 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.719
 learn the ford config as well as the 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.610
 clean minecraft directory and 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.770
 also support of forces terminal 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.270
 a question put your problems with the 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.729
 Cost terminal should therefore be the 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.350
 belong to the past 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.210
 section of the program welcomes you now 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.009
 now a head of a player end 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.080
 on the official force terminal server 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.729
 have played his before 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.310
 Movements were also repeated 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.590
 improved a new logo is also 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.070
 with the version 3.5 you with from the 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.079
 game 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.610
 But that's not all is well 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:30.409
 Now the crash of the program a 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.180
 error report saved as well as a 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.680
 error message also appears that 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.060
 scrolling has now been improved so 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.950
 that at a new message 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.810
 for example, not in the shoutbox 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.149
 more all the way down to automatic gold 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.619
 that will make the setup a little bigger 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.270
 it has become on the 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.259
 new internal graph terminal growth 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.119
 lead back 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.549
 the in unfavorable than the old one 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.500
 is also designed some bugfixes 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.240
 Of course you should not miss the noodle 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.219
 will include images of webex 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.719
 displayed again the setting will be 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.939
 always saved and it does not come 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.850
 more to seemingly random crash 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.289
 also programs with a faulty 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.810
 xml files were lifted and if you 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.490
 Once the selection snapshots show at 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.390
 then this is always true 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.859
 maintain 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.630
 In addition, the program now attacks 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:13.489
 also on your computer 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.230
 matching java version too 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.019
 these were basically the changes of the 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.720
 new forces terminals 3.5 point four 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.610

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.660

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.700
 terminal in which we explain what 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.140
 all because at all correct as 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.910
 you between the versions back and forth 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.800
