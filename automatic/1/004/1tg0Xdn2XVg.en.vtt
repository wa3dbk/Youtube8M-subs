00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.220
 Good morning, traffic safety. 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.740
 The girl who runs the time will introduce the book. 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.010
 Now I think a lot of facts lately. I became famous too 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.180
 It is. 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.419
 I usually go to Japan in 1965 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:26.749
 In this book, two short pieces of a girl 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:28.480
 There's more. 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.769
 Only about the girl who runs the time 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.820
 I'll give you an introduction. 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.820
 I will briefly introduce the content of the 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.390
 It's about the extraordinary Ilsan of ordinary international students. 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.670
 There is 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.540
 Stories and students will have some ability, 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.810
 I'm on your stairs. 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:47.640
 It's right 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.780
 I have the ability to know the future. 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:53.880
 Do not make your own growth. 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.170
 Prepare for friends and divorce your friends again 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:58.570
 It is up to 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.840
 However, I am very self-confident 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.120
 Will 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.120
 Because I've experienced those things in advance. 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.250
 Let's make two of them and explain. 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.130
 After reporting 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.780
 I do not have the Holy Spirit, but I will be safe and sound. 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.060
 When examining the moment of inspecting the safe, write the correct answer 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.470
 I want you to watch. 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.020
 He can of course get the right answer at that time, 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.950
 I can not tell you later. 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.300
 When I live, I have an accident and sometimes I have something wrong. 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.290
 Every time I do it, I go back in time. 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.690
 Life is so fascinating. 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.950
 I can trace the story of why this happened to me. 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.680
 The self is good and the ability to have this ability 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.490
 I was able to see it with the body of a science lab. 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.250
 So I went to find it 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.150
 Someone felt anxiety. 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.450
 I'm going through an accident that falls. 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.600
 Beyond that, in the last April, 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.640
 I have a transcendental experience. 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.340
 From then on 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.990
 It's got to be this ability. 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.869
 But the problem is if there is a problem, 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.330
 I was able to do it in this book. 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.309
 I'm going out. 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:17.309
 So the book instantly turns into propulsion. 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.529
 It is not fun to talk about the scholarship conclusion. 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:23.349
 You might want to read it yourself. 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.389
 If someone tells me this 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.409
 The man who came from the future and came from the future took it. 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:33.609
 It's a time-lapse thing. 

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:35.769
 You might want to look at the range or distance yourself. 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.239
 The same 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.639
 It was written in 1965, but I'm excited about the idea. 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.649
 Even though we have the future, 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:48.439
 I think it's important to be 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.439
 The same 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:59.799
 The recommended book of resources is what we need to 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:01.779
 I am responsible for my business. 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:05.309
 This book is a must-do story 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:08.399
 Talk about postponement and groups and individuals
