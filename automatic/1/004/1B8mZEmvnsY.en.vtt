house six so let's talk a little bit

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.720 
house six so let's talk a little bit
about<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.170> floors<00:00:19.560> here<00:00:19.949> this<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.609> an

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
about the floors here this is an

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.599 
about the floors here this is an
eighteen<00:00:21.210> inch<00:00:21.390> mat<00:00:22.320> foundation<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:23.430> this

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
eighteen inch mat foundation so this

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.179 
eighteen inch mat foundation so this
whole<00:00:23.820> thing<00:00:23.850> floats<00:00:24.600> like<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> like<00:00:25.769> a<00:00:25.800> boat

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
whole thing floats like a like a boat

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.830 
whole thing floats like a like a boat
you<00:00:26.519> know<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.000> earthquake<00:00:27.599> country

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
you know and this is earthquake country

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.950 
you know and this is earthquake country
and<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:29.160> engineered<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.570> entire

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
and it's engineered so that this entire

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.049 
and it's engineered so that this entire
structure<00:00:31.380> will<00:00:31.679> behave<00:00:32.009> as<00:00:32.040> one<00:00:32.430> unit<00:00:32.910> in

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
structure will behave as one unit in

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.110 
structure will behave as one unit in
that<00:00:33.230> we<00:00:34.230> we<00:00:34.800> talked<00:00:35.040> about<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.760> know<00:00:35.850> that

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
that we we talked about you know that

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.750 
that we we talked about you know that
this<00:00:36.480> floor<00:00:36.780> was<00:00:37.020> was<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.559> challenge<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.219> to

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
this floor was was a challenge to to

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.119 
this floor was was a challenge to to
pour<00:00:39.059> because<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.780> particular<00:00:40.200> day<00:00:40.680> it

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
pour because in that particular day it

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.479 
pour because in that particular day it
actually<00:00:41.460> stormed<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.890> but<00:00:43.890> once<00:00:44.070> we<00:00:44.250> solve

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
actually stormed and but once we solve

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.760 
actually stormed and but once we solve
that<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:45.420> came<00:00:45.989> with<00:00:46.289> all<00:00:46.590> these<00:00:46.770> brass<00:00:47.629> strips

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
that I came with all these brass strips

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.610 
that I came with all these brass strips
and<00:00:49.969> the<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.539> brass<00:00:51.750> strips<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.140> purposes<00:00:52.530> of

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
and the the brass strips the purposes of

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.380 
and the the brass strips the purposes of
brass<00:00:52.770> strips<00:00:53.100> was<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.850> always<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.360> to

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
brass strips was that you always have to

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.990 
brass strips was that you always have to
put<00:00:54.660> cut<00:00:55.079> lines<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.070> control<00:00:56.489> joints<00:00:56.730> in

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
put cut lines and control joints in

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.160 
put cut lines and control joints in
concrete<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.690> know<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.579> facilitate<00:01:00.170> areas

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
concrete you know to facilitate areas

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.840 
concrete you know to facilitate areas
where<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.530> concrete<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:02.129> crack<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.789> you

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
where the concrete can crack and you

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.250 
where the concrete can crack and you
want<00:01:03.030> them<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.180> crack<00:01:03.510> where<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.930> want<00:01:04.140> them

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
want them to crack where you want them

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.810 
want them to crack where you want them
to<00:01:04.379> crack<00:01:04.589> not<00:01:04.830> where<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.129> concrete<00:01:05.309> wants<00:01:05.729> to

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
to crack not where the concrete wants to

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.240 
to crack not where the concrete wants to
crack<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:08.030> when<00:01:09.030> we<00:01:09.150> do<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:10.040> sometimes<00:01:11.040> what

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
crack and when we do that sometimes what

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.170 
crack and when we do that sometimes what
I<00:01:11.280> like<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.729> do<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.420> actually<00:01:12.630> put<00:01:13.350> a

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
I like to do is I actually put a

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.710 
I like to do is I actually put a
decorative<00:01:15.180> brass<00:01:16.110> strip<00:01:16.650> or<00:01:16.950> copper<00:01:17.340> strip

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
decorative brass strip or copper strip

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.200 
decorative brass strip or copper strip
right<00:01:18.720> along<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.380> line<00:01:19.770> and<00:01:20.159> what<00:01:20.909> it<00:01:21.030> does

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
right along that line and what it does

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.910 
right along that line and what it does
is<00:01:21.420> actually<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.840> disguises<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.500> fact<00:01:22.830> that

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
is actually it disguises the fact that

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.710 
is actually it disguises the fact that
that<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.369> where<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:23.790> going<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.090> crack<00:01:24.360> and

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
that is where it's going to crack and

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.590 
that is where it's going to crack and
yet<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.619> provides<00:01:25.979> an<00:01:26.280> element<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:27.060> design

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
yet it provides an element a design

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.590 
yet it provides an element a design
element<00:01:28.070> much<00:01:29.070> like<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.850> would<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:30.240> in

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
element much like you would have in

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.289 
element much like you would have in
brass<00:01:30.840> trypsin<00:01:31.350> terrazzo<00:01:31.790> there's<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.880> lot<00:01:33.119> of

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
brass trypsin terrazzo there's a lot of

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.109 
brass trypsin terrazzo there's a lot of
there's<00:01:33.840> there's<00:01:34.290> some<00:01:34.490> interesting<00:01:35.490> ways<00:01:36.090> to

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
there's there's some interesting ways to

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.069 
there's there's some interesting ways to
approach<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.520> sometimes<00:01:38.520> people<00:01:38.780> want<00:01:39.780> to

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
approach this sometimes people want to

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.179 
approach this sometimes people want to
drop<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.369> brass<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.899> wet<00:01:43.110> concrete<00:01:43.500> just

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
drop the brass in the wet concrete just

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.100 
drop the brass in the wet concrete just
you<00:01:44.520> know<00:01:44.610> when<00:01:44.850> it's<00:01:44.970> gotten<00:01:45.149> its<00:01:45.299> first<00:01:45.570> here

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
you know when it's gotten its first here

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.490 
you know when it's gotten its first here
you<00:01:46.590> drop<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.670> brass<00:01:48.149> rail<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.020> we

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
you drop this brass rail in and we

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.300 
you drop this brass rail in and we
attach<00:01:49.829> little<00:01:50.070> brass<00:01:50.700> screws<00:01:51.210> underneath

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
attach little brass screws underneath

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.340 
attach little brass screws underneath
and<00:01:53.310> then<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.570> concrete<00:01:54.810> can<00:01:55.110> grab

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
and then that the concrete can grab

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.580 
and then that the concrete can grab
those<00:01:55.619> now<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.630> problem<00:01:57.780> with<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.350> is

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
those now the the problem with this is

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.350 
those now the the problem with this is
that<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.790> strips<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.299> are

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
that you have to have strips that are

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.350 
that you have to have strips that are
fairly<00:02:01.079> flat<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.560> straight<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.210> once<00:02:03.210> you

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
fairly flat and straight and once you

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.630 
fairly flat and straight and once you
lay<00:02:03.570> them<00:02:03.810> down<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.740> people<00:02:04.950> can't<00:02:05.280> Tramp

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
lay them down in that people can't Tramp

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.520 
lay them down in that people can't Tramp
all<00:02:05.820> over<00:02:06.149> them<00:02:06.329> right<00:02:06.659> it's<00:02:06.869> got<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.140> be<00:02:07.229> set

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
all over them right it's got to be set

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.249 
all over them right it's got to be set
at<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.799> level<00:02:07.920> where<00:02:08.879> they<00:02:09.450> don't<00:02:09.690> start<00:02:10.110> to

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
at a level where they don't start to

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.570 
at a level where they don't start to
drift<00:02:10.619> down<00:02:10.709> through<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.580> slab

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
drift down through the slab

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.910 
drift down through the slab
it<00:02:12.760> can't<00:02:12.970> be<00:02:13.120> too<00:02:13.390> hard<00:02:13.750> where<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:14.680> can't

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
it can't be too hard where you can't

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.270 
it can't be too hard where you can't
push<00:02:15.160> it<00:02:15.190> down<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:16.480> it's<00:02:17.380> a<00:02:17.500> delicate<00:02:17.950> balance

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
push it down so it's a delicate balance

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.100 
push it down so it's a delicate balance
it<00:02:18.430> has<00:02:18.490> to<00:02:18.700> have<00:02:18.880> some<00:02:19.270> really<00:02:19.510> good<00:02:19.780> timing

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
it has to have some really good timing

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.080 
it has to have some really good timing
you<00:02:20.410> have<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.620> work<00:02:20.800> with<00:02:20.980> a<00:02:21.010> crew<00:02:21.340> really<00:02:21.820> well

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
you have to work with a crew really well

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.440 
you have to work with a crew really well
to<00:02:22.720> put<00:02:23.110> these<00:02:23.290> in<00:02:23.500> at<00:02:23.710> that<00:02:23.920> moment<00:02:24.370> so<00:02:25.180> what

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
to put these in at that moment so what

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.090 
to put these in at that moment so what
they<00:02:25.570> would<00:02:25.720> do<00:02:25.960> is<00:02:26.230> they<00:02:26.590> would<00:02:26.620> cut<00:02:27.070> a

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:27.100 
they would do is they would cut a

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.180 
they would do is they would cut a
control<00:02:27.550> line<00:02:28.170> with<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.230> jointer<00:02:29.560> tool<00:02:29.890> and

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
control line with a jointer tool and

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.290 
control line with a jointer tool and
then<00:02:31.680> allow<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.740> slab<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.400> Keir<00:02:33.700> off<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:33.910> little

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
then allow the slab to Keir off a little

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.210 
then allow the slab to Keir off a little
bit<00:02:34.480> and<00:02:34.900> then<00:02:35.020> just<00:02:35.350> at<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.590> right<00:02:35.740> moment

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
bit and then just at the right moment

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.420 
bit and then just at the right moment
you<00:02:36.450> insert<00:02:37.450> these<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:37.990> let<00:02:38.890> them<00:02:39.070> float

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
you insert these and let them float

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.390 
you insert these and let them float
right<00:02:39.670> on<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:39.910> top<00:02:40.120> then<00:02:40.720> you<00:02:40.840> push<00:02:41.080> them<00:02:41.260> down

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
right on the top then you push them down

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.940 
right on the top then you push them down
slightly<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.790> keep<00:02:43.360> them<00:02:43.540> flat<00:02:43.750> now<00:02:44.500> in<00:02:44.770> this

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
slightly and keep them flat now in this

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.210 
slightly and keep them flat now in this
case<00:02:45.220> here<00:02:45.790> where<00:02:46.210> we<00:02:46.330> had<00:02:46.510> a<00:02:46.540> storm<00:02:47.350> and<00:02:47.770> you

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
case here where we had a storm and you

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.310 
case here where we had a storm and you
had<00:02:48.400> water<00:02:48.850> and<00:02:49.240> you<00:02:49.300> had<00:02:49.390> bleed<00:02:49.720> water<00:02:50.020> and

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
had water and you had bleed water and

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.260 
had water and you had bleed water and
all<00:02:50.440> this<00:02:50.620> stuff<00:02:50.830> these<00:02:51.640> things<00:02:51.940> are<00:02:52.090> moving

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
all this stuff these things are moving

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.410 
all this stuff these things are moving
around<00:02:52.600> it<00:02:53.110> was<00:02:53.290> really<00:02:53.950> really<00:02:54.220> tough<00:02:54.640> and<00:02:54.910> in

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
around it was really really tough and in

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.150 
around it was really really tough and in
some<00:02:55.660> cases<00:02:55.930> we<00:02:56.350> actually<00:02:56.709> had<00:02:59.010> places<00:03:00.010> where

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
some cases we actually had places where

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.810 
some cases we actually had places where
the<00:03:00.310> brass<00:03:00.520> strips<00:03:01.170> didn't<00:03:02.459> grab<00:03:03.459> anything

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
the brass strips didn't grab anything

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.449 
the brass strips didn't grab anything
cuz<00:03:04.120> there's<00:03:04.300> too<00:03:04.480> much<00:03:04.630> water<00:03:04.959> there<00:03:05.320> and<00:03:05.560> so

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
cuz there's too much water there and so

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.699 
cuz there's too much water there and so
we<00:03:06.610> had<00:03:06.730> to<00:03:06.850> pull<00:03:07.180> those<00:03:07.420> out<00:03:07.570> and<00:03:07.810> just<00:03:07.870> go

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
we had to pull those out and just go

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.240 
we had to pull those out and just go
ahead<00:03:08.860> and<00:03:09.310> flood<00:03:10.209> that<00:03:10.420> area<00:03:10.840> with<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.590> mixture

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
ahead and flood that area with a mixture

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.620 
ahead and flood that area with a mixture
of<00:03:12.370> sand<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:13.180> cement<00:03:14.310> powder<00:03:15.310> to<00:03:16.090> suck<00:03:16.360> up<00:03:16.510> the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
of sand and cement powder to suck up the

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.830 
of sand and cement powder to suck up the
water<00:03:16.660> and<00:03:17.140> then<00:03:18.070> come<00:03:18.340> back<00:03:18.370> later<00:03:18.550> and<00:03:19.150> cut

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
water and then come back later and cut

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.900 
water and then come back later and cut
these<00:03:20.019> in<00:03:20.320> so<00:03:20.650> some<00:03:20.890> of<00:03:20.950> these<00:03:21.160> in<00:03:21.400> this<00:03:21.580> floor

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
these in so some of these in this floor

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.870 
these in so some of these in this floor
this<00:03:22.180> particular<00:03:22.450> floor<00:03:22.840> are<00:03:23.050> actually<00:03:23.650> done

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
this particular floor are actually done

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.630 
this particular floor are actually done
afterward<00:03:24.880> and<00:03:25.150> some<00:03:26.050> were<00:03:26.830> managed<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.489> be

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
afterward and some were managed to be

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.540 
afterward and some were managed to be
put<00:03:27.940> in<00:03:28.209> at<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.780> time<00:03:29.200> of<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:29.470> pour<00:03:29.830> so

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
put in at the time of the pour so

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.880 
put in at the time of the pour so
there's<00:03:30.790> many<00:03:31.030> aspects<00:03:31.570> of<00:03:31.690> a<00:03:31.810> floor<00:03:32.200> you<00:03:32.800> know

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890

there's many aspects of a floor you know
especially<00:03:33.160> a<00:03:33.370> concrete<00:03:33.790> floor<00:03:34.090> where<00:03:34.510> we

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
especially a concrete floor where we

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.490 
especially a concrete floor where we
have<00:03:35.620> opportunities<00:03:35.800> to<00:03:36.550> manipulate<00:03:37.500> the

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
have opportunities to manipulate the

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.790 
have opportunities to manipulate the
look<00:03:38.709> and<00:03:39.600> in<00:03:40.600> addition<00:03:40.959> to<00:03:40.989> just<00:03:41.080> grinding

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
look and in addition to just grinding

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.860 
look and in addition to just grinding
the<00:03:41.920> floor<00:03:42.160> there's<00:03:42.489> textures<00:03:43.180> and<00:03:43.690> there's

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
the floor there's textures and there's

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.590 
the floor there's textures and there's
inlays<00:03:44.370> just<00:03:45.370> like<00:03:45.550> in<00:03:45.730> countertop<00:03:46.269> set

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:46.600 
inlays just like in countertop set

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.360 
inlays just like in countertop set
actually<00:03:46.900> a<00:03:47.140> lot<00:03:47.470> of<00:03:47.500> what<00:03:47.920> you're<00:03:48.070> seeing

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
actually a lot of what you're seeing

countertops and taking those

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.250 
countertops and taking those
opportunities<00:03:57.370> and<00:03:58.300> applying<00:03:58.690> them<00:03:59.019> on<00:03:59.230> a

opportunities and applying them on a
bigger<00:03:59.860> scale<00:04:00.400> really<00:04:01.000> so<00:04:02.010> in<00:04:03.010> this<00:04:03.250> house<00:04:03.489> for

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
bigger scale really so in this house for

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.780 
bigger scale really so in this house for
instance<00:04:04.320> not<00:04:05.320> only<00:04:05.380> did<00:04:05.890> we<00:04:05.920> inlay<00:04:06.370> brass

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
instance not only did we inlay brass

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.380 
instance not only did we inlay brass
strips<00:04:07.180> to<00:04:07.980> work<00:04:08.980> with<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.640> design<00:04:10.060> of

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
strips to work with the the design of

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.070 
strips to work with the the design of
the<00:04:11.049> grid<00:04:11.350> so<00:04:11.980> that<00:04:12.190> you<00:04:12.340> don't<00:04:12.519> have<00:04:12.730> that

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
the grid so that you don't have that

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.300 
the grid so that you don't have that
usual<00:04:14.730> control<00:04:15.730> joint<00:04:16.090> for<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:16.600> cracking<00:04:17.310> we

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
usual control joint for the cracking we

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.040 
usual control joint for the cracking we
inlaid<00:04:19.150> large<00:04:19.830> fossils<00:04:21.270> one<00:04:22.270> of<00:04:22.390> my<00:04:22.510> favorites

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
inlaid large fossils one of my favorites

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.590 
inlaid large fossils one of my favorites
is<00:04:23.260> automatic<00:04:24.220> valve<00:04:24.460> body<00:04:24.760> covers

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
is automatic valve body covers

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.720 
is automatic valve body covers
transmissions<00:04:26.470> and<00:04:27.000> and<00:04:28.000> also<00:04:29.250> we<00:04:30.250> put<00:04:30.460> in<00:04:30.610> a

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
transmissions and and also we put in a

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.920 
transmissions and and also we put in a
few<00:04:31.000> key<00:04:31.530> large<00:04:33.330> precious<00:04:34.330> items<00:04:35.320> like<00:04:35.650> the

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
few key large precious items like the

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.610 
few key large precious items like the
ammonite<00:04:37.930> from<00:04:38.230> russia<00:04:38.560> which<00:04:38.860> is<00:04:39.120> very<00:04:40.120> large

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
ammonite from russia which is very large

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.650 
ammonite from russia which is very large
just<00:04:41.620> as<00:04:41.770> you<00:04:41.890> walk<00:04:42.100> in<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.370> entryway<00:04:42.760> and

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
just as you walk in the entryway and

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.440 
just as you walk in the entryway and
then<00:04:45.420> this<00:04:46.420> lab<00:04:46.720> not<00:04:46.990> only<00:04:47.290> looks<00:04:48.220> good<00:04:48.460> but<00:04:48.520> it

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
then this lab not only looks good but it

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.540 
then this lab not only looks good but it
has<00:04:49.720> a<00:04:49.750> radiant<00:04:50.560> floor<00:04:50.860> system<00:04:50.890> that's

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
has a radiant floor system that's

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.310 
has a radiant floor system that's
running<00:04:51.760> through<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:52.150> whole<00:04:52.270> house<00:04:52.570> so<00:04:53.170> it

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
running through the whole house so it

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.660 
running through the whole house so it
gives<00:04:53.560> it<00:04:53.710> that<00:04:53.740> warmth<00:04:54.250> I<00:04:54.370> mean<00:04:54.550> without

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
gives it that warmth I mean without

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.000 
gives it that warmth I mean without
which<00:04:55.080> admittedly<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.380> concrete<00:04:56.740> would<00:04:56.920> be

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
which admittedly the concrete would be

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.040 
which admittedly the concrete would be
very<00:04:57.370> very<00:04:57.640> cold<00:04:57.910> so<00:04:58.600> it's<00:04:58.870> always

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
very very cold so it's always

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.490 
very very cold so it's always
recommended<00:04:59.680> to<00:04:59.830> use<00:05:00.190> a<00:05:01.140> hydraulic<00:05:02.140> system

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
recommended to use a hydraulic system

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.190 
recommended to use a hydraulic system
through<00:05:03.280> a<00:05:03.310> floor<00:05:03.670> like<00:05:03.910> this<00:05:04.120> because<00:05:05.050> it's

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
through a floor like this because it's

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.290 
through a floor like this because it's
not<00:05:05.470> only<00:05:05.590> efficient<00:05:06.160> and<00:05:06.370> it<00:05:06.730> gives<00:05:06.940> off<00:05:07.150> this

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
not only efficient and it gives off this

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.090 
not only efficient and it gives off this
very<00:05:07.750> very<00:05:08.140> comfortable<00:05:08.530> radiant<00:05:09.310> heat<00:05:09.690> and

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
very very comfortable radiant heat and

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.220 
very very comfortable radiant heat and
in<00:05:12.100> the<00:05:13.020> summertime

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 
in the summertime

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.360 
in the summertime
of<00:05:14.860> course<00:05:15.100> this<00:05:15.310> house<00:05:15.580> is<00:05:15.900> incredibly<00:05:16.900> cool

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
of course this house is incredibly cool

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.510 
of course this house is incredibly cool
it's<00:05:18.370> very<00:05:18.460> well<00:05:18.940> insulated<00:05:19.300> and<00:05:20.520> protective

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520

it's very well insulated and protective
against<00:05:21.850> the<00:05:21.970> heat<00:05:22.210> but<00:05:22.810> during<00:05:23.080> the

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.170 
against the heat but during the

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:24.870 
against the heat but during the
wintertime<00:05:23.440> you<00:05:23.770> also<00:05:23.950> want<00:05:24.280> that<00:05:24.460> radiant

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
wintertime you also want that radiant

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.690 
wintertime you also want that radiant
heat<00:05:25.120> to<00:05:25.470> the<00:05:26.470> concrete<00:05:26.800> can<00:05:27.040> radiate<00:05:27.430> that

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
heat to the concrete can radiate that

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.910 
heat to the concrete can radiate that
heat<00:05:27.760> back<00:05:28.000> to<00:05:28.600> you<00:05:28.810> and<00:05:29.050> it's<00:05:29.650> a<00:05:29.740> very
