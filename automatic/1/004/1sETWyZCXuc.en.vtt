but<00:01:38.369> it's<00:01:38.520> interesting<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.820> see<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.119> could

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
but it's interesting to see that I could

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.440 
but it's interesting to see that I could
really<00:01:39.509> control<00:01:40.020> how<00:01:40.530> much<00:01:41.030> pace<00:01:42.030> was<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.390> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
really control how much pace was on the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.550 
really control how much pace was on the
ball<00:01:42.630> so<00:01:44.600> as<00:01:45.600> we<00:01:45.720> continue<00:01:45.869> this<00:01:46.110> rally<00:01:46.380> it's

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
ball so as we continue this rally it's

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.200 
ball so as we continue this rally it's
to<00:01:46.649> make<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.950> camera<00:01:47.340> setup<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.729> can<00:01:47.850> see<00:01:48.060> me

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
to make it a camera setup you can see me

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.830 
to make it a camera setup you can see me
in<00:01:48.420> shot<00:01:48.810> now<00:01:49.520> just<00:01:50.520> sort<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.729> move<00:01:51.149> around<00:01:51.329> you

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
in shot now just sort of move around you

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.389 
in shot now just sort of move around you
know<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.380> motion<00:01:52.649> of<00:01:52.740> my<00:01:52.829> arms<00:01:53.220> is

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
know it's that the motion of my arms is

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.039 
know it's that the motion of my arms is
matched<00:01:53.670> exactly<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.630> motion<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:54.990> the

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
matched exactly to the motion on the

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.209 
matched exactly to the motion on the
screen<00:01:55.229> even<00:01:55.470> if<00:01:55.740> it's<00:01:55.890> not<00:01:55.979> actually

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
screen even if it's not actually

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.950 
screen even if it's not actually
involved<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.670> playing<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.390> much<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:57.780> that

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
involved in playing so much so that

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.420 
involved in playing so much so that
actually<00:01:58.259> have<00:01:58.350> missed<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.770> shot<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.250> let's

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
actually have missed a shot so let's

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.740 
actually have missed a shot so let's
just<00:01:59.579> try<00:01:59.670> again<00:01:59.759> a<00:02:00.030> bit<00:02:00.240> more<00:02:00.390> than<00:02:00.600> follow

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
just try again a bit more than follow

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.480 
just try again a bit more than follow
through<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.619> time<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:01.950> good<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.219> since

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
through the time is good on that since

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.459 
through the time is good on that since
we're<00:02:02.579> blue<00:02:02.850> trail<00:02:03.149> good<00:02:03.930> timing<00:02:04.290> on<00:02:04.350> the

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
we're blue trail good timing on the

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.590 
we're blue trail good timing on the
return<00:02:05.329> perfect<00:02:06.329> hit<00:02:06.509> get<00:02:06.659> petits<00:02:06.990> prints<00:02:07.320> for

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
return perfect hit get petits prints for

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.690 
return perfect hit get petits prints for
and<00:02:07.870> he<00:02:08.380> was<00:02:08.590> forced<00:02:08.800> long<00:02:09.190> so<00:02:09.399> though<00:02:09.550> that

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
and he was forced long so though that

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.030 
and he was forced long so though that
was<00:02:09.820> a<00:02:09.850> very<00:02:10.119> powerful<00:02:10.479> shot<00:02:10.960> there<00:02:11.680> was<00:02:11.890> some

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
was a very powerful shot there was some

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.500 
was a very powerful shot there was some
finesse<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.550> it<00:02:12.580> again<00:02:12.880> we'll<00:02:13.030> throw<00:02:13.180> up<00:02:13.330> and

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
finesse to it again we'll throw up and

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.530 
finesse to it again we'll throw up and
would<00:02:13.660> serve<00:02:14.100> cross-court<00:02:15.190> nice<00:02:15.970> blue<00:02:16.240> trail

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
would serve cross-court nice blue trail

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.270 
would serve cross-court nice blue trail
try<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:18.180> nice<00:02:19.180> down<00:02:19.570> the<00:02:19.750> line<00:02:19.959> backspin<00:02:20.950> shot

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
try a nice down the line backspin shot

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.640 
try a nice down the line backspin shot
and<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.790> direction<00:02:22.120> there<00:02:22.540> meant<00:02:23.380> that<00:02:23.560> he

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
and the direction there meant that he

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.720 
and the direction there meant that he
was<00:02:23.800> not<00:02:23.890> able<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.100> get<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.490> obviously

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
was not able to get to it obviously

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.920 
was not able to get to it obviously
we're<00:02:24.880> playing<00:02:25.030> on<00:02:25.090> quite<00:02:25.240> an<00:02:25.330> easy<00:02:25.450> setting

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
we're playing on quite an easy setting

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.070 
we're playing on quite an easy setting
here<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:27.640> opponent<00:02:27.910> isn't<00:02:28.750> returning

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
here and so the opponent isn't returning

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.590 
here and so the opponent isn't returning
everything<00:02:29.530> as<00:02:29.680> they<00:02:29.890> would<00:02:30.270> if<00:02:31.270> they<00:02:31.330> were<00:02:31.480> in

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
everything as they would if they were in

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.540 
everything as they would if they were in
a<00:02:31.720> harder<00:02:31.990> setting<00:02:32.290> cross-court<00:02:32.890> shot<00:02:33.130> there

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
a harder setting cross-court shot there

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.410 
a harder setting cross-court shot there
wins<00:02:33.850> me<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.180> game<00:02:34.390> so<00:02:35.290> that<00:02:35.620> takes<00:02:36.160> me<00:02:36.520> to<00:02:37.060> one

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
wins me the game so that takes me to one

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.370 
wins me the game so that takes me to one
game<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.990> love<00:02:38.170> but<00:02:38.920> now<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:39.160> will<00:02:39.670> be<00:02:40.380> receiving

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
game to love but now I will be receiving

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.990 
game to love but now I will be receiving
receiving<00:02:41.920> surf<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.400> see<00:02:42.550> how<00:02:42.640> we<00:02:42.700> go<00:02:42.850> and

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
receiving surf to see how we go and

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.130 
receiving surf to see how we go and
again<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.180> like<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.450> way<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.630> motion<00:02:43.959> of<00:02:44.050> the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
again I like the way the motion of the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.910 
again I like the way the motion of the
player<00:02:44.350> matches<00:02:44.590> both<00:02:44.860> my<00:02:45.070> torso<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.820> my<00:02:45.970> arms

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
player matches both my torso and my arms

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.270 
player matches both my torso and my arms
go<00:02:47.920> across<00:02:48.130> port<00:02:48.550> their<00:02:49.000> back<00:02:49.750> spin<00:02:50.280> slightly

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
go across port their back spin slightly

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.699 
go across port their back spin slightly
shorter<00:02:51.870> testing<00:02:52.870> him<00:02:52.989> out<00:02:53.140> still<00:02:53.410> got<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.560> blue

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
shorter testing him out still got a blue

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.199 
shorter testing him out still got a blue
trail<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.190> see<00:02:54.280> that<00:02:54.430> he<00:02:54.520> hit<00:02:54.670> it<00:02:54.790> back<00:02:54.970> blue

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
trail and see that he hit it back blue

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:56.460 
trail and see that he hit it back blue
as<00:02:55.360> well<00:02:55.390> just<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.810> good<00:02:56.020> shot

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
as well just a good shot

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.260 
as well just a good shot
who<00:02:56.560> had<00:02:56.739> to<00:02:56.860> be<00:02:56.950> on<00:02:57.040> my<00:02:57.190> toes<00:02:57.250> get<00:02:57.730> this<00:02:57.880> timing

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
who had to be on my toes get this timing

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.150 
who had to be on my toes get this timing
right<00:02:58.420> it's<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.260> bit<00:02:59.380> more<00:02:59.530> power<00:02:59.709> across<00:02:59.950> the

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
right it's a bit more power across the

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.820 
right it's a bit more power across the
court<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.640> beat<00:03:01.180> him<00:03:01.420> in<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.690> back<00:03:02.080> the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
we've got a super racquet upgrade

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.590 
we've got a super racquet upgrade
because<00:03:08.920> you<00:03:09.250> take<00:03:09.459> see<00:03:09.610> I'm<00:03:09.760> flashing<00:03:10.030> purple

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
and also in the top left it tells me if

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.390 
and also in the top left it tells me if
I<00:03:13.510> stamp<00:03:13.840> my<00:03:13.900> foot<00:03:14.200> or<00:03:14.380> if<00:03:14.470> I<00:03:14.530> say<00:03:14.709> super<00:03:15.040> racket

available that is the time and to take
your<00:04:52.260> shot<00:04:52.470> you<00:04:52.680> do<00:04:52.830> it<00:04:52.920> late<00:04:53.130> or<00:04:53.310> early<00:04:53.490> you're

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
your shot you do it late or early you're

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:55.120 
your shot you do it late or early you're
not<00:04:53.940> going<00:04:54.060> to<00:04:54.120> get<00:04:54.270> a<00:04:54.300> perfect<00:04:54.480> connection

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
not going to get a perfect connection

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.800 
not going to get a perfect connection
and<00:04:56.130> then<00:04:56.280> at<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:56.640> amount<00:04:56.970> of<00:04:57.120> motion<00:04:57.330> in<00:04:57.690> your

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
and then at the amount of motion in your

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.570 
and then at the amount of motion in your
arm<00:04:58.020> determines<00:04:58.560> the<00:04:58.680> power<00:04:58.830> so<00:04:59.160> they<00:04:59.310> get<00:04:59.460> I'm

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
arm determines the power so they get I'm

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.860 
arm determines the power so they get I'm
going<00:04:59.730> for<00:04:59.910> a<00:04:59.940> gentlest<00:05:00.510> shot<00:05:00.690> they're

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
going for a gentlest shot they're

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.590 
going for a gentlest shot they're
midcourt<00:05:01.470> and<00:05:01.820> he<00:05:02.820> hits<00:05:03.060> it<00:05:03.150> back<00:05:03.330> with<00:05:03.480> an

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
midcourt and he hits it back with an

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.510 
midcourt and he hits it back with an
orange<00:05:03.840> strategy<00:05:04.260> isn't<00:05:04.590> that<00:05:04.710> good<00:05:04.920> you

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
orange strategy isn't that good you

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.740 
orange strategy isn't that good you
really<00:05:05.700> look<00:05:05.790> to<00:05:05.940> see<00:05:06.090> those<00:05:06.210> blue<00:05:06.480> trails

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
really look to see those blue trails

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.180 
really look to see those blue trails
that's<00:05:06.960> quicker<00:05:07.200> so<00:05:07.470> I<00:05:07.500> had<00:05:07.590> to<00:05:07.680> be<00:05:07.770> quick<00:05:08.040> on

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
that's quicker so I had to be quick on

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.060 
that's quicker so I had to be quick on
that<00:05:08.480> I've<00:05:09.480> triggered<00:05:09.990> my<00:05:10.230> power<00:05:10.500> shot<00:05:10.800> there

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
that I've triggered my power shot there

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.270 
that I've triggered my power shot there
mid-game<00:05:12.050> my<00:05:13.050> glowing<00:05:13.290> racket<00:05:13.770> I<00:05:13.890> think<00:05:14.070> this

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
mid-game my glowing racket I think this

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.680 
mid-game my glowing racket I think this
whole<00:05:14.460> game<00:05:14.700> is<00:05:14.730> it<00:05:15.000> was<00:05:15.180> just<00:05:15.330> a<00:05:15.390> number<00:05:15.630> of

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
whole game is it was just a number of

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.990 
whole game is it was just a number of
shots<00:05:15.900> I<00:05:16.260> had<00:05:16.980> some<00:05:17.130> extra<00:05:17.370> power<00:05:17.550> there<00:05:17.820> but

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
shots I had some extra power there but

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.900 
shots I had some extra power there but
he<00:05:18.150> managed<00:05:18.480> to<00:05:18.660> beat<00:05:18.900> me<00:05:19.610> keep<00:05:20.610> the<00:05:20.730> ball<00:05:20.880> in

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
he managed to beat me keep the ball in

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.120 
he managed to beat me keep the ball in
and<00:05:21.540> then<00:05:21.630> I<00:05:21.720> over<00:05:21.960> hit<00:05:22.140> that<00:05:22.320> shot<00:05:22.590> like<00:05:22.830> as<00:05:23.040> I

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:23.130 
and then I over hit that shot like as I

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:25.010 
and then I over hit that shot like as I
approach<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.640> next<00:05:23.820> so<00:05:24.240> that<00:05:24.390> although<00:05:24.780> I<00:05:24.870> did

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
approach the next so that although I did

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.450 
approach the next so that although I did
use<00:05:25.140> my<00:05:25.170> super<00:05:25.800> power<00:05:25.980> it<00:05:26.160> didn't<00:05:26.400> actually

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
use my super power it didn't actually

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
nice now that was that time was slightly

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.490 
nice now that was that time was slightly
late<00:05:45.510> but<00:05:45.630> I<00:05:45.660> still<00:05:45.840> managed<00:05:46.050> to<00:05:46.110> make<00:05:46.380> a

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
late but I still managed to make a

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.560 
late but I still managed to make a
connection<00:05:46.770> and<00:05:47.220> hit<00:05:47.700> it<00:05:47.850> across<00:05:48.090> court<00:05:48.420> this

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
connection and hit it across court this

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.780 
connection and hit it across court this
copán<00:05:48.840> observe<00:05:49.230> but<00:05:50.100> blue<00:05:50.280> trail<00:05:50.580> that's

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
copán observe but blue trail that's

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.780 
copán observe but blue trail that's
that's<00:05:51.150> gonna<00:05:51.300> be<00:05:51.480> a<00:05:51.510> bit<00:05:51.660> shocked<00:05:52.790> slightly

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
that's gonna be a bit shocked slightly

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.110 
that's gonna be a bit shocked slightly
they<00:05:54.720> go<00:05:54.930> by<00:05:55.080> varying<00:05:56.040> the<00:05:56.370> pace<00:05:56.670> of<00:05:56.820> that<00:05:56.940> ball

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
they go by varying the pace of that ball

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.060 
they go by varying the pace of that ball
so<00:05:57.270> it<00:05:57.330> wasn't<00:05:57.600> a<00:05:57.630> hard<00:05:57.930> hit<00:05:58.170> ball<00:05:58.350> but<00:05:58.890> it<00:05:58.980> was

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
so it wasn't a hard hit ball but it was

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:01.160 
so it wasn't a hard hit ball but it was
a<00:05:59.100> well<00:05:59.400> struck<00:05:59.880> with<00:06:00.180> not<00:06:00.390> too<00:06:00.510> much<00:06:00.630> pace<00:06:00.900> I

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
a well struck with not too much pace I

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.030 
a well struck with not too much pace I
managed<00:06:01.470> to<00:06:01.500> confuse<00:06:01.980> him<00:06:02.430> he<00:06:02.580> missed

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:03.040 
managed to confuse him he missed

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.520 
managed to confuse him he missed

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
shot again human opponents I think we've

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.160
