00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.770
 hello youtube friends then in this 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.840
 occasion I gave myself the task of trying the 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.000
 most difficult games for android and 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.890
 deliver an interesting top 5 of 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.240
 these games 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.340
 although video games for 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.900
 mobile devices are conceived 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.730
 commonly as a means of 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.890
 entertainment to hang out and 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.990
 Enjoy in a pleasant way some time 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.970
 free between activities there is a 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.920
 interesting number of titles that 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.260
 represent a real challenge to the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.540
 intelligence reflexes and patience 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.910
 player among all of them 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.410
 Android has a considerable catalog 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.360
 of alternatives that beyond 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.700
 relax can cause everything 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.520
 but they are also irresistible 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.070
 for the lovers of the challenges here they 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.560
 I present the 5 most difficult games for 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.600
 android a complicated choice where 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:00.390
 surely there will be many more who can 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.520
 share in the comments in the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.769
 number 5 of this top is the game 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.659
 called expander we start with a 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.369
 title not so complicated and that leads 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.159
 within its name the nuance of what 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.080
 Expect us to expand is one of those 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.750
 games that love or hate 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.790
 the video is deceptive makes it seem 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.530
 everything very simple and fluid but the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.650
 reality is that it is a title 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.690
 exasperating expander is a cube that 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.820
 advance through an endless corridor the 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.770
 objective is to stretch its shape 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.230
 to collect as much of 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.420
 cubes possible these without exceeding in the 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.490
 size so as not to burst the aisle and 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.930
 changing proportions and fair color 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.030
 in time not to brown or 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.780
 crash against the figures of it 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.050
 color is a must-have game and 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.630
 hateful in number 4 of this top is 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.640
 the game called bosÃ³n tenth a game 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.140
 Not suitable for people susceptible to 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.790
 Vertigo 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.740
 it's about another career title 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.810
 infinite but with a more 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.350
 interesting that it already had great popularity 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.090
 on the platform and you're a teacher 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.130
 of science that runs through a 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.320
 particle accelerator to charge it 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.179
 of energy and discover new particles 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.160
 the question here is that according to the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.860
 character advances the stage goes 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.810
 literally unfolding and rotating what 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.940
 which requires excellent reflexes to 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.710
 not drop holes generated as 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.840
 harder is not to get distracted 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.790
 the deployment of the environment but after 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.850
 a good time is possible to master it 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.920
 relatively beyond the challenge is a 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.110
 real pleasure to watch how they move 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.240
 and create the elements in a title that 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.220
 without resorting to elaborate graphics achieves 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.490
 one of the most original proposals of 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.560
 the last times for mobile games 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.080
 in number 3 of this top is the game 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.000
 called 1001 athens one of the best 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.370
 elements of this game is your soundtrack 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.400
 that pays a direct tribute to the saga 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.900
 Megaman 8 - bit Nintendo in the 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.660
 reality is that the level of difficulty 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.610
 here is even more frustrating 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.260
 the approach is simple and absurd 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.240
 you have to bounce between the four 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.040
 walls of a closed room for 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.620
 collect the gems that appear 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.510
 as more more recoleta gems 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.430
 will be the traps that can be liquidated 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.040
 until everything reaches a level where 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.260
 it is impossible to leave alive if you die 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.060
 you start from scratch and basically you 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.740
 you have to hurry just to discover 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.130
 what scenario are they going to 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:20.380
 disembowel you 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.110
 in number 2 of this top is the game 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.880
 called impossible row a classic game 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.030
 of them that is also unsurpassed 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.040
 on android if your personality is a 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.840
 both addictive and those that always 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.450
 seek to achieve the highest possible score 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.670
 This game can get you into more than one 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.740
 I tighten with its simple game system 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.780
 consisting of making steal a ball 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:43.180
 through an infinite path you can 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.220
 seem almost impossible at first 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.410
 but after tying him the way he 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.470
 it only becomes complex and very addictive 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.960
 in the number 1 of this top is the game 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.090
 called the impossible game of impossible 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.180
 game is really a game of 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.340
 infinite horizontal career where with 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.140
 minimal graphics we take the role of a 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.350
 picture that runs in a plagued scenario 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.390
 of peaks and deadly traps all here 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.450
 it's about the synchronicity to execute the 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:12.370
 jumps and not die in the attempt to depart 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.710
 of the eighth or tenth round begins at 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.180
 get back less complicated but move 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.120
 for the entire journey 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.310
 dying countless times just to see 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.320
 how far you get is one of those 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.680
 guilty pleasures that are produced by 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.650
 put 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.660
