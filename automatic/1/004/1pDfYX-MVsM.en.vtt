00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.000
 not 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.520
 hello my name is thierry I am 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.630
 teacher coaching organizers in 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.750
 the world of Argentine tango 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:18.280
 I present to you alessia lyndine us 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.500
 Let's go together to introduce you to the basics 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.920
 Argentinean tango well today we 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.350
 let's see the march in dissociation or 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.530
 spiral and the different systems of 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.970
 walking crossed or normal without good 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.649
 heard forget the position and the 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.550
 foot posture in seven million 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.640
 years of evolution 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.400
 the human body has arrived a stage of 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:43.410
 market based on antagonism and 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.410
 dissociation of the body as I am 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.520
 you will have noted that at this time there to 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.010
 an opposition movement between 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.110
 shoulders and legs and a moment of 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.530
 dissociation between the basin and 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.930
 shoulders 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.970
 that's what we'll call 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.760
 antagonism arms legs and 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.440
 dissociation shoulders pelvis most 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.269
 individuals when they dance 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.189
 use this technique but the 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.689
 dancer needs him another 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.759
 technique that we will call the spiral 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:11.020
 and that allows him in any circumstance 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:12.850
 to keep your balance 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.990
 most dancers rightly 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.450
 uses this technique of the 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.570
 dissociation which is more natural for 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.460
 walk the march in dissociation and 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.900
 antagonisms you will notice that the basin 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.330
 is ahead when les paul is in 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.159
 withdrawal in the spiral march the 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.799
 dancer preferred to put the basin in 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.020
 withdrawal at the same time as his shoulder this 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.490
 which will allow him to lengthen his leg 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.409
 without losing the balanced 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.970
 you will have a phenomenon of walking 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:41.979
 of this type the hand singing spiral she 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.170
 keeps the center of gravity at 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.520
 same place while advancing the leg 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.000
 which allows a maintenance of the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.369
 balanced 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.220
 so we can work the advanced 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.759
 and receding the leg of one of the two 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.729
 partners 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.100
 without losing the equilibrium 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.810
 which is true on the front and the back 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.390
 will also be true on the side 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:08.259
 let's resume this process with our 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:10.780
 partner the spiral allows to lengthen 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.269
 the leg of his follower and his own 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.430
 leg with the assurance of never having 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.430
 no loss of balance or the opposite 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.050
 now see this example of walking 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:30.530
 in antagonism and spiral with a 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:33.870
 arm partner 10 note closed 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.700
 the spiral isation decor and 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.020
 the antagonism of the shoulders and legs 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.500
 you will also note that in the 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.160
 market 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.640
 we have four phases such as 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.150
 the intention that allows you to stretch the 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.220
 dancer's leg development 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.920
 which brings lax between the two 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.770
 feet the weight transfer up 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.790
 the next focus before grouping and 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.110
 and so on 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:08.280
 intentions stock transfer group and 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:10.110
 stop transfer intentions grouped and that 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.510
 mastery of these four elements at the 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:14.130
 slowed as in speed allows for 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.230
 control the march in its absolute 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.810
 the goal of a launcher will be to 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.790
 set up these four phases in 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.150
 taking into account that a step of 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.820
 walk is to step from 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:30.540
 his initial position to his position 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:33.810
 final in other words to pass his axis 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.440
 from a middle position to a 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.360
 middle position and not as do 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.050
 most dancers a position 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.280
 closed to a firm position and 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.200
 now that we have developed the 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.630
 moving the legs in the dance 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.390
 let's talk about the posture of the feet during 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:54.180
 the movement in the walk before the 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.910
 direction of the free leg will be the one 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.730
 foot support feet will arise 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.070
 on the outer phalanges up 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.940
 full extension of the front leg 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:08.160
 to slip and take the support following the 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.130
 front foot will be opened and the 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.830
 back foot on the dance line in 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:17.010
 a pad walk before the free leg takes 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.769
 the direction of the support foot and the 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.870
 phalanges outside the free foot go 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.310
 slide along the ground to the point 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.260
 arrival in reverse 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.810
 the dance line is defined by the 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.169
 leg book that stretches until the 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.479
 forefoot 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.999
 to begin the transfer to the hip 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.810
 back and their group and feet in 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:37.999
 the same position 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.529
 let's go now to the side steps and 

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:42.259
 observe the behavior of the foot 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:44.270
 note that on the off position the 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:46.819
 foot of the leg free and slightly 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.770
 broken you observe it strongly on the 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:52.659
 foot of the dancer the feet go then 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:55.669
 slid on the side until the extension 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:57.020
 complete the leg the foot will then 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:05:00.199
 pointed at the first phalanx 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.839
 outside the thumb before transfer 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:05.300
 total body 

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:06.800
 finally in the walk there is no left 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.050
 more than the change of support to deal with 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.389
 which is an unlisted small sizes 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.360
 the posture of the feet is the same 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:17.150
 free ankle is broken and the transfer 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.770
 will be by rolling feet from the 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:19.759
 right to the left or left 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.789
 to the right 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:25.129
 always releasing the free ankle 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:27.560
 and breaking it slightly now 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:29.629
 that the way of walking is established that 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.339
 the processes are clear let's see the 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:33.650
 two systems of margins available on 

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:35.870
 system says normal or parallel and the 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.110
 cross system in the normal system 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:46.490
 opposable legs are moving at the same 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:51.279
 time in the system cross legs 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:54.050
 opposable do not circulate at the same time 

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:57.020
 so you can work on 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:01.629
 changes in support of the march in 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:07.419
 system says normal a change the support 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:07.419
 and the system time margin crossed 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:11.149
 I would never recommend enough 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.439
 work your left time and you 

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:13.969
 the exercises are simple for 

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:17.270
 work your spiral with 

00:06:13.969 --> 00:06:20.479
 antagonisms such as those working 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:24.620
 on the spot and pass your leg 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:30.710
 from front to back using your 

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:33.349
 arm in antagonism the changes 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:35.509
 support will then be installed between two 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:37.909
 no walk we saw today 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:40.190
 walking his process the different 

00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:40.550
 phases the different systems of the 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:42.740
 market 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.970
 we saw the changes of supports 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.069
 I propose to meet you in 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.500
 an upcoming video to work the 

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:50.800
 to cross one of the constituent elements of the 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.800
 Argentine tango
