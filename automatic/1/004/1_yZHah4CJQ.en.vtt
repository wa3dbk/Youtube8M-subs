00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 So, guys, I'm going to teach you today. 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:10.019
 How does the flood system work? 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:13.679
 from dm then first we need 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.650
 to know is what to clone rona you get a 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.930
 certain status of your digimon and increase 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.820
 he has a chance to fail has a 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.710
 chance to increase and has a minimum and a 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.350
 maximum it can increase 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.660
 it is always very variable knowing this 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.210
 has different colors for levels 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.090
 different from flooding in the clone of 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.000
 Level 13 series the clones and left the 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.850
 level 4 or 6 clone b came out of level 7 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.629
 to 9 and the clone the level series of 10 or 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.300
 12 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.370
 there is a maximum number of clones that 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.989
 You can distribute in your daemon that 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.450
 are exactly 24 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.660
 you can put 12 in two attributes 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.730
 did on each of the four or you do 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.739
 Any way you want but I recommend it 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.989
 you put 12 in two attributes 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.180
 different as you may have perceived 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.770
 you can not put 24 points in one 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.790
 state is more common than people 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.540
 usually place or is having 71 or ati 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.130
 ev 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.100
 I've never seen anyone putting 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.960
 block any daemon not know why and 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.450
 like I said before have the maximum and 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.450
 minimum that each level can rise thus 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.710
 How are you showing on your screen? 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.900
 so there's a lot of money that 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.909
 Pick up reservation Edson and if not upgraded the 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.549
 maximum that level lets them climb 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.439
 back one level of the clone then it was 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.689
 this basically means that the option 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.759
 It serves more and when you think it does not 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.470
 I liked this tribute by putting everything in 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.670
 and you do not want to spend a lot of 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.770
 reset cassol 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.750
 for this there is a reset that blesses 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.880
 But it's really hard for you to get her. 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.430
 even with players selling items 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.470
 cash the only advantage of playing gdm is that 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.960
 You do not have to pay to put 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.420
 clone in the thousand thousand new paying one 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.500
 a certain rate for each Thai clone on the screen 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.630
 to the table 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.729
 Anyway, I prefer academia because 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.040
 gym has many more advantages than 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.479
 disadvantages in relation to the meeting but 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.250
 This is subject to another video. Let's go. 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.990
 continue with the cones 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.850
 as you have a chance to pay also has 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.860
 chance to regress to what exists 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.110
 the backup said the backup says it serves 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.319
 for when you fail your jingle does not 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.629
 regress one level 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.129
 then let's get out of theory 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.019
 show you how it's in 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:20.200
 practice this all you have to talk to 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:23.319
 jumps human data there will alienate by 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.489
 option will open this menu to yoki and 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.230
 click start 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.540
 there you choose the tribute you want 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.909
 conan clicks the first button and it goes 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.950
 put the necessary and there will be this 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:36.099
 mini game you choose a card or 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.790
 wait 9 seconds and then it will show 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:42.040
 there was an ugly or civil success in the case there 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.379
 with you realized having a morning is 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.329
 always on the third top card from 1 to 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.950
 6 is almost sure it will not fail 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.139
 understood 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.819
 it's basically this then as I did not have 

00:02:50.139 --> 00:02:54.370
 backup said he could not show it to 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.250
 how do they work but is the 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.319
 same thing only you double click 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.060
 on that button there and will put the backup 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.400
 I said to you, so this is it folks 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.319

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.510
