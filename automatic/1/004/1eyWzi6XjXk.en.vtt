 Or both 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.570
 welcome to a new video or the stroke 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.570
 to what would be the new version of 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.240
 minecraft that I said which is the 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.880
 0.12 point 1 in this case we would have the 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.169
 beta number one good has come out the day 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.880
 today because today I'm going up 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.199
 as always a description for leaving 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.640
 the link many people who come 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.520
 mainly to download it then 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.680
 well a description will be the link 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.420
 Besides that, well, let's see a 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.820
 little about the novelties that this 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.740
 version that is very well very many 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.620
 novelties one that is mainly the 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.970
 that calls more attention well let's 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.130
 enter the game so that you then 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.020
 see , we are going to talk about the 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.000
 news among the news the 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.620
 main would be the black we give the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.230
 back and as we see then here 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.070
 we would have in which you can do 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.570
 any size as in today I have it 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.910
 other news well let's go we go 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.830
 parts with the novelties we can run 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.070
 as you can see, we could run 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.920
 duck and we played twice with this one 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.140
 as we would in this case we would have 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.869
 inside the new controls 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.119
 tactile renewed which as you see 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.040
 Well, if in this case they go out if we do 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.210
 double that we bend over and go 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.130
 walking slowly 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.930
 if we are from the team here we fly and then 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.149
 So here we go up and down, it's no longer with 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.670
 the little arrows these are then 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.340
 quite well this from the controls the 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.600
 portal can be made from any 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.640
 size as previously well between 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.609
 among other few other not 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.659
 we would have the rain the snow anvils and 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:50.609
 repair pots enchantments the 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.549
 enchanted table of enchantment 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:55.319
 exhibitions elaborating those of the 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.530
 beer and the preparation of 

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.049
 stand beers 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.659
 to hunger the food because we could already 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:06.100
 eat the vital and all that then is 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:10.910
 very good in new sounds the goals 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:14.270
 we would have also the things ready 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:16.640
 in the strengths in the mnr we go to 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.110
 enter ships and as in the nerd then 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.500
 I do not know what I said that it's going to 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.300
 shut up that I will be failing or with 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.459
 the controls because I have been told that in 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.350
 many devices the controls do not 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.270
 they are functioning as they should then 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.209
 for those who do not work because they would have 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.190
 to wait for them to draw another vein of 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.650
 which all the times that the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.750
 I'll be uploading to the channel even if it's 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.269
 a one-day delay due to the 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.950
 are rising even if it is changing the 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.530
 links of the last video that comes up from 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.970
 sales in this case if tomorrow the 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.040
 beta 2 and I do not have time to upload what 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.810
 I do it in this video to change a link 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.239
 so that they can always 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.410
 download and as well over here 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:59.450
 we would have a fortress and this one 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.860
 we would have the blades and other things that 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.650
 has added 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.080
 and have it really go pretty well 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.970
 to me in my experience 3 as in the nerd 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.560
 I'm doing pretty well to the only one when 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.050
 I'm going to leave that as you see there it gets 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.090
 like lentito but already after there everything 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:17.150
 from what I thought I would later 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.840
 I was going to be failing or something like that but 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.270
 really, it is not as fluid and 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.800
 Well, everything here is very fluid in the 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.480
 description as I would always leave what 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.720
 would be the list of changes so that 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.750
 You can see all the changes because 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:34.850
 they are really many and good 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.830
 we would also have control support and 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.540
 the control assignment screen where 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.640
 we could place these controls that 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.110
 they are in the adjustments and many good 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.690
 things more than a description then 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.260
 will be the link where you can see what 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.750
 it would be the novelties completely all 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.630
 the novelties besides those novelties 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.540
 then download this new version that the 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.560
 description leave the link and then good 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.970
