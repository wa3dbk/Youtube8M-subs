00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.040
 Peace for all I am Steve. Do you believe that we still have about a week to finish Lent? 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.860
 It has been weeks of challenging time 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.420
 Fasting is hard work! 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.389
 Fasting unites us in a common struggle 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.769
 And joint preparation 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.769
 If we are honest ... with a common failure 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.340
 No one is perfect 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.340
 These past few weeks have all engulfed us 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.040
 We are all too fast 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.430
 Or we said things we should say 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.940
 Or we did things we had to do 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.560
 Instead of allowing us to approach the great week with a discouraging resolve and weak morale 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.880
 The Church gives us hope ... in the person of Saint Mary of Egypt 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.080
 For a long time St. Mary lived a life full of sins 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.080
 Until a day came when she wanted to go to Jerusalem to visit the Church of the Holy Sepulcher (the Resurrection) 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.360
 Where there is the tomb of Jesus Christ 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.160
 When I tried to enter I felt an invisible force preventing her from entering 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.040
 I realized that this was because of her sins! 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.040
 She was ashamed of herself 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.979
 When she saw the icon of the Virgin Mary outside the church building 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:00.320
 Tabet ..! 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.020
 She asked for forgiveness 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.610
 I went to the desert 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.850
 I stayed in the desert for forty years 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.700
 Pray and come closer than God .. and repent of her sins 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.260
 Now when we think of Saint Mary of Egypt 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.400
 We no longer recall its flaws 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.860
 We do not go back and think about what it was 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.440
 But think about what it has become 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.680
 "Saint" 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.480
 A holy person in the kingdom of God 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.480
 They are saints because they repent 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.080
 When we think of repentance we usually associate them with a bad feeling towards our sins 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.000
 But repentance means more 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 The word "repentance" comes from the Greek word "metanoya" 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.900
 Which means a change in thinking or a change of direction 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.360
 St. Mary (the Egyptian) did not feel his sins alone 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.820
 But changed her life 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.720
 She changed her destination 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.320
 I stopped running away from God 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.340
 She began to go towards him 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.320
 Sometimes we resist repentance in our lives because we are afraid 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.820
 We are so burdened with guilt that we feel forgiven 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.570
 No way! 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.210
 We build walls around ourselves 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.899
 Because we are afraid 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.359
 Lest we be broken and we do not deserve love 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.580
 When St. Mary felt that power outside the church 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.580
 She had a chance 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.540
 She could have gone back from God 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.460
 Or try to get close to him 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.670
 It is no coincidence that she made her decision after looking into my eyes 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.370
 Mary 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.430
 Because somewhere in its depths I knew 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.300
 That saints love her 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.900
 They are waiting for it 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.880
 I know that God loves her 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.880
 He is waiting for her 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.380
 I realized that there was no great or bad sin 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.920
 God does not forgive her 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.210
 It does not matter what you did before or how long you were doing this 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.890
 God was waiting for her, opening his hands and ready for forgiveness 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.600
 All of us have sinned and we all have our losses. But it does not matter what we have done before 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.680
 Nothing God can not do 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.500
 This does not apply only to Lent 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.500
 But applies to our lives in general 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:58.800
 Yes, repentance is not easy 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.640
 It takes more than a moment 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.920
 St. Mary lived forty years in the desert 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.960
 But that started in a moment! 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.360
 A decision to return to God 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.580
 The saints continue to do so throughout their lives. Every day 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.680
 Every minute and every moment is a chance 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.040
 And call for repentance until we re-focus on God 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.850
 Of course we will find and fall 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.500
 But God is always present to extend His hand to us and raise us again 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.300
 If you feel that you did not benefit 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.560
 Of the opportunity to fast in Lent 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.980
 Do not worry, there is still time to prepare for Passover 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.800
 They just started now 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.830
 And even if you spend your lives away from God 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.290
 do not worry 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:44.720
 Just do not move away 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.450
 But turned 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.080
 So let us be like the bee and to repent 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.580
 This moment and every moment 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.579
 Be like the bees and live Orthodoxy 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.579
 Remember to join the channel if you like it 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.171
 I will meet you all next week
