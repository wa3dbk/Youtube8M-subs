00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.940
 this is a special report report 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.490
 special 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.150
 because the guardians of the road always 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.690
 they are alert and ready to help 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.690
 special report 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.440
 Most of us like to be in the water 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:32.330
 good except if you live in a colony of 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.630
 coatzacoalcos and it is said that 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.400
 after the storm comes the calm 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.700
 but you also have to say that where 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:43.250
 there were fire ashes left and although not 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.140
 we see precisely ashes if we see the 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.410
 ravages that the rains have left in 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.720
 the last hours flooded streets 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:54.050
 broken fittings covered sewers 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.989
 and stuck vehicles etc. and so on 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.060
 etcetera the guardians of the road 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.540
 We went to visit the colonies of 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:05.479
 coatzacoalcos and how can you see them all? 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.130
 it rained on wet people 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.009
 they had to walk in the middle of the water 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.250
 some with other boots with flip flops and 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:16.040
 some more as you could but the 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.890
 good Mexicans we try to always see 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.500
 the positive side of things and try 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.899
 to keep calm and hope such 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.509
 as Mr. Isaane Jimenez tells us 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.560
 towers inhabitants of the colony adolfo 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.560
 lÃ³pez mateos 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.430
 and I see that you have also attached water in 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.220
 their jugs and now that there was no water 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.090
 we had to have water at the service of 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.119
 bathroom 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.979
 they already came to invite you to 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.979
 the shelters were not 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.390
 around here they do not have abandoned after 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.250
 100 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.400
 abandoned 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.090
 and that, because it should not be, we are 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.969
 humans 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.690
 here the kids go to school we have 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:10.690
 this load 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.600
 and that's a low level right now because 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.970
 now lower than when now is the 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.690
 joaquin campaign they threw three 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.210
 land travel already cited also 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.220
 so yes yes now like who says yes 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.790
 joaquin would have thrown the sand up more 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.870
 the water level 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.490
 yes because I see that it is even the 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.600
 taxi drivers do not want to enter here this 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.460
 stop one edits 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.610
 and from there they go down to people and tell them that 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.610
 do not 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.580
 Excellent 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.620
 because they do not have us to abandon 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.940
 merely take a little spin around 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.840
 here to see how we are doing 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.740
 it does not help at least one point of land 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.740
 to get ahead 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.870
 we do not do it 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.420
 and for his future mayor that joaquin 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.120
 well let's hope it's not the same as 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.130
 others because you see that this framework is 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.130
 doing a lot outside and where almost not 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:16.850
 they need it is high everything is yes but 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.850
 here in the low 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.280
 see it as the down 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.230
 how we were how we live 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.300
 do not give up 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.920
 and over there he is given a pantry when 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:33.800
 and a large size 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.800
 we not enlarged with any help 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:40.750
 and because 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.890
 actually 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.959
 the guardians of the road 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:51.050
 We strongly recommend that you take the 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.120
 precautions necessary to avoid 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.650
 any unfortunate incident is at 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.750
 pending releases of 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.860
 civil protection and if your house is in 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.940
 a risk area 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.959
 go immediately to a shelter 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.600
 keep your documents very well 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.750
 important items in an envelope 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:12.870
 plastic or nylon bag and have the 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:17.720
 on hand in any emergency 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.720
 remember take care of your life and that of yours 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:27.510
 resource for the guardians of the road 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.510
 vicente gonzÃ¡lez 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.849
 this was a special report report 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:33.849
 special 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.400
 because the guardians of the road always 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.140
 they are alert and ready to help 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:44.990
