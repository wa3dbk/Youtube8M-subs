00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
characters and the voice acting but

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.120 
characters and the voice acting but
before<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.580> start<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.389> just<00:00:12.660> want<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.230> admit<00:00:13.620> that

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
before I start I just want to admit that

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.460 
before I start I just want to admit that
when<00:00:14.309> I<00:00:14.340> first<00:00:14.639> heard<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.179> show<00:00:15.420> I<00:00:15.690> didn't

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
when I first heard of the show I didn't

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.080 
when I first heard of the show I didn't
think<00:00:16.680> it<00:00:16.949> was<00:00:17.100> going<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.310> be<00:00:17.460> all<00:00:17.640> that<00:00:17.820> great

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
think it was going to be all that great

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.410 
think it was going to be all that great
after<00:00:18.930> seeing<00:00:19.140> previous<00:00:19.680> seasons<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.400> saw<00:00:21.000> the

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
after seeing previous seasons I saw the

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.420 
after seeing previous seasons I saw the
sonic<00:00:21.750> boom<00:00:21.900> trailer<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.529> I<00:00:22.949> thought<00:00:23.189> it

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
sonic boom trailer and I thought it

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.519 
sonic boom trailer and I thought it
looked<00:00:23.460> ridiculous<00:00:24.449> along<00:00:25.140> with<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.439> new

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
looked ridiculous along with the new

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.279 
looked ridiculous along with the new
look<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.859> knuckles<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:26.820> on<00:00:27.000> but<00:00:27.750> after

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
look of knuckles and so on but after

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.099 
look of knuckles and so on but after
watching<00:00:28.590> episodes<00:00:29.250> one<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.580> two<00:00:29.910> I<00:00:30.179> ended<00:00:30.990> up

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
watching episodes one and two I ended up

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.860 
watching episodes one and two I ended up
enjoying<00:00:31.470> them<00:00:31.800> just<00:00:32.430> as<00:00:32.610> much<00:00:32.640> as<00:00:32.969> i<00:00:33.059> did<00:00:33.360> with

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
enjoying them just as much as i did with

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.560 
enjoying them just as much as i did with
older<00:00:34.290> sonic<00:00:34.620> episodes<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.550> know<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.239> may<00:00:36.360> come

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
older sonic episodes I know it may come

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.020 
older sonic episodes I know it may come
as<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.750> surprise<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.620> enjoyed<00:00:38.070> them<00:00:38.280> but

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
as a surprise that I enjoyed them but

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.299 
as a surprise that I enjoyed them but
you<00:00:39.270> see<00:00:39.480> when<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.379> watch<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.860> show<00:00:41.070> like<00:00:41.250> this

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
you see when you watch a show like this

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.760 
you see when you watch a show like this
whether<00:00:42.270> you're<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.480> longtime<00:00:42.780> Sonic<00:00:43.410> fan<00:00:43.620> or

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
whether you're a longtime Sonic fan or

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.549 
whether you're a longtime Sonic fan or
not<00:00:43.800> you<00:00:44.579> can't<00:00:44.879> really<00:00:45.239> compare<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:46.260> older

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
not you can't really compare it to older

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.369 
not you can't really compare it to older
seasons<00:00:46.980> like<00:00:47.190> sonic<00:00:47.579> x<00:00:47.820> sonic<00:00:47.969> sat<00:00:48.750> a.m<00:00:48.960> and

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
seasons like sonic x sonic sat a.m and

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.920 
seasons like sonic x sonic sat a.m and
so<00:00:49.649> on<00:00:49.770> because<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.120> one<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.329> those<00:00:51.600> shows

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
so on because this is one of those shows

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.350 
so on because this is one of those shows
that<00:00:52.410> in<00:00:52.620> order<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:53.010> really<00:00:53.309> enjoy<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.850> you

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
that in order to really enjoy it you

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.020 
that in order to really enjoy it you
have<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.719> watch<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:54.930> for<00:00:55.350> what<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.649> is<00:00:55.760> no<00:00:56.760> it's

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
have to watch it for what it is no it's

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.630 
have to watch it for what it is no it's
not<00:00:57.090> perfect<00:00:57.719> but<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.530> still<00:00:58.829> manages<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.309> be

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
not perfect but it still manages to be

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.090 
not perfect but it still manages to be
funny<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.180> enjoyable<00:01:00.629> as<00:01:01.230> for<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
funny and enjoyable as for the

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.369 
funny and enjoyable as for the
characters<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.940> voice<00:01:02.969> acting<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.840> think

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
characters and voice acting I think

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.859 
characters and voice acting I think
they're<00:01:04.530> great<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:05.119> sonics<00:01:06.119> new<00:01:06.270> design<00:01:06.630> is

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
they're great to sonics new design is

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.590 
they're great to sonics new design is
nice<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.250> show<00:01:08.460> he<00:01:09.090> comes<00:01:09.390> off<00:01:09.570> more

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
nice and in the show he comes off more

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.469 
nice and in the show he comes off more
like<00:01:10.350> an<00:01:10.470> older<00:01:10.860> version<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.310> Sonic<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.939> it's

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
like an older version of Sonic and it's

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.600 
like an older version of Sonic and it's
the<00:01:12.570> same<00:01:12.780> thing<00:01:13.020> with<00:01:13.200> knuckles<00:01:13.680> he<00:01:14.430> may<00:01:14.580> be

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the same thing with knuckles he may be

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.640 
the same thing with knuckles he may be
taller<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.210> bulkier<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.409> case

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
taller and bulkier but in this case

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.700 
taller and bulkier but in this case
change<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.580> good<00:01:17.640> tails<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.840> Amy's<00:01:19.200> character

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710

designs<00:01:20.070> don't<00:01:20.520> look<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.850> much<00:01:20.909> different

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060

designs don't look that much different
than<00:01:21.479> before<00:01:21.659> but<00:01:22.560> in<00:01:22.770> my<00:01:22.920> opinion<00:01:23.090> they<00:01:24.090> have

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
than before but in my opinion they have

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.080 
than before but in my opinion they have
never<00:01:24.570> looked<00:01:24.840> better<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.380> CG<00:01:25.979> form<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.610> know<00:01:26.909> a

game and comic books I always thought
those<00:01:43.229> two<00:01:43.530> would<00:01:43.920> make<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.159> great<00:01:44.399> couple<00:01:44.759> she

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
those two would make a great couple she

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.690 
those two would make a great couple she
would<00:01:45.630> drive<00:01:45.869> sonic<00:01:46.320> crazy<00:01:46.590> but<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.490> would

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
would drive sonic crazy but that would

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.630 
would drive sonic crazy but that would
be<00:01:47.820> hilarious<00:01:48.590> also<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.890> find<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.520> new

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
be hilarious also I find the new
