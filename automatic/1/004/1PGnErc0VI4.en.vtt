yards but a PC is my mainstay however I
was<00:00:40.379> having<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.649> problem<00:00:40.950> with<00:00:41.160> my<00:00:41.540> keyboard<00:00:42.540> so

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
was having a problem with my keyboard so

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.080 
was having a problem with my keyboard so
I<00:00:42.989> don't<00:00:43.320> see<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.370> Logitech<00:00:44.820> mouse

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
I don't see this is the Logitech mouse

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.529 
I don't see this is the Logitech mouse
and<00:00:46.100> Logitech<00:00:47.100> wireless<00:00:47.430> keyboard<00:00:48.210> now<00:00:48.480> two

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
and Logitech wireless keyboard now two

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.010 
and Logitech wireless keyboard now two
things<00:00:49.219> one<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.430> pluses<00:00:51.210> about<00:00:51.600> this<00:00:51.809> is

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
things one of the pluses about this is

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.959 
things one of the pluses about this is
the<00:00:52.199> batteries<00:00:52.710> learning<00:00:53.100> this<00:00:53.250> stuff<00:00:53.399> lasts

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
the batteries learning this stuff lasts

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.850 
the batteries learning this stuff lasts
like<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.300> long<00:00:54.719> time<00:00:55.079> they<00:00:55.260> really<00:00:55.559> come<00:00:55.739> up

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
like a long time they really come up

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.040 
like a long time they really come up
with<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.039> very<00:00:56.250> efficient<00:00:56.850> way<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.660> make<00:00:57.809> sure

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
with a very efficient way to make sure

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.799 
with a very efficient way to make sure
that<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> battery<00:00:58.559> life<00:00:58.980> stays<00:00:59.600> very<00:01:00.600> very

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
that the battery life stays very very

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.779 
that the battery life stays very very
high<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.039> doesn't<00:01:02.309> take<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.489> many

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
high and it doesn't take that many

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.579 
high and it doesn't take that many
batteries<00:01:03.329> either<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:03.899> only<00:01:04.019> like<00:01:04.290> two

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
batteries either it's only like two

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.609 
batteries either it's only like two
batteries<00:01:05.129> okay<00:01:05.900> I'm<00:01:06.900> going<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.110> also<00:01:07.380> dust

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
batteries okay I'm going to also dust

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.660 
batteries okay I'm going to also dust
frequency-hopping

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
frequency-hopping

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.420 
frequency-hopping
and<00:01:09.180> all<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.450> that<00:01:09.570> good<00:01:09.869> stuff<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:11.250> then

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
and all of that good stuff and then

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.340 
and all of that good stuff and then
there's<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.820> little<00:01:11.970> transceivers<00:01:12.869> let's<00:01:13.170> come

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
there's a little transceivers let's come

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.270 
there's a little transceivers let's come
over<00:01:13.470> here<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.680> take<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.920> look<00:01:14.070> at<00:01:14.220> this

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
over here and take a look at this

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.179 
over here and take a look at this
transceiver<00:01:14.880> it's<00:01:15.479> very<00:01:15.840> very<00:01:16.170> very<00:01:16.830> tiny

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
transceiver it's very very very tiny

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.789 
transceiver it's very very very tiny
you'll<00:01:17.850> see<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.119> right<00:01:18.270> there<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.650> a

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
you'll see it right there and that is a

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.890 
you'll see it right there and that is a
unifying<00:01:20.580> transceiver<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.420> what<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.720> means

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
unifying transceiver and what that means

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.780 
unifying transceiver and what that means
is<00:01:22.200> from<00:01:22.439> Logitech<00:01:22.950> they<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.369> system

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
is from Logitech they have the system

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.270 
is from Logitech they have the system
called<00:01:24.030> unifying<00:01:24.650> and<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.830> think<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.159> even

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
called unifying and I think it even

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.120 
called unifying and I think it even
comes<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.790> Macs<00:01:27.030> as<00:01:27.240> well<00:01:27.450> where<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.740> tie

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
comes on Macs as well where you can tie

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.700 
comes on Macs as well where you can tie
in<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> bunch<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:29.939> different<00:01:30.110> Logitech<00:01:31.110> devices

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
in a bunch of different Logitech devices

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.310 
in a bunch of different Logitech devices
including<00:01:32.189> mice<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.850> keyboards<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.720> all

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
including mice and keyboards and all

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.740 
including mice and keyboards and all
kind<00:01:34.560> of<00:01:34.590> other<00:01:34.650> stuff<00:01:34.979> one<00:01:35.820> big<00:01:36.119> problem<00:01:36.390> is

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
kind of other stuff one big problem is

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.830 
kind of other stuff one big problem is
this<00:01:37.290> little<00:01:37.619> guy<00:01:37.770> okay<00:01:38.520> that<00:01:39.270> little<00:01:39.600> guy<00:01:39.780> is

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
this little guy okay that little guy is

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.030 
this little guy okay that little guy is
the<00:01:40.049> wireless<00:01:40.970> USB<00:01:41.970> adapter<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.380> has<00:01:43.890> been

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
the wireless USB adapter and it has been

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.510 
the wireless USB adapter and it has been
causing<00:01:44.310> interference<00:01:45.290> with<00:01:46.290> my<00:01:46.320> keyboard

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
causing interference with my keyboard

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.609 
causing interference with my keyboard
okay<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.270> what<00:01:48.509> that<00:01:48.719> means<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.170> when<00:01:49.350> I'm<00:01:49.439> you

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
okay and what that means is when I'm you

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.200 
okay and what that means is when I'm you
know<00:01:49.740> going<00:01:50.039> between<00:01:50.159> tracks<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.909> I'm<00:01:50.969> trying

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
know going between tracks and I'm trying

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.580 
know going between tracks and I'm trying
to<00:01:51.270> do<00:01:51.359> key<00:01:51.570> commands<00:01:51.929> and<00:01:52.109> all<00:01:52.200> that

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
to do key commands and all that

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.209 
to do key commands and all that
once<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.670> get<00:01:53.729> key<00:01:54.149> commands<00:01:54.509> going<00:01:55.109> it's<00:01:55.979> not<00:01:56.070> a

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
once I get key commands going it's not a

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.730 
once I get key commands going it's not a
problem<00:01:56.549> but<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.210> first<00:01:57.689> few<00:01:57.990> seconds<00:01:58.500> it's

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
problem but the first few seconds it's

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.679 
problem but the first few seconds it's
almost<00:01:59.009> like<00:01:59.219> there's<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.579> wireless<00:01:59.939> hopping

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
almost like there's a wireless hopping

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.139 
almost like there's a wireless hopping
that<00:02:01.469> has<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.770> happen<00:02:01.920> between<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.700> Logitech

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
that has to happen between the Logitech

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.459 
that has to happen between the Logitech
keyboard<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.740> actual<00:02:05.929> the<00:02:06.929> transceiver

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
keyboard and the actual the transceiver

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.309 
keyboard and the actual the transceiver
and<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.879> was<00:02:09.060> slowing<00:02:09.450> my<00:02:09.569> workflow<00:02:09.989> down

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
and so that was slowing my workflow down

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.400 
and so that was slowing my workflow down
and<00:02:10.619> what<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.009> went<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.459> did<00:02:11.670> was<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:12.120> got<00:02:12.900> this

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
and what I went and did was I got this

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.009 
and what I went and did was I got this
which<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.370> USB<00:02:15.830> Apple<00:02:16.830> keyboard<00:02:17.580> and

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
which is a USB Apple keyboard and

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.750 
which is a USB Apple keyboard and
another<00:02:19.019> bird<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.920> killed<00:02:20.160> with<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.640> with

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
another bird that I killed with it with

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.880 
another bird that I killed with it with
that<00:02:20.790> one<00:02:21.090> stone<00:02:21.450> and<00:02:22.079> look<00:02:22.319> at<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.560> size

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
that one stone and look at the size

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.530 
that one stone and look at the size
difference<00:02:22.920> here<00:02:23.819> okay

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
difference here okay

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.009 
difference here okay
so<00:02:25.079> there<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.310> Logitech<00:02:27.030> keyboard<00:02:27.599> if<00:02:27.900> you

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
so there is the Logitech keyboard if you

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.319 
so there is the Logitech keyboard if you
can<00:02:28.230> see<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:29.579> can<00:02:29.700> see<00:02:29.819> the<00:02:29.910> edge<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.269> the

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
can see you can see the edge of the

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:35.000 
can see you can see the edge of the
space<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:32.250> there's<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.930> Apple<00:02:33.930> keyboard<00:02:34.560> I'm

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
space and there's the Apple keyboard I'm

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.640 
space and there's the Apple keyboard I'm
getting<00:02:35.340> very<00:02:35.760> very<00:02:35.910> efficient<00:02:36.720> lots<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.440> room

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
getting very very efficient lots of room

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.030 
getting very very efficient lots of room
here

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
here

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.400 
here
I<00:02:38.190> still<00:02:38.730> got<00:02:38.880> my<00:02:38.910> keyboard<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:40.079> impulse

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
I still got my keyboard and the impulse

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.620 
I still got my keyboard and the impulse
Novation<00:02:41.040> down<00:02:41.250> there<00:02:41.519> but<00:02:42.150> this<00:02:42.269> gives<00:02:42.480> me

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
Novation down there but this gives me

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.030 
Novation down there but this gives me
some<00:02:42.810> room<00:02:43.019> I<00:02:43.200> can<00:02:43.380> actually<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:44.010> know
