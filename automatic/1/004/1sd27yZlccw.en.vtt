because they've been repositioned you
get<00:05:08.060> more<00:05:08.270> coverage<00:05:08.510> but<00:05:09.080> at<00:05:09.140> the<00:05:09.229> same<00:05:09.440> time

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
get more coverage but at the same time

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.430 
get more coverage but at the same time
the<00:05:09.950> boot<00:05:10.100> is<00:05:10.280> also<00:05:10.640> more<00:05:10.880> flexible<00:05:11.290> mainly<00:05:12.290> in

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
the boot is also more flexible mainly in

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.990 
the boot is also more flexible mainly in
the<00:05:12.590> forefoot<00:05:13.010> area<00:05:13.070> making<00:05:13.550> for<00:05:13.850> a<00:05:13.880> more

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
the forefoot area making for a more

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.969 
the forefoot area making for a more
comfortable<00:05:14.270> fit<00:05:14.690> as<00:05:14.870> well<00:05:14.900> I<00:05:15.350> think<00:05:15.770> that<00:05:15.890> the

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
comfortable fit as well I think that the

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:17.980 
comfortable fit as well I think that the
new<00:05:16.100> control<00:05:16.520> frame<00:05:16.820> doesn't<00:05:17.330> feel<00:05:17.690> too<00:05:17.960> much

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
new control frame doesn't feel too much

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.630 
new control frame doesn't feel too much
different<00:05:18.620> I<00:05:18.710> do<00:05:18.770> think<00:05:19.130> it's<00:05:19.250> an<00:05:19.340> improvement

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
different I do think it's an improvement

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.580 
different I do think it's an improvement
but<00:05:20.180> again<00:05:20.419> that<00:05:20.600> extra<00:05:20.960> weight<00:05:21.110> to<00:05:21.169> the<00:05:21.410> shoe

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
but again that extra weight to the shoe

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:22.990 
but again that extra weight to the shoe
is<00:05:21.830> something<00:05:22.160> that's<00:05:22.310> going<00:05:22.460> to<00:05:22.520> turn<00:05:22.700> a<00:05:22.729> lot

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 
is something that's going to turn a lot

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.969 
is something that's going to turn a lot
of<00:05:23.030> people<00:05:23.390> away<00:05:23.630> but<00:05:24.110> at<00:05:24.169> the<00:05:24.260> same<00:05:24.440> time<00:05:24.710> for

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
of people away but at the same time for

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:26.409 
of people away but at the same time for
those<00:05:25.070> who<00:05:25.130> have<00:05:25.340> been<00:05:25.490> asking<00:05:25.940> for<00:05:26.000> a<00:05:26.240> more

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419

those who have been asking for a more
traditional<00:05:26.630> predator<00:05:27.380> this<00:05:27.800> is<00:05:28.070> the<00:05:28.280> closest

a<00:05:40.100> big<00:05:40.400> impact<00:05:40.790> on<00:05:41.060> the<00:05:41.210> overall<00:05:41.570> feel<00:05:41.840> as<00:05:42.110> far

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
a big impact on the overall feel as far

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.170 
a big impact on the overall feel as far

actually<00:05:44.300> find<00:05:44.660> that<00:05:44.840> it<00:05:44.960> did<00:05:45.080> a<00:05:45.110> good<00:05:45.440> job<00:05:45.500> at

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
actually find that it did a good job at

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.680
