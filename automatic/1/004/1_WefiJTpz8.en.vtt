if<00:00:01.180> you're<00:00:01.390> trying<00:00:01.660> to<00:00:01.719> replace<00:00:02.170> your<00:00:02.440> heat

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:02.710 
if you're trying to replace your heat

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:04.500 
if you're trying to replace your heat
sink<00:00:03.010> and<00:00:03.250> you<00:00:03.340> noticed<00:00:03.670> the<00:00:03.970> thermal<00:00:04.330> paste

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:04.510 
sink and you noticed the thermal paste

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.160 
sink and you noticed the thermal paste
is<00:00:04.870> all<00:00:05.050> dried<00:00:06.040> up<00:00:06.190> on<00:00:06.340> the<00:00:06.520> bottom<00:00:06.910> and<00:00:07.170> you're

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:08.170 
is all dried up on the bottom and you're

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.629 
is all dried up on the bottom and you're
wondering<00:00:08.469> if<00:00:08.650> you<00:00:08.769> have<00:00:08.860> to<00:00:09.009> you<00:00:09.219> know<00:00:09.309> keep

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:09.639 
wondering if you have to you know keep

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:13.560 
wondering if you have to you know keep
it<00:00:09.820> on<00:00:09.910> the<00:00:10.089> same<00:00:10.299> or<00:00:10.900> remove<00:00:11.619> it<00:00:11.799> and<00:00:12.360> put<00:00:13.360> some

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:13.570 
it on the same or remove it and put some

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
cloth and 91% isopropyl alcohol you can

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.999 
cloth and 91% isopropyl alcohol you can
get<00:00:21.670> that<00:00:21.849> at<00:00:22.150> a<00:00:22.630> pharmacy<00:00:23.380> I<00:00:23.589> got<00:00:23.800> mine<00:00:23.980> at

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:24.009 
get that at a pharmacy I got mine at

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:26.880 
get that at a pharmacy I got mine at
Target<00:00:24.519> in<00:00:24.669> the<00:00:25.080> Medical<00:00:26.080> Center<00:00:26.499> or<00:00:26.560> whatever

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
Target in the Medical Center or whatever

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.720 
Target in the Medical Center or whatever
and<00:00:28.050> it<00:00:29.050> wasn't<00:00:29.230> that<00:00:29.349> much<00:00:29.589> money<00:00:29.859> fairly

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:30.730 
and it wasn't that much money fairly

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.430 
and it wasn't that much money fairly
cheap<00:00:31.029> and<00:00:31.269> the<00:00:31.329> lint-free<00:00:31.509> cloth<00:00:31.900> I<00:00:32.200> actually

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:32.440 
cheap and the lint-free cloth I actually

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.340 
cheap and the lint-free cloth I actually
got<00:00:32.920> that<00:00:32.950> at<00:00:33.250> Target<00:00:33.370> also<00:00:33.820> it<00:00:34.600> was<00:00:34.990> in<00:00:35.200> the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
got that at Target also it was in the

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.800 
got that at Target also it was in the
car<00:00:35.770> section<00:00:36.370> to<00:00:36.820> wax<00:00:37.000> your<00:00:37.270> car<00:00:37.300> but<00:00:37.660> we're

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
car section to wax your car but we're

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.330 
car section to wax your car but we're
not<00:00:37.930> using<00:00:38.200> it<00:00:38.290> on<00:00:38.410> a<00:00:38.440> car<00:00:38.710> we're<00:00:38.890> gonna<00:00:38.980> use<00:00:39.190> it

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
not using it on a car we're gonna use it

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.580 
not using it on a car we're gonna use it
on<00:00:39.400> your<00:00:39.550> heat<00:00:39.730> sink<00:00:40.000> and<00:00:40.210> your<00:00:40.750> CPU<00:00:40.960> so

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:41.590 
on your heat sink and your CPU so

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.590 
on your heat sink and your CPU so
basically<00:00:42.250> what<00:00:42.430> you<00:00:42.550> do<00:00:42.700> is<00:00:42.910> you're<00:00:43.540> gonna

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
basically what you do is you're gonna

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.450 
basically what you do is you're gonna
want<00:00:43.810> to<00:00:43.840> fold<00:00:44.110> up<00:00:44.260> your<00:00:44.290> cloth<00:00:44.620> a<00:00:44.950> few<00:00:45.220> times

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
want to fold up your cloth a few times

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.960 
want to fold up your cloth a few times
and<00:00:45.760> then<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.950> I<00:00:47.980> just<00:00:48.130> fold<00:00:48.340> it<00:00:48.460> like<00:00:48.550> forth

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:48.970 
and then so I just fold it like forth

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.240 
and then so I just fold it like forth
for<00:00:49.480> two<00:00:49.720> times<00:00:49.930> whatever<00:00:50.260> just<00:00:50.890> so<00:00:50.980> when<00:00:51.100> you

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
for two times whatever just so when you

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.940 
for two times whatever just so when you
put<00:00:51.490> the<00:00:51.610> the<00:00:52.240> alcohol<00:00:52.960> on<00:00:53.080> it<00:00:53.230> doesn't<00:00:53.560> seep

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 
put the the alcohol on it doesn't seep

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.600 
put the the alcohol on it doesn't seep
through<00:00:54.250> and<00:00:54.460> you<00:00:54.970> know<00:00:55.000> damage<00:00:55.420> other<00:00:55.570> parts

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.610 

so<00:01:00.610> after<00:01:00.820> it's<00:01:00.970> folded<00:01:01.390> just<00:01:01.420> to<00:01:01.870> take<00:01:02.440> the

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
so after it's folded just to take the

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.130 
so after it's folded just to take the
alcohol<00:01:02.880> put<00:01:03.880> the<00:01:04.059> cloth<00:01:04.330> on<00:01:04.540> it<00:01:04.690> and<00:01:04.809> then<00:01:04.900> tip

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
alcohol put the cloth on it and then tip

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.020 
alcohol put the cloth on it and then tip
it<00:01:05.260> over<00:01:05.350> so<00:01:05.680> just<00:01:05.710> get<00:01:06.160> saturated<00:01:06.370> a<00:01:06.820> little

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
it over so just get saturated a little

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.850 
it over so just get saturated a little
bit<00:01:07.180> and<00:01:07.360> then<00:01:07.750> you'll<00:01:07.900> be<00:01:08.050> able<00:01:08.110> to<00:01:08.350> clean<00:01:08.740> off

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
bit and then you'll be able to clean off

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.590 
bit and then you'll be able to clean off
your<00:01:08.890> heat<00:01:09.160> sink<00:01:09.400> I<00:01:12.060> heard<00:01:13.060> a<00:01:13.150> lot<00:01:13.270> of<00:01:13.330> people

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
your heat sink I heard a lot of people

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.640 
your heat sink I heard a lot of people
say<00:01:13.810> go<00:01:14.170> in<00:01:14.350> one<00:01:14.650> motion<00:01:14.920> but<00:01:15.640> honestly<00:01:16.420> I

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
say go in one motion but honestly I

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.860 
say go in one motion but honestly I
don't<00:01:17.650> think<00:01:17.830> that<00:01:18.070> matters<00:01:18.510> just<00:01:19.510> make<00:01:19.690> sure

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:19.870 
don't think that matters just make sure

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.600 
don't think that matters just make sure
it's<00:01:20.080> all<00:01:20.170> off<00:01:20.440> and<00:01:20.770> then<00:01:20.890> when<00:01:21.130> it's<00:01:21.250> all<00:01:21.370> off

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
it's all off and then when it's all off

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.780 
it's all off and then when it's all off
just<00:01:22.120> make<00:01:22.720> sure<00:01:22.900> you<00:01:22.990> dry<00:01:23.260> it<00:01:23.320> because<00:01:24.130> if

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
just make sure you dry it because if

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.610 
just make sure you dry it because if
it's<00:01:24.940> wet<00:01:25.180> it<00:01:25.450> probably<00:01:25.900> won't<00:01:26.050> mix<00:01:26.290> well<00:01:26.530> with

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
it's wet it probably won't mix well with

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.890 
it's wet it probably won't mix well with
the<00:01:26.680> thermal<00:01:27.040> paste<00:01:27.190> so<00:01:27.670> that's<00:01:28.540> how<00:01:28.750> it

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
the thermal paste so that's how it

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.560 
the thermal paste so that's how it
should<00:01:29.020> look<00:01:29.050> when<00:01:29.320> it's<00:01:29.440> done<00:01:29.620> probably

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
should look when it's done probably

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.300 
should look when it's done probably
brand<00:01:31.570> new<00:01:31.810> but<00:01:32.229> when<00:01:32.680> I<00:01:32.710> got<00:01:32.890> this<00:01:33.100> there

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
brand new but when I got this there

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.399 
brand new but when I got this there
actually<00:01:33.700> was<00:01:33.820> pre<00:01:34.600> applied<00:01:34.870> thermal<00:01:35.229> paste

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
actually was pre applied thermal paste

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.040 
actually was pre applied thermal paste
so<00:01:35.800> that's<00:01:36.040> about<00:01:36.430> how<00:01:36.580> it<00:01:36.760> should<00:01:36.880> look<00:01:37.060> you

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
so that's about how it should look you

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.330 
so that's about how it should look you
also<00:01:38.170> have<00:01:38.350> to<00:01:38.409> do<00:01:38.500> the<00:01:38.590> same<00:01:38.860> thing<00:01:39.100> to<00:01:39.220> the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
also have to do the same thing to the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.270 
also have to do the same thing to the
CPU<00:01:39.790> I<00:01:40.030> found<00:01:40.600> it<00:01:40.750> easier<00:01:41.350> if<00:01:41.470> you<00:01:41.680> unscrew<00:01:42.070> the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
CPU I found it easier if you unscrew the

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.800 
CPU I found it easier if you unscrew the
motherboard<00:01:42.700> itself<00:01:42.970> you<00:01:43.540> know<00:01:43.600> you<00:01:43.720> already

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
motherboard itself you know you already

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.660 
motherboard itself you know you already
have<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.530> heatsink<00:01:45.010> off<00:01:45.190> so<00:01:45.370> it's<00:01:45.520> not<00:01:45.610> that

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
have the heatsink off so it's not that

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.760 
have the heatsink off so it's not that
hard<00:01:45.970> to<00:01:46.240> you<00:01:46.930> know<00:01:46.960> take<00:01:47.170> a<00:01:47.229> few<00:01:47.440> other<00:01:47.590> parts

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
hard to you know take a few other parts

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.380 
hard to you know take a few other parts
out<00:01:47.950> to<00:01:48.070> take<00:01:48.250> it<00:01:48.370> out<00:01:48.490> so<00:01:48.790> I<00:01:48.850> find<00:01:49.240> it's<00:01:49.360> easier

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
out to take it out so I find it's easier

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.660 
out to take it out so I find it's easier
to<00:01:49.690> take<00:01:49.870> the<00:01:49.990> motherboard<00:01:50.350> out<00:01:50.440> itself<00:01:50.860> to

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
to take the motherboard out itself to

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.730 
to take the motherboard out itself to
clean<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:51.970> CPU<00:01:52.420> rather<00:01:53.020> than<00:01:53.260> just<00:01:53.530> you<00:01:53.650> know

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
clean the CPU rather than just you know

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.710 
clean the CPU rather than just you know
try<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:53.979> get<00:01:54.159> in<00:01:54.250> there<00:01:54.370> maybe<00:01:54.640> get<00:01:55.360> something

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
try to get in there maybe get something

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.440 
try to get in there maybe get something
else<00:01:55.810> wet<00:01:56.110> which<00:01:56.500> is<00:01:56.680> not<00:01:56.830> necessary<00:01:57.369> so<00:01:58.240> here

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
else wet which is not necessary so here

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.300 
else wet which is not necessary so here
I<00:01:58.479> do<00:01:58.720> spill<00:01:59.260> the<00:01:59.380> water<00:01:59.619> just<00:01:59.860> a<00:01:59.950> little<00:01:59.979> bit

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
I do spill the water just a little bit

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.460 
I do spill the water just a little bit
just<00:02:00.490> make<00:02:00.640> sure<00:02:00.970> you<00:02:01.119> that<00:02:01.810> doesn't<00:02:02.020> touch

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
just make sure you that doesn't touch

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.590 
just make sure you that doesn't touch
anything<00:02:02.890> else<00:02:03.159> on<00:02:03.520> the<00:02:03.610> motherboard<00:02:03.880> does

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
anything else on the motherboard does

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.440 
anything else on the motherboard does
that<00:02:04.720> might<00:02:04.869> damage<00:02:05.200> something<00:02:05.619> so<00:02:06.420> what<00:02:07.420> I

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
that might damage something so what I

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.389 
that might damage something so what I
did<00:02:07.540> is<00:02:07.630> I<00:02:07.690> just<00:02:07.720> folded<00:02:08.110> it<00:02:08.229> again<00:02:08.469> just<00:02:09.279> use

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
did is I just folded it again just use

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:10.919 
did is I just folded it again just use
the<00:02:09.519> tip<00:02:09.729> of<00:02:09.759> it<00:02:09.999> so<00:02:10.299> to<00:02:10.389> make<00:02:10.599> sure<00:02:10.689> I<00:02:10.749> didn't

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
the tip of it so to make sure I didn't

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.039 
the tip of it so to make sure I didn't
touch<00:02:11.109> anything<00:02:11.319> and<00:02:12.510> like<00:02:13.510> the<00:02:13.659> heatsink

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:14.049 
touch anything and like the heatsink

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:14.280 
touch anything and like the heatsink
just

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
just

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.500 
just
get<00:02:14.379> all<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.620> thermal<00:02:14.799> paste<00:02:15.069> off<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.700> you'll

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
get all the thermal paste off and you'll

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:24.209 
get all the thermal paste off and you'll
be<00:02:16.629> pretty<00:02:16.780> good<00:02:22.709> all<00:02:23.709> right<00:02:23.799> that's<00:02:23.950> how<00:02:24.040> it

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:24.219 
be pretty good all right that's how it

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.520 
be pretty good all right that's how it
should<00:02:24.250> look<00:02:24.400> when<00:02:24.519> it's<00:02:24.819> all<00:02:24.939> done<00:02:25.180> just<00:02:25.530> it

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
should look when it's all done just it

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.830 
should look when it's all done just it
should<00:02:26.680> look<00:02:26.890> fairly<00:02:27.219> brand<00:02:27.730> new<00:02:27.969> and<00:02:28.629> make

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
should look fairly brand new and make

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.140 
should look fairly brand new and make
sure<00:02:28.959> there's<00:02:29.140> no<00:02:29.200> thermal<00:02:30.069> paste<00:02:30.430> anywhere

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
sure there's no thermal paste anywhere

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.020 
sure there's no thermal paste anywhere
else<00:02:31.329> on<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.659> and<00:02:32.310> so<00:02:33.310> doesn't<00:02:33.489> overheat<00:02:33.790> or

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
else on it and so doesn't overheat or

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:41.539 
else on it and so doesn't overheat or
anything

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:44.429 

the<00:02:42.549> rule<00:02:42.760> for<00:02:42.790> applying<00:02:43.420> thermal<00:02:43.930> paste<00:02:44.139> is

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:44.439 
the rule for applying thermal paste is

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:47.339 
the rule for applying thermal paste is
usually<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:46.000> size<00:02:46.269> of<00:02:46.450> uncooked<00:02:46.900> grain<00:02:47.230> of

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
usually the size of uncooked grain of

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:51.240 
usually the size of uncooked grain of
rice<00:02:47.379> this<00:02:48.280> is<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.670> tad<00:02:49.329> too<00:02:49.780> much<00:02:49.920> but<00:02:50.920> I'm

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
rice this is a tad too much but I'm

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.420 
rice this is a tad too much but I'm
running<00:02:52.030> my<00:02:52.239> thing<00:02:52.540> at<00:02:52.689> 4.0<00:02:53.560> gigahertz<00:02:54.010> and

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
running my thing at 4.0 gigahertz and

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.940 
running my thing at 4.0 gigahertz and
it's<00:02:54.700> at<00:02:54.879> 35<00:02:55.450> degrees<00:02:55.780> so<00:02:56.620> I'm<00:02:56.680> pretty<00:02:56.829> sure

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
it's at 35 degrees so I'm pretty sure

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.629 
it's at 35 degrees so I'm pretty sure
it's<00:02:57.220> working<00:02:57.400> just<00:02:57.849> fine<00:02:58.090> so<00:02:59.519> once<00:03:00.519> you're

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:00.639 
it's working just fine so once you're

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.849 
it's working just fine so once you're
done<00:03:00.669> with<00:03:00.939> that<00:03:00.970> just<00:03:01.120> put<00:03:02.109> your<00:03:02.349> heatsink

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
done with that just put your heatsink

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.159 
done with that just put your heatsink
back<00:03:03.069> on<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.909> same<00:03:04.120> way<00:03:04.180> took<00:03:04.540> it<00:03:04.689> off<00:03:04.840> and

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:05.169 
back on the same way took it off and

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:06.599 
back on the same way took it off and
you'll<00:03:05.980> be<00:03:06.099> fine

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
you'll be fine

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.300 
you'll be fine
