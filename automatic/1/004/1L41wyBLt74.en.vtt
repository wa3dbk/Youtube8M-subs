00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.650
 Hello, welcome to the board in this class. 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.240
 I want to solve with you an issue. 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.100
 that fell on the enem of 2010 and that is 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.410
 related to Brazilian biomes 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.900
 the question says the following two 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.050
 Researchers traveled paths 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.170
 the task was marked on the map. 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.350
 analyze ecosystems and find 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.000
 problems and to propose measures of 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.409
 recovery 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.019
 the following are reproduced 

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:43.199
 from the reports 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:45.659
 of these two researchers then before 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.929
 passing through these passages we will observe 

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:50.339
 here the paths covered by each 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:54.269
 researcher 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:56.399
 the researcher who are here come 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:01:01.049
 this route 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:04.080
 already the researcher 2 has covered this 

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:07.409
 path here beauty 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.890
 Now let's move on to the 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.100
 first random excerpts from the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:17.219
 researcher's report a researcher 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.350
 one is the one who is here with the arrow that 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:22.380
 I reinforced in yellow 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.189
 he said that because of the decrease 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:29.189
 drastic plant species leaves 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.920
 system like the pines 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.600
 the blue crow is also in the process of 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.079
 extinction 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.710
 trees of tortuous logs and bark 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:43.770
 species that predominated in this ecosystem 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:46.890
 are being used in good charcoal 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.829
 thinking about these first two sections and 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.299
 observing the path traveled by 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.890
 researcher 1 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.009
 we can imagine that he is 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.289
 speaking of two different ecosystems 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.119
 in the first part we have a tip 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:06.030
 very important, it tells us that it is a 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:09.030
 drastic reduction of species and within 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.090
 of these species are the pines 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.860
 When I speak of pine trees in Brazil, you 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:20.010
 you can think of the 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:23.380
 Araucaria forest that is pine trees 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.230
 very famous here from our country 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.520
 Araucaria forest found 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:33.340
 mainly in the southern regions of the country 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.990
 do not stop at Santa Catarina on the river 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.320
 great southern 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.770
 looking now at the second stretch 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:47.170
 the researcher talks about trees 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:49.980
 tortuous logs and coarse bark 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.810
 this kind of characteristic is well 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.400
 observed in plants growing in 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:00.220
 which grow in the cerrado biome that the 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.020
 which is located here the most 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.120
 at the same time taking several 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.370
 states as state of minas gerais 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.010
 goiás tocantins 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.780
 then this researcher here has gone through 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.170
 the whole cerrado went there in the forest of 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.890
 araucarias 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.620
 now let's look at the researcher 2 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.440
 for the sections that were extracted from the 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.260
 report of this second the researcher 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.080
 he said the following of the palm trees that 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.959
 predominate in this region can be 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.760
 substances that are important for the 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.730
 regional economy 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.840
 for personal palm trees 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:45.549
 palm trees are vegetables that 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:49.660
 characterize the forest of the cocais a 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:53.830
 which is even known as the babassu 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:56.440
 also called the area of coca crops this 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:59.320
 mata is called cocais 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:03.250
 precisely because of the diversity of palm trees 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:05.950
 of babassu carnal buriti all 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.280
 exploited by communities living 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:11.950
 in these regions of the seeds of these 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.650
 palm trees are extracted eyes that are 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.140
 used in both cooking and 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.479
 industry and other parts of the 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:22.210
 plant as the leaves can be 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:25.100
 used for the production of handicrafts 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:28.610
 and even coverage 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:32.240
 of houses in the next stretch he says 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.510
 despite the area from this region where 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.940
 we found many thorny plants 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:41.900
 you can not despise your 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:46.610
 biodiversity and here is the reference 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:50.690
 map good arid region and with 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:56.930
 thorny plants in Brazil can only be 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:59.390
 the caatinga is the biome caatinga that is 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.360
 more or less located here 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:06.080
 in this region and also takes several 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:10.610
 states such as piauí ceará rio grande do 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.900
 north peruambuco sergipe bahia and minas 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.390
 general 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.240
 good what you can notice in this 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:21.230
 question is that in all of them 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:25.850
 examples were mentioned. 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:29.750
 of vegetables or through the 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:32.450
 characteristics of the environment grows and 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.220
 vegetables that are adapted to that 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:36.800
 environment and that's why we 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.310
 identify these four biomes 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.850
 different only by observing what was 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:47.140
 described on the vegetables that were 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:50.150
 there in that language and which were 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:53.710
 observed by the researchers 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:57.910
 so the question asks us to 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:59.210
 identify which biomes to which 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:03.980
 ecosystems 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:06.170
 sections 1 2 3 and 4 refer to 

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:10.130
 then we saw that one is kills of 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:14.270
 araucarias 2 is the cerrado 3 is the forest of 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:18.080
 cocais and 4 is the caatinga and the 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:21.650
 enem 2010 for this question is the letter 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:24.940
 b and it is very interesting that at the time of 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:28.810
 prove you do this characterization 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.849
 before even reading the alternatives 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:33.639
 because then you from 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:36.249
 and the chance to be confused with 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:38.110
 alternative tips 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:43.020
 Good, I hope you liked it. 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:43.020
 this resolution continues to study
