00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
 What a deputy wins is excessive 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.910
 no I do not think it's so 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.590
 I wanted Bernardo to wait for 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.900
 question whether, for example, the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.900
 private business executives 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.279
 I keep asking myself when the person 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.140
 lawyer for which a politician lives a 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.220
 franciscan life that earns a salary 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.400
 Minimum 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.900
 He never stops to think of us. 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.439
 large corporate executives who 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.880
 come pay is bump - nobody 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.010
 question but with flowering is paying and the 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.590
 corporation is paying is because for 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.680
 it is worth the settings often 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.320

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.760
 Bahia stage still talking about aic 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.860
 I'm not talking about so many others. 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.340
 business in the hay that the debt 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.610
 haiti with the bnds is a dynamic is only him 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.160
 there are other sectors of the market 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.350
 who enjoy the tax exemption given by us 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.879
 society and this society does not 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.989
 question the salary of executives and 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.710
 want to question the salary of a 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.690
 deputy 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.920
 My salary I'm going to tell you about my 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.409
 salary that only an honest person 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.270
 intellectual material when you say 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.960
 account all the party contribution 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.189
 when the income tax and such I earned 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.290
 the one who earned as a teacher 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.909
 comments practically hours that gives more 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.920
 or less about 15 thousand reais 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.049
 I so that work does not think 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.790
 that is the salary of the deputy is the 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.790
 teacher salary 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.439
 my salary taken off rebates and turns 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.390
 to turn the teacher's salary 40 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.950
 hours of exclusive dedication in the 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.759
 private university I want 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.210
 earned 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.659
 Now you 're not talking about the money 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.520
 office but it's allegedly not for me 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.509
 It is not to use my this is a team with 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.549
 the cabinet money to pay the 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.060
 office staff to make the 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.869
 policy and the use of the activities of the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.820
 cabinet 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.939
 who makes use of this money for the company as 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.860
 There is no excess, that's what you said. 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.310
 No, I do not think there's access. 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:01.530
 I even think there are excesses in some 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.240
 salaries of public servants of 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.130
 career that incorporates bonuses 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.630
 but it is their right also if people 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.190
 Did not correct this before. 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.160
 I do not know what we're going to do now. 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.950
 I think that for example in certain 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.270
 assembly today 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.520
 active not need the assembly 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.890
 a new car to each deputy 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.230
 us or even councilor or with up to 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.330
 camera of aldermen give these excesses 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.790
 It's me who is good to talk to. 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.090
 Speak openly as you do not go there has 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.090
 the smallest problem
