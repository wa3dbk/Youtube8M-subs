00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.570
 hello to all without me here for a 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.210
 new tutorial to make you a mini 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.910
 red velvet cakes I saw this picture on 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.859
 pinto stay I just hung on 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.930
 right now so just do a 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.050
 little like the macaron does two slices 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.970
 of red a slice of white and a 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.620
 small a small square of chocolate and 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.140
 you stack them on top of each other 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.489
 as you will see in the video 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.199
 so to make small circles I 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.750
 used a straw from mac do for 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.750
 the straws of the hit dice 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.429
 once everything is stacked you do 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.550
 small textures like me to do 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:06.100
 the cake effect my tool I have them 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:08.360
 bought on the shop haye creation 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.170
 anyway I'll make you a video 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.170
 of my last purchases 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.920
 so once it's done you 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.479
 can add a little dry pastel if 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.009
 you want to darken a little bit the 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.060
 cake is like you want me I 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:27.800
 I do not want to do it 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.140
 there I make the small square of chocolate 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.789
 who will go on whipped cream I put 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.580
 all that baked once it's done 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:44.780
 I put the whipped cream on it and there we go 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:47.170
 put the chocolate square up and I 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.190
 decides to add a gold leaf that 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.679
 I love gold leaf I decided 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.360
 to add a small one on the photo 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:57.610
 seems to me that they were kind of a little 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.610
 coffee bean enrobed in fire and sleep 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.119
 so here's the little tutorial 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.890
 I hope you enjoyed it do not hesitate 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.189
