00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:10.550
 qigong walking fat train 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:13.170
 winter balance is good in the head 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:16.800
 use at least not directly 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:19.740
 elements of this exercise in the warm season 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.640
 years can be very well charged 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:28.830
 energy of the earth with the help of all nha you 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.869
 a very simple thing regulates means 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.610
 sugar level i.e. lowers it 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:37.200
 when he is too tall and a little 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.629
 raising when its too little when 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.030
 too much blood sugar of course already 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.950
 not to qigong but high to lower 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.190
 can as well as organize blood 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:55.860
 pressures generally calm down all very 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:58.500
 just that's how commonplace it is here 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:03.480
 the most important energy of the earth when she 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:06.600
 rises and enters our body always 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.430
 here is and our movements they are not that 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.820
 to feed that energy inside 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.830
 do not allow the body and and feel because 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.400
 imagine that your palms and feet 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.300
 just raise up the energy of the earth and 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.100
 here look 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:26.650
 palm our points lagoon palace of labor 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:30.040
 very important points and they are gaining well 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:33.220
 force and give in this case about him all 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.760
 time watching the earth so as not to rise 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:38.590
 when 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:44.009
 and so that the hand does not rise like that 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.009
 time we ask everyone 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.610
 opposite limbs work 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.880
 the right hand is raised to raise the rights 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.880
 and year 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.140
 and all the time these movements we feel 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:13.330
 as when climbing 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:16.130
 inhale we feel as it rises 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.100
 want us the energy of the earth she is warm she 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.650
 strong on strong in the sense that she 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.100
 that pulls us down doesn't give us 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.989
 will fly to the clouds 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.819
 literally and figuratively when 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:33.380
 man is tightly bound in the winter of thought 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:37.480
 practical and the ice will not slip 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.390
 and who is so cold down the street say 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.100
 first honestly people on the street 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.200
 absolutely not interested in how you look 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.540
 and you can walk as few as you like 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:54.160
 will pay attention but if it is at all 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:57.200
 seriously, that's when you feel that 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:01.760
 body weight is transferred to one new not 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.890
 Slowly slowly what a slippery area 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.040
 they are so long you don't have to go 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.170
 kilometers away 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.690
 hands barely rise but at the same 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:16.299
 time you feel the energy of the earth goes 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.299
 in you and she keeps you she ties you 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.980
 step not see wide 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.190
 it is necessary literally leaves the distance of the foot 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.190
 forward 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.130
 and hands all the time form a circle 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.130
 between the fingertips 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.670
 one hand below old above this 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.330
 rises as if pulling out 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.330
 opposite leg probably 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.049
 and hands when it rises up she 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.049
 not like this 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:27.490
 this is such a good deal in combat is 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.070
 she floats like a wing remember palm 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.870
 all the time down so there is no loss 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:37.330
 connection by earth and try to 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:42.750
 the distance between the belly and the earth was 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:42.750
 equally here do not jump but here 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:53.229
 the main thing let's not forget one very high and 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.229
 set and go very far calmly 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.960
 on turn 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.540
 heaps 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.860
 but see the Khan see did not go inside the exhale 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:31.780
 short steps 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:33.220
 try this exercise in the forest then 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.760
 when there is an opportunity in nature 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.580
 somewhere 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:42.940
 I sometimes go for half an hour already minutes through 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:45.250
 ten sensations to us is a beautiful land 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.730
 leads yourself don't have to think where to go 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.010
 to put 

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:54.670
 you will feel it is necessary on nature 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:58.860
 for now try at home and at least a memory 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:58.860
 especially for the party
