hello today I'm going to add the curved

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.419 
hello today I'm going to add the curved
closure<00:00:09.570> rail<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.790> point<00:00:11.900> and<00:00:13.219> I'll<00:00:14.219> probably

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
closure rail and point and I'll probably

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.359 
closure rail and point and I'll probably
spare<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:14.969> a<00:00:15.000> lot<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.770> filing<00:00:16.770> footage

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
spare you a lot of the filing footage

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.370 
spare you a lot of the filing footage
here<00:00:17.670> because<00:00:18.980> once<00:00:19.980> we<00:00:20.100> get<00:00:20.220> this<00:00:21.380> roughly

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
here because once we get this roughly

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.689 
here because once we get this roughly
into<00:00:22.710> place<00:00:23.869> it's<00:00:24.869> kind<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.109> more<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.289> same

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:25.699 
into place it's kind of more the same

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.390 
into place it's kind of more the same
the<00:00:26.699> same<00:00:26.910> as<00:00:27.500> doing<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.650> is<00:00:28.890> following<00:00:29.220> this

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
the same as doing this is following this

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.170 
the same as doing this is following this
so<00:00:30.320> maybe<00:00:31.320> I'll<00:00:31.619> spare<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.550> having<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.000> wash

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
so maybe I'll spare you having to wash

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.569 
so maybe I'll spare you having to wash
that<00:00:33.649> then<00:00:34.649> again<00:00:34.800> maybe<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.100> won't

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
that then again maybe I won't

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.479 
that then again maybe I won't
so<00:00:35.820> anyway<00:00:36.690> take<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.390> take<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.140> rail<00:00:40.980> that

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
so anyway take so take this rail that

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.750 
so anyway take so take this rail that
you<00:00:41.610> cut<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.600> notched<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:44.160> we're<00:00:44.370> gonna<00:00:44.489> go

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
you cut and notched and we're gonna go

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.600 
you cut and notched and we're gonna go
ahead<00:00:45.230> and<00:00:46.730> Bend<00:00:47.899> bend<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> little<00:00:49.200> bit

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
ahead and Bend bend it a little bit

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.990 
ahead and Bend bend it a little bit
quick<00:00:50.610> little<00:00:50.879> Bend<00:00:51.059> there<00:00:51.469> probably<00:00:52.469> enough

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
quick little Bend there probably enough

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.130 
quick little Bend there probably enough
pull<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.059> Frog<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.360> that's<00:00:54.629> probably<00:00:54.930> too

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
pull the Frog and that's probably too

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.770 
pull the Frog and that's probably too
much<00:00:55.910> yeah<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.090> don't<00:00:57.210> know<00:00:57.329> maybe<00:00:57.539> it's<00:00:57.719> about

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
much yeah I don't know maybe it's about

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
rikes I'm gonna start death kind of

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.670 
rikes I'm gonna start death kind of
forming<00:01:00.480> they're<00:01:00.629> shaping<00:01:01.020> this<00:01:01.199> over<00:01:01.530> I'm

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
forming they're shaping this over I'm

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.630 
forming they're shaping this over I'm
gonna<00:01:01.890> do<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> same<00:01:02.460> way<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.699> bent<00:01:03.120> this

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
gonna do it the same way I bent this

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.260 
gonna do it the same way I bent this
curved<00:01:05.640> stock<00:01:05.970> rail<00:01:06.240> here<00:01:06.600> just<00:01:07.640> take<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.850> and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
curved stock rail here just take it and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.200 
curved stock rail here just take it and
just<00:01:09.330> start<00:01:10.820> going<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:14.119> it's<00:01:15.119> very

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
just start going like that it's very

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.160 
just start going like that it's very
gently<00:01:16.110> Bend<00:01:17.450> now<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.540> can<00:01:18.720> see<00:01:18.900> it's<00:01:19.020> already

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
gently Bend now you can see it's already

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.100 
gently Bend now you can see it's already
starting<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.650> bend<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:20.009> little<00:01:20.130> bit<00:01:21.680> form<00:01:22.680> it

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
starting to bend a little bit form it

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.640 
starting to bend a little bit form it
that's<00:01:26.420> there<00:01:27.420> already<00:01:27.960> got<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.229> little<00:01:28.380> bit<00:01:28.560> of

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
that's there already got a little bit of

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.580 
that's there already got a little bit of
a<00:01:28.710> bend<00:01:28.979> then<00:01:29.400> I'm<00:01:29.490> gonna<00:01:29.670> hold<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.060> up<00:01:30.590> against

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
a bend then I'm gonna hold it up against

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.440 
a bend then I'm gonna hold it up against
here<00:01:33.829> doesn't<00:01:34.829> look<00:01:34.890> too<00:01:35.130> bad

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.249 

okay<00:01:38.280> that's<00:01:39.280> pretty<00:01:39.460> good<00:01:40.119> Oh<00:01:40.150> check<00:01:41.140> out

okay that's pretty good Oh check out
what<00:01:41.380> the<00:01:41.470> gauge<00:01:41.909> here<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:44.170> that<00:01:45.869> check<00:01:46.869> it

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
what the gauge here like that check it

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.990 
what the gauge here like that check it
over<00:01:47.110> here<00:01:47.500> run<00:01:47.799> this<00:01:47.920> up<00:01:48.130> and<00:01:48.250> down<00:01:48.520> all<00:01:48.850> the

over here run this up and down all the
way<00:01:49.180> so<00:01:49.210> this<00:01:49.570> gets<00:01:49.810> pulled<00:01:50.110> in<00:01:50.880> let<00:01:51.880> me<00:01:52.000> do

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
way so this gets pulled in let me do

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.190 
way so this gets pulled in let me do
this<00:01:52.630> first<00:01:52.930> here<00:01:53.610> why<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.670> point<00:01:55.180> take<00:01:55.990> away

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
this first here why the point take away

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.749 
this first here why the point take away
a<00:01:56.229> little<00:01:56.350> bit<00:01:56.500> of<00:01:56.680> solder<00:01:56.920> so<00:01:57.310> I<00:01:57.340> can<00:01:57.610> that<00:01:59.759> get

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
a little bit of solder so I can that get

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:10.620 
a little bit of solder so I can that get
the<00:02:02.789> get<00:02:03.789> the<00:02:04.470> Frog<00:02:06.390> part<00:02:08.280> snug<00:02:09.330> up<00:02:10.330> against

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
the get the Frog part snug up against

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.259 
the get the Frog part snug up against
this<00:02:12.060> point<00:02:13.060> here<00:02:13.330> at<00:02:13.450> front<00:02:13.750> point<00:02:14.019> so<00:02:14.410> I<00:02:15.269> get

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.330 
this point here at front point so I get
some<00:02:16.810> of<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.989> solder<00:02:17.319> make<00:02:17.860> sure<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.160> don't

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
some of the solder make sure you don't

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.990 
some of the solder make sure you don't
file<00:02:19.180> through<00:02:19.950> copper<00:02:20.950> foil<00:02:21.250> I'm<00:02:21.700> just<00:02:21.850> gonna

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
file through copper foil I'm just gonna

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.910 
file through copper foil I'm just gonna
need<00:02:22.209> that<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:24.060> solder<00:02:25.060> this<00:02:25.269> frog<00:02:25.600> -<00:02:25.920> okay

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
so now I'm gonna do let's cut this curve

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:19.470 
so now I'm gonna do let's cut this curve
roughly<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.599> correct<00:03:16.989> length<00:03:18.329> okay<00:03:19.329> I've

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
roughly to the correct length okay I've

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.479 
roughly to the correct length okay I've
got<00:03:19.689> that<00:03:19.720> in<00:03:19.870> there<00:03:20.260> got<00:03:20.560> my<00:03:20.620> track<00:03:20.950> gauges<00:03:21.370> in

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
got that in there got my track gauges in

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.149 
got that in there got my track gauges in
there<00:03:21.640> oh<00:03:21.819> yeah<00:03:22.030> I<00:03:22.060> cut<00:03:22.360> this<00:03:22.480> one<00:03:22.629> over<00:03:22.840> long

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 
there oh yeah I cut this one over long

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:27.470 
there oh yeah I cut this one over long
all<00:03:24.159> right<00:03:24.370> Shh<00:03:24.909> yeah<00:03:25.329> go<00:03:25.870> ahead

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
all right Shh yeah go ahead

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.930 
all right Shh yeah go ahead
Point<00:03:28.480> C<00:03:29.049> go<00:03:29.799> ahead<00:03:30.069> across<00:03:30.400> here<00:03:30.700> look<00:03:30.849> at

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
Point C go ahead across here look at

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.250 
Point C go ahead across here look at
this<00:03:31.060> line<00:03:31.359> here<00:03:31.599> it's<00:03:31.750> almost<00:03:31.989> directly

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
this line here it's almost directly

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.229 
this line here it's almost directly
obviously<00:03:32.769> we<00:03:32.890> score<00:03:33.280> this<00:03:33.459> make<00:03:33.819> it<00:03:33.939> a<00:03:34.000> little

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
obviously we score this make it a little

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.830 
obviously we score this make it a little
bit<00:03:34.510> longer<00:03:35.670> then<00:03:36.670> score<00:03:37.180> it<00:03:37.269> right<00:03:37.450> there<00:03:39.840> now

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
bit longer then score it right there now

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.680 
bit longer then score it right there now
take<00:03:41.109> my<00:03:41.260> rail<00:03:41.470> nippers<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:45.239> we're<00:03:46.239> gonna<00:03:46.359> cut

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
take my rail nippers and we're gonna cut

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:59.759 
take my rail nippers and we're gonna cut
this<00:03:46.870> thing<00:03:47.170> short<00:03:56.760> now<00:03:57.810> got<00:03:58.810> this<00:03:59.109> roughly

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
this thing short now got this roughly

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.360 
this thing short now got this roughly
where<00:03:59.920> I<00:03:59.950> want<00:04:00.280> it<00:04:00.340> to<00:04:00.400> be<00:04:00.700> I<00:04:01.920> can<00:04:02.920> always<00:04:03.069> nip<00:04:03.340> a

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
where I want it to be I can always nip a

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.089 
where I want it to be I can always nip a
little<00:04:03.639> bit<00:04:03.760> more<00:04:03.970> off<00:04:04.209> after<00:04:04.840> I've<00:04:05.099> filed

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
little bit more off after I've filed

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.710 
little bit more off after I've filed
file<00:04:07.060> this<00:04:07.299> side<00:04:07.540> flat<00:04:07.870> here<00:04:08.260> and<00:04:09.720> yeah

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
file this side flat here and yeah

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.110 
file this side flat here and yeah
essentially<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.530> same<00:04:11.919> principles<00:04:12.459> apply<00:04:12.549> as

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
essentially the same principles apply as

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.150 
essentially the same principles apply as
a<00:04:13.150> filing<00:04:13.959> here<00:04:14.370> I'm<00:04:15.370> gonna<00:04:15.519> take<00:04:16.919> the<00:04:17.919> base

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
a filing here I'm gonna take the base

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.300 
a filing here I'm gonna take the base
off<00:04:18.489> and<00:04:18.880> the<00:04:18.970> rail<00:04:19.150> head<00:04:19.479> on<00:04:20.440> this<00:04:20.739> side<00:04:21.039> and

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
off and the rail head on this side and

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.080 
off and the rail head on this side and
then<00:04:21.820> just<00:04:22.210> file<00:04:22.479> off<00:04:23.400> the<00:04:24.400> rail<00:04:24.580> head<00:04:24.820> on<00:04:24.940> this

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
then just file off the rail head on this

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.060 
then just file off the rail head on this
side<00:04:25.360> and<00:04:25.660> get<00:04:25.840> to<00:04:26.410> get<00:04:26.470> your<00:04:26.620> point

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
side and get to get your point

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:34.350 
side and get to get your point
so<00:04:27.570> go<00:04:28.570> ahead<00:04:28.960> and<00:04:30.419> break<00:04:31.419> out<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:31.840> Vice<00:04:33.360> do

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
so go ahead and break out the Vice do

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.250 
so go ahead and break out the Vice do
some<00:04:35.849> do<00:04:36.849> some<00:04:37.090> filing<00:04:37.419> make<00:04:37.840> sure<00:04:38.050> I<00:04:38.080> have

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
some do some filing make sure I have

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.890 
some do some filing make sure I have
this<00:04:38.349> oriented<00:04:39.010> right<00:04:39.280> in<00:04:39.880> the<00:04:40.090> vase<00:04:40.330> I<00:04:40.690> don't

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
this oriented right in the vase I don't

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.020 
this oriented right in the vase I don't
file<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:42.010> wrong<00:04:42.190> size

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
file the wrong size

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.810 
file the wrong size
but<00:04:43.330> yeah<00:04:43.690> Oliver<00:04:44.260> on<00:04:44.349> side<00:04:44.620> I<00:04:44.979> can<00:04:45.699> talk<00:04:47.820> learn

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
but yeah Oliver on side I can talk learn

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:52.230 
but yeah Oliver on side I can talk learn
how<00:04:48.940> to<00:04:49.090> talk<00:04:50.280> that's<00:04:51.280> fine<00:04:51.550> and<00:04:51.729> clamping<00:04:52.120> it

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
how to talk that's fine and clamping it

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.750 
how to talk that's fine and clamping it
in<00:04:52.360> the<00:04:52.449> vase<00:04:52.659> and<00:04:53.020> I<00:04:53.110> put<00:04:53.349> my<00:04:53.500> curvature<00:04:54.400> in<00:04:54.550> a

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
in the vase and I put my curvature in a

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.779 
in the vase and I put my curvature in a
rough<00:04:54.940> curvature<00:04:55.510> and<00:04:55.690> just<00:04:56.310> get<00:04:57.310> the<00:04:57.460> correct

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
rough curvature and just get the correct

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:59.790 
rough curvature and just get the correct
length<00:04:58.060> and<00:04:58.449> get<00:04:58.570> a<00:04:58.599> ballpark<00:04:58.840> idea<00:04:59.289> where<00:04:59.710> I'm

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
length and get a ballpark idea where I'm

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.040 
length and get a ballpark idea where I'm
gonna<00:05:00.010> where<00:05:00.849> I'm<00:05:00.940> going<00:05:01.210> from<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:01.690> now<00:05:01.810> it's

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
gonna where I'm going from and now it's

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.469 
gonna where I'm going from and now it's
gonna<00:05:02.199> the<00:05:02.889> process<00:05:03.250> of<00:05:03.370> filing<00:05:03.639> this<00:05:04.000> part<00:05:04.360> is

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
gonna the process of filing this part is

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.029 
gonna the process of filing this part is
gonna<00:05:04.599> actually<00:05:04.780> flatten<00:05:05.409> this<00:05:05.560> out<00:05:05.770> a<00:05:05.830> little

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:06.039 
gonna actually flatten this out a little

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:06.960 
gonna actually flatten this out a little
but<00:05:06.190> that's<00:05:06.370> not<00:05:06.520> a<00:05:06.550> big<00:05:06.760> deal

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
but that's not a big deal

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.300 
but that's not a big deal
you<00:05:07.180> can<00:05:07.300> always<00:05:07.449> uh<00:05:07.949> rebend<00:05:08.949> it<00:05:10.500> let<00:05:11.500> me<00:05:11.530> zoom

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
you can always uh rebend it let me zoom

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.840 
you can always uh rebend it let me zoom
in

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
in

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.230 
in
here<00:05:14.850> we<00:05:14.940> go<00:05:16.670> all<00:05:17.670> right

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
here we go all right

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.540 
here we go all right
hmm<00:05:18.810> start<00:05:19.770> filing<00:05:20.070> two<00:05:21.030> inches<00:05:22.550> hopefully

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:23.550 
hmm start filing two inches hopefully

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.890 
hmm start filing two inches hopefully
two<00:05:23.730> inches<00:05:25.970> I'm<00:05:26.970> just<00:05:27.090> following<00:05:27.510> a<00:05:27.570> bit<00:05:27.750> of

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
two inches I'm just following a bit of

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.720 
two inches I'm just following a bit of
an<00:05:28.020> angle<00:05:29.300> like<00:05:30.300> this<00:05:31.100> so<00:05:32.100> if<00:05:32.160> I<00:05:32.220> follow<00:05:32.430> too

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
an angle like this so if I follow too

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.430 
an angle like this so if I follow too
much<00:05:32.970> like<00:05:33.240> this<00:05:33.450> sign<00:05:33.840> attends<00:05:34.170> has<00:05:34.410> a

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 
much like this sign attends has a

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:36.170 
much like this sign attends has a
tendency<00:05:34.860> to<00:05:34.950> pop<00:05:35.130> out<00:05:35.370> of<00:05:35.400> the<00:05:35.580> groove

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
tendency to pop out of the groove

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.390 
tendency to pop out of the groove
you<00:05:37.140> see<00:05:37.290> wouldn't<00:05:37.560> clamp<00:05:37.830> this<00:05:38.040> a<00:05:38.130> little<00:05:38.310> bit

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
you see wouldn't clamp this a little bit

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:46.060 
you see wouldn't clamp this a little bit
more<00:05:38.660> okay<00:05:39.660> so<00:05:44.480> yeah

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
more okay so yeah

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.610 
more okay so yeah
filing<00:05:47.070> a<00:05:47.160> little<00:05:47.400> bit<00:05:47.630> upwards<00:05:48.630> and<00:05:48.960> an<00:05:49.260> angle

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
filing a little bit upwards and an angle

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:55.790 
filing a little bit upwards and an angle
here<00:05:49.920> so<00:05:53.570> Burton<00:05:54.570> we<00:05:54.660> file<00:05:54.960> off<00:05:55.290> that<00:05:55.680> we

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
here so Burton we file off that we

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.550 
here so Burton we file off that we
follow<00:05:56.070> up<00:05:56.130> more<00:05:56.430> of<00:05:56.490> the<00:05:56.670> bass<00:05:57.200> on<00:05:58.200> the<00:05:58.320> side
