all right check out today's you have the
you<00:00:03.990> mark<00:00:04.230> to<00:00:04.770> go<00:00:04.980> it's<00:00:05.490> all<00:00:05.670> hand<00:00:05.940> marker<00:00:06.330> this

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
you mark to go it's all hand marker this

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.660 
you mark to go it's all hand marker this
is<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:06.990> permanent<00:00:07.290> and<00:00:07.620> water<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.220> UV

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
is a permanent and water and UV

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.459 
is a permanent and water and UV
resistant<00:00:09.240> paint<00:00:09.420> marker<00:00:09.809> it's<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.170> solid

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
resistant paint marker it's a solid

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.350 
resistant paint marker it's a solid
paint<00:00:10.679> stick<00:00:10.980> so<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.639> gives<00:00:11.849> almost<00:00:12.179> like<00:00:12.300> a

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
paint stick so it gives almost like a

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.600 
paint stick so it gives almost like a
crayon<00:00:13.049> type<00:00:13.320> look<00:00:13.710> when<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.040> do<00:00:14.219> write<00:00:14.429> with

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
crayon type look when you do write with

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.060 
crayon type look when you do write with
it<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:15.210> prefers<00:00:15.570> kind<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:15.990> rough<00:00:16.260> surfaces<00:00:16.800> and

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
it it prefers kind of rough surfaces and

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.769 
it it prefers kind of rough surfaces and
it<00:00:17.160> works<00:00:17.310> great<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.789> pretty<00:00:18.449> much<00:00:18.570> any

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
it works great on pretty much any

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.179 
it works great on pretty much any
surface<00:00:18.990> as<00:00:19.350> long<00:00:19.619> as<00:00:19.740> you<00:00:19.830> get<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.070> going

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
surface as long as you get it going

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.670 
surface as long as you get it going
right<00:00:20.630> these<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.810> mark<00:00:22.020> paint<00:00:22.230> markers<00:00:22.529> are

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
right these you mark paint markers are

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.029 
right these you mark paint markers are
similar<00:00:23.160> to<00:00:23.460> mark<00:00:24.330> out<00:00:24.539> B<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.199> it's<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.740> dry

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
similar to mark out B in that it's a dry

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.099 
similar to mark out B in that it's a dry
paint<00:00:26.400> stick<00:00:26.699> compared<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.359> something<00:00:27.869> more

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
paint stick compared to something more

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.730 
paint stick compared to something more
wet<00:00:28.410> of<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:29.090> Sakura<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.720> these<00:00:31.320> are<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.560> little

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
wet of a Sakura so these are a little

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.110 
wet of a Sakura so these are a little
bit<00:00:31.920> drier<00:00:32.160> you're<00:00:32.489> not<00:00:32.610> going<00:00:32.759> to<00:00:32.820> be<00:00:32.910> able<00:00:33.000> to

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
bit drier you're not going to be able to

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.030 
bit drier you're not going to be able to
split<00:00:33.480> them<00:00:33.630> as<00:00:33.840> easily<00:00:34.200> if<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.559> want<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:34.920> do

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
split them as easily if you want to do

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.950 
split them as easily if you want to do
that<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.579> actually<00:00:35.969> just<00:00:36.270> released<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.660> video<00:00:36.809> on

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
that I actually just released a video on

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.959 
that I actually just released a video on
how<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.320> do<00:00:37.530> that<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:38.160> can<00:00:38.340> try<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.610> it's

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
how to do that you can try it it's

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.760 
how to do that you can try it it's
definitely<00:00:39.690> preferred<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.140> use<00:00:40.320> more<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.649> a

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
definitely preferred to use more of a

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.920 
definitely preferred to use more of a
wet<00:00:40.950> paint<00:00:41.160> stick<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.610> like<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.000> use<00:00:42.360> dry<00:00:42.629> paint

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
wet paint stick I like to use dry paint

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.770 
wet paint stick I like to use dry paint
sticks<00:00:43.230> just<00:00:43.410> as<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:43.980> they<00:00:44.789> work<00:00:44.969> great<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.390> if

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
sticks just as is they work great and if

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.690 
sticks just as is they work great and if
you<00:00:45.960> kind<00:00:46.230> of<00:00:46.289> get<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> feeling<00:00:46.890> for<00:00:47.039> using<00:00:47.550> them

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
you kind of get a feeling for using them

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.430 
you kind of get a feeling for using them
you<00:00:48.149> can<00:00:48.300> actually<00:00:48.450> get<00:00:48.690> them<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.840> last<00:00:49.079> really

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
you can actually get them to last really

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.340 
you can actually get them to last really
long<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.820> know<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.149> dries<00:00:51.390> pretty<00:00:52.199> much

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
long and you know it dries pretty much

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.100 
long and you know it dries pretty much
on<00:00:52.530> contact<00:00:53.100> as<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.640> are<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.090> dry<00:00:54.840> paint

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
on contact as it is are you dry paint

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.619 
on contact as it is are you dry paint
stick<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.800> that's<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.610> bonus<00:00:56.940> there's<00:00:57.149> not<00:00:57.480> much

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
stick so that's a bonus there's not much

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.479 
stick so that's a bonus there's not much
dry<00:00:57.899> time<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.440> it<00:00:58.890> gives<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.100> kind<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.309> cool

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
dry time and it gives a kind of cool

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.470 
dry time and it gives a kind of cool
unique<00:00:59.879> effect<00:01:00.210> for<00:01:00.480> some<00:01:00.690> harder<00:01:00.960> surfaces

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
unique effect for some harder surfaces

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.820 
unique effect for some harder surfaces
so<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.600> first<00:01:03.809> surface<00:01:04.019> I've<00:01:04.290> been<00:01:04.409> testing

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
so the first surface I've been testing

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.710 
so the first surface I've been testing
out<00:01:04.949> on<00:01:05.129> was<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.670> simple<00:01:06.000> painted<00:01:06.360> surface

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
out on was just a simple painted surface

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.750 
out on was just a simple painted surface
it's<00:01:06.960> pretty<00:01:07.170> smooth<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:08.130> isn't<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
it's pretty smooth so it isn't the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.880 
it's pretty smooth so it isn't the
preferred<00:01:09.299> surface<00:01:09.990> for<00:01:10.200> these<00:01:10.409> markers

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
preferred surface for these markers

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.980 
preferred surface for these markers
these<00:01:11.460> markers<00:01:11.820> really<00:01:12.119> do<00:01:12.330> enjoy<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.720> rough

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
these markers really do enjoy a rough

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.469 
these markers really do enjoy a rough
surface<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.680> I'd<00:01:14.220> say<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:15.090> works<00:01:15.270> so

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
surface and I'd say that it works so

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.780 
surface and I'd say that it works so
well<00:01:15.509> on<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.080> smooth<00:01:16.320> surface<00:01:16.640> these<00:01:17.640> are

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
well on the smooth surface these are

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.280 
well on the smooth surface these are
more<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.119> street<00:01:18.390> sign<00:01:18.659> kind<00:01:18.930> of<00:01:19.020> style

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
more like a street sign kind of style

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.580 
more like a street sign kind of style
surface<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.580> at<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.150> same<00:01:21.299> time<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.960> tag<00:01:22.290> was

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
surface but at the same time the tag was

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
surface but at the same time the tag was
a<00:01:22.650> little<00:01:23.070> choppy

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
a little choppy

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.760 
a little choppy
there<00:01:24.090> was<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.240> there<00:01:24.600> wasn't<00:01:24.840> as<00:01:24.930> much<00:01:25.110> paint

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
there was a there wasn't as much paint

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.969 
there was a there wasn't as much paint
getting<00:01:26.100> broken<00:01:26.939> off<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.330> tip<00:01:27.570> into<00:01:28.380> each<00:01:28.650> tag

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
getting broken off the tip into each tag

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.090 
getting broken off the tip into each tag
so<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.850> being<00:01:30.030> said<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:31.079> was<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.320> little<00:01:31.650> kind

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
so that being said it was a little kind

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.670 
so that being said it was a little kind
of<00:01:32.189> choppy<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.729> tag<00:01:32.939> but<00:01:33.270> no<00:01:34.229> getting<00:01:34.500> into

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
of choppy of a tag but no getting into

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.319 
of choppy of a tag but no getting into
some<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.040> more<00:01:35.220> rough<00:01:35.430> surfaces<00:01:35.970> you'll

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
some of the more rough surfaces you'll

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.179 
some of the more rough surfaces you'll
see<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.840> really<00:01:37.259> kind<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.530> smoothes<00:01:37.799> out<00:01:37.979> and

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
see it really kind of smoothes out and

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.710 
see it really kind of smoothes out and
you<00:01:38.280> can<00:01:38.369> still<00:01:38.579> get<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> nice<00:01:38.939> readable

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
you can still get a nice readable

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.830 
you can still get a nice readable
legible<00:01:40.140> tag<00:01:41.060> moving<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.270> next<00:01:42.450> surface

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
legible tag moving to the next surface

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.600 
legible tag moving to the next surface
we<00:01:42.990> have<00:01:43.020> wood<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.860> markers<00:01:44.189> performed

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
we have wood the markers performed

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.280 
we have wood the markers performed
awesome<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.299> these<00:01:45.509> it's<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.840> pretty<00:01:46.049> straight

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
awesome on these it's a pretty straight

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.800 
awesome on these it's a pretty straight
forward<00:01:46.320> as<00:01:47.250> far<00:01:47.579> as<00:01:47.729> how<00:01:47.909> they<00:01:48.060> work<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
forward as far as how they work the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.719 
forward as far as how they work the
marker<00:01:49.140> was<00:01:49.320> able<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.619> break<00:01:50.100> off<00:01:50.310> at<00:01:50.579> an

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
marker was able to break off at an

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.670 
marker was able to break off at an
efficient<00:01:51.149> rate<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.630> there<00:01:51.899> was<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.079> nice<00:01:52.259> clean

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
efficient rate so there was a nice clean

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.440 
efficient rate so there was a nice clean
and<00:01:52.979> consistent<00:01:53.579> line<00:01:53.729> for<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.000> most<00:01:54.210> part

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
and consistent line for the most part

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.780 
and consistent line for the most part
and<00:01:54.689> all<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.200> colors<00:01:55.560> held<00:01:55.770> up<00:01:55.920> pretty<00:01:56.130> true

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
and all the colors held up pretty true

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.670 
and all the colors held up pretty true
the<00:01:57.180> yellow<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.810> was<00:01:57.930> obviously<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.469> light

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
the yellow it was obviously a light

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.289 
the yellow it was obviously a light
surface<00:01:58.890> on<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.280> light<00:01:59.520> color<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.090> couldn't

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
surface on a light color so you couldn't

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.450 
surface on a light color so you couldn't
really<00:02:00.420> see<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.750> too<00:02:00.780> well<00:02:00.960> but<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.430> end

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
really see it too well but in the end

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.969 
really see it too well but in the end
all<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.090> markers<00:02:03.390> performed<00:02:03.810> great<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.860> the

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
all the markers performed great so the

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.440 
all the markers performed great so the
cardboard<00:02:05.399> was<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> little<00:02:05.850> bit<00:02:05.939> smoother<00:02:06.210> than

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
cardboard was a little bit smoother than

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.749 
cardboard was a little bit smoother than
wood<00:02:06.630> but<00:02:06.840> not<00:02:06.990> quite<00:02:07.320> as<00:02:07.500> rough<00:02:08.250> as<00:02:08.429> like<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
wood but not quite as rough as like the

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.609 
wood but not quite as rough as like the
brick<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.119> I'll<00:02:09.209> be<00:02:09.330> testing<00:02:09.750> later<00:02:09.899> but

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
brick that I'll be testing later but

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.070 
brick that I'll be testing later but
overall<00:02:10.979> they<00:02:11.250> definitely<00:02:11.489> worked

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
overall they definitely worked

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.650 
overall they definitely worked
all<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.650> colors<00:02:12.980> held<00:02:13.820> up<00:02:13.940> true<00:02:14.240> and<00:02:14.570> I

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
all the colors held up true and I

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.360 
all the colors held up true and I
actually<00:02:14.870> did<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.260> dark<00:02:15.470> surface<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:16.130> test

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
actually did the dark surface to test

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.700 
actually did the dark surface to test
out<00:02:16.550> you<00:02:17.030> know<00:02:17.120> how<00:02:17.300> well<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.750> colors<00:02:18.320> hold<00:02:18.530> up

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
out you know how well the colors hold up

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:21.280 
out you know how well the colors hold up
if<00:02:18.890> it's<00:02:19.520> not<00:02:19.700> it<00:02:20.000> just<00:02:20.030> whiter<00:02:20.600> just<00:02:21.020> a<00:02:21.110> light

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
if it's not it just whiter just a light

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.530 
if it's not it just whiter just a light
color<00:02:21.560> so<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:22.130> was<00:02:22.550> very<00:02:22.610> happy<00:02:22.970> with<00:02:23.180> all<00:02:23.330> the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
color so I was very happy with all the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.720 
color so I was very happy with all the
results<00:02:24.020> the<00:02:24.560> white<00:02:24.770> marker<00:02:25.130> in<00:02:25.220> itself<00:02:25.490> it

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
results the white marker in itself it

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.450 
results the white marker in itself it
was<00:02:25.850> a<00:02:25.910> really<00:02:26.870> really<00:02:26.990> nice<00:02:27.290> result<00:02:27.710> now<00:02:27.890> you

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
was a really really nice result now you

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.860 
was a really really nice result now you
can<00:02:28.640> see<00:02:28.820> I've<00:02:28.940> been<00:02:28.970> using<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.600> little

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
can see I've been using that a little

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.010 
can see I've been using that a little
bit<00:02:29.990> so<00:02:30.320> it<00:02:30.770> was<00:02:30.980> broken<00:02:31.280> down<00:02:31.400> and<00:02:31.730> not<00:02:32.480> in<00:02:32.780> its

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
bit so it was broken down and not in its

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.920 
bit so it was broken down and not in its
full<00:02:33.320> size<00:02:33.590> but<00:02:34.430> overall<00:02:35.150> I<00:02:35.240> really<00:02:35.570> liked<00:02:35.780> how

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
full size but overall I really liked how

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.030 
full size but overall I really liked how
it<00:02:35.960> worked<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.470> that's<00:02:36.590> just<00:02:36.740> to<00:02:36.860> show

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
it worked and that's just to show

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.190 
it worked and that's just to show
another<00:02:37.280> kind<00:02:37.610> of<00:02:37.700> semi<00:02:38.390> rough<00:02:38.600> surface<00:02:39.020> and

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
another kind of semi rough surface and

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.320 
another kind of semi rough surface and
how<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.380> marker<00:02:39.860> works<00:02:40.430> a<00:02:40.700> lot<00:02:40.850> better<00:02:41.090> than

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
how the marker works a lot better than

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.630 
how the marker works a lot better than
just<00:02:41.630> a<00:02:41.780> smooth<00:02:42.050> surface<00:02:42.320> it<00:02:42.740> really<00:02:43.340> likes<00:02:43.520> a

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
just a smooth surface it really likes a

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.230 
just a smooth surface it really likes a
nice<00:02:43.790> little<00:02:44.060> bit<00:02:44.270> of<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.420> roughed-up<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:47.180> I'm

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
nice little bit of a roughed-up so I'm

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.640 
nice little bit of a roughed-up so I'm
gonna<00:02:47.360> contradict<00:02:47.900> myself<00:02:48.050> a<00:02:48.320> little<00:02:48.470> bit

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
gonna contradict myself a little bit

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.040 
gonna contradict myself a little bit
here<00:02:48.890> with<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.400> brick<00:02:49.610> surface<00:02:49.880> it<00:02:50.360> was<00:02:50.630> rough

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
here with the brick surface it was rough

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.990 
here with the brick surface it was rough
and<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.590> paint<00:02:51.890> was<00:02:52.040> able<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.400> break<00:02:52.670> off<00:02:52.880> the

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
and the paint was able to break off the

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.810 
and the paint was able to break off the
marker<00:02:53.300> and<00:02:53.480> write<00:02:53.660> as<00:02:53.870> it<00:02:54.650> would<00:02:54.920> but<00:02:55.400> it<00:02:55.670> was

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
marker and write as it would but it was

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.330 
marker and write as it would but it was
a<00:02:56.090> little<00:02:56.360> bit<00:02:56.570> too<00:02:56.810> I<00:02:57.140> guess<00:02:57.230> porous<00:02:57.890> in<00:02:58.130> that

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
a little bit too I guess porous in that

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.970 
a little bit too I guess porous in that
there<00:02:59.330> was<00:02:59.450> obviously<00:03:00.200> spaces<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:00.800> gaps

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
there was obviously spaces and gaps

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.240 
there was obviously spaces and gaps
between<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.880> brick<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:03.140> next<00:03:04.100> little

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
between the brick and the next little

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.220 
between the brick and the next little
piece<00:03:04.340> so<00:03:04.760> there's<00:03:04.970> little<00:03:05.570> air<00:03:05.720> holes<00:03:05.959> and<00:03:06.170> a

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
piece so there's little air holes and a

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.780 
piece so there's little air holes and a
little<00:03:06.470> kind<00:03:06.920> of<00:03:06.950> cracking<00:03:07.370> and<00:03:07.520> stuff<00:03:07.760> that

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
little kind of cracking and stuff that

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.270 
little kind of cracking and stuff that
is<00:03:08.180> part<00:03:08.750> of<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.959> brick<00:03:09.170> surface<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:09.950> you're

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
is part of the brick surface and you're

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.760 
is part of the brick surface and you're
gonna<00:03:10.370> see<00:03:10.640> that<00:03:10.670> it<00:03:11.240> doesn't<00:03:11.630> stick<00:03:11.930> to<00:03:12.500> those

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
gonna see that it doesn't stick to those

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.520 
gonna see that it doesn't stick to those
pieces<00:03:13.100> as<00:03:13.430> well<00:03:13.880> when<00:03:14.540> you're<00:03:14.660> writing<00:03:14.840> you

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
pieces as well when you're writing you
