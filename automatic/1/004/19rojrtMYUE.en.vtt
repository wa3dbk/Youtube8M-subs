card<00:01:23.150> this<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.479> great<00:01:25.049> tip<00:01:25.700> why<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.970> a

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
card this is a great tip why is that a

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.460 
card this is a great tip why is that a
great<00:01:27.509> tip<00:01:28.400> it's<00:01:29.400> because<00:01:29.939> when<00:01:30.810> we<00:01:31.020> start

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
great tip it's because when we start

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.429 
great tip it's because when we start
spending<00:01:31.890> cash<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.570> actually<00:01:33.810> starts

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
spending cash and it actually starts

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.190 
spending cash and it actually starts
leaving<00:01:34.829> our<00:01:35.220> hands<00:01:35.670> when<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:36.270> pay<00:01:36.600> for<00:01:36.960> things

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
leaving our hands when we pay for things

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.830 
leaving our hands when we pay for things
it<00:01:37.829> seems<00:01:38.340> like<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.909> little<00:01:39.270> bit<00:01:39.420> harder

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
it seems like it's a little bit harder

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.649

let<00:01:40.110> go<00:01:40.470> of<00:01:40.740> some<00:01:41.070> stuff<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.509> actually

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
let go of some stuff that I can actually

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.380 
let go of some stuff that I can actually
feel<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.590> my<00:01:43.799> hands<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.369> know<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:45.060> amount
