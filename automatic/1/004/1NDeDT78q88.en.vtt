three settings on your camera for

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:17.740 
three settings on your camera for

thousandth of a second be careful with
some<00:01:17.330> of<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.510> makes<00:01:17.750> as<00:01:17.990> they<00:01:18.200> can<00:01:18.500> be<00:01:18.650> quite

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
some of the makes as they can be quite

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.030 
some of the makes as they can be quite
slow<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:19.520> put<00:01:19.729> caused<00:01:20.000> you<00:01:20.180> a<00:01:20.210> few<00:01:20.510> problems

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
slow and put caused you a few problems

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.800 
slow and put caused you a few problems
also<00:01:22.040> remember<00:01:22.820> that<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.120> lower<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.510> power

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
also remember that the lower the power

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.870 
also remember that the lower the power
settings<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:24.799> slower<00:01:25.190> the<00:01:25.430> flash<00:01:25.640> duration

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
settings the slower the flash duration

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.899 
settings the slower the flash duration
will<00:01:26.360> be<00:01:26.500> this<00:01:27.500> is<00:01:27.560> opposite<00:01:28.280> to<00:01:28.490> the<00:01:28.580> way<00:01:28.729> an

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
will be this is opposite to the way an

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.740 
will be this is opposite to the way an
on-camera<00:01:29.450> flash<00:01:29.600> works<00:01:30.790> okay<00:01:31.790> so<00:01:32.060> this<00:01:32.510> just

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
on-camera flash works okay so this just

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.600 
on-camera flash works okay so this just
leaves<00:01:33.020> us<00:01:33.229> with<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:33.530> lens<00:01:33.740> aperture<00:01:34.070> to<00:01:34.340> find

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610 
leaves us with the lens aperture to find

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.210 
leaves us with the lens aperture to find
and<00:01:34.909> this<00:01:35.479> is<00:01:35.690> where<00:01:35.869> we<00:01:36.020> need<00:01:36.140> a<00:01:36.200> flash<00:01:36.500> meter

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220

when you take a meter reading through
your<00:01:41.600> camera<00:01:42.200> it's<00:01:42.650> what's<00:01:42.950> called<00:01:43.190> a

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
your camera it's what's called a

reflected light reading the meter is

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.530 
reflected light reading the meter is

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
sky is included likewise if I were to

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.050

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
take a reflected light reading from my

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.360 
take a reflected light reading from my
handheld<00:02:11.389> meter<00:02:11.749> from<00:02:12.019> actually<00:02:12.469> wearing<00:02:13.249> a

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
handheld meter from actually wearing a

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.220 
handheld meter from actually wearing a

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
white top against a light background

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.309 
white top against a light background
and<00:02:15.440> then<00:02:16.010> set<00:02:16.310> that<00:02:16.340> on<00:02:16.730> my<00:02:16.879> camera<00:02:17.360> I'm<00:02:17.629> sure

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
and then set that on my camera I'm sure

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.339 
and then set that on my camera I'm sure
I<00:02:18.349> would<00:02:18.650> get<00:02:18.800> some<00:02:19.010> well<00:02:19.190> expose<00:02:19.640> shots<00:02:20.349> but

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
I would get some well expose shots but

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.380 
I would get some well expose shots but
if<00:02:21.470> we<00:02:21.620> then<00:02:21.650> asked<00:02:22.190> Ashley<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.640> change<00:02:23.000> and

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
if we then asked Ashley to change and

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.940 
if we then asked Ashley to change and
she<00:02:23.510> puts<00:02:23.720> on<00:02:23.810> a<00:02:23.870> black<00:02:24.140> top<00:02:24.500> when<00:02:24.680> we<00:02:24.769> use<00:02:24.920> a

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
she puts on a black top when we use a

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.949 
she puts on a black top when we use a
black<00:02:25.250> background<00:02:25.519> there<00:02:26.480> would<00:02:26.599> be<00:02:26.629> less

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
black background there would be less

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.280 
black background there would be less
light<00:02:27.319> reflected<00:02:28.010> back<00:02:28.250> to<00:02:28.430> my<00:02:28.580> camera<00:02:28.870> if<00:02:29.870> I

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
light reflected back to my camera if I

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.600 
light reflected back to my camera if I
took<00:02:30.349> another<00:02:30.709> reading<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.340> would<00:02:31.459> be

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
took another reading it would be

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.699 
took another reading it would be
different<00:02:32.000> from<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.299> first<00:02:32.709> now

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
different from the first now

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.380 
different from the first now
individually<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.580> pictures<00:02:34.970> were<00:02:35.090> probably

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
individually the pictures were probably

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.869 
individually the pictures were probably
like<00:02:35.870> okay<00:02:36.260> but<00:02:37.129> when<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.340> put<00:02:37.700> them

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
like okay but when you put them

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.940 
like okay but when you put them
side-by-side<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:39.110> skin<00:02:39.349> tones<00:02:39.620> would<00:02:39.830> be

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
side-by-side the skin tones would be

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.880 
side-by-side the skin tones would be
different<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.750> much<00:02:41.750> more<00:02:41.989> accurate<00:02:42.560> way<00:02:42.590> of

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
different a much more accurate way of

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.130 
different a much more accurate way of
taking<00:02:43.129> a<00:02:43.370> reading<00:02:43.760> in<00:02:43.849> the<00:02:43.940> studio<00:02:44.329> is<00:02:44.780> to

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
taking a reading in the studio is to

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.930 
taking a reading in the studio is to
read<00:02:45.349> the<00:02:45.560> light<00:02:45.739> that's<00:02:45.980> actually<00:02:46.549> falling

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
read the light that's actually falling

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.270 
read the light that's actually falling
onto<00:02:47.060> my<00:02:47.209> subject<00:02:47.810> this<00:02:48.680> is<00:02:48.860> called<00:02:49.129> an

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
onto my subject this is called an

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.180 
onto my subject this is called an
incident<00:02:49.849> light<00:02:50.090> reading<00:02:50.390> if<00:02:51.349> we<00:02:51.440> using<00:02:51.980> just

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
incident light reading if we using just

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.099 
incident light reading if we using just
one<00:02:52.400> light<00:02:52.640> on<00:02:52.670> our<00:02:53.000> subject<00:02:53.450> like<00:02:53.569> this<00:02:53.900> I

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
one light on our subject like this I

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.470 
one light on our subject like this I
just<00:02:54.379> point<00:02:55.069> my<00:02:55.250> meter<00:02:55.489> with<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.090> diffuser

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
just point my meter with the diffuser

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.050 
just point my meter with the diffuser
cone<00:02:56.780> in<00:02:56.959> place<00:02:57.200> at<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.220> light<00:02:58.400> and<00:02:58.700> hey

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
cone in place at the light and hey

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.119 
cone in place at the light and hey
presto<00:02:59.090> I<00:02:59.810> get<00:03:00.049> an<00:03:00.140> accurate<00:03:00.590> reading

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
presto I get an accurate reading

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.520 
presto I get an accurate reading

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
correct exposure let's say I want to

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.400 
correct exposure let's say I want to
shoot<00:03:12.620> at<00:03:12.769> f8<00:03:13.129> at<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.329> moment<00:03:14.780> my<00:03:14.959> meter<00:03:15.200> is

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
shoot at f8 at the moment my meter is

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.380 
shoot at f8 at the moment my meter is
telling<00:03:15.799> me<00:03:15.920> that<00:03:16.099> the<00:03:16.250> correct<00:03:16.579> exposure<00:03:17.000> is

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
telling me that the correct exposure is

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.670 
telling me that the correct exposure is
5.6<00:03:18.109> and<00:03:18.590> 3/10<00:03:19.459> so<00:03:20.209> I'm<00:03:20.329> 7/10<00:03:21.200> of<00:03:21.290> a<00:03:21.410> stop
