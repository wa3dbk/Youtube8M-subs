00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.050
 more comfortable position I've already put on 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.880

 the new tutorial 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.380

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.560

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:32.400
 we catch we take one this water will be in 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.160
 the woods and we make ourselves a table 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.590
 kraft 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.740
 we put it out there that comes in handy and 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.740
 we make a wooden peak if you do not know 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.160
 how the wooden beak is made 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.000
 you know what it is 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:50.430
 actively as there is no wood 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.870
 we make a button and we put it here I do not know 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.720
 why the good truth here we are 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.990
 taking three stone worth for 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.120
 do good to us what is doing the 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.320
 he plays I do not know why he does it but 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.320
 you do not have to do it 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.710
 we take a peak worth a peak of how 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.780
 before dawn july 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:15.180
 and since we are going to take two more 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.180
 for the theme of the shovel 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.290
 here we are, we have come across a 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.650
 mine 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.390
 so let's go after killing this 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:27.819
 bat we are going to apply a little bit of 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.090
 iron if it's super unfair all this 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.129
 tree is a bit fake but the time 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.670
 You ask why there is so much around 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:38.980
 The new passat with three sons-in-law 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.700
 enough to catch the water were here 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:44.890
 ok and that 's it but if we make the bit a 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.390
 bit 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.150
 well we have the iron 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.310
 we do not make another brand other character 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:57.060
 that is crossed because we forget 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.910
 up and we make a cuckoo 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.920
 the cube we take water and we go 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.630
 work but as we do not realize 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.800
 that there is already water then this shield already 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:08.710
 it's useless so we throw it away 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.770
 then after catching everything all 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:14.320
 these days blanket thing that are 44 you're 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:18.070
 there for the super fake fucking face all 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.650
 we make a diamond peak like 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.290
 as before, they are the same, we cover 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:27.900
 you see water and it does not bother us and we put 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:31.120
 apply in that is a boring but good 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:33.760
 here if it happens to you as friends and here is 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.350
 a rock bothering the remover is already not 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:41.410
 nothing happens then we take out the portal and 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:47.100
 go go that has lighter this is already 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:50.750
 the good high good let's see if 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:54.350
 appears is here in the meter 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:57.410
 you start looking for these characters that 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.800
 well in here they are not so easy but 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.800
 good 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.710
 then we got a saw the cut 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.100
 and well you do not lack the arena of weapons 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.290
 that you can find 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.110
 good lies about the chest but it's 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.250
 that if not good you choose here a site 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.890
 very wide 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:23.590
 we make one puts you flight at three o'clock 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:25.210
 heads and will appear the twitter does not pass 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.730
 nothing because with a touch is dead 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.600
 ok we have 30 and we can 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.600
 be jumping 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:36.139
 but that's it, that's it 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:46.420
 well this but everything all right 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:50.190
