you take a form like contemporary dance
which<00:00:39.980> is<00:00:40.100> a<00:00:40.130> little<00:00:40.280> hard<00:00:40.430> to<00:00:40.520> understand<00:00:40.910> we

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
which is a little hard to understand we

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.639 
which is a little hard to understand we
take<00:00:41.750> genetics<00:00:42.200> a<00:00:42.290> little<00:00:42.470> hard<00:00:42.590> to

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
take genetics a little hard to

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:44.200 
take genetics a little hard to
understand<00:00:43.040> you<00:00:43.489> say<00:00:43.610> let's<00:00:43.970> put<00:00:44.120> them

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
understand you say let's put them

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.180 
understand you say let's put them
together<00:00:44.300> then<00:00:44.960> everyone<00:00:45.590> will<00:00:45.739> understand

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
together then everyone will understand

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.670 
together then everyone will understand
things<00:00:46.610> like<00:00:46.850> how<00:00:47.239> is<00:00:47.300> that<00:00:47.390> gonna<00:00:47.630> work<00:00:47.720> but

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
things like how is that gonna work but

that the students were already familiar
with<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:21.100> idea<00:01:21.399> was<00:01:21.580> to<00:01:21.610> make<00:01:21.880> it<00:01:22.000> unique<00:01:22.360> and

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:22.600 
with the idea was to make it unique and

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.420 
with the idea was to make it unique and
something<00:01:22.990> different<00:01:23.380> from<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.159> way<00:01:24.280> they

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
something different from the way they

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.070 
something different from the way they
were<00:01:24.460> normally<00:01:24.909> taught<00:01:25.090> in<00:01:25.299> the<00:01:25.420> classes<00:01:25.869> the

were normally taught in the classes the
main<00:01:26.350> goal<00:01:26.710> is<00:01:27.069> to<00:01:27.670> teach<00:01:28.149> the<00:01:28.390> science

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
main goal is to teach the science

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.620 
main goal is to teach the science
through<00:01:29.429> dance<00:01:30.429> and<00:01:30.580> through<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:30.970> arts<00:01:31.270> and

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
through dance and through the arts and

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.059 
through dance and through the arts and
and<00:01:31.899> really<00:01:32.050> how<00:01:32.289> that<00:01:32.500> connection<00:01:32.920> can<00:01:33.039> be

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
and really how that connection can be

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:37.740 
and really how that connection can be
made<00:01:34.710> about<00:01:35.710> a<00:01:35.740> month<00:01:35.979> later<00:01:36.270> 70<00:01:37.270> students

Washington DC the students will have to

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.279 
Washington DC the students will have to
choreograph<00:01:42.399> one<00:01:43.000> of<00:01:43.210> four<00:01:43.479> topics<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.200> the

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
choreograph one of four topics and the

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:46.859 
choreograph one of four topics and the
groups<00:01:44.500> they<00:01:44.679> get<00:01:44.860> split<00:01:45.159> into<00:01:45.549> one<00:01:46.509> of<00:01:46.690> which

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
groups they get split into one of which

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.440 
groups they get split into one of which
is<00:01:47.049> mitosis<00:01:47.649> you<00:01:48.549> talked<00:01:48.850> about<00:01:48.970> mitosis

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
is mitosis you talked about mitosis

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.300 
is mitosis you talked about mitosis
dance<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.500> chromosomes

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
dance and chromosomes

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.169 
dance and chromosomes
because<00:01:51.970> again<00:01:52.600> it's<00:01:52.899> just<00:01:52.990> like<00:01:53.319> a

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
because again it's just like a

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.779 
because again it's just like a
production<00:01:55.179> right<00:01:55.950> we<00:01:56.950> gave<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.340> students<00:01:57.670> an

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
production right we gave the students an

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.910 
production right we gave the students an
overview<00:01:58.390> of<00:01:58.450> mitosis<00:01:59.350> taking<00:01:59.770> them<00:01:59.890> through

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
overview of mitosis taking them through

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.160 
overview of mitosis taking them through
the<00:02:00.130> various<00:02:00.460> phases<00:02:00.729> and<00:02:01.270> then<00:02:01.869> we<00:02:02.020> asked

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
the various phases and then we asked

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.630 
the various phases and then we asked
them<00:02:02.350> to<00:02:02.409> choreograph<00:02:02.829> movement<00:02:03.549> that

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
them to choreograph movement that

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.850 
them to choreograph movement that
depicted<00:02:04.149> each<00:02:04.240> of<00:02:04.420> those<00:02:04.570> phases<00:02:04.840> at<00:02:05.590> the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
depicted each of those phases at the

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.669 
depicted each of those phases at the
center<00:02:06.340> I<00:02:06.640> like<00:02:07.119> to<00:02:07.240> coil<00:02:07.509> the<00:02:07.600> shape<00:02:07.810> I<00:02:08.049> like<00:02:08.470> I

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
center I like to coil the shape I like I

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.069 
center I like to coil the shape I like I
like<00:02:08.950> that<00:02:09.100> idea<00:02:09.220> of<00:02:09.459> the<00:02:09.579> mirroring<00:02:09.970> not<00:02:10.810> the

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.079 
like that idea of the mirroring not the

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.289 
like that idea of the mirroring not the
drag<00:02:11.350> can't<00:02:12.130> go<00:02:12.250> wrong<00:02:12.489> with<00:02:12.609> the<00:02:12.760> coil<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.209> I

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
drag can't go wrong with the coil and I

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.390 
drag can't go wrong with the coil and I
started<00:02:13.959> to<00:02:14.079> just<00:02:14.109> implant<00:02:14.769> places<00:02:15.190> about

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
started to just implant places about

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.430 
started to just implant places about
speed<00:02:15.730> we<00:02:16.480> gave<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.840> students<00:02:17.200> few

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
speed we gave the students few

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.470 
speed we gave the students few
parameters<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.130> work<00:02:18.340> within<00:02:18.549> the<00:02:18.970> idea<00:02:19.269> was

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
parameters to work within the idea was

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.819 
parameters to work within the idea was
for<00:02:19.630> them<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.930> create<00:02:20.109> something<00:02:20.590> that<00:02:20.620> was

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
for them to create something that was

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.310 
for them to create something that was
totally<00:02:21.100> their<00:02:21.549> own<00:02:21.780> hopefully<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:22.930> students

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
totally their own hopefully the students

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.780 
totally their own hopefully the students
will<00:02:23.470> create<00:02:23.590> something<00:02:24.220> that<00:02:24.250> their<00:02:24.519> peers

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
will create something that their peers

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.640 
will create something that their peers
will<00:02:24.970> enjoy<00:02:25.299> but<00:02:25.750> then<00:02:25.870> also<00:02:26.079> their<00:02:26.380> peers

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
will enjoy but then also their peers

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.050 
will enjoy but then also their peers
will<00:02:26.829> gain<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.010> new<00:02:27.220> understanding<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:28.000> the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
will gain a new understanding of the

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.589 
will gain a new understanding of the
science<00:02:28.540> and<00:02:28.720> in<00:02:28.780> this<00:02:28.930> case<00:02:29.109> it<00:02:29.260> was<00:02:29.380> mitosis

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:46.280 

let's<00:02:33.900> start<00:02:34.489> break<00:02:44.689> the<00:02:45.689> students<00:02:46.109> have

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
let's start break the students have

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.009 
let's start break the students have
about<00:02:46.469> two<00:02:46.829> hours<00:02:47.010> to<00:02:47.790> learn<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.810> major

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
about two hours to learn the major

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.379 
about two hours to learn the major
concepts<00:02:49.560> of<00:02:49.680> mitosis<00:02:50.239> explore<00:02:51.239> those

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
concepts of mitosis explore those

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.990 
concepts of mitosis explore those
concepts<00:02:51.989> through<00:02:52.439> dance<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.219> movement<00:02:53.519> and

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
concepts through dance and movement and

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.809 
concepts through dance and movement and
then<00:02:54.689> create<00:02:55.109> brand-new<00:02:55.590> choreography<00:02:56.430> that

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
then create brand-new choreography that

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.119 
then create brand-new choreography that
essentially<00:02:57.510> will<00:02:57.689> teach<00:02:58.109> other<00:02:58.469> students

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.129 
essentially will teach other students

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.270 
essentially will teach other students
those<00:02:59.489> major<00:02:59.819> concepts<00:03:00.359> in<00:03:00.510> mitosis<00:03:01.280> after

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
those major concepts in mitosis after

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.920 
those major concepts in mitosis after
they're<00:03:02.459> done<00:03:02.609> creating<00:03:02.909> their<00:03:03.269> choreography

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
they're done creating their choreography

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.050 
they're done creating their choreography
they'll<00:03:04.290> have<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.709> opportunity<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.489> perform

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
they'll have the opportunity to perform

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.539 
they'll have the opportunity to perform
it<00:03:06.269> for<00:03:06.719> their<00:03:07.079> friends<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:07.799> other<00:03:07.950> students

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
it for their friends and other students

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:20.869 
it for their friends and other students
who<00:03:08.669> are<00:03:08.760> part<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.180> workshop<00:03:19.879> students

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
who are part of the workshop students

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.759 
who are part of the workshop students
are<00:03:21.060> dancing<00:03:21.659> mitosis<00:03:22.230> if<00:03:22.349> you<00:03:22.439> can<00:03:22.620> believe

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
are dancing mitosis if you can believe

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:30.280 
are dancing mitosis if you can believe
that

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.449 

they're<00:03:31.290> dancing<00:03:31.829> what<00:03:31.949> happens<00:03:32.310> when

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
they're dancing what happens when

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.759 
they're dancing what happens when
mitosis<00:03:33.090> happens<00:03:33.629> right<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.349> when<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.620> goes

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
mitosis happens right and when it goes

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:47.190 
mitosis happens right and when it goes
awry

mitosis you worked as a team you know
it's<00:04:23.020> not<00:04:23.169> exactly<00:04:23.320> easy<00:04:23.740> to<00:04:24.040> collaborate

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250

amount of time so awesome

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.110 
amount of time so awesome
now<00:04:31.870> it's<00:04:32.290> performance<00:04:32.830> time<00:04:33.070> you<00:04:33.729> can<00:04:33.910> tell

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
now it's performance time you can tell

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.060 
now it's performance time you can tell
the<00:04:34.300> students<00:04:34.690> are<00:04:34.840> excited<00:04:35.139> and<00:04:35.530> probably<00:04:36.040> a

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
the students are excited and probably a

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.219 
the students are excited and probably a
little<00:04:36.220> bit<00:04:36.400> nervous<00:04:36.639> to<00:04:37.240> show<00:04:37.270> what<00:04:38.050> they've

put together two very creative and

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:48.840 
put together two very creative and
unique<00:04:46.600> performances<00:04:47.560> that<00:04:47.950> depict<00:04:48.310> mitosis

unique performances that depict mitosis

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:57.270 
unique performances that depict mitosis
I<00:04:52.169> wanted<00:04:53.169> them<00:04:53.350> to<00:04:53.620> see<00:04:55.320> biology<00:04:56.320> in<00:04:56.620> terms<00:04:57.100> of

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
I wanted them to see biology in terms of

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.040 
I wanted them to see biology in terms of
how<00:04:57.430> it<00:04:57.490> relates<00:04:57.610> to<00:04:58.150> them<00:04:58.360> not<00:04:58.690> just<00:04:58.900> what

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
how it relates to them not just what

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.450 
how it relates to them not just what
they're<00:04:59.200> reading<00:04:59.350> from<00:04:59.560> the<00:04:59.710> textbook<00:05:00.070> but

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
they're reading from the textbook but

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.670 
they're reading from the textbook but
you<00:05:01.030> know<00:05:01.150> and<00:05:01.450> how<00:05:01.840> other<00:05:02.139> people<00:05:02.530> actually

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
you know and how other people actually

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.469 
you know and how other people actually
are<00:05:03.010> interested<00:05:03.100> in<00:05:03.520> science<00:05:03.729> it's<00:05:04.120> not<00:05:04.270> just

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
are interested in science it's not just

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.420 
are interested in science it's not just
the<00:05:04.600> geeks<00:05:04.810> in<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.050> nerds<00:05:05.320> who<00:05:05.620> like<00:05:05.800> science

the geeks in the nerds who like science

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.820 
the geeks in the nerds who like science
you<00:05:06.729> have<00:05:06.760> dancers<00:05:07.360> now<00:05:07.539> who<00:05:07.810> are<00:05:08.350> interested

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
you have dancers now who are interested

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:16.830 
you have dancers now who are interested
in<00:05:08.919> science<00:05:15.060> one<00:05:16.060> of<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.210> comments<00:05:16.600> that<00:05:16.630> one

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
in science one of the comments that one

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.529 
in science one of the comments that one
of<00:05:16.930> my<00:05:16.990> students<00:05:17.350> said<00:05:17.410> was<00:05:17.710> that<00:05:18.270> she<00:05:19.270> said<00:05:19.450> he

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
of my students said was that she said he

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:21.000 
of my students said was that she said he
was<00:05:19.690> much<00:05:19.900> freer<00:05:20.320> than<00:05:20.650> being<00:05:20.889> in<00:05:20.979> the

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
was much freer than being in the

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.290 
was much freer than being in the
classroom<00:05:21.310> I<00:05:21.700> think<00:05:21.940> that's<00:05:22.060> actually

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
classroom I think that's actually

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.719 
classroom I think that's actually
explore<00:05:22.990> something<00:05:23.350> an<00:05:23.680> explanation<00:05:24.310> a

before<00:05:46.470> or<00:05:46.950> take<00:05:47.160> something<00:05:47.520> they<00:05:47.610> learned<00:05:47.760> in

the classroom I think what surprised me
was<00:05:56.100> initially<00:05:56.550> the<00:05:56.820> students<00:05:57.210> were<00:05:57.330> very

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
was initially the students were very

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.510 
was initially the students were very
tentative<00:05:58.440> about<00:05:58.620> doing<00:05:58.980> this<00:05:59.100> if<00:05:59.250> by<00:05:59.370> the<00:05:59.430> end

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
tentative about doing this if by the end

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.730 
tentative about doing this if by the end
of<00:06:00.000> it<00:06:00.180> they<00:06:00.570> really<00:06:00.870> got<00:06:01.020> into<00:06:01.380> it<00:06:01.530> I<00:06:01.710> mean

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
of it they really got into it I mean

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.830 
of it they really got into it I mean
they<00:06:02.040> really<00:06:02.070> they<00:06:02.610> really<00:06:02.640> were<00:06:03.120> visualizing

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
they really they really were visualizing

they really they really were visualizing
what<00:06:04.050> mitosis<00:06:04.620> looked<00:06:04.800> like<00:06:04.950> through<00:06:05.160> dance

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
what mitosis looked like through dance

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.010 
what mitosis looked like through dance
and<00:06:05.640> I'm<00:06:05.760> so<00:06:06.120> impressed<00:06:06.300> with<00:06:06.690> them<00:06:06.900> because

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
and I'm so impressed with them because

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.520 
and I'm so impressed with them because
all<00:06:07.380> the<00:06:07.590> inhibitions<00:06:07.800> were<00:06:08.340> gone
