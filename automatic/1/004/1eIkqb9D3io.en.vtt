today<00:00:00.900> we're<00:00:01.050> going<00:00:01.140> to<00:00:01.199> be<00:00:01.290> doing<00:00:01.410> a<00:00:01.530> quick

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
today we're going to be doing a quick

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.740 
today we're going to be doing a quick
unboxing<00:00:01.970> the<00:00:02.970> fennan<00:00:03.650> 2x6<00:00:05.150> 1100<00:00:06.150> T<00:00:06.359> so<00:00:06.600> this

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
unboxing the fennan 2x6 1100 T so this

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.780 
unboxing the fennan 2x6 1100 T so this
is<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:06.899> multi-core<00:00:07.589> processor<00:00:07.620> as<00:00:08.400> you<00:00:08.550> may<00:00:08.730> or

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
is a multi-core processor as you may or

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.490 
is a multi-core processor as you may or
may<00:00:08.849> not<00:00:09.000> have<00:00:09.150> figured<00:00:09.300> out<00:00:09.510> by<00:00:09.570> now<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:10.080> is

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
may not have figured out by now it is

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.249 
may not have figured out by now it is
also<00:00:10.679> a<00:00:10.889> phenom<00:00:11.460> 2<00:00:11.730> as<00:00:11.969> you<00:00:12.360> may<00:00:12.599> or<00:00:12.840> may<00:00:12.900> not

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
also a phenom 2 as you may or may not

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.320 
also a phenom 2 as you may or may not
have<00:00:13.710> figure<00:00:13.980> out<00:00:14.099> by<00:00:14.250> now<00:00:14.400> this<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.059> Black

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
have figure out by now this is a Black

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.120 
have figure out by now this is a Black
Edition<00:00:15.540> processor<00:00:16.379> which<00:00:16.529> means<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:17.010> you

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
Edition processor which means that you

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.460 
Edition processor which means that you
have<00:00:17.340> full<00:00:17.580> control<00:00:18.539> over<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.050> CPU

have full control over the CPU

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.210 
have full control over the CPU
multiplier<00:00:19.789> now<00:00:20.789> that's<00:00:21.449> actually<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:22.680> even

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
multiplier now that's actually it even

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.839 
multiplier now that's actually it even
means<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.640> little<00:00:23.880> bit<00:00:25.250> it<00:00:26.250> means<00:00:26.460> something<00:00:26.789> a

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
means a little bit it means something a

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.519 
means a little bit it means something a
little<00:00:27.090> bit<00:00:27.180> different<00:00:27.720> than<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.019> even<00:00:28.109> used

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
little bit different than it even used

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.919 
little bit different than it even used
to<00:00:28.710> because<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.130> used<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.490> be<00:00:29.720> the<00:00:30.720> Black

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929

to because it used to be the Black
Edition<00:00:31.109> menu<00:00:32.070> had<00:00:32.250> one<00:00:32.579> multiplier<00:00:33.180> to

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
Edition menu had one multiplier to

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.979 
Edition menu had one multiplier to
either<00:00:34.590> turn<00:00:34.980> up<00:00:35.219> or<00:00:35.430> turn<00:00:35.640> down<00:00:35.910> according<00:00:36.870> to

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
either turn up or turn down according to

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.930 
either turn up or turn down according to
your<00:00:37.170> will<00:00:37.380> so<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.800> meant<00:00:38.040> ok<00:00:38.579> well<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.850> don't

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
your will so it meant ok well you don't

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.520 
your will so it meant ok well you don't
have<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.329> fuss<00:00:39.510> around<00:00:39.690> with<00:00:41.930> with<00:00:42.930> adjusting

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
have to fuss around with with adjusting

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.860 
have to fuss around with with adjusting
the<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:44.399> ratio<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.030> actual<00:00:45.180> bus<00:00:45.600> speed

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
the the ratio of the actual bus speed

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.170 
the the ratio of the actual bus speed
itself<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.500> can<00:00:46.680> just<00:00:46.950> turn<00:00:47.520> up<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.760> multi

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
itself you can just turn up the multi

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.700 
itself you can just turn up the multi
there's<00:00:48.629> your<00:00:48.780> overclock<00:00:49.140> turn<00:00:49.500> up<00:00:49.620> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
there's your overclock turn up the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.000 
there's your overclock turn up the
voltage<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.190> dot<00:00:50.370> well<00:00:51.239> now<00:00:51.600> with<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.440> turbo

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
voltage you dot well now with the turbo

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.400 
voltage you dot well now with the turbo
processor<00:00:53.789> so<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.420> all<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.079> six

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
processor so that is all of the six

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.799 
processor so that is all of the six
cores<00:00:55.710> from<00:00:55.890> AMD<00:00:56.160> right<00:00:56.460> now<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:57.239> have<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.449> tee

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
cores from AMD right now that have a tee

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.290 
cores from AMD right now that have a tee
at<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.079> end<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> part<00:00:58.680> number<00:00:59.270> have<00:01:00.270> a

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
at the end of the part number have a

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.860 
at the end of the part number have a
feature<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:01.230> allows<00:01:01.590> them<00:01:02.180> to<00:01:03.180> scale<00:01:03.449> up<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
feature that allows them to scale up the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.810 
feature that allows them to scale up the
frequency<00:01:04.470> when<00:01:04.979> you're<00:01:05.159> running<00:01:05.339> three

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
frequency when you're running three

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.260 
frequency when you're running three
cores<00:01:06.210> or<00:01:06.479> less<00:01:07.220> so<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.400> processor<00:01:09.000> although

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
cores or less so this processor although

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.240 
cores or less so this processor although
it<00:01:09.420> says<00:01:09.600> 3.3<00:01:10.200> gigahertz<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.890> that's<00:01:11.040> your

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
it says 3.3 gigahertz and that's your

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.450 
it says 3.3 gigahertz and that's your
stock<00:01:11.549> multiplier<00:01:12.119> also<00:01:12.990> runs<00:01:13.229> at<00:01:13.460> 3.7

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
stock multiplier also runs at 3.7

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.060 
stock multiplier also runs at 3.7
gigahertz<00:01:14.790> when<00:01:15.720> you're<00:01:15.900> running<00:01:16.110> with<00:01:16.680> three

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
gigahertz when you're running with three

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.179 
gigahertz when you're running with three
active<00:01:17.909> processing<00:01:18.750> threads<00:01:19.110> or<00:01:19.320> less<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.159> you

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
active processing threads or less so you

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.240 
active processing threads or less so you
can<00:01:20.549> not<00:01:20.759> only<00:01:20.970> adjust<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.259> stock<00:01:22.619> multiplier

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
can not only adjust the stock multiplier

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.910 
can not only adjust the stock multiplier
but<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.970> can<00:01:24.210> also<00:01:24.479> adjust<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.290> turbo

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
but you can also adjust the turbo

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.440 
but you can also adjust the turbo
multiplier<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.729> can<00:01:26.850> make<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.119> so<00:01:27.270> okay

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
multiplier so you can make it so okay

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.539 
multiplier so you can make it so okay
let's<00:01:27.869> say<00:01:28.020> you've<00:01:28.200> decided<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.860> know<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.009> want

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
let's say you've decided you know I want

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.740 
let's say you've decided you know I want
die<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:30.000> know<00:01:30.119> what<00:01:30.240> I'm<00:01:30.329> going<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.479> leave<00:01:30.630> my

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
die you know what I'm going to leave my

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.120 
die you know what I'm going to leave my
stock<00:01:31.049> speed<00:01:31.350> when<00:01:31.560> I'm<00:01:31.650> running<00:01:31.829> like

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
stock speed when I'm running like

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.740 
stock speed when I'm running like
heavily<00:01:32.549> multi-threaded<00:01:33.240> stuff<00:01:33.450> at<00:01:33.600> three

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
heavily multi-threaded stuff at three

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.120 
heavily multi-threaded stuff at three
point<00:01:33.990> three<00:01:34.020> gigahertz<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.040> don't

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
point three gigahertz so that I don't

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.370 
point three gigahertz so that I don't
get<00:01:35.759> more<00:01:35.939> power<00:01:36.180> consumption<00:01:36.900> or<00:01:37.229> so

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
get more power consumption or so

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.530 
get more power consumption or so
whatever<00:01:37.860> your<00:01:38.189> reasoning<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.820> but<00:01:39.329> I'm<00:01:39.420> going

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
whatever your reasoning is but I'm going

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.569 
whatever your reasoning is but I'm going
to<00:01:39.630> turn<00:01:39.810> my<00:01:39.930> turbo<00:01:40.320> up<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.590> four<00:01:40.890> gigahertz<00:01:41.189> so

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
to turn my turbo up to four gigahertz so

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.670 
to turn my turbo up to four gigahertz so
that<00:01:41.790> when<00:01:42.420> I'm<00:01:42.540> running<00:01:42.780> games<00:01:43.229> for<00:01:43.590> example

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
that when I'm running games for example

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.249 
that when I'm running games for example
which<00:01:44.280> only<00:01:44.610> use<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> few<00:01:45.180> processor<00:01:45.780> cores<00:01:46.049> I

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
which only use a few processor cores I

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.410 
which only use a few processor cores I
can<00:01:46.590> really<00:01:46.740> get<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.040> most<00:01:47.070> out<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.490> my<00:01:47.579> CPU<00:01:48.030> so

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
can really get the most out of my CPU so

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
here's a little tip for you guys if you

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.430 
here's a little tip for you guys if you
want<00:02:48.180> it<00:02:48.299> to<00:02:48.420> look<00:02:48.569> tidy<00:02:48.780> or<00:02:49.019> in<00:02:49.110> your<00:02:49.260> case

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
want it to look tidy or in your case

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.380 
want it to look tidy or in your case
twist<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.370> up<00:02:50.489> like<00:02:51.420> this<00:02:52.430> that<00:02:53.430> way<00:02:53.640> instead

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
twist it up like this that way instead

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.509 
twist it up like this that way instead
of<00:02:54.450> being<00:02:54.600> like<00:02:54.989> a<00:02:55.019> total<00:02:55.500> mess<00:02:55.920> when<00:02:56.250> you<00:02:56.340> plug

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
of being like a total mess when you plug

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.030 
of being like a total mess when you plug
it<00:02:56.670> into<00:02:56.819> your<00:02:57.230> into<00:02:58.230> your<00:02:58.349> fan<00:02:58.560> header<00:02:58.799> and

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
it into your into your fan header and

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.770 
it into your into your fan header and
like<00:02:59.160> looking<00:02:59.430> like<00:02:59.459> this<00:02:59.760> you<00:03:00.060> can<00:03:00.630> actually

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
like looking like this you can actually

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.650 
like looking like this you can actually
have<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.410> just<00:03:01.709> all<00:03:01.920> sort<00:03:02.280> of<00:03:02.480> come<00:03:03.480> together

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
have it just all sort of come together

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.070 
have it just all sort of come together
like<00:03:04.380> that<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:05.010> then<00:03:05.360> you<00:03:06.360> can<00:03:06.569> plug<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:06.959> in

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
like that and then you can plug it in

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.320 
like that and then you can plug it in
somewhere<00:03:07.319> and<00:03:07.799> then<00:03:08.459> kind<00:03:08.760> of<00:03:08.819> twist<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.239> up

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
somewhere and then kind of twist it up

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.229 
somewhere and then kind of twist it up
like<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.540> so<00:03:09.780> it's<00:03:10.170> sort<00:03:10.920> of<00:03:10.980> more<00:03:11.790> uniform

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
like that so it's sort of more uniform

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.470 
like that so it's sort of more uniform
anyway<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:13.019> has<00:03:13.140> four<00:03:13.470> heat<00:03:13.650> pipes<00:03:14.360> two<00:03:15.360> of

anyway it has four heat pipes two of

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.449 
anyway it has four heat pipes two of
them<00:03:15.599> go<00:03:15.750> one<00:03:15.959> way<00:03:16.140> two<00:03:16.739> of<00:03:16.890> them<00:03:17.040> go<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.340> other

them go one way two of them go the other

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:19.400 
them go one way two of them go the other
way<00:03:17.579> you've<00:03:17.910> got<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.150> pre<00:03:18.420> applied<00:03:18.690> thermal<00:03:19.170> pad
