 our clients 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.939
 the barbecue starts with the choice of meat 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.369
 to be the best is yet more good 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.670
 understander cry if you choose the meat in the 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.880
 Look back to that point is 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.100
 I need a lot of experience here in the fire. 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.500
 of ground we serve the meat of the race 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.500
 angus e is a tender and tasty meat 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.320
 to make a good barbecue has several 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.969
 aspects that need to be 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.880
 meat purchase time 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:50.570
 one is the color of the size here 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.350
 of the pieces and the fat interspersed 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.539
 fibers 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.960
 this will make your meat more 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:59.479
 soft and juicy our barbecue is 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.630
 seasoned only with coarse salt 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:05.420
 nothing else and should be put as far as 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:08.500
 accurate to not mask the taste of meat 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:12.110
 and help me to know where the meat is 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.099
 the most tender and juicy cuts request 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.849
 on the mattress 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:20.180
 the ribeye steak before the prodigy palette 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:23.269
 lamb in the stent show the show was 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:26.510
 launched by us and is the first cut 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.380
 that was taken from the front of the 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.400
 ox 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.440
 This is another example of our quest 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.650
 incessant for new cuts and new 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.650
 flavors 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.410
 good today the first tip is not good to talk 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.590
 love and you and I have two 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.880
 sticks with practically the same 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.420
 characteristic with each other with 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.700
 great differential one has the fat 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.549
 between the fibers that will give 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.590
 larger but did it in our rasko on a 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.190
 another piece that does not have the same 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:04.790
 amount of marbling that we can 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.880
 observe the naked eye is this spicy by 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.640
 example is a 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.720
 fat is lower and she does not 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.600
 has the culture of ms interspersed is in the face 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.030
 this is already a campaign that she has a 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.090
 more uniform and external culture and 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.750
 internally it's also eye catching 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:28.200
 nude is the degree of marbling it has 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:31.470
 this one for sure we will do the 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.670
 best barbecue in our world for the 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.970
 next program 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.440
 Let's show you how to cut a spike. 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.310
 to cook a picanha 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.310
 until then
