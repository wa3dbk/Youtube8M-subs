00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.950
 impressions about the game, I looked iron

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.390

 the atmosphere of the chip is full and now 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.230

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.020
 specific genre n eye runner and

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.740
 gigabyte is a lot for n eyes 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.380
 runner 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.570
 the genre of the endless race originated 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.479
 in the days of the king of peas a thousand years ago 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.700
 but a surge of interest and activity as well 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.350
 all kinds of cloning fell on 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.930
 temp wound popularity 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.720
 12 reviews which are also on the channel 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.670
 game in a similar genre for agents on it 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.470
 first experience and fix you honestly 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.340
 I will say some elements on the four 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.920
 screwed up 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.539
 some have refined and rethought in 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.850
 the whole is played very exciting what 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.220
 concerns the size of the game all the same this 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.960
 story thing the game tells us about 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.369
 whose stories will be told in 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.220
 iron man 3 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.869
 so there are different locations different 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.270
 enemies of various possibilities huge 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.220
 The number of suits overall size can be 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.990
 say that it is justified moreover that it 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.440
 universal application will go immediately and 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.360
 on iphone and ipad as for 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.190
 suit one of the main pieces of iron 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.800
 person except the person 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.989
 tony stark philanthropist playboy little bit 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.640
 alcoholic arrogant performance 

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:07.379
 robert dauni junior and here is very 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.869
 a lot and they all open behind 

00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:11.220
 intragame currency by itself but 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.140
 move the most important game 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.300
 eliminated by freemium model 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.090
 only recently became 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.550
 observe the birth of freemium 20 if 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.379
 want and apple start with this phenomenon not 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.510
 then to fight but to inform 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.099
 consumers how it all happens and 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.349
 how much money can you spend 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.930
 but the publishers themselves have worked on 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.819
 mistakes and I see that of you no longer 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.879
 pull the money we by the way discussed this in 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.540
 dandjan hunter 4 game review from the same 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.610
 gameplay 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.010
 and now you can pass the game 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.720
 not really spending the real 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.659
 means yes it does not happen so fast 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.489
 and fun but nonetheless if you go nowhere 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.170
 take your time and may not be accustomed 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.959
 rush case of mobile game 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.780
 then dried up calmly follow the plot and 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.150
 here in iron man 3 10 really 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.319
 stories about it I have said here 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.030
 also bosses 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.310
 many gameplay elements which 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.230
 added by passing the game that 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.810
 makes some interesting it is not easy 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.180
 n2 countries where you go through the same 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.769
 level and the same gameplay 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.840
 elements throughout the game and 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.730
 will always entertain you 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.120
 surprise and this is the most important difference 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.859
 which made gameloft into this genre with 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.060
 running everything is fine as in any 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.980
 foreign friend 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.900
 we pilot the iron man with the help 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.669
 accelerometer can reconfigure on 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.340
 screens and controls but it's not so convenient 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:31.139
 and also shoot gestures on the screen here 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.730
 on the ironman grid and not some 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.250
 endless temple run 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.980
 now see the game go on galaxy 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.719
 s4 and I will say right away I did not like it 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.329
 optimization on android or rather something else 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:44.939
 time proves the advantage of the platform from 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:47.579
 apple on chips is old enough again 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:49.139
 which stand vp-2 ipad mini iphone 4s 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.620
 ipod touch fifth generation of all sorts 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.959
 jerking 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.180
 you won't see on the other hand you can 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.370
 complain that gameplay is bad 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.560
 optimized my game but in my opinion 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.510
 this once again proves again 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.549
 benefits of the platform from apple because 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.709
 that there is no such terrible fragmentation 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:06.810
 and do not need to do anything but again 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.669
 how the game can slow down on the flagship 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.620
 which came out just yesterday for me 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.509
 this is absolutely incomprehensible game at all 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.009
 turned out smartly out of nice graphics and 

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:16.169
 sound and atmosphere 

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:18.659
 However, when I downloaded it and played 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.579
 half an hour I tweeted that she 

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:23.490
 I didn't like it seemed boring and 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.349
 monotonous but then I advanced on 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.840
 the plot opened a couple of new costumes 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:29.849
 plunged into the atmosphere and realized that if 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.770
 have a free moment no no but get out 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.030
 smartphone out of pocket and launch it 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.490
 Iron Man 3 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:37.680
 and this is the power of the game, it does not require you 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.620
 many hours of immersion have a minute 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.120
 played no well, nothing terrible this 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.800
 a case when it's great that I didn't 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.900
 immediately review my opinion is not right 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.719
 to have changed dramatically 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.880
 changed but I definitely improved my 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:53.580
 relation to the iron man 3 game 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.650
 worth the time spent is the most 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.479
 the main thing and since the game is freemium 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.120
 I want to play something I decided this 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.880
 dilemma with hasbro toys 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.500
 licensed by the way and very reminiscent 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.570
 Jinjou at least what was 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.950
 day in the 90s to take 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.780
 participate in this improvised 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.450
 the competition after the Russian premiere 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.640
 iron man 3 2 may write in 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.770

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:20.080
 of how you actually look at it with 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.780
 hashtag wheels iron man 3 how are you now 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.540
 see everything on your screen at random 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.080
 I will choose the winner by mail 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.730
 I will send 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.800
 this wonderful set well yes 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.330
 it seems for 25 species how straight they are 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.410
 can be combined so ideally 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.480
 need to collect all 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:35.950
 but you can start with one and you were
