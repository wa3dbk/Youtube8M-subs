00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.660 
carefully glycerine so after she told me
that<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.590> decided<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.070> do<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.219> bit<00:00:38.460> more<00:00:38.489> research

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
that I decided to do a bit more research

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
that I decided to do a bit more research
and<00:00:39.739> I<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:41.399> wanted<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.670> share<00:00:41.910> what<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.270> found

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
and I just wanted to share what I found

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.990 
and I just wanted to share what I found
about<00:00:42.809> glycerine<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.010> it's<00:00:44.219> not<00:00:44.340> necessarily

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
about glycerine so it's not necessarily

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.500 
about glycerine so it's not necessarily
bad<00:00:45.180> what<00:00:45.950> this<00:00:46.950> arena<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:48.030> humectant

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
bad what this arena is it's a humectant

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
bad what this arena is it's a humectant
which<00:00:49.140> means<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.399> attracts<00:00:51.090> moisture<00:00:51.530> so

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
which means it attracts moisture so

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.709 
which means it attracts moisture so
that's<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.860> good<00:00:53.010> thing<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.699> when<00:00:54.270> it's<00:00:54.480> nice

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
moisture in the air the glycerine is

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.390 
moisture in the air the glycerine is
