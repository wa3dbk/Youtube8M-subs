 and here I am guys that they marcel 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.570
 is the nerd against time and after three 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.470

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.240
 world 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.919
 It's time to focus a little on the post 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.419
 In this video, we will see a 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:23.419
 little of japan and the anime 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:37.480
 it's like we saw in the last Berlin video 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.780
 was invaded by the Soviet Union on 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.370
 30 of April of 1945 the second war 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.019
 was practically finished 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.239
 but the country still had to sell in the 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.100
 The Japanese people have always been a country 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.870
 extremely proud they preferred 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.649
 die with honor by your own hands 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.649
 surrender to the enemy 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.510
 with that in view the United States 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.129
 decided to encourage already surrender 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.470
 using his newest weapon 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.149
 destruction of the atomic bomb in 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.979
 the whole history of mankind the bomb 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:11.920
 atomic bomb was used twice in combat 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:14.979
 on the 6th and the 9th of August 1945 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.659
 hiroshima and nagasaki in japan says 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.220
 United States that decided to use the good 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.479
 to end the war once and for all 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.640
 and prevent further deaths 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.229
 but the good news with a civil move where 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.940
 The war was actually happening. 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:27.220
 where the families were 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.690
 women children and elderly 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.490
 my an atrocity committed against 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.200
 innocent people were 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.090
 surviving a bomb still had to 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.860
 to cope with the effects of radiation 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.840
 stays in place after the explosion 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.820
 after this disaster happens in the 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.259
 finally surrenders and that is when the 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.759
 people finally hear the voice of 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.360
 first through Emperor 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:44.920
 radio 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.799
 the emperor he said that they are 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.390
 yielding so that you can already have a future 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.340
 after the war an agreement of 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.990
 surrender where Japan receives a budget 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.820
 to rebuild the country only if it does not 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.829
 can invest that money in increase 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.079
 stipulated so that there is no revenge 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:00.549
 by Japan as well as by 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.829
 part of Germany after the first 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.570
 world war japan takes this great 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:07.090
 invests basically two things in the 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.470
 education technology companies this 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.869
 can be noticed if we look at the level 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.370
 Japan today has all these 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.720
 events end up influencing 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.380
 comic books produced in the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.030
 Japan 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.160
 the four Japanese are called 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.540
 he is a little different from the 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.130
 american comics 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.989
 the American comics they are made of 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.790
 on industrial scale ie the face does 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:27.040
 the drawing does the script does 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.109
 organization and then distribute 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.180
 already the mangás a more natural thing is the 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.190
 author does everything and if authors call 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.690
 Kaka morning is much more freedom with 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.730
 His car 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.320
 I'm here and you want one of the manga has 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.670
 influence of these pump events 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.500
 atomic shakira 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.140
 many of you may have already had contact 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.820
 with the anime is just to remember anime is the 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.920
 name of japanese animation 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.540
 the story is set in Tokyo that the river 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.920
 The city was rebuilt after the 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.050
 touch has been destroyed by a 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.000
 mysterious explosion and this explosion of 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.100
 beginning the 3rd world war history 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.620
 revolves around two characters the 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.000
 and pen that are organs grow 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.770
 together and when they reach adolescence 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.580
 became part of a gang of 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.230
 bikers 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.000
 the ram is a born leader he has the 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.980
 More Democrat bike wins and such 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.940
 already the third he feels in the shadow of 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.430
 planet because it is a bit more 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.650
 shy introspective until one fine day 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.570
 traffic is in an accident and it is taking the 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.400
 government to be guinea pigs injuries 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.350
 these experiments awaken powers 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.090
 ment of tarsus and he uses the powers 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.750
 to discount their frustrations 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.190
 others 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.750
 for an hour and a half we get to 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.580
 this was not the first guinea pig of the 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.560
 experiments to generate super mano ele 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.390
 was number 41 have among all 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.550
 more powerful experiments is a boy 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.500
 called akira and was responsible for 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.510
 explosion destroyed the old tokyo 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.340
 this character a direct criticism of 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.989
 nuclear bomb and how sometimes human 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.970
 creates forces that he can 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.860
 control the hiv and also makes a critical 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.750
 to the very Japanese society that it 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.040
 values ​​education so much that 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.290
 who can not keep up with the 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.970
 studies end up suffering from bullying as well 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.230
 different from American culture by 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.430
 example the car that studies a lot 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.430
 ends up being used 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.270
 in ac was as tense as pen and his 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.830
 worst students of the worst school and the tokyo 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.450
 but his it makes a difference in 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:08.100
 this story shows that anyone 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.910
 can make a difference both for the good 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.770
 how much for evil 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:13.080
 other foods also have this bid 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.420
 implied in history for example this 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:22.290
 that the average year and a half of a purple was 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:24.030
 ill clear but also appears we see 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.340
 that maybe buoy history anyway he 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.440
 He is the hero and of course I'll take care of the 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:35.250
 I even voted to be a tapir not to be 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:37.020
 power of the universe so now only to 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.130
 close if you are interested in 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.930
 a slightly more realistic approach 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.850
 about the lives of these people who 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.160
 survived nuclear has a place 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.320
 very good called those kind of chaos 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.330
 is practically a diary in a large 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.470
 guy who survived the bomb a manga 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.060
 it's spectacular 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.130
 extremely realistic story but it is 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.170
 very sad because you are a fan of culture 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.550
 Japanese is very worth it 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.530
 So people, I 'm not one. 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.240
 Manga expert, I made this video. 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.070
 much more with my disgruntled students and 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.350
 I love the theme but you can be sure 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.760
 I 'm going to do a lot of research on this and 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.620
 People are going to make lots of videos or send 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.620
 still beauty to receive next week
