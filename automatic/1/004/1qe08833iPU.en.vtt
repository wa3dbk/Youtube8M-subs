 because we have a big game 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:30.190
 calvin well is this victory 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.060
 the particular where it was a match 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.340

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.600
 we wanted to win because yeah you 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.700
 can come back on this match because there is 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.750
 a little hit the headlines with with 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.369
 pictures that were not very very 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:50.140
 pretty was winning after if we told them 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:52.179
 give match we do the fact we give them 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.590

 beat me after at the end 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.590
 we try to make the commitment there is a 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:06.729
 kind of selling on the long arm the 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.009
 angry Germans you had some 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:13.019
 regret for your behavior 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.019
 it served us a few lessons 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:21.810
 twelve games without defeat in 17 how 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:23.730
 you explain this series is superb 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.660
 wrong series and that they say it we have 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.920
 always won 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:37.410
 every month so offensive tatami you have 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:39.000
 always played at this post there a post that 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.320
 allows you to feast in particular value 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.910
 in the finish because you a 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.870
 formidable scorer you have reached the bar 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.670
 from 10 goals down to mid season 1 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.310
 it was something that you had set 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:56.730
 aim to score goals or 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:57.960
 fashion i think i have a post where i 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.700
 learn how to support for 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:04.260
 mark after if I can so that on the 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.830
 field you are rather good technician 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.410
 finisher 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.750
 always in motion is what in the 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:11.760
 everyday life you're someone from 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.650
 dynamic too or rather reserved 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.380
 how when are you if you had to define 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:26.910
 for those who do not know the 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:30.890
 listen to the sound of what you do 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.890
 advise us to listen right now 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:41.010
 it is rather see rap rock rap 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.170
 american okay such an opportunity if he 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.900
 wore the shirt of the team of France 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:48.930
 because it's different from the pg's 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:56.420
 and there still sing even where 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:56.420
 it is ten times the other okay 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.670
 ok good last week we have the right 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.980
 to a little joke of our friend nathan 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.810
 and baward is what you can do 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.340
 better than him too was not been not 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:15.010
 badly huh it valid and to hide there so 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.140
 no good we are two days away from the match 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.770
 against beauvais 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.930
 is it easy to 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.310
 reconcentrate to play a match face 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.380
 to a team at least a case is that 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:28.930
 lens how do we do to find the 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:30.370
 concentration we will win what is the 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.700
 program there on a Friday afternoon 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.960
 two days of a match also agree 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.220
 You place where you are not working 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:44.920
 make liquid and sometimes else like 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:47.760
 that's fine 

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:50.560

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.570
