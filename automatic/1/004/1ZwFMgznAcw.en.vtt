read<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.110> story<00:01:25.320> right<00:01:25.619> now<00:01:25.680> and

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
read this story right now and

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.120 
read this story right now and
essentially<00:01:28.200> what<00:01:28.380> you're<00:01:28.500> going<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.710> get<00:01:28.920> is

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
essentially what you're going to get is

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.289 
essentially what you're going to get is
that<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.369> book<00:01:29.520> is<00:01:29.610> going<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.820> read<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.270> you

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
that the book is going to read to you

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.090 
that the book is going to read to you
and<00:01:30.720> then<00:01:31.229> there's<00:01:31.380> arrows<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.979> would

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
and then there's arrows that would

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.940 
and then there's arrows that would
direct<00:01:32.430> them<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.880> go<00:01:33.000> to<00:01:33.060> another<00:01:33.299> page<00:01:33.950> and

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
direct them to go to another page and

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.859 
direct them to go to another page and
essentially<00:01:35.369> that's<00:01:35.520> how<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.790> works<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.720> we

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
essentially that's how it works so we

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.810 
essentially that's how it works so we
can<00:01:36.900> see<00:01:37.170> we<00:01:37.350> get<00:01:37.500> these<00:01:38.189> are<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.430> pages<00:01:38.790> that

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
can see we get these are the pages that

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.240 
can see we get these are the pages that
we<00:01:39.060> get<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.450> free<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:40.470> can<00:01:40.500> go<00:01:40.710> back<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
we get for free you can go back to the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.740 
we get for free you can go back to the
cover<00:01:41.490> right<00:01:41.759> here<00:01:41.970> and<00:01:42.180> you<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.390> also<00:01:42.509> take<00:01:42.689> a

cover right here and you can also take a

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.270 
cover right here and you can also take a
roll<00:01:43.020> call<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.590> kind<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.890> neat<00:01:44.070> because

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
roll call this is kind of neat because

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.380 
roll call this is kind of neat because
these<00:01:44.369> are<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> characters<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.210> this<00:01:45.329> book

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
these are the characters in this book

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.319 
these are the characters in this book
and<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.350> tells<00:01:46.530> you<00:01:46.710> about<00:01:46.799> dino<00:01:47.130> dan<00:01:47.460> gives

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
you some facts and figures so to speak

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.319 
you some facts and figures so to speak
and<00:01:50.399> then<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.640> tells<00:01:50.790> you<00:01:51.000> about<00:01:51.090> the

and then it tells you about the
additional<00:01:51.750> dinosaurs<00:01:52.259> now<00:01:52.350> obviously<00:01:52.649> a

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
additional dinosaurs now obviously a

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.380 
additional dinosaurs now obviously a
three-year-olds<00:01:53.729> not<00:01:53.909> going<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.090> be<00:01:54.149> able<00:01:54.210> to

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
three-year-olds not going to be able to

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.420 
three-year-olds not going to be able to
read<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:54.990> he<00:01:55.110> at<00:01:55.229> least<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.590> see<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
read this but he at least can see the

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.190 
read this but he at least can see the
different<00:01:56.759> dinosaurs<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.719> if<00:01:58.049> you're

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
different dinosaurs and and if you're

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.660 
different dinosaurs and and if you're
reading<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.619> together<00:01:58.799> with<00:01:59.130> him<00:01:59.340> then<00:01:59.520> it's

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
reading it together with him then it's

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.039 
reading it together with him then it's
kind<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.000> just<00:02:00.149> an<00:02:00.329> interactive<00:02:00.840> experience

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
kind of just an interactive experience

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.910 
kind of just an interactive experience
together<00:02:01.560> so<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.579> gives<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.420> know<00:02:03.890> for<00:02:04.890> a

nice some nice things but like I said

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.720 
nice some nice things but like I said
there<00:02:09.780> are<00:02:09.810> some<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.349> lot<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:10.950> little<00:02:11.190> touch

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
there are some a lot of little touch

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.430 
there are some a lot of little touch
where<00:02:11.970> if<00:02:12.239> a<00:02:12.420> child<00:02:12.659> was<00:02:12.810> using<00:02:13.050> us<00:02:13.140> on<00:02:13.290> their

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
where if a child was using us on their

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.080 
where if a child was using us on their
own<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:14.340> could<00:02:14.459> just<00:02:14.640> get<00:02:14.760> him<00:02:14.909> into<00:02:15.060> a

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
own you could just get him into a

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.160 
own you could just get him into a
location<00:02:15.480> where<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.870> may<00:02:15.959> not<00:02:16.080> necessarily

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
location where you may not necessarily

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.899 
location where you may not necessarily
want<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.680> have<00:02:16.860> them<00:02:17.129> so<00:02:17.310> for<00:02:17.819> this

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
want to have them so for this

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.670 
want to have them so for this
application<00:02:18.120> if<00:02:18.629> you<00:02:18.720> have<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.840> Dino<00:02:19.080> Dan<00:02:19.349> fan

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
application if you have a Dino Dan fan

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.110 
application if you have a Dino Dan fan
and<00:02:19.980> you're<00:02:20.340> going<00:02:20.459> to<00:02:20.519> use<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.760> together<00:02:20.879> with

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
and you're going to use it together with

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.000 
and you're going to use it together with
them<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:21.750> would<00:02:22.110> recommend<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.680> if<00:02:22.769> it's<00:02:22.890> an

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
them I would recommend it if it's an

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.500 
them I would recommend it if it's an
application<00:02:23.519> that<00:02:23.610> your<00:02:23.760> child<00:02:24.000> only<00:02:24.120> plays

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
application that your child only plays

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.059 
application that your child only plays
with<00:02:24.540> by<00:02:24.780> themselves<00:02:25.349> probably<00:02:25.739> wouldn't

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
with by themselves probably wouldn't

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.500 
with by themselves probably wouldn't
recommend<00:02:26.280> this<00:02:26.430> particular<00:02:26.610> one<00:02:27.090> there's

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
recommend this particular one there's

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.300 
recommend this particular one there's
other<00:02:27.659> Dino<00:02:27.959> Dan<00:02:28.260> ones<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:28.950> think<00:02:29.220> would

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
other Dino Dan ones that I think would

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.190 
other Dino Dan ones that I think would
be<00:02:29.400> able<00:02:29.489> ittle<00:02:29.940> bit<00:02:29.970> better<00:02:30.209> right<00:02:30.480> here<00:02:30.660> okay

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
be able ittle bit better right here okay

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.199 
be able ittle bit better right here okay
so<00:02:31.709> that's<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.040> Dino<00:02:32.220> Dan<00:02:32.519> Dino<00:02:32.879> erase

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
so that's the Dino Dan Dino erase

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.199 
so that's the Dino Dan Dino erase
application<00:02:34.110> from<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.190> Dino<00:02:35.370> Dan<00:02:35.640> bookshelf
