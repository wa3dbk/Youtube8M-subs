I<00:01:21.330> imagine<00:01:21.689> but<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> little<00:01:21.990> bit<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.229> a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
I imagine but it's a little bit of a

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.460 
I imagine but it's a little bit of a
problem<00:01:22.530> for<00:01:22.920> hours<00:01:23.990> like<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.110> say<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.290> is

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
problem for hours like I say this is

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.649 
problem for hours like I say this is
going<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.650> take<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.830> little<00:01:26.009> bit<00:01:26.250> time<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.210> load

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
going to take a little bit time to load

large and then you can see that it's

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.039 
large and then you can see that it's
indeed<00:03:47.320> much<00:03:48.190> bigger<00:03:48.519> when<00:03:48.820> we<00:03:48.970> go<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.750> create

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
indeed much bigger when we go to create

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:58.700 
indeed much bigger when we go to create
