basically<00:02:09.810> fan<00:02:10.259> detail<00:02:10.739> on<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.039> engines<00:02:12.800> top

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
basically fan detail on the engines top

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.860 
basically fan detail on the engines top
wing<00:02:14.069> detail<00:02:16.910> pretty<00:02:17.910> nice<00:02:20.420> let's<00:02:21.420> get<00:02:21.660> this

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
wing detail pretty nice let's get this

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.600 
wing detail pretty nice let's get this
out<00:02:22.140> of<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.350> way<00:02:24.920> let's<00:02:25.920> check<00:02:26.310> out<00:02:26.459> the

fuselage this is actually got a little
bit<00:02:46.680> of<00:02:46.829> weight<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.160> it<00:02:47.190> guys<00:02:51.079> see<00:02:52.079> how<00:02:52.200> that

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
bit of weight to it guys see how that

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.600 
bit of weight to it guys see how that
looks

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.860 

not<00:02:58.610> bad<00:03:00.280> for<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.370> being<00:03:02.240> a<00:03:02.330> plastic<00:03:02.720> model

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
not bad for the being a plastic model

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.930 
not bad for the being a plastic model
I'm<00:03:03.200> actually<00:03:03.380> really<00:03:03.709> impressed<00:03:04.160> with<00:03:04.459> the

I'm actually really impressed with the

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.220 
I'm actually really impressed with the
weight<00:03:05.120> of<00:03:05.270> this<00:03:05.420> here<00:03:05.690> again<00:03:05.900> this<00:03:05.990> is<00:03:06.050> my

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
weight of this here again this is my

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:15.550 
weight of this here again this is my
first<00:03:07.090> airliner<00:03:11.440> pretty<00:03:12.440> cool<00:03:14.320> so<00:03:15.320> we'll<00:03:15.470> get

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
first airliner pretty cool so we'll get

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.220 
first airliner pretty cool so we'll get
this<00:03:15.709> built<00:03:15.950> up<00:03:16.130> put<00:03:16.490> together<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:17.120> get<00:03:18.050> some

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230

more detailed pictures and photographs
and<00:03:20.810> I'll<00:03:21.470> see<00:03:21.650> what<00:03:21.770> I<00:03:21.800> can<00:03:21.830> put<00:03:22.040> together

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
and I'll see what I can put together

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.080 
and I'll see what I can put together
later<00:03:23.390> it<00:03:23.510> is<00:03:23.630> all<00:03:24.200> put<00:03:24.350> together

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
later it is all put together

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.670 
later it is all put together
put<00:03:26.090> up<00:03:26.209> on<00:03:26.360> its<00:03:26.510> stand<00:03:26.840> got<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.470> wheels

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
put up on its stand got the wheels

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.050 
put up on its stand got the wheels
attached<00:03:28.100> they'd<00:03:28.459> have<00:03:28.580> a<00:03:28.610> little<00:03:28.880> bit<00:03:28.970> of

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
attached they'd have a little bit of

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.510 
attached they'd have a little bit of
issue<00:03:29.180> with<00:03:29.420> these<00:03:30.050> rear<00:03:30.500> wheels<00:03:30.830> I<00:03:31.190> ended<00:03:31.430> up

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
issue with these rear wheels I ended up

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.100 
issue with these rear wheels I ended up
having<00:03:31.790> to<00:03:31.970> use<00:03:32.150> a<00:03:32.180> little<00:03:32.540> bit<00:03:32.630> of<00:03:32.720> glue<00:03:32.930> to

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
having to use a little bit of glue to

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:41.590 
having to use a little bit of glue to
get<00:03:33.200> them<00:03:33.380> to<00:03:33.500> hold<00:03:40.000> this<00:03:41.000> thing<00:03:41.300> is<00:03:41.450> just

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
get them to hold this thing is just

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:47.539 
get them to hold this thing is just
beautiful

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.369 

a<00:03:47.579> really<00:03:48.329> good<00:03:48.450> job<00:03:48.689> when<00:03:48.930> this<00:03:49.019> for<00:03:49.200> being

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
a really good job when this for being

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:51.349 
a really good job when this for being
plastic<00:03:49.950> and<00:03:50.189> I<00:03:50.519> think<00:03:50.849> I<00:03:50.909> mentioned<00:03:50.969> it

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:51.359 
plastic and I think I mentioned it

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:53.420 
plastic and I think I mentioned it
probably<00:03:51.840> pulled<00:03:52.409> a<00:03:52.500> fuselage<00:03:52.890> out<00:03:53.129> but

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
probably pulled a fuselage out but

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.880 
probably pulled a fuselage out but
they've<00:03:54.120> got<00:03:54.299> to<00:03:54.450> embed<00:03:54.870> some<00:03:54.900> weight<00:03:55.379> inside

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
they've got to embed some weight inside

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.890 
they've got to embed some weight inside
of<00:03:56.010> this<00:03:56.159> it's<00:03:56.700> definitely<00:03:57.329> got<00:03:57.480> some<00:03:57.510> weight

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
of this it's definitely got some weight

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.500 
of this it's definitely got some weight
to<00:03:57.930> it<00:03:58.170> doesn't<00:03:58.819> obviously<00:03:59.819> when<00:04:00.120> you<00:04:00.209> feel<00:04:00.390> it

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
to it doesn't obviously when you feel it

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.420 
to it doesn't obviously when you feel it
it<00:04:00.599> feels<00:04:00.629> like<00:04:00.959> plastic<00:04:01.170> but<00:04:01.620> as<00:04:01.709> far<00:04:01.920> as<00:04:01.950> the

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
it feels like plastic but as far as the

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.649 
it feels like plastic but as far as the
weight<00:04:02.609> goes<00:04:04.489> there's<00:04:05.489> definitely<00:04:06.239> something

00:04:06.649 --> 00:04:06.659 
weight goes there's definitely something

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:09.440 
weight goes there's definitely something
in<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:07.079> little<00:04:07.620> bit<00:04:07.769> of<00:04:07.889> a<00:04:07.980> scuff<00:04:08.430> right<00:04:08.849> here

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
in it a little bit of a scuff right here

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.059 
in it a little bit of a scuff right here
I<00:04:09.480> don't<00:04:09.780> know<00:04:09.870> if<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.079> camera<00:04:10.500> will<00:04:10.620> pick<00:04:10.920> up

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
I don't know if the camera will pick up

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:13.429 
I don't know if the camera will pick up
on<00:04:11.250> it<00:04:11.629> but<00:04:12.629> there's<00:04:12.840> definitely<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.260> little

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 
on it but there's definitely a little

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:17.180 
on it but there's definitely a little
bit<00:04:13.560> of<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.739> scuff<00:04:14.730> or<00:04:15.000> scratch<00:04:15.329> but<00:04:16.100> for<00:04:17.100> the

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
bit of a scuff or scratch but for the

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.979 
bit of a scuff or scratch but for the
most<00:04:17.310> part<00:04:17.639> for<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.259> price<00:04:20.660> roughly<00:04:21.660> I<00:04:21.690> think

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
most part for the price roughly I think

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.480 
most part for the price roughly I think
