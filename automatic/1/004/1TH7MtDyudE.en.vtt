00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:09.250
 welcome to Italian home cooking 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.710
 today's traditional recipe 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.889
 Tuscan-Romagna Apennines and ragù di 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:18.280
 wild boar wild boar already see it in 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:22.179
 marina ta rossa with its vegetables which 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:25.029
 they will be used to prepare ragù e 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:25.869
 not mandatory but I think they are there 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.539
 well 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.660
 a nice catch of dried porcini mushrooms 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:35.710
 they are quitting in warm water 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.920
 I start by preparing a carrot e 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.649
 a clove of garlic cut with a knife 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.020
 because I like the carrot to be seen 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.870
 and feel in the wild boar sauce 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.660
 the rest of the vegetables are what they are 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.760
 instead in the marina ta le 3 ter o 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.059
 along with a portion of the meat of 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.059
 boar 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:03.640
 here we are ready let's go into the big one 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.510
 protagonist of all our ragù 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.600
 vegetables along with a nice spin of oil from 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.619
 the good one will be Tuscan oil this 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.350
 time possibly for which tasty 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.369
 we combine the vegetables and put the pot 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.310
 of earthenware 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.340
 to begin to warm up after having it 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.030
 wet to prevent p in 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.090
 cooking 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.630
 if the crock pot is placed on it 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.850
 on gas and you don't have the 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.340
 old stove that was used to make the 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.979
 ragù used 1 spandi flame 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:42.310
 otherwise you risk looking like the pot 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.590
 and to have bad meat 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.320
 which is preferably used for 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.530
 preparing the wild boar ragù is la 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.530
 shoulder that as we can see is fat 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.380
 and thin the pieces of lean put them from 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.920
 part because I will cut there with a knife 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.500
 those instead a little more monsters them 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.619
 I can add to the mince so as to 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.050
 have a very homogeneous fund for the 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.270
 ragout and at the same time 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.690
 the pleasure of hearing the bits of 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.240
 meat cut with a chopped knife 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:19.450
 I also combine the vegetables he used to 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.850
 the marinade including the onion with i 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.580
 cloves pickled with bulls 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.400
 of carnation in order to have a good 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.100
 perfume also in the radio as and 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.500
 we get the wild boar ground 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.310
 we will add to the pot that 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.350
 is cooking we continue to mix the 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.530
 our milled until not 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:44.350
 you will see more on the bottom of the pot the 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.660
 red color of the wine that will be faded 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.170
 all because logically a bit of wine 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.810
 absorbed by the meat there is and is good for 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.980
 to flavor but not good if then ragusa 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.740
 of wine 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.650
 we combine a little clove and the 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:03.700
 cinnamon stick always two rare father 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:06.580
 on the perfume and we cut the part that 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.140
 we kept our own knife 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:13.840
 wild boar with very small pieces 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.810
 because it will then have to accompany or 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.260
 pappardelle if you cook it in the same way 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:24.580
 Tuscan or strozzapreti seat 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:27.920
 we will cook in the Romagna style 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:31.420
 we combine the cut part with the knife of 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.420
 boar labor minister 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:42.290
 always mix a little now as you see 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:49.490
 my sauce is going on a high flame 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:56.900
 now I will combine the beautiful tomato 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:59.060
 plenty for a pound of meat at least 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.740
 half a kilo of tomato and maybe even 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.440
 more 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:05.780
 and then lower the flame because the sauce 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.750
 wild boar exactly like that 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:11.710
 traditional must sigh not cook 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.710
 on an open flame 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:19.760
 let us slowly boil ours 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:24.130
 lake for at least a couple of hours then to that 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:24.130
 point it will be time to combine the mushrooms 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.870
 we cover and let him work then vi 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.000
 you will ask for the wine of the marinade what 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.600
 I throw it away 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:38.750
 if you want you can add this wine 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.910
 three quarters of a quarter of this wine a 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.920
 three quarters of water and use it for 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.990
 fertilize the flowers and an excellent fertilizer 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.300
 natural 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.310
 let's remember to mix the ragù every 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:56.660
 so much and when it came half-cooked 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:05:00.110
 we can add our porcini which 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.780
 streets and robben and so yes 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.110
 they cook and give our ragù perfume 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.110
 of wild boar 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:12.070
 already there are 

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.070
 I add a first pinch of salt 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:19.010
 the continuous cooking is always covered 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:22.940
 so that it evaporates very slowly 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:25.070
 good cooking wild boar meat on 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.830
 wild boar ragu is so ready 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:30.320
 good that in addition to pasta you can 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:33.080
 appreciate it even simply on a 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.090
 bread crouton as rich me 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.120
 linda oh traditional aperitif 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:37.120
