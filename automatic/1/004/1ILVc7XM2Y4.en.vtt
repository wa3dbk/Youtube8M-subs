him just a little bit that might be a

of the zone when he shouts in blue flags

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.820 
of the zone when he shouts in blue flags
he<00:01:03.629> wants<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.960> car<00:01:04.260> out<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.619> way

eventually<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.640> does<00:01:05.820> he's<00:01:06.390> now<00:01:06.630> gone<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.470> DRS

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
eventually it does he's now gone the DRS

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.039 
eventually it does he's now gone the DRS
a<00:01:08.010> little<00:01:08.580> house<00:01:08.820> he's<00:01:09.420> got<00:01:09.600> too<00:01:09.810> deep

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049

Sebastian<00:01:10.680> threatened<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.220> turn<00:01:11.400> 11<00:01:11.840> though

this<00:01:13.080> reserve<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.860> detection<00:01:14.220> point<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:15.060> I

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
this reserve is the detection point so I

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.679 
this reserve is the detection point so I
think<00:01:15.270> that'll<00:01:15.810> work

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
think that'll work

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.499 
think that'll work
in<00:01:17.469> a<00:01:17.499> second<00:01:17.950> going<00:01:18.100> off<00:01:18.340> so<00:01:18.969> the<00:01:19.090> traffic's

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
in a second going off so the traffic's

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:21.599 
in a second going off so the traffic's
cost<00:01:19.810> is<00:01:20.020> put<00:01:20.289> animals<00:01:20.979> in<00:01:21.069> really<00:01:21.369> on<00:01:21.490> his

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:21.609 
cost is put animals in really on his

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:23.760 
cost is put animals in really on his
