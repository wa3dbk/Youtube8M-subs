00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello youtube friends this is for 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.459
 materials again on this occasion les 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.959
 I bring a video so that we learn to 

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:10.860
 place the fan directly 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:11.400
 radiator of the waves good here is the 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.040
 car 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.750
 this is a sling as we can observe and 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.310
 this serves us quite this 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.940
 that I'm going to show you for when we 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.860
 we go down is the fan even sometimes 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.500
 When the car has water, let's observe 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.180
 you have to be cold I am very lowered 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.180
 I'm burning it 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.730
 when the car is with water and has 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.460
 overheated from road in some 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.600
 part is due to this small sensor that 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:44.620
 is here by the one that is attached to the wing 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.780
 at the top of the water everything that we 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.370
 we make that patxi head is that 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.070
 you observe ain gray 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.910
 and tell the masters with a click this is the 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:59.329
 patita that we have to let go and 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.760
 bridge masters with a clip this so that the 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.159
 fan that direct and stays cool 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.600
 all the time and avoid more damage 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.310
 serious in the engine us what 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.990
 we have to do is fold a clip or a 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.810
 piece of cable what you want 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.290
 in this way to deceive the 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.460
 computer and think that the circuit 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.320
 has closed or is doing the functions 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:25.070
 that acs that sensor that I'm playing there 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.960
 and when it heats up be closed close 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.210
 the circuit then we're going to 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.649
 close to deceive her and think that the 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.060
 car is always hot and she 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:36.050
 simply what you are going to do is give the 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.360
 that signal that triggers the 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.320
 While this fan placed camarita 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.320
 let's try 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.149
 all right 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.149
 okay 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:55.600
 and I'm insured in a little hole and in 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.600
 the other little hole 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:03.120
 because it must look like this 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:07.730
 if it is 1 in each contact 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.730
 making a bridge we leave this here 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.819
 and we will open the car or suiche 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.739
 You do not even have to learn it 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.530
 it is not supposed that the 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.120
 fan because the car is cold 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.920
 but as we put it in automatic what 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.880
 we place directly then the car of 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:27.400
 lifetime 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:30.340
 to turn on the fan let's go 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.710
 with this cut 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:40.430
 well close 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.430
 and there we see the fan running 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.850
 this thanks for watching me chao
