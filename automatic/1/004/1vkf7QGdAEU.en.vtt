00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.270 
like it does on the 3ds just choose any
blank<00:01:56.300> icon<00:01:56.690> and<00:01:56.960> a<00:01:57.050> create<00:01:57.410> folder<00:01:57.740> icon<00:01:58.100> will

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
blank icon and a create folder icon will

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.850 
blank icon and a create folder icon will
show<00:01:58.490> up<00:01:58.670> and<00:01:58.880> you<00:01:59.840> can<00:02:00.020> title<00:02:00.620> it<00:02:00.710> whatever

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860

show up and you can title it whatever
you<00:02:01.190> want<00:02:01.340> so<00:02:01.580> we're<00:02:01.730> just<00:02:01.760> gonna<00:02:02.090> title<00:02:02.660> this

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
you want so we're just gonna title this

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.430 
you want so we're just gonna title this
one<00:02:04.570> but<00:02:06.370> because<00:02:07.370> why<00:02:07.580> not<00:02:07.820> and<00:02:08.289> we're<00:02:09.289> gonna

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
one but because why not and we're gonna

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.820 
one but because why not and we're gonna
go<00:02:09.709> ahead<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.069> move<00:02:10.700> it<00:02:11.000> into<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:11.870> folder<00:02:12.019> now

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
go ahead and move it into the folder now

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.530 
go ahead and move it into the folder now
if<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:13.160> just<00:02:13.340> drop<00:02:13.700> it<00:02:13.730> in<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.120> folder<00:02:14.390> within

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
if you just drop it in the folder within

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.510 
if you just drop it in the folder within
the<00:02:14.720> first<00:02:14.930> second<00:02:15.410> it'll<00:02:15.620> just<00:02:15.830> place<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.280> on

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
the first second it'll just place it on

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.370 
the first second it'll just place it on
the<00:02:16.640> first<00:02:17.030> available<00:02:17.180> space

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
the first available space

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.740 
the first available space
but<00:02:19.130> otherwise<00:02:19.610> you<00:02:19.910> can<00:02:20.090> just<00:02:20.360> hold<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.720> down

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
but otherwise you can just hold it down

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.190 
but otherwise you can just hold it down
for<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:21.170> second<00:02:21.560> or<00:02:21.650> so<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:23.780> can<00:02:23.900> just<00:02:24.050> put

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
for a second or so and you can just put

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.080 
for a second or so and you can just put
it<00:02:24.260> wherever<00:02:24.440> in<00:02:25.130> case<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.550> need<00:02:25.670> to<00:02:25.820> put<00:02:26.000> it

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
it wherever in case you need to put it

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.420 
it wherever in case you need to put it
in<00:02:26.210> a<00:02:26.270> specific<00:02:26.450> spot<00:02:26.930> but<00:02:27.230> like<00:02:28.130> I<00:02:28.190> said<00:02:28.340> it

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
in a specific spot but like I said it

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.340 
in a specific spot but like I said it
works<00:02:28.610> just<00:02:28.880> like<00:02:29.000> the<00:02:29.210> 3d<00:02:29.420> s<00:02:29.570> folders<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.110> just

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
works just like the 3d s folders it just

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.460 
works just like the 3d s folders it just
looks<00:02:30.800> a<00:02:30.920> lot<00:02:31.100> cleaner<00:02:31.280> and<00:02:32.050> you<00:02:33.050> know<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.230> can

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
looks a lot cleaner and you know you can

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.220 
looks a lot cleaner and you know you can
tell<00:02:33.800> which<00:02:34.130> folders<00:02:34.580> which<00:02:34.850> much<00:02:35.630> easier<00:02:36.050> now

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
tell which folders which much easier now

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.830 
tell which folders which much easier now
if<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.620> haven't<00:02:36.830> had<00:02:37.100> your<00:02:37.510> first<00:02:38.510> initial

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840
