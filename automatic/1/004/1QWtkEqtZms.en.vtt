times an area of time when BP were
expanding<00:00:35.309> and<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.460> worked<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.880> area<00:00:36.120> of

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530

additives for the oil and gas industry

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.970 
additives for the oil and gas industry
and<00:00:43.640> that<00:00:44.640> was<00:00:44.879> for<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:46.260> couple<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.530> years<00:00:46.590> and

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
and that was for a couple of years and

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.380 
and that was for a couple of years and
then<00:00:47.100> I<00:00:47.280> moved<00:00:47.550> slightly<00:00:47.820> up<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> supply

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
then I moved slightly up the supply

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.330 
then I moved slightly up the supply
chain<00:00:48.420> there<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.020> moved<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.410> IC<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:49.890> one<00:00:50.219> of

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
chain there and moved to IC I one of

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.869 
chain there and moved to IC I one of
their<00:00:50.489> suppliers<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:52.399> started<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.550> sort<00:00:53.850> of

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
their suppliers and started in sort of

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.060 
their suppliers and started in sort of
R&amp;D<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.570> will<00:00:55.320> be<00:00:55.379> called<00:00:55.469> applications

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
R&amp;D and will be called applications

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.529 
R&amp;D and will be called applications
development<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.730> essentially<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.210> interface

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
development so essentially the interface

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.560 
development so essentially the interface
between<00:00:57.890> between<00:00:58.890> R&amp;D<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.579> the<00:01:00.149> sales

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
between between R&amp;D and the sales

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.680 
between between R&amp;D and the sales
process<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.340> as<00:01:02.340> my<00:01:02.520> progressed<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:03.600> became

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
process and as my progressed it became

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.719 
process and as my progressed it became
more<00:01:04.049> more<00:01:04.290> commercially<00:01:05.159> oriented<00:01:05.309> unless

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
more more commercially oriented unless

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.700 
more more commercially oriented unless
unless<00:01:06.060> technical<00:01:06.540> oriented<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.080> mean<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:07.650> think

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
unless technical oriented I mean I think

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.130 
unless technical oriented I mean I think
as<00:01:08.010> as<00:01:08.280> my<00:01:08.490> per<00:01:08.549> group<00:01:08.729> career<00:01:09.240> progressed<00:01:09.689> I<00:01:09.869> I

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
as as my per group career progressed I I

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.520 
as as my per group career progressed I I
came<00:01:10.350> out<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:11.360> out<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.479> my<00:01:12.570> PhD<00:01:12.750> thinking<00:01:13.350> that

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
came out of out of my PhD thinking that

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.289 
came out of out of my PhD thinking that
the<00:01:14.310> way<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.460> was<00:01:14.520> going<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.729> contribute<00:01:15.090> in

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
the way I was going to contribute in

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:16.850 
the way I was going to contribute in
this<00:01:15.390> world<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.780> through<00:01:15.960> solving<00:01:16.409> scientific

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
this world is through solving scientific

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.160 
this world is through solving scientific
problems<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.670> quite<00:01:18.330> quickly<00:01:18.689> realize

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
problems and you quite quickly realize

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.859 
problems and you quite quickly realize
that<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.890> lot<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.729> scientists<00:01:21.180> scientific

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
that a lot of scientists scientific

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.030 
that a lot of scientists scientific
problems<00:01:22.170> are<00:01:22.320> great<00:01:22.590> but<00:01:22.740> they're<00:01:22.830> only<00:01:22.920> a

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
problems are great but they're only a

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.830 
problems are great but they're only a
small<00:01:23.280> part<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.700> what<00:01:23.970> influences<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> world

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
small part of what influences the world

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.899 
small part of what influences the world
and<00:01:25.460> I<00:01:26.460> think<00:01:27.390> I<00:01:27.770> gradually<00:01:28.770> quite<00:01:29.670> quickly

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
and I think I gradually quite quickly

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.960 
and I think I gradually quite quickly
actually<00:01:30.530> then<00:01:31.530> realize<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.460> what<00:01:32.880> you're

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
actually then realize that what you're

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.120 
actually then realize that what you're
really<00:01:33.060> looking<00:01:33.210> at<00:01:33.420> is<00:01:33.570> people<00:01:34.200> problems<00:01:34.530> so

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
really looking at is people problems so

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.069 
really looking at is people problems so
I<00:01:35.159> got<00:01:35.520> involved<00:01:35.729> with<00:01:35.970> some<00:01:36.030> suppliers<00:01:36.810> and

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
I got involved with some suppliers and

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.960 
I got involved with some suppliers and
some<00:01:37.200> collaborations<00:01:37.770> all<00:01:38.250> over<00:01:38.549> although

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
some collaborations all over although

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.100 
some collaborations all over although
they're<00:01:39.150> in<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.299> scientific<00:01:40.520> context<00:01:42.049> that<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
they're in a scientific context that the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.020 
they're in a scientific context that the
determine<00:01:43.680> of<00:01:43.770> success<00:01:44.130> or<00:01:44.280> not<00:01:44.310> would<00:01:44.579> be<00:01:44.700> can

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
determine of success or not would be can

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.520 
determine of success or not would be can
you<00:01:45.090> influence<00:01:45.299> somebody<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.899> do<00:01:46.259> what<00:01:46.409> you're

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
you influence somebody to do what you're

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.859 
you influence somebody to do what you're
doing<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:47.700> I<00:01:47.759> think<00:01:47.939> as<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.060> continue<00:01:48.840> in

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
doing and I think as you continue in

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.179 
doing and I think as you continue in
your<00:01:48.930> career<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.470> realise<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.159> actually

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
your career you realise that actually

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.620 
your career you realise that actually
these<00:01:50.610> people<00:01:50.939> problems<00:01:51.240> all<00:01:51.450> about

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
these people problems all about

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.910 
these people problems all about
influence<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.290> trying<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.530> extend<00:01:52.770> your

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
influence and trying to extend your

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.389 
influence and trying to extend your
level<00:01:53.460> of<00:01:53.490> influence<00:01:54.110> ultimately<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:56.280> comes

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
level of influence ultimately it comes

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.170 
level of influence ultimately it comes
down<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.790> can<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.420> financially<00:01:58.079> quantify

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180
