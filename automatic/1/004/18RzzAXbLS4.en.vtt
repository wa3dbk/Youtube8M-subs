00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:02.770
 how you do that 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.350
 today i'm going to color day makes the two ran well 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.999
 what needed the biggest problem 

00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:11.859
 very important 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:14.619
 gas stove clean 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.910
 it looks like there is a regular high voltage power supply that 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.089
 has been developed by galaxy you 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.150
 and that the western block is the most important part of 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:31.149
 ciz and richer in you in which the and the old are exerted according to ictr a 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:34.149
 keep plot of women that would soon have been able to hold 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.200
 that's because I make it myself the silver corkscrew homemade cowell money 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.340
 what i exactly the same 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.340
 and of course it is not understood 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.130
 distilled water from the market and the malicious 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.670
 this is free for the injections 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.670
 and this is fine 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.420
 so two meters of water fall to the boil of the rinse it later 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.840
 understand 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.990
 now all soft feeding is now roaring 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.159
 distilled water does not normally boil with bubbles and can 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.610
 very believable if you have two ribs 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.820
 due to the lack of stopping 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.790
 they can't choke a bubble 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.710
 if it forms a bell then it does want to explode as it were 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.450
 so it is wise to 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.280
 to take the lead if you also have to get big 10 in the 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.240
 columns 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.649
 so that you like the songs of games and the common man 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:41.090
 efforts that way the 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.780
 we don't want to be can anymore 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.230
 that is the water that is used to coke these are the 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.240
 salt lion folds in brussels our bare body 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.160
 restaurants in cubes also one 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.570
 the unions are a very important part, little bit longer part 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.040
 also other direction 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.240
 this feels good can see 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.440
 long that could 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.890
 distance knew the involved 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.100
 That actually goes for the desired oxfam range 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.129
 well i will keep doing that fired him 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:17.789
 and that is the western bob team, the institution and the bronze 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:22.629
 we still have the cables, but there is also in the device in the meantime 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.629
 power is still turned off 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.179
 according to let's that 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.599
 on it appeared a glass so that all codes could come 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:37.949
 just as important that come without water 

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:41.049
 m 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.049
 a job 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.799
 and then turn 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.689
 the first also recently completely left 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:51.849
 just as long 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.849
 because we are the first to moore the shops 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.319
 on the other hand 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.319
 with this position 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.319
 how to open the further process it simply continues to exist 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:10.019
 moody's newspaper 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.019
 the only thing we do is it the electrodes we tune every time 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.189
 more importantly everything is clean, it is not so much the time 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:21.439
 registered respect but more 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.769
 to prevent that of course not getting into the water 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.399
 but once that happens 

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:28.749
 then the whole choir pours everyone 

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:31.749
 we can start again 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:35.059
 we are now releasing a little further 

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:37.519
 manufacturing process 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.809
 to hear in the cell 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:42.989
 I hope it is a bit clear spokesperson for the film 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:46.859
 something needs to be done about it 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:48.239
 the every dead 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.319
 But then you don't need more than that you usually mean that you have the 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.319
 scribbling years can park the sound can be heard 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:59.969
 from a certain rhythm and I am a tricolore that actually has the atmosphere 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:01.629
 closer together 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.729
 to be put 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:08.049
 a nice pink color distinguishes that I also have a bit 

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:11.479
 cynicism 

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:14.479
 so far came 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.549
 too bad its now about an hour in process 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.789
 you could say we now 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:25.240
 just around 6 6 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.639
 ppn 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.210
 it's pretty big 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:33.210
 I thought it was good too 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.460
 Witsel became another high frequency visitor
