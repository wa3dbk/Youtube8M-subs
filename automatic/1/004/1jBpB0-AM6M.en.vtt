carry<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.970> rest<00:01:30.210> which<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.479> kind<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.689> original

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
carry the rest which is kind of original

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.149 
carry the rest which is kind of original
on<00:01:31.170> aneta<00:01:31.380> queen<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.770> I'm<00:01:31.829> going<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.009> be<00:01:32.070> able

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
on aneta queen and I'm going to be able

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.179 
on aneta queen and I'm going to be able
to<00:01:32.400> switch<00:01:33.180> out<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.960> opie<00:01:34.259> news<00:01:34.470> because

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
to switch out to the opie news because

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.200 
to switch out to the opie news because
it<00:01:36.380> walls<00:01:37.380> poliwrath<00:01:38.070> two<00:01:38.430> main<00:01:38.610> stab<00:01:38.909> moves

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
it walls poliwrath two main stab moves

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.749 
it walls poliwrath two main stab moves
and<00:01:39.509> even<00:01:40.500> though<00:01:40.650> he's<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> physically

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
and even though he's a physically

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:42.950 
and even though he's a physically
defensive<00:01:42.360> pelipper<00:01:42.630> not<00:01:42.810> especially

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
defensive pelipper not especially

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.240 
defensive pelipper not especially
defensive<00:01:43.530> he's<00:01:43.649> gonna<00:01:43.740> take<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.009> had<00:01:44.159> to

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
defensive he's gonna take that had to

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.590 
defensive he's gonna take that had to
come<00:01:44.369> very<00:01:44.549> well<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:45.090> going<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.329> go<00:01:45.420> for<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
come very well just going to go for the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.730 
come very well just going to go for the
air<00:01:45.750> /<00:01:46.020> because<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.380> would<00:01:46.470> be<00:01:46.500> super

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
air / because it would be super

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.830 
air / because it would be super
effective<00:01:47.100> against<00:01:47.490> poliwrath<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.240> if<00:01:48.720> he

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
effective against poliwrath and if he

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.780 
effective against poliwrath and if he
knows<00:01:48.990> my<00:01:49.140> playing<00:01:49.409> style<00:01:49.500> which<00:01:49.920> he<00:01:50.040> does<00:01:50.220> he

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
knows my playing style which he does he

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.719 
knows my playing style which he does he
might<00:01:50.820> be<00:01:51.060> predicting<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.509> toxic<00:01:52.020> I<00:01:53.009> think<00:01:53.640> he

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
might be predicting a toxic I think he

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.069 
might be predicting a toxic I think he
probably<00:01:53.880> was<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.540> that's<00:01:54.659> why<00:01:54.750> he<00:01:54.899> brought

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
probably was and that's why he brought

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.050 
probably was and that's why he brought
this<00:01:55.259> guy<00:01:55.439> in<00:01:55.649> so<00:01:58.130> yeah<00:01:59.130> that's<00:01:59.790> not<00:01:59.909> gonna

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
this guy in so yeah that's not gonna

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.520 
this guy in so yeah that's not gonna
work<00:02:00.119> out<00:02:00.360> very<00:02:00.450> well<00:02:00.570> for<00:02:00.689> him<00:02:00.990> since<00:02:01.290> my

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
work out very well for him since my

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.039 
work out very well for him since my
pelipper<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.670> surprisingly<00:02:03.240> going<00:02:03.509> out<00:02:03.630> speed

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
pelipper is surprisingly going out speed

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.109 
pelipper is surprisingly going out speed
I<00:02:04.259> don't<00:02:04.799> really<00:02:04.950> know<00:02:05.159> much<00:02:05.399> about<00:02:05.460> beautifly

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
I don't really know much about beautifly

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.080 
I don't really know much about beautifly
or<00:02:06.360> what<00:02:06.509> speed<00:02:06.869> stat<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.380> but<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.710> assumed<00:02:08.090> that

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
or what speed stat is but I assumed that

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.669 
or what speed stat is but I assumed that
since<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:09.840> weak<00:02:10.020> to<00:02:10.140> stealth<00:02:10.410> rocks

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
since it's so weak to stealth rocks

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.650 
since it's so weak to stealth rocks
being<00:02:11.039> offensive<00:02:11.430> set<00:02:11.700> not<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.879> defensive<00:02:12.420> sex

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
being offensive set not a defensive sex

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.640 
being offensive set not a defensive sex
hit<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.930> switch<00:02:13.080> into<00:02:13.230> defense

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
hit the switch into defense

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.369 
hit the switch into defense
pokes<00:02:13.799> a<00:02:13.890> lot<00:02:14.069> so<00:02:14.939> yeah<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.810> was<00:02:15.989> surprised<00:02:16.290> i

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
pokes a lot so yeah I was surprised i

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.839 
pokes a lot so yeah I was surprised i
did<00:02:16.560> not<00:02:16.650> speed<00:02:16.920> so<00:02:17.370> i'm<00:02:17.430> going<00:02:17.489> to<00:02:17.610> go<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.760> my

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
did not speed so i'm going to go to my

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.970 
did not speed so i'm going to go to my
whisk<00:02:18.540> cash<00:02:18.780> because<00:02:19.110> it's<00:02:19.260> part<00:02:19.439> ground<00:02:19.739> type

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
whisk cash because it's part ground type

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.350 
whisk cash because it's part ground type
thinking<00:02:20.459> that<00:02:20.610> when<00:02:20.760> he's<00:02:20.879> this<00:02:21.000> far<00:02:21.209> behind

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
thinking that when he's this far behind

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.050 
thinking that when he's this far behind
he<00:02:21.780> can't<00:02:22.079> really<00:02:22.349> afford<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:23.220> not<00:02:23.549> go<00:02:23.760> for<00:02:23.970> the

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
he can't really afford to not go for the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.759 
he can't really afford to not go for the
obvious<00:02:24.209> play<00:02:24.689> which<00:02:24.959> is<00:02:25.079> the<00:02:25.200> electric<00:02:25.560> move

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
obvious play which is the electric move

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.319 
obvious play which is the electric move
and<00:02:26.010> i'm<00:02:26.549> pretty<00:02:26.700> sure<00:02:26.939> he<00:02:27.030> doesn't<00:02:27.209> have<00:02:27.299> the

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
and i'm pretty sure he doesn't have the

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.119 
and i'm pretty sure he doesn't have the
HP<00:02:27.510> grass<00:02:27.930> because<00:02:28.290> I<00:02:28.349> kind<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.650> know<00:02:28.799> his<00:02:28.920> play

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
HP grass because I kind of know his play

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.050 
HP grass because I kind of know his play
style<00:02:29.370> because<00:02:29.700> we<00:02:29.790> have<00:02:29.879> a<00:02:29.909> lot<00:02:30.030> of

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
style because we have a lot of

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.479 
style because we have a lot of
experience<00:02:30.599> battling<00:02:30.959> each<00:02:31.079> other<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.500> yeah

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
experience battling each other and yeah

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.140 
experience battling each other and yeah
he's<00:02:32.760> going<00:02:32.909> to<00:02:32.970> for<00:02:33.180> charge<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.810> then<00:02:34.170> go<00:02:34.439> for

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
he's going to for charge and then go for

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.360 
he's going to for charge and then go for
toxic<00:02:36.150> while<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.480> go<00:02:37.170> for<00:02:37.349> a<00:02:37.379> DD<00:02:37.769> on<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.099> switch

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
toxic while I go for a DD on the switch

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.420 
toxic while I go for a DD on the switch
now<00:02:38.720> because<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:40.109> was<00:02:40.590> thinking<00:02:41.010> he<00:02:41.159> was<00:02:41.310> going

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
now because I was thinking he was going

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.690 
now because I was thinking he was going
to<00:02:41.489> go<00:02:41.609> into<00:02:41.790> something<00:02:42.269> with<00:02:43.129> immunity<00:02:44.129> to

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
to go into something with immunity to

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.660 
to go into something with immunity to
Anna<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.569> grounded<00:02:46.200> type<00:02:46.349> attack<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.519> that's

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
Anna a grounded type attack and that's

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.039 
Anna a grounded type attack and that's
going<00:02:47.819> to<00:02:47.879> work<00:02:47.940> out<00:02:48.090> pretty<00:02:48.239> well<00:02:48.389> for<00:02:48.510> me<00:02:48.780> and

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
going to work out pretty well for me and

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.390 
going to work out pretty well for me and
even<00:02:49.379> if<00:02:49.470> he<00:02:49.560> didn't<00:02:49.829> it<00:02:49.889> would<00:02:49.980> probably<00:02:50.190> work

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
even if he didn't it would probably work

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.500 
even if he didn't it would probably work
out<00:02:50.609> because<00:02:50.760> I<00:02:50.909> don't<00:02:51.060> think<00:02:51.209> he<00:02:51.269> could<00:02:51.420> have

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
out because I don't think he could have

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.750 
out because I don't think he could have
done<00:02:51.690> too<00:02:51.930> much<00:02:52.079> to<00:02:52.290> me<00:02:52.440> with<00:02:53.040> that<00:02:53.069> guy<00:02:53.430> and

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
done too much to me with that guy and

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.330 
done too much to me with that guy and
that<00:02:53.819> plus<00:02:54.480> one<00:02:54.750> I<00:02:55.019> would<00:02:55.349> easily<00:02:55.889> be<00:02:56.159> able<00:02:56.280> to

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
that plus one I would easily be able to

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.559 
that plus one I would easily be able to
take<00:02:56.459> him<00:02:56.609> on<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.819> following<00:02:57.180> turn<00:02:57.329> and<00:02:57.480> I'll

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
take him on the following turn and I'll

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.080 
take him on the following turn and I'll
speed<00:02:57.810> probably<00:02:58.319> so<00:02:58.980> all<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.400> is<00:02:59.579> good<00:02:59.760> for

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
speed probably so all that is good for

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.210 
speed probably so all that is good for
me<00:03:00.120> take<00:03:01.049> out<00:03:01.200> his<00:03:01.379> whatever<00:03:01.799> with<00:03:02.040> a

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220
