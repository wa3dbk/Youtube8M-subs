00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello greek hotel for green to 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.980
 points as welcome for a new 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.450
 episode on the winning sequences in 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.719
 boxing feet fists in the first two 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.960
 episodes we saw the combination itself 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.500
 arm but legs then arm leg 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.000
 opposite 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.490
 there we will see a little bit of 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.080
 combination of the two I recommend 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.310
 often tried to start with 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.630
 points when we want to put a shot of 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.359
 foot pass brushed by the leg 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.990
 directly so one of the ways that 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.210
 I like it back it's going to be the devil 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:34.260
 and the inner peak so here I start 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:40.920
 with my jab as a pasha this is a 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:44.370
 interior chic look in Switzerland when I 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.039
 fall before I fall in cross 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.350
 ok big i'm going shifted on my 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.170
 next and swing the back leg 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.270
 this time in idol or high kick by 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.550
 example no it's not 2 3 4 and 5 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:04.170
 we find here the two concepts 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:06.290
 ravenna legs and then arm leg 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.290
 opposite 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.490
 good access for not to risk 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.910
 to be countered the decline begins 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.320
 already have continuous access or a 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.940
 linking gmail used on 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.860
 people who backs up a lot but who 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.960
 basically back online they 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.720
 make the mistake of not turning that goes 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.400
 to be a devil cross when I see that 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.610
 the person recoil I will take a step 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.970
 with my back leg and come get 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:43.140
 unethical front leg no it gives 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:45.540
 that I'm not a big fan of 3 we can 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.010
 add behind other things 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:53.160
 so it is 1 2 see go cross 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.940
 and for example the interior optics 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.940
 first possibility 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.240
 5 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.670
 if the person stays a little a little 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.270
 little more on the spot after the start I 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.760
 am here Hercules 2 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.070
 I will be able to place my back leg 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.030
 is that if it moves back and end it 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.209
 continues to go back 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.430
 I'm going to do cros and then it allows me to 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.090
 continue to advance 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.090
 if she is there 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.200
 even bring back legs and then I'll be able 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.090
 to hurt well or blow and even go down 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.010
 on the lot type for really gone 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:38.020
 push your shin into your thigh 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.150
 falls back other web that I like 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.170
 although they spend well in general 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.030
 yeah the trench of the same arm 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.030
 hook one pushes when send them the 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:53.770
 person down there and practice the 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:56.709
 back leg so that gives two women 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.890
 three hung a little bit heavy for 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:04.239
 send the bus to the other side and that the 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.739
 nobody impales on ethics 1.23 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.080
 what I like to do work 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.300
 then always from his 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.459
 tracking the a61 rebalance a cross 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.980
 to learn to take back well 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:18.459
 support after his kick so there a 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.860
 right I resume my support you want 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:27.760
 not start a second sequence 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:29.320
 behind what gives us I give towards 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.720
 the variant with a little jump on the 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:39.030
 kick in the end 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:39.030
 3 take last slowed 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:47.310
 pick up the cuy cross next biopic 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.380
 for a sequence to be effective it 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.270
 must be fluid must not be 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.100
 of hesitation in the sequence so 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.080
 how are we going to get to that? 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.360
 a lot of repetitions in a first 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.040
 time we can make the petition with a 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.180
 partner but if we do not have 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.080
 partner we can also do them at 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.380
 punching bag 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.670
 at first I recommend you start 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.650
 without moving place and 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.970
 so chaining with displacements 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.220
 that there will be within soon 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.110
 but leave at the stop more fur and at 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.820
 able to try to be comfortable succeed 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.980
 to place them while being in motion 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.720
 who will bring a little closer to the fight 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.180
 most of his strings can 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.440
 be placed also against but this 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.060
 will be the subject of another video 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.900
 I remind you that every Tuesday I 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.370
 answers one of the questions of 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.960
 netizens if you want to ask thielle 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.150
 click on the link in the description 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.400
 is like jelly always the one who believes 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.770
 know does not learn anymore so let go of the 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.060
 do and do not forget frankly 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.060
 more heartbreaking reached
