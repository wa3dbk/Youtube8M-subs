I<00:00:48.120> thought<00:00:49.120> I'd<00:00:49.270> lost<00:00:49.420> Reverse<00:00:49.899> but<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:50.920> bolt

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.160 
I thought I'd lost Reverse but the bolt

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.040 
I thought I'd lost Reverse but the bolt
for<00:00:51.460> the<00:00:51.489> linkage<00:00:51.940> just<00:00:52.239> came<00:00:52.449> loose<00:00:52.690> so<00:00:52.930> it

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
for the linkage just came loose so it

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.920 
for the linkage just came loose so it
wasn't<00:00:53.350> connecting<00:00:54.180> so<00:00:55.180> like<00:00:55.480> it<00:00:55.660> would<00:00:55.780> work

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
wasn't connecting so like it would work

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.830 
wasn't connecting so like it would work
going<00:00:56.620> into<00:00:56.829> drive<00:00:57.190> but<00:00:57.879> like<00:00:58.030> for<00:00:58.239> reverse<00:00:58.570> it

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
going into drive but like for reverse it

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.270 
going into drive but like for reverse it
would<00:00:58.930> just<00:00:59.109> loose<00:00:59.379> it<00:00:59.410> would<00:00:59.739> just<00:00:59.920> act<00:01:00.100> like

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
would just loose it would just act like

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.599 
would just loose it would just act like
it<00:01:00.430> was<00:01:00.550> really<00:01:00.760> loose<00:01:00.969> and<00:01:01.269> not<00:01:01.420> working<00:01:02.609> so

00:01:03.599 --> 00:01:03.609 
it was really loose and not working so

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:04.920 
it was really loose and not working so
he<00:01:03.730> went<00:01:03.850> back<00:01:03.969> to<00:01:04.120> the<00:01:04.210> pits<00:01:04.420> and<00:01:04.540> found<00:01:04.750> that

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
he went back to the pits and found that

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.499 
he went back to the pits and found that
I'll<00:01:05.110> put<00:01:05.320> that<00:01:05.530> on<00:01:05.590> and<00:01:06.100> it<00:01:06.670> worked<00:01:06.970> fine<00:01:09.509> then

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
I'll put that on and it worked fine then

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.190 
I'll put that on and it worked fine then
in<00:01:10.810> the<00:01:10.960> consolation<00:01:11.590> I<00:01:13.619> kept<00:01:14.619> losing<00:01:14.979> a

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
in the consolation I kept losing a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.819 
in the consolation I kept losing a
throttle<00:01:17.200> cable<00:01:18.630> off<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.689> pedal<00:01:20.409> up<00:01:20.560> there

00:01:20.819 --> 00:01:20.829 
throttle cable off the pedal up there

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.380 
throttle cable off the pedal up there
like<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:22.020> legs<00:01:23.020> hang<00:01:23.259> you<00:01:23.560> can't<00:01:23.770> see<00:01:23.979> it<00:01:24.070> but

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
like the legs hang you can't see it but

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.450 
like the legs hang you can't see it but
the<00:01:25.390> cable<00:01:25.840> that<00:01:25.990> wraps<00:01:26.290> into<00:01:26.619> the<00:01:26.770> pedal

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
the cable that wraps into the pedal

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.149 
the cable that wraps into the pedal
itself<00:01:27.970> kept<00:01:28.240> coming<00:01:28.570> up<00:01:28.659> through<00:01:29.049> so<00:01:29.680> it<00:01:29.860> keep

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
itself kept coming up through so it keep

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.240 
itself kept coming up through so it keep
falling<00:01:30.700> out<00:01:30.790> so<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:32.560> had<00:01:32.680> to<00:01:32.740> keep<00:01:32.890> redoing

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
falling out so I had to keep redoing

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.350 
falling out so I had to keep redoing
that<00:01:34.409> other<00:01:35.409> than<00:01:35.680> that<00:01:35.829> it<00:01:36.009> was<00:01:36.070> fine<00:01:36.369> it<00:01:37.180> got

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
that other than that it was fine it got

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.740 
that other than that it was fine it got
really<00:01:37.600> hot<00:01:37.869> I<00:01:37.899> lost<00:01:38.290> the<00:01:38.500> radiator<00:01:41.520> and<00:01:42.750> then

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
really hot I lost the radiator and then

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.020 
really hot I lost the radiator and then
so<00:01:44.409> I<00:01:44.439> made<00:01:44.680> it<00:01:44.799> to<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.009> feature<00:01:45.220> I<00:01:45.640> won<00:01:45.909> the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
so I made it to the feature I won the

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.749 
so I made it to the feature I won the
consi<00:01:46.509> and<00:01:48.270> later<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.479> find<00:01:49.689> out<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:51.610> the

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
consi and later to find out that the

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.679 
consi and later to find out that the
battery<00:01:52.180> cable<00:01:53.610> ripped<00:01:54.610> off<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:55.210> starter

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
battery cable ripped off the starter

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.959 
battery cable ripped off the starter
from<00:01:55.990> the<00:01:56.140> positive<00:01:56.790> on<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:58.000> battery<00:01:58.380> and

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
from the positive on the battery and

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.910 
from the positive on the battery and
when<00:02:00.969> I<00:02:01.000> upload<00:02:01.479> the<00:02:01.960> consolation<00:02:02.649> video

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
when I upload the consolation video

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.850 
when I upload the consolation video
you'll<00:02:03.130> see<00:02:03.219> sparks<00:02:04.030> coming<00:02:04.539> out<00:02:04.750> from<00:02:05.049> right

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
you'll see sparks coming out from right

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.280 
you'll see sparks coming out from right
down<00:02:05.890> here<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:07.780> a<00:02:07.990> lot<00:02:08.320> of<00:02:08.530> sparks

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.479 

so<00:02:11.799> that's<00:02:11.980> why<00:02:12.099> I<00:02:12.129> didn't<00:02:12.340> run<00:02:12.459> the<00:02:12.489> feature

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
so that's why I didn't run the feature

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.009 
so that's why I didn't run the feature
but<00:02:15.489> that's<00:02:16.030> all<00:02:16.209> they<00:02:16.360> took<00:02:16.510> me<00:02:16.659> out<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:16.989> I

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
but that's all they took me out and I

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:19.550 
but that's all they took me out and I
think<00:02:17.319> my<00:02:17.530> starter<00:02:18.010> may<00:02:18.159> be<00:02:18.220> closed<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:19.000> junk

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
think my starter may be closed to junk

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.559 
think my starter may be closed to junk
but<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.620> don't<00:02:20.829> know<00:02:21.120> but<00:02:22.120> then<00:02:22.269> here's<00:02:22.480> the

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
but I don't know but then here's the

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.809 
but I don't know but then here's the
damage<00:02:22.750> on<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.409> started<00:02:23.980> nosing<00:02:24.189> a<00:02:24.519> little

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
damage on it it started nosing a little

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.839 
damage on it it started nosing a little
bit<00:02:24.939> more<00:02:25.379> you<00:02:26.379> can<00:02:26.590> see<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.890> slanting<00:02:27.400> frying

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
bit more you can see the slanting frying

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:31.199 
bit more you can see the slanting frying
now<00:02:28.709> and<00:02:29.709> I<00:02:29.769> kind<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.099> evened<00:02:30.519> it<00:02:30.610> out<00:02:30.730> on<00:02:30.970> both

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
now and I kind of evened it out on both

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:06.510 

it's<00:04:00.220> bending<00:04:00.490> weird<00:04:03.930> so<00:04:04.930> that's<00:04:05.110> that<00:04:05.350> and<00:04:05.650> on

reason<00:04:11.890> I<00:04:12.100> got<00:04:12.280> out<00:04:12.340> was<00:04:12.670> because<00:04:13.000> I<00:04:13.150> drove

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.180 
himself down into a big puddle I hit him
right<00:04:22.300> on<00:04:22.540> the<00:04:22.720> wheel<00:04:22.990> well<00:04:23.260> or<00:04:23.500> here<00:04:23.860> my

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
right on the wheel well or here my

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.130 
right on the wheel well or here my
bumper<00:04:24.580> went<00:04:24.760> over<00:04:25.060> his<00:04:25.150> tire<00:04:25.450> and<00:04:25.750> got<00:04:25.870> caught

up<00:04:26.320> and<00:04:26.500> caught<00:04:27.220> up<00:04:27.400> in<00:04:27.550> there<00:04:27.760> and<00:04:30.000> my<00:04:31.000> friends

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
up and caught up in there and my friends

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.970 
up and caught up in there and my friends
tried<00:04:31.630> getting<00:04:31.960> me<00:04:32.050> unhooked<00:04:32.470> but<00:04:32.830> they

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
tried getting me unhooked but they

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.390 
tried getting me unhooked but they
couldn't<00:04:34.290> so<00:04:35.290> I<00:04:35.320> got<00:04:35.530> fourth<00:04:35.830> in<00:04:36.010> that<00:04:36.040> that's

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
couldn't so I got fourth in that that's

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.590 
couldn't so I got fourth in that that's
the<00:04:36.490> only<00:04:36.640> reason<00:04:36.910> that<00:04:36.940> that's<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:37.360> only<00:04:37.420> way

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:37.600 
the only reason that that's the only way

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.340 
the only reason that that's the only way
I<00:04:37.720> got<00:04:38.050> out<00:04:39.030> as<00:04:40.030> you<00:04:40.210> can<00:04:40.360> see<00:04:40.540> this<00:04:40.810> was<00:04:41.050> packed

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.350 
I got out as you can see this was packed

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.500 
I got out as you can see this was packed
in<00:04:42.000> in<00:04:43.000> there<00:04:43.830> but<00:04:44.830> they<00:04:45.760> hooked<00:04:46.030> the<00:04:46.210> chain

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
in in there but they hooked the chain

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:47.850 
in in there but they hooked the chain
when<00:04:46.780> they<00:04:46.870> pulled<00:04:47.140> me<00:04:47.290> off<00:04:47.320> the<00:04:47.410> other<00:04:47.650> car

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
when they pulled me off the other car

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.020 
when they pulled me off the other car
they<00:04:48.010> hooked<00:04:48.250> it<00:04:48.370> through<00:04:48.520> here<00:04:48.700> and<00:04:48.760> it<00:04:48.880> came

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
they hooked it through here and it came

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.330 
they hooked it through here and it came
out<00:04:49.240> so<00:04:49.270> all<00:04:49.570> this<00:04:49.810> was<00:04:50.530> folded<00:04:50.980> under<00:04:51.220> the

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:51.340 
out so all this was folded under the

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:58.230 
out so all this was folded under the
trunk<00:04:53.010> the<00:04:54.010> rear<00:04:54.220> ends<00:04:54.490> fine<00:04:56.790> other<00:04:57.790> than<00:04:58.060> that

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
trunk the rear ends fine other than that

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.550 
trunk the rear ends fine other than that
it's<00:04:58.419> straight<00:04:58.810> you're<00:04:59.020> not<00:04:59.050> really<00:04:59.350> going<00:04:59.500> to

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
it's straight you're not really going to

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.200 
it's straight you're not really going to
get<00:04:59.680> too<00:04:59.800> much<00:04:59.830> damage<00:05:00.430> on<00:05:00.580> a<00:05:00.610> frame<00:05:00.970> that's

get too much damage on a frame that's

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:07.080

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
motors this motor runs that one don't at

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.880 
motors this motor runs that one don't at
the<00:05:10.570> moment<00:05:10.600> because<00:05:11.169> of<00:05:11.200> the<00:05:11.350> cables<00:05:11.770> and

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
the moment because of the cables and

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.800 
the moment because of the cables and
starter<00:05:12.370> but<00:05:12.880> it<00:05:13.000> was<00:05:13.090> running<00:05:13.330> at<00:05:13.510> the<00:05:13.540> end<00:05:13.690> of

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
starter but it was running at the end of

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.590 
starter but it was running at the end of
the<00:05:13.870> consi<00:05:14.350> I<00:05:17.669> didn't<00:05:18.669> run<00:05:18.790> a<00:05:18.820> back<00:05:19.060> bumper<00:05:19.510> on

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:19.600 
the consi I didn't run a back bumper on

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.390 
the consi I didn't run a back bumper on
this<00:05:19.780> car<00:05:20.020> because<00:05:20.410> that's<00:05:20.680> what<00:05:20.950> the<00:05:21.070> bumper

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
this car because that's what the bumper

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.140 
this car because that's what the bumper
looked<00:05:21.580> like<00:05:21.790> after<00:05:21.970> Monroe

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.340 

and<00:05:28.800> when<00:05:29.800> you<00:05:29.890> guys<00:05:30.040> see<00:05:30.810> the<00:05:31.810> aftermath<00:05:32.200> of

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
and when you guys see the aftermath of

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.280 
and when you guys see the aftermath of
this<00:05:32.680> from<00:05:33.130> Greene<00:05:33.670> County<00:05:34.090> you'll<00:05:34.960> see<00:05:35.170> what

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
this from Greene County you'll see what

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.840 
this from Greene County you'll see what
else<00:05:35.410> talking<00:05:35.680> about<00:05:35.980> what<00:05:36.070> the<00:05:36.190> hoses<00:05:36.580> as<00:05:36.700> you

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
else talking about what the hoses as you

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.480 
else talking about what the hoses as you
can<00:05:36.970> see<00:05:37.180> right<00:05:37.330> here<00:05:37.860> you<00:05:38.860> wrap<00:05:39.130> them<00:05:39.310> in

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
can see right here you wrap them in

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.980 
can see right here you wrap them in
there<00:05:39.640> and<00:05:39.730> put<00:05:39.940> fluid<00:05:40.270> in<00:05:40.390> it<00:05:40.510> because<00:05:40.870> these

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
there and put fluid in it because these

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.230 
there and put fluid in it because these
four<00:05:41.230> boxes<00:05:41.770> they<00:05:41.950> need<00:05:42.160> fluid<00:05:42.640> on<00:05:42.850> the<00:05:42.970> gears

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
four boxes they need fluid on the gears

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.670 
four boxes they need fluid on the gears
because<00:05:43.360> when<00:05:43.540> it<00:05:43.660> dries<00:05:43.780> up<00:05:44.080> and<00:05:44.140> get<00:05:44.380> hit<00:05:44.530> the

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
because when it dries up and get hit the

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.860 
because when it dries up and get hit the
gears<00:05:44.920> will<00:05:45.100> break<00:05:46.090> or<00:05:46.360> chip<00:05:46.390> or<00:05:46.840> something

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
gears will break or chip or something

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.500 
gears will break or chip or something
that's<00:05:47.410> why<00:05:47.560> I<00:05:47.590> lost<00:05:47.830> my<00:05:47.950> steering<00:05:48.460> and<00:05:48.580> knurl

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.910 

so<00:05:52.510> you<00:05:52.600> can't<00:05:52.810> really<00:05:52.960> do<00:05:53.140> much<00:05:53.170> of<00:05:53.500> a<00:05:53.590> damage

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920 
so you can't really do much of a damage

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.100 
so you can't really do much of a damage
