00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.060
 very good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.340
 new video on this occasion I love you 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.380
 bring another build the barbarian another species 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.280
 of guidance but this time I want to do it 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.480
 for russia the failures of torments 6 already 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.250
 which varied from you because you have 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.830
 said in comments or by messages 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.260
 private that if it's good then given that 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.600
 itself in the previous video on the web of 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.820
 the upper faults I could see myself 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.740
 doing the failure well enough with 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.720
 quite easily and it was a failure of 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.670
 torments 6 because I did not record any of 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.550
 superior failure can be raised doubt 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.469
 if it is what the previous one 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.149
 it served well for torment 6 obviously 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:39.729
 yes as you are fine as you saw in the 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.649
 previous video perfectly serves what 

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:43.539
 more and the will much more effective for the 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.699
 failure of torment 6 and that will cause the 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:48.159
 we take out more speed and good 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.629
 basically because it is this is 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.489
 well I 'll explain it now without 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.619
 entertain me more first we'll talk about the 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.719
 equipment that we will need and in this 

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:58.209
 occasion we will use five parts 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.909
 from the tier of the pÃ¡ramos in the amulets 

00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:02.949
 we'll take the fire skeleton then in the 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.719
 the belt of chila knicks that makes 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.070
 when we use the cry of 

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:07.240
 battle as it increases our 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.950
 speed 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.560
 movement of our our ally a 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.970
 30 or a 40 for 10 seconds that what 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.369
 that makes us move much more 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.890
 fast and we can russian much better those 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.450
 reapers like in the bracelets that is what 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.430
 that will make every one that we take then 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.560
 esfero health on the ground as 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.450
 will restore our fury so 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.149
 we could both use with greater 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.950
 loose the whirlwind and danny I can 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.500
 wear the ring of the elements or the 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.840
 jordan stone or the other ring that is 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.330
 the focus between those three, then you can 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.670
 choose one that will come to us equally 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.459
 well and finally because in weapons what 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.659
 most important of all those that are 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:46.179
 required one hundred percent together with 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.100
 the six pieces of tier I think before 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.080
 said five but good are six forgive 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.179
 We will take the weapons 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.369
 we should all take them both so 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:55.720
 well when they leave then you know that 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.670
 you can become this grandmother to 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.920
 so then better if I only had one 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.750
 two-handed weapon because you can use the 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.939
 abulic explain in the previous video 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.399
 the gems if they are exactly the same 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.759
 that the previous one will be the scourge of 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:11.920
 those arrested the taeguk and finally 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.360
 the pain enhancer 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.890
 once explained the equipment that 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.900
 we will need to start talking with 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.700
 the skills one of them will be the 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.349
 dismember with the mutilated rune the 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.930
 anger went crazy too that we will continue 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.069
 using with your a dementia too 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.110
 we must get the battle cry 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.610
 with its impunity that as you know 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.110
 will not give strength to all 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.880
 other elements of the skills that 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.440
 we have to choose will be the law of blood 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.690
 with his rune bloodshed 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.819
 important the skill of the given sprint 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.190
 that what interests us is doing the 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.110
 fail as quickly as possible since it 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.519
 assumes that the team already has it that way 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.890
 that is not going to be any kind of problem 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.840
 putting in more skills or 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.610
 less damage this time we will use 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.980
 as I said the spring with its rune 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.569
 marathon that increases the bonus by 40% 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.040
 of movement speed instead of being 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:56.080
 30 percent what you have from 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.910
 base and finally and how could it be from 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.470
 another way in this build we will have to 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.600
 use the whirlpool that our 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.489
 main skill also and using 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.840
 the rune of blood boiling since the 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.630
 tornado rune we will get it 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.850
 passively thanks to the six bonus 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.049
 pieces of loses we stop and already for 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.150
 finish talking about the skills 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.370
 Well, let's talk about those that we 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.989
 they passively effect or the boeing 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.250
 naming and now you when you go 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.260
 placing in 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.110
 Realistic skills first 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.630
 we will have to use mercilessly the 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:28.090
 second master of weapons 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.430
 the third debauchery and finally 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.440
 quarrelsome now is the time to quote 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.480
 basically, the distribution 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.860
 distribution of the stop points that 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.110
 we will be getting as we go 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:39.700
 raising those levels that go up to 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.890
 from level 70 and are the following 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.420
 we start with the primary tab and 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.100
 the order is this 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.320
 first of all we should put 50 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.750
 points in the speed of movement and 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.520
 then assign all points forces 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.440
 although good if you have plenty of points 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.690
 you have a lot of level of standing 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.520
 you can give him 50 points maximum fury if 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.140
 want or raise some point of vitality 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.370
 in case your team would give 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.050
 little of this 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.640
 still as I said first the 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.459
 Movement speed until you reach 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.230
 the 50 points that is the maximum and then 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.030
 the force that does not have any kind of 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.370
 limit on the attack tab first 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.170
 we will raise 50 points in the blow damage 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.510
 critical later on the probability of 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.250
 critical hit then 50 points 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:19.780
 in attack speed and finally the 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:21.669
 reduction of cooldown 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.050
 going to the defense tab the 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:24.940
 priority is the following first the 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.100
 resistance all the most important 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.780
 50 points as quickly as possible and if not 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.000
 they will create us in second place 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.890
 the armor would be later in life and 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.210
 finally the regeneration of life and 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.220
 to end with the distribution of points 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.870
 of legend we have to talk about the 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.940
 utility tab and the order is the 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.800
 next first the reduction 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.410
 of the cost of resources in second place 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.390
 the damage of area in third life by 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.250
 hit and last and why you have to 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.780
 put it the gold find that as 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.270
 happened in the previous guild because we did not 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.180
 It serves practically nothing although good 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.860
 here in the failure of 36 and they release gold 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.600
 and well, it's something more bright 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.160
 we are going to take and to end with 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.710
 this vile because we only have to talk 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.840
 of the gems in the weapon we will use the 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.760
 emerald as always in pants and 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.860
 chest rubies and finally in the 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.600
 helmet we will use the amethyst that we 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.730
 it gives more percent of life and we 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.470
 will help us not to kill these 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.060
 levels of failure and nothing else I hope 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.370
 have solved any doubt you already have 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.950
 the two built one of them that is this 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.780
 to solve the torment failures 6 and 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.730
 another which is prior to 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.770
 fight as higher level failures 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:28.360
 very high you know that if you liked it 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.460
 you can leave it to me reflected in the video 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.569
 with the button I like you can add it 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.339
 your favorite list 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.679
 in your social networks so that 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:37.779
 the video so it looks much more and you 

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:39.309
 I got a lot more people from me 

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:40.749
 I leave my tower of both facebook and 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:42.039
 twitter down here in the description of 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:43.899
 this same video and as I always say 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:47.039
 thank you very much for watching and see you 

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:47.039
 in the next one until then
