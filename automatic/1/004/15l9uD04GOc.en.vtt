00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.030
If a picture is worth a thousand words, what's
a video worth?

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.580
Well yes, here in Captivate 6, you can import
video into your projects, and there's a couple

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.590
of different ways to do it.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.530
One option is to bring it in as an object
that sits on your slide, giving your users

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.570
full control over that video object.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.430
Another option is to make it part of your
slide, and synchronize it with other items

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.220
that might show up on the slide.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.940
We'll talk about that in the next lesson.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.019
Right now, let's focused on bringing in some
video as an object on a slide.

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.930
We're going to continue working here with
our Volunteer Orientation project, and if

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.869
you need to get caught up, you're jumping
to this lesson; go to the Chapter4 folder

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:01.980
of your Exercise Files, and open up Volunteer_orientation_SAMOCA18.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.860
We'll click over here in the Filmstrip on
slide number 9, or Vision, because we want

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.130
our new slide to go right after this.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.050
When we go to insert a new slide, we're going
to look at a new way to get content.

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.220
Go to Insert &gt; New Slide from, and we'll go
over to our layouts here, and choose one that

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.650
includes content.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.620
And in this way, we have the layout already
set up for us; it's just a matter of choosing

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:28.750
the right type of content, which in our case
will be a video.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.470
So here we have some with captions, and the
content on the left, or the content on the

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.470
right.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.770
How about content right in the middle, or
center?

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.750
Let's choose Content - Center, and there's
our new slide with our placeholders.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.700
Let's double-click to add a title; we'll begin
there by typing in the name of the person

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.320
we're going to see in this video.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.640
His name is Jim Sugar.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.210
Next, we have double-click to add subtitle.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.190
Put in a subtitle by double-clicking, and
type in Photographer.

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.549
Now it's a matter of getting the content,
which could be text, or it could be content

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.240
from this content wheel.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.200
Let's zoom in to see what that looks like.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.209
We'll go to our dropdown to choose a zoom
level of 100.

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.780
As we scroll over, we're not going to be adding
text here; we're going to use the Content

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.790
Wheel, and on the Content Wheel, there's a
number of different types of content.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.010
If we go to this first little section here,
we can Insert Animations, or Text Captions.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:33.599
How about Text Animations, Images, and there
it is: Insert Video Object.

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.680
The Flash logo is kind of important; I'll
tell you why in a second.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.380
Let's just click Video Object first.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.470
This opens up a new window, Import Video,
which could reside on your computer, or it

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.060
could already be deployed to a Web server,
and if you know the exact location -- it does

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.530
have to be an FLV file; a Flash Video file
-- if it's using the HTTP protocol, you would

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.790
enter that URL in the URL field.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.661
If it's streaming video, using RTMP protocol,
you need to know the exact folder name, and

00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:06.180
you would enter that here as well.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.030
But for our purposes, I have something for
you on the computer in your Exercise Files,

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.930
so we'll choose On your Computer.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.060
The File Path; we could type it in, or use
Browse.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.350
Here in the Chapter4 folder, there it is;
jim sugar short bio, and notice it is an FLV

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.520
file.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.620
That's a Flash video.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.190
Look down below at the supported video formats.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.350
Here we have FLV, F4V, also Flash; we also
have MP4.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.390
If you were to choose something like MP4,
let's say we did have that format, there is

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.220
an Adobe Media Encoder that automatically
launches, and converts it to an FLV file that's

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.680
compatible.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.590
But in our case, we don't have to go through
that.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.030
We'll just select jim sugar short bio, and
click Open.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.800
Now what you're going to see is a full path,
and if you were to scroll over to the right,

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.190
the name of our file.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.120
we're ready to go; click OK.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.209
That just takes a moment, and you can see
it's inserted right on the slide; there it

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.440
is, and there are some important options to
consider.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.460
The length of our slide, for example, is about
four or five seconds.

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.129
The length of this video is much longer.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.250
So let's take a look over here with our Video
Object selected.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.001
Over here in the Properties, let's rename
it, first of all, from Video_Object_1 to Jim

00:04:23.001 --> 00:04:24.720
Sugar.

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.490
You can leave a space, and when you hit Enter,
you'll get the underscore character entered

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.080
for you.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.750
And we'll scroll up to see all of our properties,
including the General properties.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.360
Notice we have an option here to automatically
play it.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.780
I like that, so we don't have to hit a Play
button.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.770
It can automatically be rewound at the end
if you like; I do like that one.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.990
There is a skin that we'll see momentarily
when we preview this.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.340
Some other options, like adding shadow and
reflection.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.870
There is Timing; notice, it's displayed for
the rest of the slide.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.370
I like this down here: pause the slide till
the end of the video.

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.430
So it really doesn't matter how long the slide
appears; it's going to be paused until the

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.880
end of the video, and then it will move on
to the next slide.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.550
So let's scroll down a little further.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.020
We can add transitions, transformations; everything
looks good, so we don't really need to make

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.380
any adjustments.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.720
Let's just zoom back out to Best Fit from
our dropdown up here at the top on the Application

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.220
bar; choose Best Fit.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.840
And you can see that using the Skin that's
selected by default, there are some control

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.360
buttons here.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.360
You'll also see a Mute button over here on
the right-hand side.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.410
But let's see what it looks like using the
default.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.770
We'll go up to our Preview button, and we'll
play From this Slide.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:46.020
We'll let it generate, and see what happens.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:58.820
(video playing) Pressing Pause, we can see
we have some issues here with the actual proportion

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.280
of our content, and that's based on the layout
of our slide.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.860
So let's press Escape to go back.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.840
Now we can start making adjustments to our
content here; our video object.

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.570
For example, let's go down to the bottom right-hand
corner, when we see the double diagonal arrow,

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.160
we'll click and drag it across and down.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.420
That might be a better proportion.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.810
We can move this around, just like any other
object, and this is because of the way we

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:25.150
imported our video.

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:30.090
Let's go to the right here as well, and look
at the Properties, and try a different skin.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.350
When we click the dropdown for our Skins,
which is what we see around the outside of

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:39.030
our video, and the control buttons, try something
like haloSkin3.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.000
You can see there's actually more controls
here.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.740
Let's give that a shot; again, we'll preview
it From this Slide.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:52.930
It will regenerate the slides, and let's see
what happens.

00:06:52.930 --> 00:07:05.830
(video playing) All right!

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.169
Let's press Escape, and you can tell by the
quality of the video that we want to keep

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:12.610
it a size that was workable.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:19.300
We might want to just reduce the size of our
object even further, move it more into the

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.350
center, and we'll leave it like that.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:27.040
Now, automatically at the end of this video,
we'll move to the next slide, and that's because

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:33.430
the slide is paused until the end of the video,
where our timings in the Timeline will continue.

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:37.990
So that's one way of getting video into your
project as an object on the slide.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:43.590
Another option is to make it part of the slide;
even have it shown across multiple slides,

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:49.210
which gives you, then, the opportunity to
add other objects, and synchronize those objects

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:50.210
with your video.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:59.979
We'll talk about that next.
