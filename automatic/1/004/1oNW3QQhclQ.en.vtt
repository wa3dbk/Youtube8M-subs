 suites or bela tarr 31 as would 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.179
 and today we find ourselves for the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.189
 top 10 of the tm double k and yes this 

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:25.289
 week it's me who sticks to it so 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.429
 it's gone anyway I want to go 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.859
 some little info before 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.960
 start so the next top 10 this 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.340
 will be a top 10 so he camps sent 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.590
 the whole team as you could 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.120
 realize if you have the cam dereck that 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.190
 you will benefit tries to be the most 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.199
 original possible and you get yourself 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.780
 should go by without any problem 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.850
 then do not forget that at the end there to 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.559
 bonuses because often we see that 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.149
 there are some who stop to wolf too much 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.219
 do not really look at the bonuses 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.350
 hoist nice brief to the esj not wait 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.179
 longer we go right away 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.769
 went to the tenth position so of 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:57.149
 new small cutscenes in blue 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.519
 clear here to show a little the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.589
 class was is and wisi so he is sure 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:03.300
 career he'll see that he's a 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:05.760
 a little ahead of everyone 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.260
 before the top 10 that cabin shows that 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.330
 he is there anyway in this top 10 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.070
 double bang shot on an enemy who 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.370
 camped at the threshing machine it's done well 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.170
 for his mouth played well at war with y 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:18.270
 go to the ninth position guys 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.340
 always in small small diamond mode 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.750
 kinematics is nice is it then 27 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.340
 it is a spot that is really very 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.420
 original any case me who am not 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.320
 necessarily scalping I did not have 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.570
 the habit of loire and valves where he 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.160
 did not come back once but twice to 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.230
 killing him both enemies who is in 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.760
 catching b we see in mode 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.680
 studio the small view of the stomata 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.730
 frankly returned both on a spot 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.680
 also original on an electric pole 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.690
 had to make him say to play 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.820
 frankly it was original support to 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.890
 the 8th position his cookie solos 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.930
 go with the little Spanish accent you 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.370
 will we make tomahawk a little 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.420
 buddy throwing knives excuse me 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.890
 the scalpers I know I'm getting 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.510
 turn on us make a great quad 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.770
 fidan screen with stabs and 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.720
 throwing knives frankly well 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.480
 play on ghost especially on fred it's 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.300
 not obvious in seventh position dream 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.260
 kratos or rest 14 as I do not know 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.210
 how is it pronounced in any case 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.410
 something quite original so he 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.480
 will kill us in direct costs 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.009
 with his part to another style with his 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.899
 a knife to throw two shots 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.100
 of knife for the a5 fiden script and 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.080
 to make a small one as a bonus 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.190
 frankly it's a fifty this crime 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.080
 that we are not used to seeing and 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.510
 frankly well played to you 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.700
 go in 6th position guys we get 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.040
 found with s is so he is 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.600
 on newton 2025 on black ops two and one 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.130
 will see that he will see all the enemies 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.840
 in front of him make us a beautiful 5 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.340
 fiden screen which unfortunately passes 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.420
 pretty fast because of the last he or 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.070
 she a very very long long 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.050
 in short anyway the 5th dan sweeney and 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.360
 big gg in the east we're half of that 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.920
 top 5 so these tests w sharks so we have 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.200
 used to see him in these tops he 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.820
 seems to me when I already commented on john 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.440
 phan first when you give screen the 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.700
 maintain and maintain a 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.410
 third time so three poles to what 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.760
 you give screen pu finish on another one 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.410
 little he was advancing in the spawn 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.270
 quietly and make small they 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.770

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.970

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.620
 do you have the end but you still have 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.420
