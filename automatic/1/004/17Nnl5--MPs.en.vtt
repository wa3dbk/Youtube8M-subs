00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.820
 professor wines what is mastoplasty 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.830
 reductive reductive mastoplasty is a 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.670
 allowing surgery 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:20.430
 by means of incisions on the breast of 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.070
 reduce remodel and restore shape 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.189
 a breast too big indeed a breast 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.260
 giant is considered a breast that is of 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.359
 volume higher than it should 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.320
 be the normal volume of the breast of 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.210
 about 800 1000 grams a normal volume 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.910
 of sine is considered between one 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.230
 second a third a breast that weighs approximately 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.520
 300 350 grams as it unfolds 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.129
 the intervention is performed 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.680
 under general anesthesia 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.840
 in day hospital often in the giant 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.210
 most important male is performed 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.210
 with a night of hospital stay and has 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.160
 a duration of about a couple of hours 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.879
 the operation ends with scars 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.060
 which are around the vertical areola 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.100
 in small reductions or even in the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.040
 the so-called submammary groove 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.020
 scar or scar still invested 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.460
 in the case of very grateful signs 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.170
 in case you have to do one 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.710
 reductive mastoplasty on this 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.880
 patient the scars he will have to perform 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.940
 they are for vertical air and in the furrow 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.150
 the measurements, of course, under the breast 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.009
 they are extremely important 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.040
 preoperative mind and these come 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.330
 performed by a meter or by 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.220
 calipers to calculate the exact 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.850
 decrease we have to get e 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.340
 through tools also 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.340
 ready-made it is possible to draw in 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:58.140
 very precisely what will be the 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:02.580
 final result the scars are 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:04.700
 visual scars are visible in 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.800
 all surgical procedures 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.140
 consider, however, the healing 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:12.510
 must be evaluated at a distance of six 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.640
 months one year of the intervention and then in 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.080
 many cases the scars will be seen 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.910
 Very little 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.090
 are rare cases in which they are of 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.549
 currencies and scars among other things with 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.260
 modern techniques are not necessary either 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.310
 plus remove the stitches 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.350
 because the methods allow to 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.060
 restructure reshape the breast 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.510
 only with points and invisible interiors 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.700
 and with external leaves six 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.769
 normal size but talent and what it is 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.780
 in this case we can do 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.329
 to resort to an intervention called di 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.060
 mastopexy mastopexy is a 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.160
 breast remodeling with his 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:53.160
 normal volume so it does not come 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.320
 modified that the volume of the breast and is 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.170
 an intervention quite similar to that 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:01.620
 of reductive mastoplasty for 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.359
 played but stay a little longer 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.370
 limited and therefore recovery times 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.079
 generally they have a more rapid 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.720
 mastopexy rather than reduction 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.000
 not 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.220
 how the post course takes place 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.690
 operating 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.430
 the intervention as said yes executed in 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.950
 day hospital the patient is discharged 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.810
 immediately if not, the more often it comes 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.310
 performed with one night stay in 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.160
 clinic 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.560
 will be a couple of days at home rest with 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.350
 a simple bra but without big 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.360
 compressions or medications from the third 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.730
 day will start doing some more 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.100
 activities such as conducting 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.200
 car a week 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.700
 from the intervention redoes 70 percent 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.770
 of the things I did before 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.280
 one month after the intervention both in 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.540
 mammary reduction than in mastopexy 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.950
 will be able to start doing exactly again 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.700
 everything he did before 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.700
 intervention
