the<00:04:54.710> fact<00:04:54.920> that<00:04:55.160> Kevin<00:04:55.760> and<00:04:56.300> other<00:04:57.110> people

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
the fact that Kevin and other people

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.920 
the fact that Kevin and other people
involve<00:04:57.830> a<00:04:57.950> coil<00:04:58.220> restoration<00:04:58.970> is<00:04:59.210> from<00:04:59.780> the

00:04:59.920 --> 00:04:59.930 
involve a coil restoration is from the

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
pet industry so I think it's different
