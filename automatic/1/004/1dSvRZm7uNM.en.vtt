00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
is where the store that dual

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:15.590 
is where the store that dual
functionality<00:04:14.970> comes<00:04:15.120> in<00:04:15.240> a<00:04:15.270> really<00:04:15.480> great

play<00:04:15.780> is<00:04:15.930> something<00:04:16.170> that<00:04:16.230> I<00:04:16.290> think<00:04:16.380> this

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
play is something that I think this

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.740 
play is something that I think this
takes<00:04:17.340> much<00:04:17.580> better<00:04:17.790> advantage<00:04:18.000> of<00:04:18.330> compared

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
takes much better advantage of compared

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.720 
takes much better advantage of compared
to<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:18.930> ipad<00:04:19.080> and<00:04:19.530> why<00:04:19.799> if<00:04:20.370> you're<00:04:20.460> looking
