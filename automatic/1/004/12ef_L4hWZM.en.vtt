00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
like an electrical force field gate

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.300 
like an electrical force field gate
there<00:01:45.329> we<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.840> EMP<00:01:46.229> grenades<00:01:46.560> EMP<00:01:47.009> grenades

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
settlers you know we really try to make

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.800 
settlers you know we really try to make
it<00:02:24.790> diverse<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.079> with<00:02:26.560> a<00:02:26.590> lot<00:02:26.799> of<00:02:26.829> variety<00:02:27.010> and

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
it diverse and with a lot of variety and

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.890 
it diverse and with a lot of variety and
all<00:02:28.810> that<00:02:29.019> diversity<00:02:29.530> was<00:02:29.769> it<00:02:29.950> simply<00:02:30.459> to

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
all that diversity was it simply to

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.000 
all that diversity was it simply to
create<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:31.930> scenario<00:02:32.319> where<00:02:32.439> the<00:02:32.530> gamers<00:02:32.829> are

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
create a scenario where the gamers are

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.649 
create a scenario where the gamers are
able<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.489> influence<00:02:33.700> it<00:02:34.150> or<00:02:34.269> is<00:02:34.569> the

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
able to influence it or is the

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.270 
able to influence it or is the
experience<00:02:35.260> going<00:02:35.379> to<00:02:35.500> be<00:02:35.590> pretty<00:02:35.799> linear

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
experience going to be pretty linear

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.490 
experience going to be pretty linear
throughout<00:02:36.879> well<00:02:37.629> for<00:02:37.930> raids<00:02:38.109> we<00:02:38.319> like<00:02:38.439> to

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
throughout well for raids we like to

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.770 
throughout well for raids we like to
call<00:02:38.620> it<00:02:38.709> open<00:02:39.099> but<00:02:39.250> directive<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.299> there

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
call it open but directive so it there

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.679 
call it open but directive so it there
there<00:02:41.409> is<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.530> story<00:02:41.889> it's<00:02:42.549> a<00:02:42.609> deep<00:02:42.879> story<00:02:43.239> it's

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
concern how much it's going to be

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.950 
concern how much it's going to be

IP is that the the world is open to us
and<00:06:13.389> when<00:06:14.050> developing<00:06:15.010> the<00:06:15.130> game<00:06:15.310> you<00:06:15.550> know<00:06:15.639> we

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909 
and when developing the game you know we

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:18.649 
and when developing the game you know we
ourselves<00:06:16.060> are<00:06:16.599> gamers<00:06:16.870> when<00:06:17.800> something<00:06:18.159> cool
