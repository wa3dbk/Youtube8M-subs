than<00:00:09.540> what<00:00:09.780> I<00:00:09.929> probably<00:00:10.320> intended<00:00:10.740> it<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.010> be

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.310 
than what I probably intended it to be
but<00:00:11.820> I<00:00:11.849> really<00:00:12.120> struggle<00:00:12.420> with<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:12.960> designs

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
but I really struggle with the designs

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.900 
but I really struggle with the designs
on<00:00:13.469> these<00:00:13.590> ones<00:00:13.769> but<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.040> did<00:00:14.309> knock<00:00:14.490> out<00:00:14.639> four

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
on these ones but I did knock out four

little bush and all four corners our

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.319 
little bush and all four corners our
thought<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.700> neat<00:00:35.700> little<00:00:35.850> thing<00:00:36.000> just<00:00:36.300> to

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
thought is a neat little thing just to

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.020 
thought is a neat little thing just to
give<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.630> little<00:00:36.750> bit<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.140> color<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:38.550> floor

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
give it a little bit of color the floor

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.540 
give it a little bit of color the floor
is<00:00:39.270> made<00:00:39.540> out<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.870> gray<00:00:40.200> wall<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.680> spruce<00:00:41.309> wood

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
is made out of gray wall and spruce wood

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.030 
is made out of gray wall and spruce wood
planks<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.270> then<00:00:42.480> gray<00:00:42.840> wall<00:00:43.110> around<00:00:43.860> the

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
planks and then gray wall around the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.190 
planks and then gray wall around the
actual<00:00:44.610> lame<00:00:44.910> dining<00:00:45.390> table<00:00:45.629> itself<00:00:45.870> which<00:00:46.170> is

actual lame dining table itself which is

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.220 
actual lame dining table itself which is
pistons<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.910> some<00:00:48.660> reasoning<00:00:48.930> won't<00:00:49.050> let<00:00:49.170> me

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
pistons so some reasoning won't let me

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.680 
pistons so some reasoning won't let me
highlight<00:00:49.739> them<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.280> if<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.610> just<00:00:50.940> go<00:00:51.149> into<00:00:51.570> he

person and the comment suggested that I

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.819 
person and the comment suggested that I
do<00:01:44.670> sort<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.149> like<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> bar<00:01:46.079> stool<00:01:46.259> type<00:01:46.619> which

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
do sort of like a bar stool type which

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.010 
do sort of like a bar stool type which
basically<00:01:47.189> just<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.640> stair<00:01:48.180> facing<00:01:48.630> inwards

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
basically just a stair facing inwards

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.100 
basically just a stair facing inwards
and<00:01:49.670> then<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.030> normals<00:01:51.540> down<00:01:51.720> on<00:01:51.869> top<00:01:52.049> of

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
and then it's the normals down on top of

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.440 
and then it's the normals down on top of
that<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.560> kind<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.130> went<00:01:53.250> with<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> quartz<00:01:54.240> at

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
that I kind of went with the quartz at

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.539 
that I kind of went with the quartz at
the<00:01:54.570> bottom<00:01:54.899> just<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.200> give<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.439> like<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
the bottom just to give it like the the

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.880 
the bottom just to give it like the the
metal<00:01:56.909> look<00:01:57.420> because<00:01:58.320> that's<00:01:58.530> what<00:01:58.710> you'd

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
metal look because that's what you'd

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.670 
metal look because that's what you'd
normally<00:01:58.920> have<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.729> then<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.290> wooden<00:02:01.290> stare

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
normally have and then the wooden stare

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.080 
normally have and then the wooden stare
as<00:02:02.270> the<00:02:03.270> sort<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.869> seat<00:02:04.399> table<00:02:05.399> is<00:02:05.549> quite<00:02:05.790> big

table and then all the way around and

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:36.869 
table and then all the way around and
there<00:02:35.859> were<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:35.980> couple<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.310> cakes<00:02:36.549> in<00:02:36.790> the

design so just a normal Sam stone slab
then<00:03:04.480> at<00:03:04.599> Samsung<00:03:05.139> sand<00:03:05.769> stone<00:03:06.280> stair<00:03:07.239> really

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
then at Samsung sand stone stair really

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.559 
then at Samsung sand stone stair really
actual<00:03:08.560> saying<00:03:08.829> that<00:03:09.069> going<00:03:10.030> upwards<00:03:10.389> and

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
then a sort of an upside down slab there

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.990 
then a sort of an upside down slab there
so<00:03:14.560> it's<00:03:14.709> on<00:03:14.829> the<00:03:14.919> top<00:03:15.129> and<00:03:15.310> not<00:03:15.489> on<00:03:15.639> the<00:03:15.669> bottom

of<00:07:00.100> the<00:07:00.310> series<00:07:00.610> so<00:07:00.730> far<00:07:00.760> I've<00:07:01.180> done<00:07:01.330> some<00:07:01.510> far

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:01.990 
of the series so far I've done some far

far better ones but again you know you
can<00:07:05.110> mix<00:07:05.260> these<00:07:05.380> designs<00:07:05.710> up<00:07:05.920> you<00:07:06.010> can

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.130 
can mix these designs up you can

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.560 
can mix these designs up you can
probably<00:07:06.370> make<00:07:06.460> things<00:07:06.730> a<00:07:06.880> hell<00:07:06.970> of<00:07:07.030> a<00:07:07.180> lot

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:07.570 
probably make things a hell of a lot

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.270 
probably make things a hell of a lot
badness<00:07:07.960> if<00:07:08.170> you<00:07:08.320> give<00:07:08.500> it<00:07:08.530> a<00:07:08.710> bit<00:07:08.890> more<00:07:08.920> time

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:09.280 
badness if you give it a bit more time

badness if you give it a bit more time
it's<00:07:09.910> just<00:07:10.030> the<00:07:10.120> reason<00:07:10.450> I<00:07:10.480> had<00:07:10.630> to<00:07:10.750> knock<00:07:10.900> this

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:12.700 
out pretty quickly because obviously I

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.790 
out pretty quickly because obviously I
had<00:07:13.330> a<00:07:13.360> video<00:07:13.540> and<00:07:13.780> over<00:07:14.170> a<00:07:14.230> week<00:07:14.410> now<00:07:14.440> and<00:07:14.590> I
