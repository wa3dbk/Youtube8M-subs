00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.970
 Yes but here I want to actually go to the place that say that try to enter the sound on the piano roll 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.960
 But 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.530
 This I think has become a tram, for example, this is I think still wish I was a peer now this time 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.580
 right 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.630
 Why through and say to you will hear Once you bet whether and fruit if I Michido 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.440
 If this is a drum and you say that you don't know where it is 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.860
 I think, but this is also 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:28.720
 There is some degree of regularity, so let me introduce it here 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:32.740
 First Kedomo I'm a thing called Saturday on the place is It was this 100 million it is written, Te c 1 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:35.950
 It is a sound like it is to say that I bass drum is here 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:39.340
 And I 100 million was Umeno Re notebook is on it 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.430
 It's 9 d but it's already a snare here 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:45.590
 Also in many cases 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.810
 I also like the snare I think that you can see that the weakening tone is different, but this is also 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.440
 I think it would be better to choose the one you like 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:54.500
 And it is the last time you remember this time, but it's also a hi-hat 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.300
 Sounds like steel metal sounds like this 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.420
 This is a little bit of fa # Some different types of hi-hats are prepared 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.890
 But it is 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.080
 First, the most it is said that close Yes hard by a black keyboard of the generic high-hat sound of 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.930
 It is ok if you remember the rings 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:15.300
 That's right now Bass s Snare Drum Tee 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:19.770
 I wonder if you Which was let to see Well then this and Is that sharp in the first Author 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:24.360
 In fact it is Once you know the city that the sound will continue to perform driving by using the three that is heard 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.229
 Original four frames but driving I feel like going to perform as you click the other 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.620
 It will not be 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.920
 Even though this it is is got to common logic for most operations 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.040
 Related to washing with something 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.180
 It's time to do this pencil well 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.630
 Now I'm the two there which say they're going main it is the left and says that what it 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.009
 is 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.850
 That is the arrow now so this is the main and then the right and say second 

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:46.869
 It is 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.909
 It will change to this right tool only when pressing the command key . 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:54.710
 Well What Once you driving at it now performance piece is, for example, 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.749
 You can make an unusual noise on a pencil by clicking on it 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:01.340
 When I said it was too long 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:03.439
 Kedomo it is shortened by an arrow from here all the way when not in use only to the one this time 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.969
 It is pencil 1 com 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:09.929
 And I want to shorten the sound, so I choose the arrow once more 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:14.120
 So it takes quite a while 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:19.250
 Because of that, at this time a pencil while commanding 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.930
 And when you're finished editing, it's still like you're editing with the arrows 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.290
 I think that is common 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.610
 Well, it's a pencil when you hold down the command key with a second sur 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.720
 Let's set it up 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.140
 Now I have a look at it this time and I got a bass drum but this is also a pattern 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.400
 It is the first night It is very much a little to get basdora 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.130
 And this Snare Dora 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:42.600
 Let's put this in 200 people and the fourth beat 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:49.140
 This is also basic with many butters, so please remember here 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:52.530
 After when I the these form put major white smoke also here, let's put in a high hat 8 distribution 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.130
 I commented on the previous video, but this length 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.510
 I think this is just one bar 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:01.459
 One night is just this length 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:05.930
 And because it's an eighth note, this half is 8 questions pro permanent production 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:10.909
 And it is put to the hi-hat that and the region 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:16.500
 Or What a fine person it will be to go you'll ne And then No. 8 reconstruction by shifting now 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:17.210
 After you think you know as soon as is shifted the will continue by implanting in this repetition 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.360
 Entered was 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:26.500
 Let's listen to this pattern for a moment 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.500
 Please listen this play it is is because we are described in more detail in the video after this 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:34.460
 I think I can see how well I played on the beat. 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.200
 And it is said that I'm doing this kind of mistake I put in like this 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:42.120
 Sometimes it's easy and this arrow is the point 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.050
 Kedomo I'm tools choose it is in such Fu When you select an application that erased it this is a 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.920
 I just have to 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:49.920
 After that as a win the way because it disappears driving the same it is and press the delete key 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.970
 You can also try again many times 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.069
 And is it probably had if I have your watch I think that many people was worrisome 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.190
 But it is the length of the sound Kedomo 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.790
 For example, 85 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:03.790
 While saying that it is a note, this length is half etc 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.140
 Even if you think I think we do need to properly and is another flow a little in this kind of wind 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.530
 I think there are 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:12.940
 As for drums , adulthood doesn't matter at all 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:16.420
 I say What is does it mean to say that it is the length of the NES Uchikomo you but You're sound 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.209
 The optical axis also has a form that is completely irrelevant 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.750
 It is in the drum 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:24.850
 So I think it would be nice if you could just see the place where you entered 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.850
 First of all I think that you remember it is you so far
