 a cup of cactus a cup of spinach

 6 cups cilantro 6 bunches of parsley 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.900
 they are not bunches are the branches half rate 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.020
 green pear green half banana 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.160
 half green apple half green lemon and 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.960
 a cup of water 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.690
 this is how it should be taken in the morning 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.030
 when you wake up you grab a cup the 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.759
 heat the water is first half lemon 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.520
 of the shots after you take that 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.350
 base water grabs its juice and you take it 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.810
 already as you prepare it the two months it has 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.369
 been all you mix everything you put him 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.110
 you can put orange juice or you can 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.700
 put water but I recommend it with 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.290
 water because they do not know they do not know this 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.660
 It's made with water and you can 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.450
 try not go wrong because you have to 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:48.310
 has apple has a little bit of lemon 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.229
 and that makes it taste rich 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.720
 then hot that hot the 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.369
 tomorrow water water now alone water you 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.060
 you take water you put a cup of water 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.400
 you put it to heat since it is hot 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.520
 you put half a lemon 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.040
 and you take it so that it takes away your 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.009
 hungry if that helps you because usually 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.410
 in the night when you have gone to bed you 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.540
 puts on the fat in the stomach 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.760
 when you drink when you drink that water 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.560
 hot with that lemon makes that that 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:22.099
 go this can enter 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.560
 so that it does more to you now how much you are 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.290

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.690
 usually if you do it well for all 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.099
 the mornings every morning that you do not 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.430
 fails hot water and water 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:39.319
 nopal fallas baja three cups three 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.060
 carvings in a month several people but what 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.130
 that I love all these are 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.959
 natural products that you can find 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.819
 in any this market any 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.140
 any supermarket supermarket 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.300
 any Mexican supermarket you can 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.940
 find all this has to be this 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.160
 it has to be organic vegetables and 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.370
 organic fruit 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.870
 I recommend it but it's a little bit more 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.880
 expensive the solid the organic fruit 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.290
 then if you can not buy fruit 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.760
 the lips 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.640
 Well, if it's not the same effect, it's 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.510
 the same effect but the organic does not 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.159
 have 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.870
 it's good it's very good for your health 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.569
 then he was mentioning he takes the 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.090
 glass of water with the half lemon and 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:24.269
 then then what is the match of 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.239
 the smoothies the bar plus that satisfies you 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:31.040
 I was not hungry hungry like at 3 4 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.040
 hours and you also need to have breakfast 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:42.590
 during the day it is recommended that 45 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.590
 must eat 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:59.879
 so obviously we have to avoid 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.500
 fats and all that now yes yes 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:03.900
 is also telling me that if one 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.359
 wants to have another smoothie in the 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.739
 nights of death you can say that it is 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.580
 also recommended that the night as 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.960
 the seven p.m. do 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.840
 now if you do not want to do this all 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:18.640
 the days you can not make a quantity 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.640
 large that lasts up to 5 days 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.960
 clean 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.740
 another important thing of this liquefied is 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.980
 what is it that you are mentioning me 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.750
 that helps the liver that other organs 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.760
 helps that the importance of 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.910
 clean good the nopal imagine normal 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.770
 in opal has 60 percent fiber is 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.660
 good for cholesterol diabetes is 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.020
 good to prevent cancer you 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.690
 rejuvenates also 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.379
 apart the pear and the apple you know that 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.930
 it's very good for this cholesterol and the 

00:05:02.379 --> 00:05:09.060
 banana has potassium this is great 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.060
 because it's good to cleanse the liver 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.000
 well this is for salads is the 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.400
 I recommend because it 's good for 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:22.389
 rich liver is I love something that 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:24.610
 yes women and something that I know something 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:26.259
 I recommend you never miss you going to 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.780
 miss this the cilantro and the laudio 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:30.819
 because this is the one that burns the fat 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.289
 also that is what without this is not going to 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:35.199
 work the same but say that the nopal 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:37.479
 This can cure some disease 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:41.440
 also if you do not see too little of that 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:42.910
 your brother sure that many 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.160
 years 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.590
 illuminates we believe in the nopal that if you 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.080
 my stomach hurt they went and cut the 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.890
 root of the cactus and they put it to boil and 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:56.800
 with stomach pain if they cut you 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:58.540
 It made us better not worth anything if 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.520
 we had some infraction in something 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.230
 they grabbed the prickly pear thorns and with that 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.830
 they cleaned us and with that they took off 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:04.830
 the infection 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:11.500
 seven years later obviously also 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.440
 greater cancer 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.840
 and my relative you have to eat nopal 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.780

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.370

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.880
