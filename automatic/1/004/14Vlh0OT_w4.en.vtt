00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
in the fall with the combo the company

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.969 
in the fall with the combo the company
that<00:01:50.939> supplies<00:01:51.090> these<00:01:51.770> originally<00:01:52.770> made

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
these for the off-road seismic oilfield

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.039 
these for the off-road seismic oilfield
construction<00:01:56.640> market<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.509> they<00:01:57.689> made<00:01:57.899> these

construction market so they made these

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.599 
construction market so they made these
tracks<00:01:58.350> for<00:01:58.649> vehicles<00:01:59.039> that<00:01:59.100> weigh<00:01:59.340> upwards

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.529 
of a hundred and fifty thousand pounds a
big<00:02:02.340> four-wheel-drive<00:02:02.640> like<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.329> is

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:03.539 
big four-wheel-drive like this is

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:05.749 
big four-wheel-drive like this is
normally<00:02:04.110> in<00:02:04.289> the<00:02:04.469> fifty<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.979> sixty<00:02:05.159> thousand

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
normally in the fifty to sixty thousand

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.580 
normally in the fifty to sixty thousand
pound<00:02:05.909> range<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.360> they're<00:02:06.539> very<00:02:06.569> very<00:02:07.110> tough

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
pound range so they're very very tough

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.789 
pound range so they're very very tough
and<00:02:07.799> robust<00:02:08.160> tracks<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:10.140> gives<00:02:10.440> us<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
and robust tracks and it gives us the

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.460 
and robust tracks and it gives us the
ability<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.569> put<00:02:12.569> them<00:02:12.720> on<00:02:12.780> anything<00:02:13.080> and

ability to put them on anything and

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.259 
ability to put them on anything and
they'll<00:02:13.650> survive<00:02:14.040> anything<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.730> customer<00:02:15.120> does

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
they'll survive anything a customer does

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.050 
they'll survive anything a customer does
in<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.510> AG<00:02:15.629> market<00:02:16.110> however<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:17.519> does<00:02:17.819> make

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
in the AG market however that does make

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.880 
in the AG market however that does make
it<00:02:18.269> a<00:02:18.360> very<00:02:18.540> heavy<00:02:18.810> vehicle<00:02:19.290> so<00:02:19.470> some<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.709> our

generation<00:02:48.440> Sidewinder<00:02:49.440> two<00:02:49.590> armrests<00:02:50.100> and

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
generation Sidewinder two armrests and

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.059 
generation Sidewinder two armrests and
we<00:02:50.940> interviewed<00:02:51.329> 300<00:02:51.989> customers<00:02:52.230> of<00:02:52.829> what

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
we interviewed 300 customers of what

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.610 
we interviewed 300 customers of what
they<00:02:53.220> wanted<00:02:53.579> for<00:02:53.760> controls<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.450> wear<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:55.049> we

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
they wanted for controls and wear and we

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.490 
they wanted for controls and wear and we
also<00:02:56.060> used<00:02:57.060> our<00:02:57.269> fiat<00:02:57.569> auto<00:02:57.930> side<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.440> the

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
also used our fiat auto side of the

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.470 
also used our fiat auto side of the
company<00:02:58.859> in<00:02:58.980> terms<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.459> ergonomics<00:03:00.329> and

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
company in terms of ergonomics and

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.110 
company in terms of ergonomics and
comfort<00:03:00.720> for<00:03:01.109> customers<00:03:01.590> from<00:03:01.769> cars<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.579> so

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
comfort for customers from cars and so

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.270 
comfort for customers from cars and so
this<00:03:03.329> armrest<00:03:03.660> moves<00:03:04.200> forward<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:04.829> backward

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
this armrest moves forward and backward

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.580 
this armrest moves forward and backward
and<00:03:05.459> as<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.299> moves<00:03:06.450> forward<00:03:07.019> it<00:03:07.139> goes<00:03:07.290> on<00:03:07.470> an

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
and as it moves forward it goes on an

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.559 
and as it moves forward it goes on an
upward<00:03:07.799> plane<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.910> benefit<00:03:09.329> of<00:03:09.420> that<00:03:09.450> is

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
upward plane and the benefit of that is

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.020 
upward plane and the benefit of that is
for<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:09.959> person<00:03:10.349> with<00:03:10.380> shorter<00:03:10.920> legs<00:03:11.190> they<00:03:11.819> also

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
for a person with shorter legs they also

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.940 
for a person with shorter legs they also
have<00:03:12.299> shorter<00:03:12.720> arms<00:03:13.079> so<00:03:13.230> as<00:03:13.349> they<00:03:13.470> get<00:03:13.650> closer

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
have shorter arms so as they get closer

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.190 
have shorter arms so as they get closer
to<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.220> steering<00:03:14.639> wheel<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.599> armrest<00:03:16.049> is

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
to the steering wheel the the armrest is

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.690 
to the steering wheel the the armrest is
more<00:03:16.410> comfortable<00:03:16.859> for<00:03:17.069> them<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.400> where<00:03:17.549> they

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
more comfortable for them and where they

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.449 
more comfortable for them and where they
operate<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.269> once<00:03:18.959> you<00:03:19.109> have<00:03:19.290> it<00:03:19.500> set<00:03:19.769> you<00:03:20.340> have

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
operate it once you have it set you have

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.280 
operate it once you have it set you have
the<00:03:20.519> ability<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.060> put<00:03:21.329> your<00:03:21.480> arm<00:03:21.660> in<00:03:21.810> one<00:03:21.959> place
