00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.800
 we are in san francisco in a store 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:15.270
 we come to show you 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.940
 the iphone 5s now we have the iphone 5 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:21.640
 that and the iphone 5 my right 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.800
 the weight is a bit a bit feels a 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.410
 slightly slightly lighter the iphone 5 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.410
 So how are you going to be able to see 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.390
 the screen is basically the same 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.380
 but here it is a little different for 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.720
 the brightness of the screen 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.930
 however you can see that the 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.510
 size is the same 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.690
 yes yes this is an iphone in color 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.460
 silver unlike the iphone 5 that 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.460
 they came in black 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.059
 and well, the operating system is going to 

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:02.300
 keep being the ibc 7 we will have the 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.799
 same functions the multi touch that 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.799
 It works very fast as we show it 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:09.380
 on the iphone 5 so it works 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.520
 even suddenly much faster is going to 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.970
 have the same applications as 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.740
 iphoto garageband that you do not name 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.890
 they are applications that used to be 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.799
 included in the computers of 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.870
 apple desk and now also 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.990
 they are in me that 7 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:30.070
 otherwise, there was the issue of 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.070
 all there is life 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.829
 and as I was telling you the novelty in 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.829
 iphone 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.050
 what 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.290
 includes the recognition of the footprint 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:47.360
 fingerprint let's do a demonstration 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.360
 how it works just touch 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.810
 and the iphone is recognizing the traces 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.640
 fingerprints regardless of position 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:02.240
 where you touch it elevates 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.240
 identifying more and more 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.310
 the fingerprint of one 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.680
 as you can see it is a system because 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.480
 every time he learns more of the trace 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.480
 fingerprint and here almost has it complete 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.140
 the fingerprint issue works 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.450
 with this little home button that 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:32.590
 around has and I do not know if they reach it 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.910
 distinguish a small hoop 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.160
 which is the one that really allows 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.700
 recognize the fingerprint when one 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.550
 he's getting over it 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.200
 otherwise, basically the iphone5 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.069
 It has a much more processor 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.840
 fast that the iphone 5 is a +7 a 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.610
 7 processor 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.440
 but the screen and the size continue 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.110
 being the same as I was saying is a 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.930
 little lighter 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.250
 They have different colors to try 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.480
 show them the gold version 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:07.970
 in the USA it is exhausted and as we saw 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.550
 samsung also dream 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.770
 fashionable so to speak and it is 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.510
 offering the samsung galaxy s 4 in 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.459
 golden color 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.519
 as we can see, they also work 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.519
 no need to lock the iphone 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.080
 the applications some applications 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.140
 like the camera the flashlight 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.290
 the calculator without the need to enter 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.970
 directly to the operating system and then 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.750
 as we see there is a total redesign of the 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.580
 OS 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.860
 compared the v6 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.780
 and these are the other two colors in the 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.940
 which is available on iphone 5 s 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.190
 as we can see this is the icon that 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.920
 is causing more sensation in the usa 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:54.110
 everyone is exhausted at least until 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.110
 October is a version 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.689
 now champagne tell you some 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.409
 not for 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.659
 dark environments and the other is a bit 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:12.480
 softer the iphone allows us also 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:13.769
 record in modules I will show you the 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.259
 new function there is recording in the 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:18.470
 dome view slow motion to 120 frames 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:18.470
 per second 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.360
 and now I show you how it is 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.360
 how the video looks 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:35.140
 so it looks 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.140
 a video in slow motion or you can see the 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:40.140
 people look extremely slow 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.140
 walking 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:46.000
 parked the new functionalities 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.620
 that for iphone 5 is 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.910
 and consequently because we are going to 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.810
 find 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:55.480
 in people of 16 32 or 64 gb 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:59.310
 in prices in two-year plans to 199 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:59.310
 299 and 399 dollars 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:06.200
 can be purchased with the operators 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.200
 understand and sprint and mobile and verizon 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.920
 with really economic plans in you 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.849
 mobile for example we find plans 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:18.580
 from 50 dollars a month 

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:21.669
 Two years without a permanence clause 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.310
 in colombia we hope that the iphone 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:26.110
 5 is coming towards the end of 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:28.830
 November or early December for 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.830
 the ship season
