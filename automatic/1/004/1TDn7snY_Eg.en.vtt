00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.819 
and all that jazz but on this device it
didn't<00:00:42.540> happen<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.989> battery<00:00:43.260> door<00:00:43.410> stayed<00:00:43.710> in

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
didn't happen the battery door stayed in

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.650 
didn't happen the battery door stayed in
place<00:00:44.010> which<00:00:44.219> is<00:00:44.340> great<00:00:44.550> however<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.360> screen

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
place which is great however the screen

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.130 
place which is great however the screen
popped<00:00:45.899> off<00:00:47.090> so<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.120> figured<00:00:48.180> I'd<00:00:48.480> show<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.930> I

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140

popped off so I figured I'd show that I
take<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.190> screen<00:00:50.520> like<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:51.379> we<00:00:52.379> can

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
take the screen like that we can

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.350 
take the screen like that we can
actually<00:00:52.890> see<00:00:53.100> there<00:00:53.640> you<00:00:53.730> have<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.030> storm

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
now we're touching here doesn't do

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.729 
now we're touching here doesn't do
anything<00:00:58.199> but<00:00:59.160> if<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.399> touch<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.789> screen

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
anything but if I touch the screen

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.350 
anything but if I touch the screen
you'll<00:01:01.739> see<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.280> icons<00:01:02.910> actually<00:01:04.369> there<00:01:05.369> as<00:01:05.580> I

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
you'll see the icons actually there as I

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.649 
you'll see the icons actually there as I
touch<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.900> screen<00:01:07.640> underneath<00:01:08.640> screen<00:01:09.540> is

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
touch the screen underneath screen is

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.060 
touch the screen underneath screen is
actually<00:01:10.549> connected<00:01:11.549> right<00:01:12.119> here<00:01:13.020> into<00:01:13.950> the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
actually connected right here into the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.670 
actually connected right here into the
device<00:01:14.369> it's<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.420> little<00:01:15.509> cable<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.200> then<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
device it's a little cable and then the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.469 
device it's a little cable and then the
sense<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.189> can<00:01:17.340> actually<00:01:17.400> see<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
sense is you can actually see it on the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.420 
sense is you can actually see it on the
screen<00:01:18.780> itself<00:01:19.170> looks<00:01:20.070> like<00:01:20.189> there's<00:01:20.369> a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
screen itself looks like there's a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.990 
screen itself looks like there's a
slight<00:01:20.640> tint<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> screen<00:01:21.450> also<00:01:22.939> so<00:01:23.939> you

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
slight tint to the screen also so you

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.960 
slight tint to the screen also so you
would<00:01:24.450> actually<00:01:25.159> the<00:01:26.159> screen<00:01:26.430> would<00:01:26.580> sense<00:01:26.820> it

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
would actually the screen would sense it

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.630 
would actually the screen would sense it
and<00:01:27.030> then<00:01:27.270> of<00:01:27.390> course<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.960> select<00:01:28.770> you'd

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
and then of course to select you'd

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.630 
and then of course to select you'd
actually<00:01:29.880> click<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.860> screen<00:01:32.040> itself<00:01:32.250> and

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
actually click the screen itself and

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.480 
actually click the screen itself and
then<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.820> would<00:01:32.939> select<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:34.250> just<00:01:35.250> thought<00:01:35.369> it

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
then it would select I just thought it

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.219 
then it would select I just thought it
would<00:01:35.579> be<00:01:35.670> interesting<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:36.030> show<00:01:36.329> looks<00:01:37.020> like

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
would be interesting to show looks like

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.030 
would be interesting to show looks like
the<00:01:37.530> screen<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:37.950> held<00:01:38.220> in<00:01:38.369> place<00:01:38.400> with<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:40.040> glue

the screen is held in place with a glue

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.700 
the screen is held in place with a glue

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
around the the metal that you see on the

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.030 
around the the metal that you see on the
exterior<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.670> screen<00:01:45.270> inside<00:01:45.720> here<00:01:46.079> this

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
exterior of the screen inside here this

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.149 
exterior of the screen inside here this
mental<00:01:47.520> band<00:01:47.759> that<00:01:47.939> goes<00:01:48.060> around<00:01:48.270> that's<00:01:48.630> the

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
mental band that goes around that's the

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.859 
mental band that goes around that's the
internal<00:01:50.159> screen<00:01:50.399> has<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> layer<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.450> glue<00:01:51.840> on

internal screen has a layer of glue on
it<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.439> then<00:01:52.530> there's<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:53.549> screen<00:01:53.850> itself

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
it and then there's the screen itself

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.789 
it and then there's the screen itself
with<00:01:54.450> sit<00:01:54.750> right<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.020> top<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.619> so<00:01:55.649> it

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
with sit right on top of it so it

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.139 
with sit right on top of it so it
doesn't<00:01:55.829> actually<00:01:56.070> lock<00:01:56.490> into<00:01:56.700> place<00:01:56.850> it's

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
doesn't actually lock into place it's

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.020 
doesn't actually lock into place it's
glued<00:01:57.390> into<00:01:57.570> place<00:01:57.950> I<00:01:58.950> don't<00:01:59.520> know<00:01:59.670> if<00:01:59.850> it's

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
glued into place I don't know if it's

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.149 
glued into place I don't know if it's
the<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.689> cold<00:02:00.960> weather<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.409> we've<00:02:01.590> had<00:02:01.770> and

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.369 
know affecting the glue the seal it
looked<00:02:09.209> like<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.360> was<00:02:09.569> a<00:02:09.599> good<00:02:09.810> amount<00:02:10.050> of<00:02:10.200> glue

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
looked like it was a good amount of glue

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.410 
looked like it was a good amount of glue
on<00:02:10.410> there<00:02:10.800> so<00:02:11.099> it<00:02:11.610> should<00:02:11.879> have<00:02:12.000> stayed<00:02:12.239> in

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
on there so it should have stayed in

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.960 
on there so it should have stayed in

however<00:02:13.840> for<00:02:14.200> anyone<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.860> was<00:02:15.040> concerned

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
however for anyone that was concerned

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.070 
however for anyone that was concerned
about<00:02:15.820> me<00:02:16.000> dust<00:02:16.330> getting<00:02:16.660> underneath<00:02:16.900> the

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
about me dust getting underneath the

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.680 
about me dust getting underneath the
screen<00:02:17.410> under<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.190> glass<00:02:18.430> onto<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:19.390> screen<00:02:19.570> I

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
screen under the glass onto the screen I

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.420 
screen under the glass onto the screen I
guess<00:02:19.900> it's<00:02:20.110> possible<00:02:20.320> if<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:20.770> glue<00:02:21.040> wasn't

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
guess it's possible if the glue wasn't

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.220 
guess it's possible if the glue wasn't
put<00:02:21.760> in<00:02:21.880> properly<00:02:22.270> but<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.630> looks<00:02:22.810> like<00:02:22.990> if

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
put in properly but it looks like if

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.630 
put in properly but it looks like if
there<00:02:23.530> was<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.680> good<00:02:23.830> amount<00:02:23.980> of<00:02:24.130> glue<00:02:24.310> in<00:02:24.460> there

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
there was a good amount of glue in there

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.380 
there was a good amount of glue in there
that<00:02:25.210> would<00:02:25.360> hold<00:02:25.600> the<00:02:26.020> screen<00:02:26.260> place<00:02:26.560> that

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
that would hold the screen place that

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.030 
that would hold the screen place that
dust<00:02:28.390> wouldn't<00:02:28.750> get<00:02:28.900> through<00:02:29.110> there<00:02:29.320> but<00:02:29.770> in

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
dust wouldn't get through there but in

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.520 
dust wouldn't get through there but in
this<00:02:30.670> case<00:02:30.880> that's<00:02:31.540> what<00:02:31.780> happened<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.380> my

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
this case that's what happened to my

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.770 
this case that's what happened to my
device<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.460> I<00:02:33.670> can<00:02:34.060> actually<00:02:34.330> put<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.540> screen

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
device and I can actually put the screen

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.260 
device and I can actually put the screen
back<00:02:34.840> up
