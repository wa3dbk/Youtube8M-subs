00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 Upgrade the RAM on your laptop or Ultrabook (also known as memory) - 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 It can quickly and easily speed up almost any operation on your computer. - 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
 The following is an introduction to the operation. 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 There are a few things to keep in mind before starting the operation. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 Make sure your memory is compatible with your system. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.933
 There is a handy online tool on Kingston.com to help you easily find out which memory is compatible with your system. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
 Next, keep the work surface clean and tidy. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 And let yourself touch the unpainted metal surface to ground yourself to prevent static damage to any parts. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Finally, in most cases, 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Simply prepare a simple Phillips head screwdriver to upgrade your notebook's memory. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 First, remove the battery 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 And make sure the computer releases all remaining power 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 After removing the battery, press the power button. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Find the location of the memory in your computer, 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 Sometimes it's at the bottom of the computer, 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 Otherwise, you need to refer to the computer manufacturer's website before you begin. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Then, remove the small screws on the memory bay door 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.333
 Keep it aside, but be sure to keep the screws in a safe place to prevent loss. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Now you should be able to clearly see the original memory in your computer. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Push the metal clips on each side of the memory module slightly outward to release the first memory module. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 You will see the memory module pop up slightly 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 If you have 2 memory modules installed, do the same for the second memory module. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
 This memory module is sometimes located next to or even below the first memory module. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 When installing new memory, it is important to note that the alignment slots on the memory must be aligned with the notches in the computer's memory slots. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 If there is no alignment, flip it over and slide it into the memory module at an angle of about 45 degrees, but do not force it to be inserted. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
 Gently press down on the memory module to hold it firmly in place. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Once it is seated, press the outer edge portion until you hear the side snap snap to the desired position, which means the memory is fixed in place. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 If you are adding more than one memory module, repeat this step for the other modules, then close the memory bay cover and secure it in place with the screws. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 Replace the battery and turn on the computer. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 On some systems, your computer may alert you that the memory capacity has changed. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
 Don't worry, just enter the BIOS and accept the changes. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
 This is done. - 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.000
