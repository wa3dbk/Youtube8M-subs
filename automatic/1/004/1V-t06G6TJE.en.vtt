00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.240
 Hello everyone! Are you Ivan Choirs. 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:09.760
 This time, let's talk about the British heavy fighter seventh level «De Havilland 103 Hornet». 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.320
 We have already passed the car «De Havilland 98 Mosquito». 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.480
 Despite certain continuity, from it we get only pyatsisotfuntavyya bombs and missiles. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.960
 Bit - but it's better than nothing. 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.880
 However, little uniformity modules not embarrass us too: 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.240
 Even in its basic configuration «Hornet» better than its predecessor in many ways. 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.000
 Significantly increased horizontal velocity and take-off speed. 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.280
 Slightly improved strength. 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.360
 Firepower initially lower than in «Mosquito», 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.960
 but this is only to establish the modified guns «Hispano». 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:03.280
 And even maneuverability, which in heavy fighters with the growth of always getting worse, it declined only slightly. 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.360
 Let's see what niche takes our hero on the seventh level among the cars of one class. 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.080
 If we compare the basic configuration, the situation is not in favor of the British aircraft: 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.000
 and the speed is not very good, and thin arms. 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.120
 But after improving aircraft with bedolagi-duckling turns into a swan famously, 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.560
 to be exact - in the rapid hornets. 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.400
 He has the least at the level of strength, 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.440
 but an improved configuration is only slightly inferior in firepower F7F aircraft - 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.400
 and in this case it has the highest speed and the minimum time turn. 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.120
 This combination of characteristics makes it possible to successfully fight for supremacy in the air. 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.160
 A small digression about the bombs and missiles: 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.680
 despite the variety of suspension arms, it is not necessary to install. 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.120
 The fact that it is significantly degrade the speed characteristics, 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.760
 and do with hornets slow and vulnerable, after the winter sleep, fly. 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.480
 Thus, the theory sorted out - a fight! 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.560
 We are on the top of the food chain. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.200
 After the frame immediately climb above kilometer three and a half and maybe three. 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.800
 Speed ​​characteristics of the aircraft will allow us to do this easily. 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.680
 But we try not to deviate from their: 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.440
 at this level of fighting a lot of experienced pilots, 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.960
 who will definitely be worthy contenders. 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.040
 So - we choose our community allies more 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.240
 and fly with them to adventure. 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.480
 Engage in combat than you can wish for: 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.360
 intercept enemy fighters and attack aircraft, 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.880
 fight on bends with heavy enemy fighters. 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.440
 But here is to behave and be Rambo to go ahead against all - is not necessary. 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.880
 Better to take a trick! 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.520
 For good reason the name of the plane is translated as "Hornet". 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.680
 Therefore fly up in the most unexpected moment, and the sting of all the guns. 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.520
 Even heavy fighters will fight for long under fire from four "twenties". 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.440
 However, the long spinning is not necessary on the enemy: 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.560
 "Flyswatter" - enemy fighters - will not sleep. 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.920
 Therefore, we leave on the height and are planning another attack. 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.400
 First of all, we rely on the speed of the aircraft, - and do not lose it for nothing. 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.240
 Fighters can attack on the aisles and even the forehead. 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.880
 Only a frontal attack should not be forgotten 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.480
 that aircraft are 20-millimeter cannon, 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.640
 which begin to effectively work with about 500--600 meters, 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.120
 why fly to the enemy, which has a long-range weapons, it is not necessary. 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.000
 You can also expect to launch in the forehead - 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.520
 Therefore, we must prepare to dodge. 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.440
 By the way, successfully launching rockets on the forehead and we can: 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.200
 it's pretty easy, but worth a try! 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.600
 also need to be alert With heavy fighters and attack aircraft: 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.760
 low strength may well spoil the "hornets" life, 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.560
 yes side arrows of the enemy may well break our plane. 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.800
 Therefore, we try to catch the heavy fighters minute ally attacks, 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.160
 and gunships - to catch when they go on purpose. 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.320
 Do not forget about the bomb attack aircraft armament: 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.640
 one label dropped the bomb - and we will go into the hangar. 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.840
 If we do take on board suspension arms, 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.640
 our tactics will change completely: 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.880
 until we dropped bombs and missiles are not all shot out, 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.000
 start a fight with enemy aircraft - suicide. 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.640
 And if we talk quite seriously, destroying barns and defense items - 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:57.640
 not the noble heavy fighter deal! 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.600
 Naturally, if there are no allies who so need our help, 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.160
 and strip the advantages of the enemy is steadily growing - if you can. 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.040
 But be very careful! 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.480
 «Hornet» is not the first of firepower - 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.480
 and this should be remembered. 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.160
 Sometimes it also happens that throws the fight on the "bottom" of the list. 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.320
 But it does not matter, as both a tactic and our role has not changed much. 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.960
 We look around, 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.160
 We try not to stay to fight alone against several enemy aircraft 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.360
 and fly in large groups as possible allies. 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.800
 Features we are such that for a decent support 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.240
 we can successfully withstand even reactive Me.262. 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.880
 The main thing - to avoid the attack and catch opponents in the uncomfortable position. 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.760
 Well, then ... then - fire from all the guns! 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.120
 You can now summarize. 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.960
 "De Havilland 103 the Hornet" definitely appeal to fans of "Falcon attack" and high-speed attacks. 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:09.360
 And those who have not mastered the "Falcon carried out the attack," it will help to improve this strategy. 

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.600
 Try it, use various tricks. 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.600
 «Hornet» is an excellent machine for the beginner, 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.880
 as well as for seasoned aces in air battles.
