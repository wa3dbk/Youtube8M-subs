00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:02.790
 [Music] 

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.479
 [Applause] 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:10.120
 Hi, guys, what do I give them? 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:12.580
 welcome to this new video in many 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.980
 Sometimes I ask myself android 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.260
 I have a side of the larger arm that 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.779
 the other one I have a left oil more 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:23.199
 big that the right I can do 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:25.210
 well in shelter in the present that if 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.369
 can solve neglect 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.339
 so without them you have a moment 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.079
 side one muscle larger than the other 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:34.420
 this video is for you the day I'm going 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:37.090
 to reveal five rules to keep in mind 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.880
 to minimize those differences so 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.000
 if you're ready let's start first rule 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.510
 use unilateral exercises you should 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.160
 use mostly or in its entirety 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.530
 unilateral exercises and insuring 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.670
 dumbbells pulleys machines in order 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.800
 the question is that each side goes for its 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.630
 account for example below we are 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.630
 showing some of those exercises 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.939
 [Music] 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.049
 Focus on exercises such as 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.420
 the detail when you use those in 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.189
 those who both citizens intervene 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.880
 to perform the movement as per 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.880
 sagging example 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.380
 the strong side tends to compensate for 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:52.130
 weakness of the weak side and that in your 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.770
 case you do not need a second rule in 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.710
 each series trains your weak side first 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.110
 that is, in each series that you make starts 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.850
 first with your weak side once 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.970
 they should do all the repetitions with 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.430
 said side you just pass by your strong side 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.590
 for example my weak side is the 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.960
 left then let's say I'm 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.660
 performing the sitting chest press 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.170
 imagine start as left as 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.170
 you're watching 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.340
 and once he finished all the replays 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.140
 steps just to my right side 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.420
 ensures to take more advantage of 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.520
 weak side performance it will be 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.220
 cooler than the strong side 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.920
 third irrigation do not make more acquisitions 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.500
 on the strong side that on the side of the 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.460
 Vertigo is doing the cur 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.740
 Biceps with more strings 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.060
 you start with your arms how you know 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.180
 remember the previous network 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.810
 let's say you get to the failure in the tenth 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:56.260
 restriction you do not give anymore that's the most 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.780
 and now it happens to the strong arm and although 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.420
 in this arm you could do more in 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.870
 ground conditions once you get to the 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.780
 tenth repetition you stop you finished the 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.810
 series this will help pretty to which side 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.900
 weak reach to strong room fix 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.239
 mentally focus much more on the 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.580
 side of him I explain to you to achieve 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:21.760
 maximum results it is essential that 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.340
 develop is the muscle mind connection 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.290
 I do not know if you have heard about it in 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.150
 one of my past videos talk about 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.160
 that topic but for you to understand 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.110
 let's say when you see train a 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.630
 bodybuilder or a model ends 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.459
 professional them in every repetition that 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.780
 they usually do it focuses itself see 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:44.560
 the weight from point a to point b 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:48.459
 are mentally focused on feeling the 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:50.830
 muscle how it stretches and contracts all 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.640
 the range of movement in each 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:57.069
 repeat then going back to this 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.880
 point to this rule with much more reason 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:03.310
 for your interest side focus 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.930
 mentally in feeling how it stretches and 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.600
 would be said speaker for 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.230
 maximize your results for example 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.450
 let's say they are doing the elevations 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.760
 lateral ok then everything is 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.269
 become at that moment where 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:23.380
 I'm on the side and focus on how 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.910
 shrinks and how it stretches ok does not matter 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.610
 the distractions that you study 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.960
 the sides you should focus 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.660
 mentally so that in each repetition 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.900
 feel like I'm a worker 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.970
 so you're going to have excellent 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.050
 results apply that in all 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:42.930
 weak muscles that you have fifth rule 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.050
 it's a series more only with the side 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.129
 should for example let's say to your routine 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.589
 stress 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:52.789
 leg extensions then you're going to 

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:57.169
 add a fourth series but only 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.169
 for his leg 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:07.050
 the maximum repetitions and that's it 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.050
 that series and andoas choose two strong 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.220
 okay guys is what I wanted to share 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.050
 with you today record of 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.960
 apply each and every one of these 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:20.050
 advice in a disciplined way have 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.389
 patience and perform each repetition to 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.850
 a controlled speed will achieve 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:27.580
 definitely reduce those differences 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.470
 between the weak 2 and the 24 if it has 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.780
 some questions please do it in the 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.729
 part of comments and so that 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.690
 center on teeth of all the videos 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.060
