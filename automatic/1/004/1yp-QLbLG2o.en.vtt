00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:39.400
 that people see the effort they made 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:42.550

 the most admired walk and now 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.420
 I'm grateful for the effort that 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.799

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.799

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.790
 actually us when I met 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.370
 year on February 20 is a new occasion 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.329
 and good or we did nothing with 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.000
 birthday and good 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:33.159
 actually I wanted a cell phone that is 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.140
 the blackberry I had told him then 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:38.739
 well that's going to give you your birthday 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:42.370
 when I come back and well I have the 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:45.430
 family has and they bring me a wrapper 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.769
 let's say with the black birds box or if 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.019
 they will treat your gifts then when 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:53.540
 I open the box there was a key inside and the 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.819
 driving license of 15 or 17 years 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.500
 and then when you see the keys something and 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.500
 the truck ends and outside 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.930
 in the engine that have the chain v6 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.890
 I had a third box but we put it 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.290
 fourth down let's say the tank in up 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.019
 it was behind the seat but modifying 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.420
 that put them down actually goes to 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.569
 remove the tank and put everything 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.470
 the music team that has to have 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:05.220
 a power an egg fer 12 inches or 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.150
 6 x 9 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:14.120
 with twitter included 600 watts 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:16.700
 with the power of 2400 exhaust silens 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.820
 full 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:23.990
 the double exit what they did put 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:26.440
 all are bumper grill with everything 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.430
 what I know 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.240
 mudguard 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:35.830
 in the temple 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.870
 they ask me how I did it or is it 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.419
 reality as they did but in 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.150
 I do not know more or less what it has 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:45.099
 out there if you do not tell me you have to have what 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.930
 another I do not know because actually I 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:50.380
 I never knew what they did with the 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:54.160
 truck only they gave it to which 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.620
 and what I see is that it starts in nothing 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.560
 not really explain to me what 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:03.099
 they have never superior to selling it 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:06.729
 I would never have well taken care of digital be 

00:05:03.099 --> 00:05:09.819
 the price that is not always workshop 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:13.270
 but really because of what my dad 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:17.560
 like and what I like to no longer believe 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:21.070
 I wanted to thank 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.600
 to my family my uncle all the effort that 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.660
 made 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.810
 because it was really something that I did not 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:33.830
 I expected and that was very 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.720
 very nice and I thank you very much for the 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.360
 effort that they made and for the 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:42.060
 exhaustion
