00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
and this question was actually about the

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.519 
and this question was actually about the
we're<00:00:09.980> on<00:00:10.250> Balenciaga<00:00:10.820> bags<00:00:11.119> and

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:14.560 
we're on Balenciaga bags and
specifically<00:00:12.529> I<00:00:12.559> think<00:00:12.770> how<00:00:13.430> Balenciaga<00:00:14.389> bags

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
specifically I think how Balenciaga bags

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.900 
specifically I think how Balenciaga bags
wear<00:00:14.930> how<00:00:15.500> you<00:00:15.529> can<00:00:15.889> kind<00:00:16.100> of<00:00:16.160> ease<00:00:16.369> their<00:00:16.670> wear

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:16.910 
wear how you can kind of ease their wear

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.269 
wear how you can kind of ease their wear
and<00:00:17.210> then<00:00:17.750> also<00:00:17.990> just<00:00:18.589> general<00:00:19.039> maintenance

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
and then also just general maintenance

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:21.669 
and then also just general maintenance
on<00:00:19.580> Balenciaga<00:00:20.179> bags<00:00:20.390> so<00:00:20.990> if<00:00:21.230> you<00:00:21.410> guys<00:00:21.619> are

looking<00:00:22.130> at<00:00:22.400> Balenciaga<00:00:22.939> bags<00:00:23.240> the<00:00:23.570> first

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
looking at Balenciaga bags the first

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.720 
looking at Balenciaga bags the first
thing<00:00:23.990> you<00:00:24.109> should<00:00:24.289> know<00:00:24.410> is<00:00:24.679> the<00:00:25.249> natural

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
thing you should know is the natural

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.339 
thing you should know is the natural
wearing<00:00:26.119> and<00:00:26.269> of<00:00:26.390> Valencia<00:00:26.779> bakes<00:00:27.169> it's

00:00:27.339 --> 00:00:27.349 
wearing and of Valencia bakes it's

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:30.460 
wearing and of Valencia bakes it's
actually<00:00:27.890> one<00:00:28.130> of<00:00:28.159> the<00:00:28.849> things<00:00:29.300> about<00:00:30.199> the

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
actually one of the things about the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.979 
actually one of the things about the
base<00:00:30.679> that<00:00:31.070> is<00:00:31.220> most<00:00:31.550> desirable<00:00:31.909> or<00:00:32.570> kind<00:00:32.900> of

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
base that is most desirable or kind of

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:33.729 
base that is most desirable or kind of
sought-after

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:33.739 
sought-after

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.670 
sought-after
so<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:34.790> bag<00:00:35.000> leather<00:00:35.360> is<00:00:35.630> very<00:00:35.930> soft<00:00:36.320> when<00:00:36.620> you

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
so the bag leather is very soft when you

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.400 
so the bag leather is very soft when you
first<00:00:36.920> get<00:00:37.130> it<00:00:37.250> but<00:00:37.400> it<00:00:37.520> is<00:00:37.670> fairly<00:00:38.270> stiff<00:00:38.720> so

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
first get it but it is fairly stiff so

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.660 
first get it but it is fairly stiff so
as<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.430> bake<00:00:40.610> is<00:00:40.850> used<00:00:41.270> it<00:00:41.570> softens<00:00:42.170> up<00:00:42.380> and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
as the bake is used it softens up and

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.220 
as the bake is used it softens up and
some<00:00:43.670> of<00:00:43.790> the<00:00:43.850> terms<00:00:44.150> that<00:00:44.270> are<00:00:44.420> commonly<00:00:44.840> used

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
some of the terms that are commonly used

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.430 
some of the terms that are commonly used
as<00:00:45.410> it<00:00:45.530> starts<00:00:45.800> to<00:00:45.980> puddle<00:00:46.430> it<00:00:46.910> gets<00:00:47.150> smushy<00:00:47.600> so

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
as it starts to puddle it gets smushy so

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.830 
as it starts to puddle it gets smushy so
all<00:00:48.830> these<00:00:49.070> types<00:00:49.370> of<00:00:49.520> things<00:00:49.760> can<00:00:49.880> describe<00:00:50.690> a

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:50.840 
all these types of things can describe a

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.070 
all these types of things can describe a
big<00:00:50.990> that's<00:00:51.200> been<00:00:51.470> used<00:00:51.890> for<00:00:52.850> quite<00:00:52.880> a<00:00:53.060> bit<00:00:53.150> so

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
big that's been used for quite a bit so

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.870 
big that's been used for quite a bit so
the<00:00:54.200> main<00:00:54.410> areas<00:00:54.860> that<00:00:55.190> get<00:00:55.430> we're<00:00:55.670> on

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
the main areas that get we're on

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.700 
the main areas that get we're on
Balenciaga<00:00:56.480> bags<00:00:56.660> over<00:00:56.870> time<00:00:57.230> are<00:00:57.530> the

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
Balenciaga bags over time are the

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.230 
Balenciaga bags over time are the
handles<00:00:58.130> obviously<00:00:58.880> because<00:00:59.120> you're

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.240 
handles obviously because you're

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.720 
handles obviously because you're
carrying<00:00:59.510> and<00:00:59.750> by<00:00:59.840> the<00:00:59.900> handles<00:01:00.410> the<00:01:01.160> corners

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
carrying and by the handles the corners

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.509 
carrying and by the handles the corners
of<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.960> bags<00:01:03.170> that<00:01:03.500> are<00:01:03.650> more<00:01:04.100> of<00:01:04.189> a<00:01:04.250> square

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
of the bags that are more of a square

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.179 
of the bags that are more of a square
shape<00:01:04.549> this<00:01:05.119> is<00:01:05.330> the<00:01:05.479> city<00:01:05.720> bag<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:06.259> it<00:01:06.979> is

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
shape this is the city bag and it is

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.609 
shape this is the city bag and it is
more<00:01:08.090> of<00:01:08.270> a<00:01:08.420> rectangle<00:01:08.929> square<00:01:09.049> shape<00:01:09.380> as<00:01:09.530> you

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
more of a rectangle square shape as you

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.310 
more of a rectangle square shape as you
can<00:01:09.740> see<00:01:09.920> so<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:10.249> corners<00:01:10.670> generally<00:01:11.600> get<00:01:12.170> a

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
can see so the corners generally get a

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.669 
can see so the corners generally get a
lot<00:01:12.590> of<00:01:12.740> wear<00:01:12.979> on<00:01:13.009> these<00:01:13.429> as<00:01:13.759> well<00:01:13.789> and<00:01:14.679> then

00:01:15.669 --> 00:01:15.679 
lot of wear on these as well and then

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:19.090 
lot of wear on these as well and then
just<00:01:16.189> overall<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:17.149> the<00:01:18.140> color<00:01:18.469> of<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:18.920> bag

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
just overall the the color of the bag

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.230 
just overall the the color of the bag
can<00:01:19.729> be<00:01:19.909> affected<00:01:20.539> by<00:01:20.659> light<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.619> heat<00:01:21.920> and

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
can be affected by light and heat and

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.179 
can be affected by light and heat and
general<00:01:23.240> use<00:01:23.509> so<00:01:24.289> we<00:01:24.409> are<00:01:24.530> in<00:01:24.619> a<00:01:24.679> Balenciaga

the amount of lotion that you use on

Balenciaga handle
and<00:02:04.650> then<00:02:05.010> also<00:02:05.160> for<00:02:05.490> like<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.760> city<00:02:06.000> style

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300

Karianna in the crook of your arm can

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.680 
Karianna in the crook of your arm can
help<00:02:08.130> save<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.550> lot<00:02:08.790> of<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.119> wear<00:02:09.330> on<00:02:09.540> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
help save a lot of the wear on the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.530 
help save a lot of the wear on the
handles<00:02:10.080> for<00:02:10.830> lighter<00:02:11.040> colors<00:02:11.610> they<00:02:12.090> not<00:02:12.300> only

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
handles for lighter colors they not only

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.450 
handles for lighter colors they not only
will<00:02:12.690> soften<00:02:13.020> but<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.560> handles<00:02:13.950> may<00:02:14.130> also

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
will soften but the handles may also

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.820 
will soften but the handles may also
darken<00:02:14.970> with<00:02:15.150> use<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:16.140> this<00:02:16.320> is<00:02:16.500> one<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.770> the

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
darken with use so this is one of the

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.440 
darken with use so this is one of the
reasons<00:02:17.160> why<00:02:17.310> I<00:02:17.340> tend<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.730> go<00:02:17.880> for<00:02:17.940> darker

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
reasons why I tend to go for darker

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.390 
reasons why I tend to go for darker
colors<00:02:18.780> in<00:02:18.810> Balenciaga<00:02:19.440> bag<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.890> next<00:02:19.920> area

to rub up against things the corners

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.670 
to rub up against things the corners
will<00:02:45.030> just<00:02:45.209> naturally<00:02:45.630> take<00:02:45.840> where<00:02:46.110> though<00:02:46.410> as

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
will just naturally take where though as

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.880 
will just naturally take where though as
you<00:02:47.490> are<00:02:48.060> using<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.630> bag<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.500> main<00:02:49.680> thing

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
you are using the bag so the main thing

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.470 
you are using the bag so the main thing
that<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.040> want<00:02:50.100> to<00:02:50.280> make<00:02:50.430> sure<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.360> just

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
that you want to make sure is you just

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.940 
that you want to make sure is you just
want<00:02:51.630> to<00:02:51.690> check<00:02:51.840> your<00:02:52.050> corners<00:02:52.230> every<00:02:52.650> now<00:02:52.770> and

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
want to check your corners every now and

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.470 
want to check your corners every now and
again<00:02:53.100> because<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.790> starts<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.330> get

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
again because it starts to get

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.590 
again because it starts to get
undesirable<00:02:55.260> if<00:02:55.740> the<00:02:56.490> corners<00:02:56.940> ever<00:02:57.209> hit<00:02:57.570> a

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
undesirable if the corners ever hit a

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.500 
undesirable if the corners ever hit a
point<00:02:57.930> where<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:59.040> piping<00:02:59.580> actually<00:03:00.240> comes

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
point where the piping actually comes

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.240 
point where the piping actually comes
out<00:03:00.720> of<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.990> bag<00:03:01.140> which<00:03:01.410> I<00:03:01.500> have<00:03:01.650> seen<00:03:01.860> this<00:03:02.040> on

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
out of the bag which I have seen this on

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.010 
out of the bag which I have seen this on
bags<00:03:02.580> that<00:03:02.760> have<00:03:02.820> had<00:03:03.000> extreme<00:03:03.450> extreme<00:03:03.810> use

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
bags that have had extreme extreme use

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:06.710 
bags that have had extreme extreme use
the<00:03:04.890> leather<00:03:05.370> can<00:03:05.550> actually<00:03:05.910> wear<00:03:06.120> down<00:03:06.330> so

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
the leather can actually wear down so

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.540 
the leather can actually wear down so
much<00:03:06.959> that<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.440> piping<00:03:07.770> comes<00:03:08.160> out<00:03:08.340> of<00:03:08.459> the

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
much that the piping comes out of the

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.460 
much that the piping comes out of the
bag<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.720> at<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.080> point<00:03:10.320> would

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
bag and you at that point would

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.930 
bag and you at that point would
definitely<00:03:11.100> have<00:03:11.220> to<00:03:11.250> get<00:03:11.430> it<00:03:11.550> fixed<00:03:11.730> because

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
definitely have to get it fixed because

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.500 
definitely have to get it fixed because
then<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.570> would<00:03:12.690> start<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.110> alter<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:14.510> the

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
then it would start to alter the the

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.650 
then it would start to alter the the
ability<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.989> use<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.440> bag<00:03:16.590> basically<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:17.970> just

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
ability to use the bag basically so just

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.270 
ability to use the bag basically so just
being<00:03:18.840> delicate<00:03:19.230> with<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.530> corners<00:03:20.010> and

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
being delicate with the corners and

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.250 
being delicate with the corners and
trying<00:03:20.820> to<00:03:20.970> be<00:03:21.090> mindful<00:03:21.300> that<00:03:21.660> they<00:03:21.780> are<00:03:21.989> going

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
trying to be mindful that they are going

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.509 
trying to be mindful that they are going
to<00:03:22.320> be<00:03:22.380> an<00:03:22.470> area<00:03:22.650> that's<00:03:22.890> going<00:03:23.010> to<00:03:23.160> have<00:03:23.280> some

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
to be an area that's going to have some

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.699

like that

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.180 
like that
and<00:04:05.420> their<00:04:05.930> ever<00:04:06.080> so<00:04:06.320> slightly<00:04:06.590> sticky<00:04:07.040> which

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
and their ever so slightly sticky which

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.170 
and their ever so slightly sticky which
is<00:04:07.310> something<00:04:07.490> that<00:04:07.610> happens<00:04:07.970> especially

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
is something that happens especially

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.810 
is something that happens especially
with<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:08.720> darker<00:04:09.020> colors<00:04:09.410> but<00:04:09.650> it's<00:04:10.550> not

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:10.820 
with the darker colors but it's not

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.390 
with the darker colors but it's not
really<00:04:11.390> that<00:04:11.420> bad<00:04:11.720> on<00:04:12.440> this<00:04:12.650> particular<00:04:12.950> bag

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
really that bad on this particular bag

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.210 
really that bad on this particular bag
yet<00:04:13.670> and<00:04:14.450> then<00:04:14.990> there's<00:04:15.440> a<00:04:15.500> bit<00:04:15.709> of<00:04:15.740> fraying

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
yet and then there's a bit of fraying

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.340 
yet and then there's a bit of fraying
around<00:04:16.670> the<00:04:16.940> edges<00:04:17.299> here<00:04:17.630> if<00:04:17.840> you<00:04:17.959> guys<00:04:18.080> can

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
around the edges here if you guys can

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.009 
around the edges here if you guys can
see<00:04:18.560> that<00:04:18.609> which<00:04:19.609> sometimes<00:04:20.359> happens<00:04:20.570> it

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
see that which sometimes happens it

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.510 
see that which sometimes happens it
seems<00:04:21.260> like<00:04:21.440> especially<00:04:21.830> on<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.190> darker

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
seems like especially on the darker

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.900 
seems like especially on the darker
colors<00:04:22.910> where<00:04:23.660> just<00:04:24.140> like<00:04:24.320> little<00:04:24.910> white

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
colors where just like little white

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.510 
colors where just like little white
threads<00:04:26.720> will<00:04:27.020> come<00:04:27.200> out<00:04:27.350> there<00:04:27.620> it<00:04:28.310> doesn't

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
threads will come out there it doesn't

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.040 
threads will come out there it doesn't
really<00:04:28.670> bother<00:04:28.970> me<00:04:29.150> so<00:04:29.420> I<00:04:29.480> don't<00:04:29.540> try<00:04:29.810> to<00:04:29.870> do

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
really bother me so I don't try to do

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.770 
really bother me so I don't try to do
anything<00:04:30.260> with<00:04:30.530> it<00:04:30.710> and<00:04:31.060> then<00:04:32.060> the<00:04:32.330> corners

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
anything with it and then the corners

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.770 
anything with it and then the corners
are<00:04:33.280> a<00:04:34.280> little<00:04:34.700> bit<00:04:34.820> worn<00:04:35.060> down<00:04:35.300> but<00:04:35.600> they're

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
are a little bit worn down but they're

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.390 
are a little bit worn down but they're
not<00:04:35.930> worn<00:04:36.260> through<00:04:36.560> the<00:04:36.650> piping<00:04:37.040> or<00:04:37.220> anything

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
not worn through the piping or anything

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.400 
not worn through the piping or anything
and<00:04:37.820> so<00:04:38.270> they<00:04:38.450> don't<00:04:38.720> really<00:04:38.870> bother<00:04:39.200> me<00:04:39.290> that

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
and so they don't really bother me that

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.440 
and so they don't really bother me that
much<00:04:39.710> I'm<00:04:40.070> just<00:04:40.130> gonna<00:04:40.640> attempt<00:04:41.030> to<00:04:41.090> be<00:04:41.270> as

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
much I'm just gonna attempt to be as

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.060 
much I'm just gonna attempt to be as
careful<00:04:41.630> as<00:04:41.900> possible<00:04:41.930> so<00:04:42.530> they<00:04:42.650> don't<00:04:42.890> get

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
careful as possible so they don't get

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.159 
careful as possible so they don't get
too<00:04:44.000> much<00:04:44.150> more<00:04:44.180> worn<00:04:44.600> from<00:04:44.810> what<00:04:45.020> they<00:04:45.140> are

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
too much more worn from what they are

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.230 
too much more worn from what they are
and<00:04:45.650> then<00:04:46.250> the<00:04:46.340> main<00:04:46.520> part<00:04:46.820> of<00:04:46.880> the<00:04:47.000> leather

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
and then the main part of the leather

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.200 
and then the main part of the leather
you<00:04:47.540> can<00:04:47.720> tell<00:04:47.960> is<00:04:48.260> very<00:04:48.919> very<00:04:49.250> much<00:04:49.820> and

second<00:05:09.410> owner<00:05:09.560> of<00:05:09.770> this<00:05:10.010> so<00:05:10.370> the<00:05:10.580> previous

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
second owner of this so the previous

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.850 
second owner of this so the previous
owner<00:05:11.150> did<00:05:11.450> live<00:05:11.630> in<00:05:11.720> a<00:05:11.780> sunnier<00:05:12.110> state<00:05:12.470> than<00:05:12.710> I

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
owner did live in a sunnier state than I

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.250 
owner did live in a sunnier state than I
live<00:05:13.220> in<00:05:13.430> and<00:05:13.669> so<00:05:14.300> I<00:05:14.330> do<00:05:14.479> think<00:05:14.870> that<00:05:14.990> it<00:05:15.080> got<00:05:15.200> a

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
live in and so I do think that it got a

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.530 
live in and so I do think that it got a
little<00:05:15.530> bit<00:05:15.740> more<00:05:15.919> Sun<00:05:16.220> than<00:05:16.460> if<00:05:17.090> I<00:05:17.300> would<00:05:17.479> have

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.540 
little bit more Sun than if I would have

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.200 
little bit more Sun than if I would have
started<00:05:17.750> out<00:05:18.020> with<00:05:18.050> it<00:05:18.350> but<00:05:19.010> you<00:05:19.790> know<00:05:19.880> all<00:05:20.060> in

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
started out with it but you know all in

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.120 
started out with it but you know all in
all<00:05:20.330> I<00:05:20.510> really<00:05:20.720> love<00:05:20.960> the<00:05:21.110> color<00:05:21.350> and<00:05:21.470> I<00:05:21.860> like

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
all I really love the color and I like

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.350 
all I really love the color and I like
how<00:05:22.370> worn<00:05:22.669> in<00:05:22.820> it<00:05:22.940> is<00:05:23.090> because<00:05:23.390> I

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
how worn in it is because I

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.999 
how worn in it is because I
I<00:05:25.419> don't<00:05:25.810> know<00:05:25.870> I<00:05:25.900> just<00:05:26.050> really<00:05:26.289> like<00:05:26.770> this

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
I don't know I just really like this

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:29.969 
I don't know I just really like this
kind<00:05:27.219> of<00:05:27.370> warning<00:05:27.699> fail<00:05:28.060> I<00:05:28.469> don't<00:05:29.469> really<00:05:29.680> like

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
kind of warning fail I don't really like

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.219 
kind of warning fail I don't really like
the<00:05:30.490> handles<00:05:31.060> would<00:05:31.389> probably<00:05:31.750> be<00:05:31.840> my<00:05:31.960> biggest

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
the handles would probably be my biggest

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:34.950 
the handles would probably be my biggest
hang-up<00:05:32.560> especially<00:05:33.430> on<00:05:33.639> the<00:05:34.210> lighter<00:05:34.449> colors

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:34.960 
hang-up especially on the lighter colors

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.749 
hang-up especially on the lighter colors
that<00:05:35.560> is<00:05:35.740> really<00:05:36.009> the<00:05:36.099> only<00:05:36.250> thing<00:05:36.460> I<00:05:36.550> can't

00:05:36.749 --> 00:05:36.759 
that is really the only thing I can't

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:38.730 
that is really the only thing I can't
handle<00:05:37.090> with<00:05:37.210> the<00:05:37.330> wear<00:05:37.509> is<00:05:37.750> when<00:05:38.259> handles

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:38.740 
handle with the wear is when handles

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.070 
handle with the wear is when handles
start<00:05:39.099> to<00:05:39.219> get<00:05:39.430> a<00:05:39.460> darker<00:05:39.909> color<00:05:40.300> than<00:05:40.750> the<00:05:40.900> bag

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
start to get a darker color than the bag

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.830 
start to get a darker color than the bag
actually<00:05:41.590> is<00:05:41.740> so<00:05:42.520> I<00:05:42.550> learned<00:05:43.060> that<00:05:43.330> fairly

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:43.840 
actually is so I learned that fairly

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.490 
actually is so I learned that fairly
early<00:05:43.870> on<00:05:44.229> in<00:05:45.039> my<00:05:45.150> Balenciaga<00:05:46.150> buying<00:05:46.360> and<00:05:46.689> so

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:47.500 
early on in my Balenciaga buying and so

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.709 
early on in my Balenciaga buying and so
I<00:05:47.530> started<00:05:48.310> steering<00:05:48.729> towards<00:05:48.909> darker<00:05:49.389> colors

00:05:49.709 --> 00:05:49.719 
I started steering towards darker colors

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.140 
I started steering towards darker colors
as<00:05:49.930> opposed<00:05:50.259> to<00:05:50.469> lighter<00:05:50.770> colors<00:05:51.219> but

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
as opposed to lighter colors but

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.670 
as opposed to lighter colors but
hopefully<00:05:52.419> this<00:05:52.569> is<00:05:52.719> giving<00:05:52.990> you<00:05:53.080> an<00:05:53.199> idea<00:05:53.319> of

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
hopefully this is giving you an idea of

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.119 
hopefully this is giving you an idea of
how<00:05:54.189> the<00:05:54.250> bags<00:05:54.639> wear<00:05:55.120> in<00:05:55.539> and<00:05:55.900> you<00:05:56.830> know<00:05:56.949> I'm
