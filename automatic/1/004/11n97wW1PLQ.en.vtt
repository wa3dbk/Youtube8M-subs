that's<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.750> generalization<00:02:20.920> we<00:02:21.920> tend<00:02:22.280> to

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
that's the generalization we tend to

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.000 
that's the generalization we tend to

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
think it's there with us and then we get

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.310 
think it's there with us and then we get
looking<00:02:25.370> at<00:02:25.490> cool<00:02:25.730> buses<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:26.660> I<00:02:26.930> realize<00:02:27.290> that

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
looking at cool buses and I realize that

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.830 
looking at cool buses and I realize that

our own ancestors not very long ago

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.690 
our own ancestors not very long ago
we're<00:02:30.830> actually<00:02:31.010> behaving<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.120> same<00:02:32.390> way

resources doing buildings in a certain
way<00:03:59.640> we<00:04:00.640> want<00:04:00.849> to<00:04:00.940> do<00:04:01.060> something<00:04:01.360> to<00:04:01.630> them<00:04:01.810> to

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
way we want to do something to them to

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:05.509 
way we want to do something to them to
reflect<00:04:02.650> this<00:04:02.799> new<00:04:03.069> awareness<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:05.200> earth

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
reflect this new awareness the earth

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.320 
reflect this new awareness the earth
earthen<00:04:06.519> building<00:04:06.879> allows<00:04:07.450> one<00:04:07.900> to<00:04:07.930> do<00:04:08.290> that

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
earthen building allows one to do that

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.140 
earthen building allows one to do that
gradually<00:04:10.330> easy<00:04:10.599> and<00:04:11.470> in<00:04:11.980> a<00:04:12.069> way<00:04:12.250> that<00:04:12.519> it

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
gradually easy and in a way that it

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.229 
gradually easy and in a way that it
doesn't<00:04:13.420> compromise<00:04:13.930> the<00:04:15.239> open-ended

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
doesn't compromise the open-ended

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:22.020 
doesn't compromise the open-ended
integrity<00:04:17.169> millio<00:04:17.760> but<00:04:18.760> that<00:04:18.940> design<00:04:19.299> is<00:04:21.030> it's

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
integrity millio but that design is it's

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.020 
integrity millio but that design is it's
since<00:04:22.360> you<00:04:22.540> will<00:04:22.720> study<00:04:23.020> how<00:04:23.500> it<00:04:23.530> is<00:04:24.460> gravy

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
since you will study how it is gravy

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.350 
since you will study how it is gravy
I<00:04:25.240> think<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.750> K<00:04:26.020> key<00:04:26.290> is<00:04:26.470> you<00:04:27.280> know<00:04:27.520> even<00:04:28.150> as

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
I think the K key is you know even as

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.750 
I think the K key is you know even as
you're<00:04:28.660> doing<00:04:29.020> it<00:04:29.260> then<00:04:29.830> when<00:04:29.979> it<00:04:30.070> hardens<00:04:30.280> and

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
you're doing it then when it hardens and

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.409 
you're doing it then when it hardens and
dries<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.770> polished<00:04:33.120> impregnated<00:04:34.120> with<00:04:34.270> the

this<00:04:45.940> is<00:04:46.090> a<00:04:46.120> good<00:04:46.389> feeling

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550

tree<00:05:11.470> that<00:05:11.970> the<00:05:12.970> hourlies<00:05:13.620> we<00:05:14.620> shook<00:05:14.890> it<00:05:14.920> in

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
tree that the hourlies we shook it in

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.600 
tree that the hourlies we shook it in
water<00:05:15.730> and<00:05:16.210> you<00:05:16.900> see<00:05:17.110> this<00:05:17.440> gravel<00:05:18.100> after

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
water and you see this gravel after

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.220 
water and you see this gravel after
fountain<00:05:19.270> this<00:05:20.430> use<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:21.640> water<00:05:21.880> water<00:05:22.750> in<00:05:23.050> it

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
fountain this use the water water in it

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.390 
fountain this use the water water in it
you<00:05:23.500> will<00:05:24.280> see<00:05:24.430> that<00:05:24.610> it<00:05:24.790> become<00:05:25.180> brown<00:05:25.660> and

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
you will see that it become brown and

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.590 
you will see that it become brown and
strong<00:05:27.400> like<00:05:27.880> cement<00:05:28.300> so<00:05:29.580> locally<00:05:30.580> if<00:05:31.330> we

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 
strong like cement so locally if we

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.870 
strong like cement so locally if we
don't<00:05:31.900> guess<00:05:32.110> means<00:05:32.410> that's<00:05:32.860> what<00:05:33.070> we<00:05:33.370> do<00:05:33.580> and

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
don't guess means that's what we do and

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.720 
don't guess means that's what we do and
so<00:05:34.870> cement<00:05:35.440> is<00:05:35.680> a<00:05:35.710> new<00:05:37.290> technology<00:05:38.310> but<00:05:39.310> this

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:39.730 
so cement is a new technology but this

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.150 
so cement is a new technology but this
form<00:05:40.090> of<00:05:40.270> what<00:05:40.660> we<00:05:40.840> usually<00:05:41.020> after<00:05:41.410> now<00:05:41.770> some

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:42.160 
form of what we usually after now some

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.080 
form of what we usually after now some
of<00:05:42.190> us<00:05:42.400> are<00:05:42.460> still<00:05:42.910> used<00:05:43.120> in<00:05:44.250> and<00:05:45.250> is<00:05:45.520> very<00:05:45.760> good
