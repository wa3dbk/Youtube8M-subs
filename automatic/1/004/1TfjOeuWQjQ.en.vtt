00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849 
about going into the play every time

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.339 
about going into the play every time
you're<00:00:24.180> going<00:00:24.270> to<00:00:24.329> get<00:00:24.450> these<00:00:24.599> instructions

and they do get a bit repetitive but
it's<00:00:27.480> not<00:00:27.689> bad<00:00:27.930> because<00:00:28.320> once<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.619> tap<00:00:28.800> you're

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:29.040 
it's not bad because once you tap you're

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.530 
it's not bad because once you tap you're
going<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.250> start<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:29.820> it's<00:00:30.090> just<00:00:30.239> a<00:00:30.329> little

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:30.540

the<00:00:45.810> top<00:00:45.990> and<00:00:46.260> pretty<00:00:47.010> much<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.430> just<00:00:47.610> you

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
the top and pretty much it's just you

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.240 
the top and pretty much it's just you
your<00:00:48.510> Blue<00:00:48.720> Bird<00:00:48.990> and<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.320> pellets<00:00:50.010> to

your Blue Bird and the pellets to

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.520 
your Blue Bird and the pellets to
survive<00:00:50.610> that's<00:00:51.240> how<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.390> think<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.990> so

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
survive that's how I think of it so

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.530 
survive that's how I think of it so
you're<00:00:53.190> going<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.340> tap<00:00:53.640> with<00:00:53.880> your<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.420> the

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
you're going to tap with your to the

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.800 
you're going to tap with your to the
right<00:00:54.720> to<00:00:54.989> go<00:00:55.140> farther<00:00:55.440> up<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.360> left<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.660> go

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
right to go farther up and left to go

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.130 
right to go farther up and left to go
left<00:00:58.110> of<00:00:58.680> course<00:00:59.040> so<00:00:59.790> blue<00:01:00.480> bird<00:01:00.720> is<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.899> really

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
left of course so blue bird is a really

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.410 
left of course so blue bird is a really
nice<00:01:01.290> concept<00:01:01.829> I'm<00:01:02.070> not<00:01:02.489> going<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> lie<00:01:02.880> i'm<00:01:03.149> i

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420

a<00:01:05.670> couple<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.270> times<00:01:06.479> because<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:07.050> may<00:01:07.170> get<00:01:07.320> a

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
a couple of times because it may get a

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.380 
a couple of times because it may get a
bit<00:01:07.440> repetitive<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.729> just<00:01:08.940> find<00:01:09.150> your

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
bit repetitive with you just find your

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.330

blue<00:01:10.020> bird<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:10.500> game<00:01:10.740> might<00:01:10.950> be<00:01:10.979> for<00:01:11.310> a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
blue bird this game might be for a

blue bird this game might be for a
couple<00:01:11.400> people<00:01:11.909> but<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.420> myself<00:01:12.540> I<00:01:12.930> really

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
couple people but for myself I really

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.840 
couple people but for myself I really
don't<00:01:13.620> like<00:01:13.680> these<00:01:13.890> types<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.250> calm<00:01:14.550> games

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
don't like these types of calm games

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.510 
don't like these types of calm games
where<00:01:15.060> you're<00:01:15.120> just<00:01:15.330> sitting<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.400> you<00:01:17.400> know

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
where you're just sitting and you know

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.120 
where you're just sitting and you know
just<00:01:18.510> like<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.840> game<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.200> I'm<00:01:19.440> not<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> fan<00:01:20.100> but

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
just like this game is I'm not a fan but

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.410 
just like this game is I'm not a fan but
i'm<00:01:20.520> sure<00:01:20.820> most<00:01:21.030> people<00:01:21.510> are<00:01:22.909> but<00:01:23.909> again<00:01:24.180> it

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
i'm sure most people are but again it

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.390 
i'm sure most people are but again it
does<00:01:24.600> not<00:01:24.810> have<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> high<00:01:25.380> replay<00:01:25.770> value<00:01:26.010> so

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
does not have a high replay value so

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.500 
does not have a high replay value so
you're<00:01:26.549> not<00:01:26.700> going<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.940> be<00:01:27.060> playing<00:01:27.270> this
