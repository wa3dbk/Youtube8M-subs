learn distance education is an

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.090 
learn distance education is an
outstanding<00:02:55.150> environment<00:02:56.019> in<00:02:56.110> which<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.260> try

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
outstanding environment in which to try

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.000 
outstanding environment in which to try
and<00:02:57.220> get<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:57.370> right<00:02:57.550> eventually<00:02:58.800> what<00:02:59.800> am<00:02:59.890> I

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
and get it right eventually what am I

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.620 
and get it right eventually what am I
looking<00:03:00.130> at<00:03:00.430> well<00:03:00.730> one<00:03:01.060> of<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.209> things<00:03:01.269> that's

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
looking at well one of the things that's

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.539 
looking at well one of the things that's
Ralph<00:03:01.930> and<00:03:02.560> you<00:03:02.680> will<00:03:02.829> know<00:03:02.950> I've<00:03:03.130> discussed

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
Ralph and you will know I've discussed

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.699 
Ralph and you will know I've discussed
in<00:03:03.760> the<00:03:03.880> last<00:03:04.000> few<00:03:04.269> weeks<00:03:04.329> is<00:03:04.720> actually<00:03:05.500> trying

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
in the last few weeks is actually trying

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.600 
in the last few weeks is actually trying
to<00:03:05.860> enhance<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:07.450> body<00:03:08.130> distance<00:03:09.130> students

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
to enhance the body distance students

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.930 
to enhance the body distance students
get<00:03:10.450> access<00:03:10.840> to<00:03:11.110> study<00:03:11.410> materials<00:03:11.950> so<00:03:12.579> at<00:03:12.790> the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
get access to study materials so at the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.670 
get access to study materials so at the
moment<00:03:13.090> i<00:03:13.299> think<00:03:13.510> is<00:03:13.600> primarily<00:03:14.140> print-based

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
moment i think is primarily print-based

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.270 
moment i think is primarily print-based
materials<00:03:15.090> that<00:03:16.090> that<00:03:16.269> students<00:03:16.690> get<00:03:17.280> and

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
materials that that students get and

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.130 
materials that that students get and
that<00:03:18.519> that<00:03:18.730> certainly<00:03:19.120> has<00:03:19.299> place<00:03:19.570> but<00:03:19.870> i<00:03:19.900> want

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
that that certainly has place but i want

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.979 
that that certainly has place but i want
to<00:03:20.260> increase<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.680> choices<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:21.549> so<00:03:21.989> maybe

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
to increase the choices and so maybe

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.990 
to increase the choices and so maybe
maybe<00:03:23.470> sorts<00:03:24.190> of<00:03:24.250> things<00:03:24.400> we're<00:03:24.610> looking<00:03:24.700> at

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
maybe sorts of things we're looking at

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.050 
maybe sorts of things we're looking at
her<00:03:25.150> maybe<00:03:25.420> getting<00:03:26.400> materials<00:03:27.400> on<00:03:27.640> memory

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060

those<00:03:44.320> materials<00:03:44.680> ok<00:03:45.430> that's<00:03:45.730> consistent

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
those materials ok that's consistent

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.120 
those materials ok that's consistent
with<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:46.570> way<00:03:46.690> into<00:03:46.930> this<00:03:47.140> he<00:03:47.380> sees<00:03:47.620> itself<00:03:48.010> as

digital<00:03:51.400> environment<00:03:52.000> so<00:03:52.180> that<00:03:52.209> students

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
digital environment so that students

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.930 
digital environment so that students
whether<00:03:53.350> they<00:03:53.470> are<00:03:53.590> studying<00:03:54.070> on<00:03:54.280> a<00:03:54.310> campus<00:03:54.790> or

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
whether they are studying on a campus or

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:55.780 
whether they are studying on a campus or
whether<00:03:55.120> they're<00:03:55.329> doing

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
whether they're doing

whether they're doing
in<00:03:56.360> a<00:03:56.510> distance<00:03:56.900> I<00:03:57.140> get<00:03:57.860> the<00:03:57.950> real<00:03:58.099> benefits<00:03:58.549> of

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
in a distance I get the real benefits of

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.539 
in a distance I get the real benefits of
one's<00:03:58.939> a<00:03:59.090> bit<00:03:59.269> of<00:03:59.329> a<00:03:59.390> revolution<00:03:59.989> now<00:04:00.200> in

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
one's a bit of a revolution now in

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.280 
one's a bit of a revolution now in
learning<00:04:01.549> because<00:04:02.450> there's<00:04:02.810> so<00:04:02.989> much<00:04:03.079> more

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
learning because there's so much more

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.170 
learning because there's so much more
you<00:04:03.349> can<00:04:03.620> do<00:04:03.859> with<00:04:04.099> with<00:04:04.670> that<00:04:04.819> digital

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
you can do with with that digital

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.330 
you can do with with that digital
environment<00:04:05.719> so<00:04:05.930> we'll<00:04:06.829> watch<00:04:07.069> those

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
environment so we'll watch those

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.160 
environment so we'll watch those
developments<00:04:08.000> okay<00:04:08.359> we<00:04:08.569> like<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:08.840> keep<00:04:08.959> these

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
developments okay we like to keep these

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.050 
developments okay we like to keep these
short<00:04:09.500> as<00:04:09.739> we've<00:04:09.890> always<00:04:10.040> said<00:04:10.489> previously

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
short as we've always said previously

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.710 
short as we've always said previously
because<00:04:11.629> we<00:04:12.019> know<00:04:12.200> that<00:04:12.950> a<00:04:13.250> long<00:04:13.730> video<00:04:14.120> log<00:04:14.510> is

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
because we know that a long video log is

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.990 
because we know that a long video log is
not<00:04:14.900> a<00:04:14.930> great<00:04:15.409> one<00:04:15.590> so<00:04:16.489> that<00:04:16.609> we<00:04:16.729> close<00:04:16.940> up

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
not a great one so that we close up

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.870 
not a great one so that we close up
