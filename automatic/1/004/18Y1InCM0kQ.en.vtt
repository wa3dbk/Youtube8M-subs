lucky band check now I'm ready to get my

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:25.059 
lucky band check now I'm ready to get my
swerve<00:02:16.970> on<00:02:17.470> apparently

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.350 

approach<00:02:26.069> your<00:02:26.280> local<00:02:26.700> piece<00:02:26.880> of<00:02:27.060> sliding

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
approach your local piece of sliding

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.870 
approach your local piece of sliding
urban<00:02:27.840> architecture<00:02:28.160> back<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.430> obstacle

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
urban architecture back to the obstacle

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.750 
urban architecture back to the obstacle
checking<00:02:30.300> you're<00:02:30.450> still<00:02:30.480> looking<00:02:31.170> fly<00:02:31.760> this

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
checking you're still looking fly this

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.729 
checking you're still looking fly this
trick<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.239> really<00:02:33.690> logical<00:02:33.900> follow<00:02:34.410> on<00:02:34.590> from

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
trick is a really logical follow on from

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.800 
trick is a really logical follow on from
the<00:02:34.890> no<00:02:35.069> slide<00:02:35.370> as<00:02:35.580> the<00:02:36.000> motion<00:02:36.300> is<00:02:36.390> really

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
the no slide as the motion is really

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.290 
the no slide as the motion is really
similar<00:02:37.110> as<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.370> near<00:02:38.520> the<00:02:38.640> obstacle<00:02:39.120> Ollie

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
similar as you near the obstacle Ollie

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.420 
similar as you near the obstacle Ollie
the<00:02:39.600> board<00:02:39.810> 90<00:02:40.200> degrees<00:02:40.530> aiming<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.130> land<00:02:41.310> with

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
the board 90 degrees aiming to land with

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
the block so it kind of makes a que

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.020 
the block so it kind of makes a que
shape<00:02:45.000> against<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:45.540> get<00:02:46.020> it<00:02:46.640> keep<00:02:47.640> your<00:02:47.850> weight
