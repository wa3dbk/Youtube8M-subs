00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.730 

I<00:00:05.240> think<00:00:06.240> going<00:00:06.359> into<00:00:06.690> this<00:00:06.810> World<00:00:07.259> Cup<00:00:07.410> in

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
I think going into this World Cup in

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.140 
I think going into this World Cup in
terms<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.250> England<00:00:08.580> I<00:00:08.700> think<00:00:08.880> one<00:00:09.000> of<00:00:09.059> the

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
terms of England I think one of the

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.200 
terms of England I think one of the
really<00:00:09.420> interesting<00:00:09.530> factors<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:11.519> how<00:00:11.580> Roy

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
really interesting factors is how Roy

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.330 
really interesting factors is how Roy
Hodgson<00:00:12.780> will<00:00:13.320> approach<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.950> forward

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
Hodgson will approach the forward

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.700 
Hodgson will approach the forward
situation<00:00:15.030> with<00:00:15.210> these<00:00:15.299> strikers<00:00:15.719> not<00:00:16.440> just

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
situation with these strikers not just

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.230 
situation with these strikers not just
which<00:00:16.920> system<00:00:17.490> we<00:00:17.580> play<00:00:17.820> but<00:00:18.090> which

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
which system we play but which

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.870 
which system we play but which
individuals<00:00:18.869> will<00:00:19.439> slot<00:00:19.770> into<00:00:20.010> that<00:00:20.310> system

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
individuals will slot into that system

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.960 
individuals will slot into that system
because<00:00:21.779> it's<00:00:22.109> it's<00:00:22.560> quite<00:00:23.100> important<00:00:23.789> to

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
because it's it's quite important to

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.000 
because it's it's quite important to
know<00:00:24.720> not<00:00:24.750> just<00:00:25.140> how<00:00:25.260> you're<00:00:25.590> playing<00:00:25.769> but

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
know not just how you're playing but

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.830 
know not just how you're playing but
which<00:00:26.220> players<00:00:26.609> fit<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.029> certain<00:00:27.390> positions

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
which players fit in certain positions

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.330 
which players fit in certain positions
which<00:00:28.050> players<00:00:28.349> can<00:00:28.740> actually<00:00:29.039> cope<00:00:29.220> with

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
which players can actually cope with

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.400 
which players can actually cope with
playing<00:00:29.609> out<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.849> position<00:00:30.449> for<00:00:30.630> me<00:00:31.199> there's

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
playing out of position for me there's

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.200 
playing out of position for me there's
one<00:00:31.560> thing<00:00:31.800> that<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.219> should<00:00:32.880> be<00:00:33.030> pretty

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
one thing that that should be pretty

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.810 
one thing that that should be pretty
permanent<00:00:33.829> given<00:00:34.829> fitness<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.370> form<00:00:35.610> and

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
permanent given fitness and form and

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.209 
permanent given fitness and form and
that's<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.899> Daniel<00:00:37.290> Sturridge<00:00:37.530> plays<00:00:37.920> up

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
that's the Daniel Sturridge plays up

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.330 
that's the Daniel Sturridge plays up
front<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.180> middle<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:39.899> think<00:00:40.590> from<00:00:40.950> time<00:00:41.129> to

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
front in the middle I think from time to

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.340 
front in the middle I think from time to
time<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.730> different<00:00:41.850> systems<00:00:42.239> Roy's<00:00:42.840> used<00:00:43.170> him

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
time in different systems Roy's used him

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.610 
time in different systems Roy's used him
on<00:00:43.469> one<00:00:44.250> side<00:00:44.550> or<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.850> other<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.420> had<00:00:45.870> Wayne

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
on one side or the other and had Wayne

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.930 
on one side or the other and had Wayne
Rooney<00:00:46.950> up<00:00:47.039> front<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.489> middle<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:47.879> I

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
Rooney up front in the middle but I

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.029 
Rooney up front in the middle but I
think<00:00:48.149> Sturridge<00:00:48.739> gives<00:00:49.739> us<00:00:49.860> different

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
think Sturridge gives us different

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.220 
think Sturridge gives us different
options<00:00:50.610> he<00:00:50.789> gives<00:00:50.969> us<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.180> threat<00:00:51.570> behind<00:00:51.780> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
options he gives us a threat behind the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.170 
options he gives us a threat behind the
opposition's<00:00:52.770> defense<00:00:53.219> which<00:00:53.520> i<00:00:53.610> think<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.969> is

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
opposition's defense which i think is is

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.970 
opposition's defense which i think is is
really<00:00:54.870> important<00:00:55.350> that's<00:00:55.469> something<00:00:55.829> that

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
really important that's something that

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.700 
really important that's something that
Wayne<00:00:56.610> Rooney<00:00:56.879> doesn't<00:00:57.719> do<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.050> frequently

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
Wayne Rooney doesn't do so frequently

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.560 
Wayne Rooney doesn't do so frequently
he's<00:00:59.190> very<00:00:59.489> good<00:00:59.760> at<00:00:59.850> coming<00:01:00.000> off<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.329> course

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
he's very good at coming off of course

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.170 
he's very good at coming off of course
creating<00:01:01.079> space<00:01:01.670> turning<00:01:02.670> hitting<00:01:02.969> shots

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
creating space turning hitting shots

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.340 
creating space turning hitting shots
bringing<00:01:03.570> other<00:01:03.690> people<00:01:03.780> into<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.320> game

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
bringing other people into the game

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.039 
bringing other people into the game
working<00:01:04.769> hard<00:01:05.159> but<00:01:05.640> in<00:01:05.760> terms<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.450> threat

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
working hard but in terms of a threat

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.469 
working hard but in terms of a threat
behind<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.530> opposition's<00:01:08.010> defense<00:01:08.479> that's

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
behind the opposition's defense that's

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.330 
behind the opposition's defense that's
the<00:01:09.930> richest<00:01:10.260> territory<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:10.799> very<00:01:10.979> good<00:01:11.220> at

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
the richest territory is very good at

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.800 
the richest territory is very good at
that<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.640> what<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.150> does<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.450> course<00:01:12.510> it

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
that and what that does of course it

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.750 
that and what that does of course it
makes<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.290> opposition<00:01:13.799> slightly<00:01:14.220> nervous<00:01:14.610> so

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
makes the opposition slightly nervous so

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.280 
makes the opposition slightly nervous so
they<00:01:14.790> edge<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> little<00:01:15.630> bit<00:01:15.750> further<00:01:16.049> back

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
they edge of a little bit further back

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.560 
they edge of a little bit further back
which<00:01:16.799> creates<00:01:17.310> space<00:01:17.729> between<00:01:18.390> the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
which creates space between the

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.240 
which creates space between the
opposition's<00:01:19.049> defense<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.650> their<00:01:19.799> midfield

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
opposition's defense and their midfield

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.320 
opposition's defense and their midfield
for<00:01:21.090> others<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.930> exploit<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:24.000> can<00:01:24.180> do

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
for others to exploit and if we can do

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.240 
for others to exploit and if we can do
that<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.630> makes<00:01:24.869> teams<00:01:25.200> thing<00:01:25.530> whereas<00:01:26.070> if

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
that it makes teams thing whereas if

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.800 
that it makes teams thing whereas if
you've<00:01:26.460> got<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> player<00:01:26.880> that<00:01:27.060> doesn't<00:01:27.360> go<00:01:27.630> that

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
you've got a player that doesn't go that

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.929 
you've got a player that doesn't go that
way<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.560> opposition's<00:01:29.009> defense<00:01:29.340> can<00:01:29.549> squeeze

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
way the opposition's defense can squeeze

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.819 
way the opposition's defense can squeeze
up<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.360> then<00:01:30.900> you've<00:01:31.020> got<00:01:31.200> less<00:01:31.409> space<00:01:31.799> to

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
up and then you've got less space to

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.880 
up and then you've got less space to
actually<00:01:32.189> perform<00:01:32.909> in<00:01:33.259> so<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.350> question<00:01:34.710> then

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
actually perform in so the question then

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.649 
actually perform in so the question then
of<00:01:34.920> course<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:35.850> right<00:01:36.390> we've<00:01:36.540> got

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
of course is is that right we've got

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.450 
of course is is that right we've got
storage<00:01:36.960> up<00:01:37.140> front<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.590> then<00:01:37.799> who<00:01:38.100> do<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.250> play

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
storage up front and then who do we play

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.640 
storage up front and then who do we play
and<00:01:38.759> which<00:01:38.880> system<00:01:39.270> do<00:01:39.420> play<00:01:39.720> well<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.140> could

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
and which system do play well you could

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.170 
and which system do play well you could
of<00:01:40.740> course<00:01:40.920> play<00:01:41.100> some<00:01:41.310> sort<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.549> diamond<00:01:42.060> in

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
of course play some sort of diamond in

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.730 
of course play some sort of diamond in
midfield<00:01:42.360> like<00:01:42.869> Liverpool<00:01:43.290> have<00:01:43.409> done<00:01:43.530> so

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
midfield like Liverpool have done so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.450 
midfield like Liverpool have done so
successfully<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.549> season<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.649> put<00:01:46.649> put

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
successfully this season and put put

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.219 
successfully this season and put put
Wayne<00:01:47.640> Rooney<00:01:48.030> in<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.210> natural<00:01:48.450> position

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
a little bit difficult you tend to

you'll<00:02:15.120> play<00:02:15.300> some<00:02:15.570> sort<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.870> system<00:02:16.560> that

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
you'll play some sort of system that

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.580 
you'll play some sort of system that
gives<00:02:17.040> him<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.610> depth<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.270> midfield<00:02:18.720> but

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
gives him that depth in midfield but

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.560 
gives him that depth in midfield but
then<00:02:20.160> you've<00:02:20.280> got<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.520> conundrum<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.060> courses

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
then you've got the conundrum of courses

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.780 
then you've got the conundrum of courses
is<00:02:21.750> if<00:02:22.260> storages<00:02:22.800> up<00:02:22.980> top<00:02:23.250> in<00:02:23.430> that<00:02:23.520> system

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
is if storages up top in that system

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.100 
is if storages up top in that system
where<00:02:24.060> do<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.210> play<00:02:24.390> Wayne<00:02:24.570> Rooney<00:02:24.930> well

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
where do you play Wayne Rooney well

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.810 
where do you play Wayne Rooney well
Wayne<00:02:25.650> can<00:02:25.860> play<00:02:26.010> anywhere<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.430> can<00:02:26.550> play<00:02:26.730> on

Wayne can play anywhere you can play on
the<00:02:26.880> right<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.690> can<00:02:27.840> play<00:02:28.020> on<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.170> left<00:02:28.440> you

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
the right you can play on the left you

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.530 
the right you can play on the left you
could<00:02:28.710> even<00:02:28.890> play<00:02:29.220> in<00:02:29.520> impress<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.210> forward

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.200 
could even play in impress the forward
midfield<00:02:30.990> role<00:02:31.640> but<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.700> question<00:02:33.000> is<00:02:33.090> of

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
midfield role but the question is of

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.090 
midfield role but the question is of
course<00:02:33.390> have<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.600> got<00:02:33.720> better<00:02:33.900> players<00:02:34.170> in

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
course have you got better players in

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.670 
course have you got better players in
those<00:02:35.400> particular<00:02:35.940> positions<00:02:36.660> than<00:02:36.990> Wayne

those particular positions than Wayne

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.470 
those particular positions than Wayne
Rooney<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.130> could<00:02:38.310> leave<00:02:38.820> goal<00:02:39.030> sorts<00:02:39.390> of

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
Rooney you could leave goal sorts of

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.900 
Rooney you could leave goal sorts of

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
options which is which is got you've got

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.580 
options which is which is got you've got

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
lot by Roy Hodgson in his teams you'd

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.500 
lot by Roy Hodgson in his teams you'd
expect<00:02:53.100> him<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.310> play<00:02:53.580> probably<00:02:54.210> on<00:02:54.420> the
