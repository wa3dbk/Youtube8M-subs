00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440 

alright<00:00:00.690> good<00:00:01.260> evening<00:00:02.240> dr.<00:00:03.240> Orakpo<00:00:05.450> briefly

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
alright good evening dr. Orakpo briefly

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.299 
alright good evening dr. Orakpo briefly
I<00:00:06.569> wanted<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.109> look<00:00:07.890> at<00:00:08.570> gametogenesis

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:10.309 
I wanted to look at gametogenesis

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.420 
I wanted to look at gametogenesis
meiosis<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.670> mitosis<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:13.730> inheritance<00:00:14.730> so

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:16.430 
meiosis and mitosis and inheritance so

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:20.179 
meiosis and mitosis and inheritance so
up<00:00:17.430> top<00:00:17.730> we<00:00:18.000> have<00:00:18.470> starting<00:00:19.470> with<00:00:19.560> meiosis

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
up top we have starting with meiosis

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.640 
up top we have starting with meiosis
meiosis<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.840> process<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.410> cell<00:00:22.619> division

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
meiosis is the process of cell division

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.420 
meiosis is the process of cell division
where<00:00:23.689> you<00:00:24.689> produce<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.439> gametes<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.189> male

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
where you produce the gametes the male

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.419 
where you produce the gametes the male
and<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.820> female<00:00:27.330> gametes<00:00:28.170> which<00:00:28.560> we<00:00:28.740> call<00:00:28.980> the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
and the female gametes which we call the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.200 
and the female gametes which we call the
sperm<00:00:29.760> and<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.090> oocytes<00:00:31.430> alright<00:00:32.430> so<00:00:32.969> from

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
sperm and the oocytes alright so from

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.069 
sperm and the oocytes alright so from
there<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.630> have<00:00:33.780> your<00:00:33.809> 46<00:00:34.440> chromosomes<00:00:34.860> and

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:36.079 
there you have your 46 chromosomes and

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.530 
there you have your 46 chromosomes and
once<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.370> 46<00:00:38.370> chromosomes<00:00:38.760> begin<00:00:39.390> to

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
once the 46 chromosomes begin to

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.630 
once the 46 chromosomes begin to
duplicate<00:00:40.079> they<00:00:40.800> turn<00:00:40.980> into<00:00:41.219> sister

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
duplicate they turn into sister

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.400 
duplicate they turn into sister
chromatids<00:00:42.210> right<00:00:43.010> you<00:00:44.010> can<00:00:44.160> see<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:45.410> okay

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
chromatids right you can see that okay

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.200 
chromatids right you can see that okay
so<00:00:47.039> immediately<00:00:47.399> after<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.879> sister

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
so immediately after the sister

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.979 
so immediately after the sister
chromatids<00:00:49.610> form<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:51.449> homologous

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
chromatids form the homologous

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.709 
chromatids form the homologous
chromosomes<00:00:52.620> pair<00:00:53.160> up<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.579> now<00:00:54.390> when<00:00:54.600> the

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
chromosomes pair up and now when the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.510 
chromosomes pair up and now when the
homologous<00:00:55.199> chromosomes<00:00:55.710> para<00:00:56.039> we<00:00:56.280> called

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
homologous chromosomes para we called

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.990 
homologous chromosomes para we called
the<00:00:56.640> process<00:00:57.120> synapses<00:00:58.020> which<00:00:59.000> immediately

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
the process synapses which immediately

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.910 
the process synapses which immediately
after<00:01:00.570> will<00:01:00.809> produce<00:01:01.050> two<00:01:02.010> daughter<00:01:03.000> cells

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
after will produce two daughter cells

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.700 
after will produce two daughter cells
alright<00:01:04.920> two<00:01:05.880> daughter<00:01:06.119> cells<00:01:07.250> okay<00:01:08.250> then

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
alright two daughter cells okay then

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.660 
alright two daughter cells okay then
after<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.799> two<00:01:10.950> daughter<00:01:11.189> cells<00:01:11.310> are

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
after the two daughter cells are

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.010 
after the two daughter cells are
produced<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.810> initiate<00:01:13.290> meiosis<00:01:13.920> 2<00:01:14.750> okay<00:01:15.750> and

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
produced you initiate meiosis 2 okay and

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.330 
produced you initiate meiosis 2 okay and
as<00:01:16.409> meiosis<00:01:16.920> 2<00:01:16.950> proceeds<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:19.340> eventually

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
as meiosis 2 proceeds it eventually

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.440 
as meiosis 2 proceeds it eventually
separates<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.869> sister<00:01:22.229> chromatids<00:01:23.060> from<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
separates the sister chromatids from the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.950 
separates the sister chromatids from the
beginning<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:24.869> the<00:01:24.990> process<00:01:25.369> right<00:01:26.960> alright

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
beginning of the process right alright

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.440 
beginning of the process right alright
so<00:01:28.140> briefly<00:01:29.329> looking<00:01:30.329> at<00:01:32.030> inheritance<00:01:33.030> theory

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
so briefly looking at inheritance theory

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.450 
so briefly looking at inheritance theory
alright<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.530> from<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:36.150> male<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:37.020> get<00:01:37.460> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
alright so from the male you get the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.610 
alright so from the male you get the
sperm<00:01:38.759> right<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.799> chromosome<00:01:41.130> you

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
sperm right on the chromosome you

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.120 
sperm right on the chromosome you
23<00:01:43.620> haploid<00:01:44.130> all<00:01:44.640> right<00:01:44.940> male<00:01:45.360> gamete<00:01:46.130> 23

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
23 haploid all right male gamete 23

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.750 
23 haploid all right male gamete 23
haploid<00:01:48.090> all<00:01:49.050> right<00:01:49.610> then<00:01:50.990> from<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.080> v-mail

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
haploid all right then from the v-mail

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:59.930 
haploid all right then from the v-mail
you<00:01:53.760> get<00:01:56.060> 23<00:01:57.060> haploid<00:01:57.480> as<00:01:57.660> well<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:59.460> summation

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
you get 23 haploid as well the summation

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.860 
you get 23 haploid as well the summation
is<00:02:00.350> 46<00:02:01.460> chromosomes<00:02:03.110> okay<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.860> but<00:02:05.790> as<00:02:06.390> humans

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
is 46 chromosomes okay so but as humans

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.430 
is 46 chromosomes okay so but as humans
you<00:02:07.050> know<00:02:07.170> we<00:02:07.350> have<00:02:08.119> we<00:02:09.119> have<00:02:09.210> 35<00:02:09.630> thousand

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
you know we have we have 35 thousand

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.410 
you know we have we have 35 thousand
genes<00:02:10.740> on<00:02:11.390> 46<00:02:12.390> chromosomes<00:02:13.550> so<00:02:14.550> astounding

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
genes on 46 chromosomes so astounding

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.370 
genes on 46 chromosomes so astounding
it's<00:02:15.690> amazing<00:02:16.200> all<00:02:16.350> right<00:02:16.610> 22<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.910> those

it's amazing all right 22 of those

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.030 
it's amazing all right 22 of those
chromosomes<00:02:19.380> are<00:02:19.950> autosomes<00:02:21.290> 22<00:02:22.290> pairs<00:02:22.500> I'm

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
chromosomes are autosomes 22 pairs I'm

to<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.940> summation<00:02:38.940> is<00:02:39.090> 46<00:02:39.570> once<00:02:39.870> again<00:02:40.190> all

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
to the summation is 46 once again all

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.370 
to the summation is 46 once again all
right<00:02:41.480> so<00:02:42.800> so<00:02:43.800> real<00:02:43.950> quick<00:02:43.980> let's<00:02:44.340> move<00:02:44.640> into

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
right so so real quick let's move into

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.509 
right so so real quick let's move into
mitosis<00:02:47.030> mitosis<00:02:48.030> is<00:02:48.540> also<00:02:48.870> cell<00:02:49.140> division<00:02:49.590> ok

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
mitosis mitosis is also cell division ok

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.630 
mitosis mitosis is also cell division ok
replication<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:52.050> chromosomal<00:02:52.739> DNA<00:02:52.980> will

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
replication of chromosomal DNA will

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.570 
replication of chromosomal DNA will
occur<00:02:53.910> before<00:02:54.180> mitosis<00:02:54.600> occurs<00:02:55.370> but<00:02:56.370> once

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
occur before mitosis occurs but once

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.150 
occur before mitosis occurs but once
mitosis<00:02:57.120> occurs<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.660> will<00:02:57.690> get<00:02:58.140> two<00:02:58.860> daughter

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
mitosis occurs you will get two daughter

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.800 
mitosis occurs you will get two daughter
cells<00:02:59.540> all<00:03:00.540> right<00:03:00.750> similar<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.739> meiosis<00:03:02.810> after

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
cells all right similar to meiosis after

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.880 
cells all right similar to meiosis after
the<00:03:03.900> daughter<00:03:04.080> cells<00:03:04.230> form<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:05.550> chromosomes

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
the daughter cells form the chromosomes

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.290 
the daughter cells form the chromosomes
you'll<00:03:07.890> see<00:03:08.130> how<00:03:08.310> they<00:03:08.459> begin<00:03:08.700> to<00:03:08.760> coil

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
you'll see how they begin to coil

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.590 
you'll see how they begin to coil
contract<00:03:09.780> and<00:03:10.019> condense<00:03:10.470> all<00:03:10.769> right<00:03:11.730> right

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
contract and condense all right right

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.710 
contract and condense all right right
here<00:03:12.870> like<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.760> begin<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.820> coil<00:03:15.239> contract

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
here like so I begin to coil contract

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.440 
here like so I begin to coil contract
and<00:03:16.080> condense<00:03:16.530> excuse<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.489> handwriting<00:03:18.000> all

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
and condense excuse the handwriting all

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.860 
and condense excuse the handwriting all
right<00:03:18.720> which<00:03:18.900> initiates<00:03:19.500> prophase<00:03:19.980> all<00:03:20.550> right

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
right which initiates prophase all right

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.370 
right which initiates prophase all right
so<00:03:21.870> prophase<00:03:23.630> right<00:03:24.630> after<00:03:24.840> prophase<00:03:25.200> you

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
so prophase right after prophase you

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.100 
so prophase right after prophase you
have<00:03:25.470> prometaphase<00:03:26.040> and<00:03:26.630> prometaphase<00:03:27.630> is

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
have prometaphase and prometaphase is

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.460 
have prometaphase and prometaphase is
significant<00:03:28.830> because<00:03:28.950> here<00:03:29.459> you<00:03:30.000> can<00:03:30.180> see<00:03:30.480> you

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
significant because here you can see you

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.140 
significant because here you can see you
can<00:03:31.500> begin<00:03:31.769> to<00:03:31.890> distinguish<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.640> chromatids

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
can begin to distinguish the chromatids

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.240 
can begin to distinguish the chromatids
right<00:03:34.220> these<00:03:35.220> chromatids<00:03:36.470> so<00:03:37.470> if<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:37.709> have<00:03:37.830> 2n

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
right these chromatids so if you have 2n

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.580 
right these chromatids so if you have 2n
you<00:03:38.640> have<00:03:38.760> two<00:03:38.910> chromosomes<00:03:39.299> you<00:03:40.200> have<00:03:40.320> four

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
you have two chromosomes you have four

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.420 
you have two chromosomes you have four
chromatids<00:03:41.299> right<00:03:42.299> each<00:03:43.019> of<00:03:43.260> these<00:03:43.440> right

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
chromatids right each of these right

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.369 
chromatids right each of these right
here<00:03:44.989> is<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.080> chromatid

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
here is a chromatid

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:52.149 
here is a chromatid
all<00:03:48.379> right<00:03:48.620> now<00:03:49.459> if<00:03:50.060> you<00:03:50.209> look<00:03:50.329> closely<00:03:51.159> the

00:03:52.149 --> 00:03:52.159 
all right now if you look closely the

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.300 
all right now if you look closely the
microtubules<00:03:52.939> here<00:03:53.359> are<00:03:53.569> what<00:03:53.840> attach<00:03:54.310> the

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
microtubules here are what attach the

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.309 
microtubules here are what attach the
chromosomes<00:03:55.819> and<00:03:56.060> align<00:03:56.659> them<00:03:56.900> along<00:03:57.140> the

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
chromosomes and align them along the

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.199 
chromosomes and align them along the
equatorial<00:03:57.500> plane<00:03:58.120> all<00:03:59.120> right<00:03:59.560> so<00:04:00.730> after<00:04:01.730> that

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
equatorial plane all right so after that

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.830 
equatorial plane all right so after that
you<00:04:02.450> have<00:04:02.480> anaphase<00:04:03.260> now<00:04:04.099> in<00:04:04.189> this<00:04:04.310> phase

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
you have anaphase now in this phase

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.679 
you have anaphase now in this phase
chromatids<00:04:05.840> begin<00:04:06.170> to<00:04:06.290> separate<00:04:06.799> and<00:04:07.689> migrate

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:08.689 
chromatids begin to separate and migrate

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:13.839 
chromatids begin to separate and migrate
towards<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:09.709> opposite<00:04:10.159> poles<00:04:10.569> all<00:04:11.569> right<00:04:12.849> and

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
towards the opposite poles all right and

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:18.270 
towards the opposite poles all right and
here's<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.180> drawing<00:04:14.450> as<00:04:14.840> such<00:04:17.019> fancy<00:04:18.019> that

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:18.280 
here's the drawing as such fancy that

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.020 
here's the drawing as such fancy that
all<00:04:19.280> right<00:04:19.489> then<00:04:20.150> the<00:04:20.690> final<00:04:20.900> stage<00:04:21.289> is

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
all right then the final stage is

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.710 
all right then the final stage is
telophase<00:04:23.030> and<00:04:23.389> here<00:04:24.139> telophase<00:04:25.330> you<00:04:26.330> can<00:04:26.479> see

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
telophase and here telophase you can see

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.370 
telophase and here telophase you can see
just<00:04:27.789> opposite<00:04:28.789> of<00:04:28.940> anaphase<00:04:29.710> the

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:32.380 
just opposite of anaphase the

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.409 
just opposite of anaphase the
chromosomes<00:04:33.380> begin<00:04:33.949> to<00:04:34.190> lengthen<00:04:34.550> actually

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
chromosomes begin to lengthen actually

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.800 
chromosomes begin to lengthen actually
they<00:04:36.020> begin<00:04:36.410> to<00:04:36.470> LinkedIn<00:04:36.949> and<00:04:37.220> uncoil<00:04:37.820> all

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
they begin to LinkedIn and uncoil all

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.719 
they begin to LinkedIn and uncoil all
right<00:04:39.190> see<00:04:40.190> but<00:04:40.430> earlier<00:04:40.849> we<00:04:41.090> saw<00:04:41.300> how<00:04:41.570> the

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
right see but earlier we saw how the

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.629 
right see but earlier we saw how the
chromosomes<00:04:43.729> were<00:04:44.030> coiling<00:04:44.630> condensing<00:04:45.349> and

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
chromosomes were coiling condensing and

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.520 
chromosomes were coiling condensing and
contracting<00:04:46.639> and<00:04:46.820> shortening<00:04:47.530> but

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
contracting and shortening but

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:49.749 
contracting and shortening but
throughout<00:04:48.800> the<00:04:48.949> whole<00:04:49.070> process<00:04:49.220> they

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 
throughout the whole process they

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.560 
throughout the whole process they
continued<00:04:50.660> to<00:04:51.099> shorten<00:04:52.099> and<00:04:52.340> Dickon<00:04:52.789> until

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
continued to shorten and Dickon until

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.320 
continued to shorten and Dickon until
you<00:04:53.900> get<00:04:54.169> to<00:04:54.500> the<00:04:54.889> final<00:04:55.580> stage<00:04:55.789> to<00:04:56.479> the<00:04:56.510> face

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
you get to the final stage to the face

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.360 
you get to the final stage to the face
all<00:04:59.330> right<00:04:59.599> there<00:05:00.110> you<00:05:00.139> have<00:05:00.409> it<00:05:01.870> very<00:05:02.870> brief

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:03.370 
all right there you have it very brief

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:10.389 
all right there you have it very brief
but<00:05:04.370> good<00:05:05.620> intro<00:05:06.620> in<00:05:07.389> HD
