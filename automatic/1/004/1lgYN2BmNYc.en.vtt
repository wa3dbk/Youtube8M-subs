00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.240
 guests in our studio we are talking about night 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.779
 about a dream the last question remained with us 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.170
 women the most important thing whether you can look younger 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.599
 just one night before answering 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.450
 On this question I want to tell you that 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.660
 going on with skin and women 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.719
 at night our skin 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.850
 we care they are from morning to evening but 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.989
 We do not even suspect that the main period 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.660
 when skin is renewed and rejuvenated 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:52.440
 occurs at night when we sleep with 11 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.110
 evenings until one o'clock so two outputs 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.289
 if you sleep badly then you quickly grow old 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.980
 and 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.980

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.320
 I did not want to have my own secrets 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.260
 would learn the nights you spend on that 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.500

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.000

 Masha cellulite you need here so here 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.900
 the younger I propose to focus on 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.240
 the most important problem areas first 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.200
 what should a woman do 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.640
 wash your face wash after this 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.640
 all procedures begin 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:08.119
 we give you hand cream put it on 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:11.480
 hands and special silicone gloves 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.870
 apply cream help help you can 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:17.660
 don't even rub it pay attention if 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.450
 you dry indoor then moisturizer 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.360
 will pull moisture out of your skin and 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.160
 the aging process will only speed up 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.330
 this did not happen you will need 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.450
 special silicone gloves 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.420
 silicone is the only moisturizer 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.610
 which water will keep these gloves off the skin 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.550
 you put your hands on put on 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:43.430
 straight our girlfriend is the first second 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.300
 take off your shoes we have to put 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:51.200
 cream on feet 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:54.140
 apply a thick layer of cream on the heel case 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.050
 the fact that on the skin of our feet almost no 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.360
 sebaceous and sweat glands so the skin in 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.840
 this area is always dry 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.230
 she's rough from cracks im so skin 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.140
 Stop 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:10.040
 it takes even more leaves 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.970
 rub the heel in the same way the second leg 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.980
 and on each leg 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:20.630
 we put on such silicone 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:23.980
 sock for the whole night second leg too 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.240
 dipping scream 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.620
 we put on the second sock 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:33.140
 what silicone socks give they will keep 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.080
 moisture is usually when you use 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.020
 moisturizers if the air is dry 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.020
 then the cream will draw moisture out of your 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.120
 legs and feet or hands and face will still 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.350
 drier after cream dry 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.500
 silicone 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:53.090
 keep all the moisture inside is not all 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:56.420
 the third thing we have to do is not take 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.000
 to vibromassage with warming 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.610
 by action 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.880
 turn it on 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:10.660
 sit your hands on your knees and do here 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:15.490
 such a simple back massage we improve 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:18.630
 now the blood flow in the neck in these muscles a 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.630
 mean and in my head 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.800
 now the woman should lie down correctly 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.600
 you can only get younger if you lie down 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:35.600
 throwing go back 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.750
 So 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.870
 Correct posture is such corners you 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:46.580
 pillows should pull up on like this 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:48.800
 ourselves and we still have andrey his 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:53.060

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:56.500
 the teeth so well bares our teeth let's you 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.500
 now glue the stripes 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.039
 last touch natasha mask 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:08.490
 feeder 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:11.639
 in this position a person will spend the whole night 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:15.380
 I swear to you the next morning it will become much 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:18.840
 younger than most importantly happen 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.970
 the main thing is that in a few night hours you 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:24.180
 make sure your skin is good 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:26.550

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.360
