00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.800
 Hello Dear YouTube I am fueling by intec professionals and I am on the internet 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.690
 a graphic that could in particular be the German Christian 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.759
 the plans to buy an iPhone 4 without a contract 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.099
 and to shun a small trip abroad 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.420
 I have him a compilation of the prices for the 16 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.760
 Gigabyte and 32 gigabyte iPhone 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.460
 abroad 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.260
 As you look around 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.210
 a how this table is structured 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.070
 there are countries that are hard cuts that means 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.930
 Some may not buy the iPhone 4, or only indirectly 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.980
 as in Germany, for example, pass over 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.830
 Tweetie Store so Eckert knows that and certainly 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.610
 Here one communicates with our European neighbors on with France 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.750
 Since the iPhone costs lures directly from the apple store 6 29 euros the sixties 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.220
 Battery and and the 32 gigabyte variant costs 739 euros 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.470
 In Ukas, that is, in the UK, things look a bit different 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.070
 because it costs the equivalent of only 592 euros, the 16-gigabyte version 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.969
 and the 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:22.829
 Zander the violence variant cost them only 10 euros 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.400
 and what she has to worry about now 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.840
 the DAX power supply for the socket a wrong respectively 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.810
 not suitable for TuS German power grid 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.040
 at the end 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.800
 Team would need an adapter that you could also buy pictures 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.000
 Extra money costs so there is ever the cost advantages 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.560
 but percent 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.810
 otherwise you are all the same 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.360
 You can use that from quite usual and if I do not bother you 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.680
 can it synonymous via USB charging then you do not even need this 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.010
 adapter 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.810
 The game will then take us to the next European country 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.149
 is it Belgium that are only recently with the iPhone 4 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.430
 and since it is relatively expensive the 16-gigabyte version costs 6 has 39 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.569
 Euro and the 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.569
 celebrated by 30 gigabytes costs 749 euros 

00:02:11.389 --> 00:02:14.819
 anyway, all iPhone 4s are Beck anyway 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.180
 to try the Hungener BZ what is always tried that now 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.040
 Broadcasting is Thorsten Schmidt 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.770
 Very very few iPhones had been equipped and they were in no time 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.019
 sold out to all 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.769
 Now they are going to the north and after that in the market and is there too 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.979
 Buy iPhone 4 at the market 

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:37.189
 and in the 16 gigabyte version for 600 30 euros again converted 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.159
 tears off and the 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.159
 32 gigabyte version costs 738 euros 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:45.290
 next 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.459
 Let's take a look 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:52.159
 then around Italy we have the prices of the iPhone 4 is also us drivers 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.840
 6 to 59 euros for the 16-gb variant us with 79 euros for the 32 gigabytes 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.169
 variant 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.129
 that is in the European comparison 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:05.560
 and overall, the whole world is likely to be the most expensive price for an iPhone 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:09.829
 if of course the other price of all in euros 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.629
 and are therefore not necessarily recommended except Brunnthal too close 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:14.689
 to Italy 

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:17.999
 otherwise that is very expensive but 

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:19.519
 then let's have a look 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.239
 also in Sweden you can buy the iPhone 4 without a contract 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:29.689
 the 16-gigabyte variant amounts to her to 658 euros and the 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:34.030
 32 gigabyte variant amounts to about 764 euros 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.110
 otherwise, we have tested here already far in Switzerland too 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.449
 lures hope 

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:45.369
 and for 565 euros the 16 gb variant and 660 euros for the 

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:47.409
 32-gb-variant 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:51.889
 this is by far the cheapest price actually in October like he was at 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.109
 the iPhone 4 could come 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.099
 However, you have to live in Switzerland or relatively nearby 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.099
 then you can afford that too 

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:03.749
 otherwise you will see here 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:04.940
 something special 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.699
 because Pedro stitch show the Green bars and Hong Kong 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:14.290
 because the whole costs 96 euros the 16-gigabyte version and 5 degrees 85 euros 

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:16.650
 the two month old at previous club 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.160
 So the 32-year-old learned about 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.959
 is in Hong Kong 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.660
 a bit more expensive and total 20 euros more expensive in doing so trends in the 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:26.319
 Switzerland 

00:04:26.319 --> 00:04:30.339
 So that's my conclusion natural less close to Switzerland and bought 

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:32.800
 such Switzerland I do not know how the availability pulls out 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.499
 probably not as big sec 

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:39.430
 everything will be there otherwise it is recommended Dario QuÃ©bec more 

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:41.449
 can do without the power supply 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:42.310
 and 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.310
 otherwise of course France has so 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:49.069
 and also very good Praest and 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:50.379
 there you can sometimes call things 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:54.580
 Nepal's there requests to Paris Las totally connect with a paris trip what he 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.030
 need 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:56.570
 Culture still brings 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.139
 and that is so nice 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:01.139
 So there you can also look how it looks 

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:05.740
 Berlin you can not recommend the moment at all since there all iPhones way 

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:07.589
 Ratzek has Sales SEC 

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:08.650
 and 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.060
 yes Italy is quite expensive I have to say 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:17.229
 well that was my short info video monitors the iPhone 4 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.539
 Prize distribution child 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.099
 Europe and a little bit in the world 

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.990
 I hope I had brought something and here is where your outbound and now 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.180
 still to buy 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:30.610
 white is still not exactly naked 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.069
 but that's all going to happen 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.529
 So one I'm into Mintec pros and I'm out chips
