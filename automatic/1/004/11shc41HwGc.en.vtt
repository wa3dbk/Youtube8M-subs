because<00:00:06.930> I<00:00:07.170> kind<00:00:07.529> of<00:00:07.620> want<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.890> do<00:00:08.099> something

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
because I kind of want to do something

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.100 
because I kind of want to do something
that<00:00:08.550> was<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:08.970> neutral<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.719> wasn't<00:00:09.990> something

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
that was a neutral that wasn't something

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.020 
that was a neutral that wasn't something
I've<00:00:10.380> done<00:00:10.500> before<00:00:10.559> something<00:00:11.490> else<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.759> lot<00:00:11.910> of

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
I've done before something else a lot of

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.879 
I've done before something else a lot of
color<00:00:12.210> and<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.509> thought<00:00:12.719> why<00:00:13.049> not<00:00:13.080> Katy<00:00:13.620> Perry

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
color and I thought why not Katy Perry

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.980 
color and I thought why not Katy Perry
is<00:00:13.980> definitely<00:00:14.340> one<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.519> my<00:00:14.610> favorite<00:00:15.299> players

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
is definitely one of my favorite players

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.960 
is definitely one of my favorite players
of<00:00:16.199> all<00:00:16.350> time<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:17.130> I<00:00:17.400> thought<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:17.760> would<00:00:17.910> be

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
of all time and I thought this would be

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.849 
of all time and I thought this would be
a<00:00:18.060> really<00:00:18.300> good<00:00:18.539> video<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.930> sort<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.500> imitate

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
a really good video to sort of imitate

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.830 
a really good video to sort of imitate
the<00:00:20.039> look<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.250> she<00:00:20.580> has<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.090> in<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.570> video

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
the look that she has and in the video

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.470 
the look that she has and in the video
she<00:00:21.900> has<00:00:22.230> sort<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.619> a<00:00:22.769> green<00:00:23.100> sort<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.820> base<00:00:24.150> and

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
she has sort of a green sort of base and

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.660 
she has sort of a green sort of base and
then<00:00:24.600> blue<00:00:24.930> eye<00:00:24.960> shadow<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.890> purple<00:00:26.580> eye

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
then blue eye shadow and purple eye

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.160
