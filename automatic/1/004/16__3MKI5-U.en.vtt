00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:15.830
 Of course, it is that 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:20.420
 this is a set of many things 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:23.560
 the phenomenology the voice of en trance 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.560
 diabolical of the girl 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.420
 the levitation also on the other hand 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.239
 except the ones in the head 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.059
 that will never be able to forgive me elena 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.629
 that has never happened in any case 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.900
 of possession where the head of a 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.000
 person has rotated 360 degrees that's what 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:51.320
 what happened because he died 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.320
 it would have broken the 20 - but but 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.940
 citing some effects too maybe 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.370
 exaggerated 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.399
 there are many scenarios that appear in 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.830
 that movie 'the exorcist' that in 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:08.100
 effect have been given and continue to be 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.409
 today in Madrid what 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.659
 commented on a program 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.009
 Cardinal Rouco Varela the he appointed ago 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.229
 a few months to eight exorcists in madrid 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:22.679
 they formed eight exorcist priests in 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.890
 beginning then soloists before the number 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:28.450
 of cases of people who called 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.780
 parishes to priests 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:36.179
 saying saying by swearing 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:40.659
 stating that they were experiencing 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:44.409
 phenomena of evil type influences and 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:49.060
 in some cases few but there are 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:52.420
 possible possessions elena the fight between 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.600
 good and evil more than one may be 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.530
 can you smile sideways say I do 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.500
 in this gesture I do not like 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.150
 they are already telling me these two that 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.460
 movies are riding I say 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.850
 clearly and in a colloquial way you 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.850
 I'd tell them 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.150
 real that a girl could be a 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.690
 boy 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:23.569
 Lorraine in the exorcist's house exists 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.499
 and it all started with a water 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.499
 in fact already 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.710
 and also us despite 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.380
 experience but good 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.660
 we are human beings and we are still 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:42.200
 scaring and reactions like those that 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:46.750
 they just saw a nervous laugh 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.750
 we pull back that it's always everything 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.060
 the evil that evil whatever it is demons beings 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.520
 dead deceased deceased I mean 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.690
 the people who have lived on earth 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:09.890
 but they have been terribly evil 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.250
 depraved of general 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.560
 and the beings that are the two angels 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.530
 fallen is to say demons 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.800
 yes yes hell demons I told you that 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.200
 the cases of someday we will treat them the 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.050
 subject of demonology possessions 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.940
 diabolical and other exorcisms in the 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.560
 world not only in Spain in the world 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.590
 in recent years 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.510
 the number of 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.209
 diabolical influences possessions 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.530
 diabolical in a way really 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.410
 striking elena 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.680
 that is, to take it into account something 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:52.880
 is acting so that the world in 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.800
 general away from what it is 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.820
 and the light we can say it 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:01.340
 metaphorically like that and you get full 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.800
 in a way of no return that is the world 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.390
 of darkness the world of evil of the 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.030
 bad feelings of the bad 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:11.780
 thoughts of bad deeds to do 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.870
 damage and ultimately to be a bad person 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.750
 that is what we should never be but 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.269
 on the contrary good people and good 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.180
 people 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.819
 it's not a religious issue it 's a subject 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.560
 paranormal I repeat the fact of 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:28.199
 that is in the bible of means not 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.750
 means nothing is the sacred book 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:34.300
 par excellence of Christians and the 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.870
 ancient testament of the Jews 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:41.220
 on which the Qur'an is based this is 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.220
 that is to say 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.979
 the bible is special because of something we are going to 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.939
 get six and it's special because 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.939
 apart from being a 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.530
 and it really has 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:08.900
 I have simply opened there are many 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.830
 it's a good bible the nacre column I've 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:15.900
 open and nothing has come out and nothing 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.100
 less the greco 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.100
 doménikos theotokópoulos 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:26.120
 here it is 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:28.910
 the image of the face of Christ or as 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.410
 It could have been ours from Christ 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:37.040
 is some look of kindness that you have is 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:38.370
 wonderful beautiful and beautiful what pity 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.460
 pain 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:44.940
 and if it sounds like theology I do not care 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:47.330
 really it does not matter what a shame that 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.529
 the world 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:52.370
 in general 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:56.050
 in a very high percentage elena 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:59.080
 from the back no longer jesus de nazaret 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:01.700
 to his teachings 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:04.210
 I do not speak of the Catholic church of the 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.210
 protestants 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:15.349
 nothing we friends now we have 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.200
 here the palette 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:21.310
 we are going 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:25.360
 a subject that also interested me a lot 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.470
 the spectators because nothing more and nothing 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.710
 less 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:32.830
 we go with the editorial our world 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:34.810
 for all of you talking about your issues 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.630
 also very delicate we dare to what 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:39.400
 better we are a bit daring in this 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:42.850
 program at certain points by 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:45.600
 deal with issues of enormous depth and 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:45.600
 huge draft 

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:51.209
 moral I would say inner emotional 

00:06:48.899 --> 00:06:52.799
 emotional but of course I assure you 

00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:56.839
 that we do it with the best intention 

00:06:52.799 --> 00:06:56.839
 we go with our editorial
