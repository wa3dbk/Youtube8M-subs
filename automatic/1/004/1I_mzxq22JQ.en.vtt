and to have to work on on this asset in

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.680 
and to have to work on on this asset in
terms<00:02:07.159> of<00:02:07.280> wine<00:02:07.520> I<00:02:07.819> think<00:02:08.119> Switzerland<00:02:08.569> is<00:02:08.660> a

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
terms of wine I think Switzerland is a

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.460 
terms of wine I think Switzerland is a
quite<00:02:09.110> mature<00:02:09.289> market<00:02:09.950> which<00:02:10.190> means

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
quite mature market which means

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.650 
quite mature market which means
you<00:02:11.740> have<00:02:11.920> probably<00:02:12.250> one<00:02:12.700> of<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:13.000> biggest<00:02:13.240> our

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
you have probably one of the biggest our

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.800 
you have probably one of the biggest our
largest<00:02:14.620> offers<00:02:15.310> all<00:02:15.670> over<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.120> world<00:02:16.300> from

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
largest offers all over the world from

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.920 
largest offers all over the world from
mines<00:02:17.110> all<00:02:17.410> over<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.770> world<00:02:17.950> so<00:02:18.850> it's<00:02:19.210> very

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
mines all over the world so it's very

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.660 
mines all over the world so it's very
important<00:02:20.680> to<00:02:20.760> have<00:02:21.760> an<00:02:21.940> identity<00:02:22.420> to

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
important to have an identity to

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.520 
important to have an identity to
transport<00:02:24.670> an<00:02:24.850> identity<00:02:25.480> specialities<00:02:26.200> and

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
transport an identity specialities and

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
transport an identity specialities and
not<00:02:26.740> to<00:02:26.920> copy<00:02:27.270> another<00:02:28.270> country<00:02:29.220> because<00:02:30.220> you

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
not to copy another country because you

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.970 
not to copy another country because you
it's<00:02:31.240> it's<00:02:31.510> another<00:02:32.080> competitor<00:02:32.650> on<00:02:32.920> the

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
it's it's another competitor on the

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.890 
it's it's another competitor on the
market<00:02:33.760> so<00:02:34.450> that's<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.490> way<00:02:36.490> I<00:02:36.520> think<00:02:37.000> Spanish

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
market so that's the way I think Spanish

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.290 
market so that's the way I think Spanish
wine<00:02:38.110> can<00:02:38.440> very<00:02:38.710> well<00:02:38.800> developed<00:02:39.100> in<00:02:39.610> the

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
wine can very well developed in the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.650 
wine can very well developed in the
Swiss<00:02:40.480> market<00:02:40.980> for<00:02:41.980> a<00:02:42.010> good<00:02:42.250> basis<00:02:42.880> of<00:02:43.510> the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
Swiss market for a good basis of the

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.090 
Swiss market for a good basis of the
market<00:02:44.110> this<00:02:44.260> image<00:02:44.560> shouldn't<00:02:44.890> change
