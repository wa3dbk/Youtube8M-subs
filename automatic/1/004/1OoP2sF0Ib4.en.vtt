not pre-cut you don't want to measure

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.350 
not pre-cut you don't want to measure
the<00:01:19.170> length<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.729> so<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.850> can<00:01:21.060> cut<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.330> to

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
the length of that so you can cut it to

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.550 
the length of that so you can cut it to
the<00:01:21.479> right<00:01:21.600> length<00:01:21.750> when<00:01:21.990> it's<00:01:22.110> time<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.290> put

the right length when it's time to put

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.609 
the right length when it's time to put
everything<00:01:22.650> back<00:01:22.890> together<00:01:24.259> after<00:01:25.259> that's

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
everything back together after that's

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:26.030 
everything back together after that's
done

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
done

you<00:01:26.189> also<00:01:26.369> want<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.820> take<00:01:27.030> note<00:01:27.110> of<00:01:28.110> how<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
you also want to take note of how the

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.859 
you also want to take note of how the
leads<00:01:28.619> go<00:01:28.829> into<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.130> connector<00:01:29.659> this<00:01:30.659> one's

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
leads go into the connector this one's

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.390 
leads go into the connector this one's
simple<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.470> three<00:01:31.650> black<00:01:31.860> leads<00:01:32.100> but

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
simple it's just three black leads but

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.679 
simple it's just three black leads but
if<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.610> have<00:01:32.700> different<00:01:32.970> colors<00:01:33.270> you<00:01:33.390> can<00:01:33.540> get

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
if you have different colors you can get

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.200 
if you have different colors you can get
slightly<00:01:34.079> confusing<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.880> find<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.030> make<00:01:36.180> a

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
slightly confusing I find if you make a

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.170 
slightly confusing I find if you make a
small<00:01:36.390> diagram<00:01:37.280> it<00:01:38.280> makes<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> job<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:39.000> lot

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
small diagram it makes the job a lot

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.090 
small diagram it makes the job a lot
easier<00:01:39.240> also<00:01:40.049> can<00:01:40.350> one<00:01:40.530> do<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.740> same<00:01:40.920> thing

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
easier also can one do the same thing

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.069 
easier also can one do the same thing
for<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.310> grommet<00:01:41.670> now<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.689> you've<00:01:42.810> recorded

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
back to install the terminals you want

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.830 
back to install the terminals you want
to<00:03:54.590> make<00:03:54.740> sure<00:03:54.770> you<00:03:54.980> strip<00:03:55.250> enough<00:03:55.840> insulation

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
to make sure you strip enough insulation

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.350 
to make sure you strip enough insulation
back<00:03:57.020> so<00:03:57.320> that<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.740> bad<00:03:58.730> part<00:03:59.030> of<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.180> wire

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
back so that the bad part of the wire

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.640 
back so that the bad part of the wire
can<00:03:59.810> see<00:04:00.050> within<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:00.800> inside<00:04:01.459> of<00:04:01.730> the

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
can see within the inside of the

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.260 
can see within the inside of the
terminal<00:04:03.650> while<00:04:04.370> still<00:04:04.640> leaving<00:04:04.760> enough<00:04:05.090> for

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
terminal while still leaving enough for

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:06.940 
terminal while still leaving enough for
the<00:04:05.360> outer<00:04:05.630> tabs<00:04:06.050> to<00:04:06.440> lock<00:04:06.590> around<00:04:06.740> the

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
the outer tabs to lock around the

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.820 
the outer tabs to lock around the
insulation<00:04:07.840> if<00:04:08.840> you<00:04:09.170> strip<00:04:09.530> too<00:04:09.740> much<00:04:09.950> back

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
insulation if you strip too much back

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.190 
insulation if you strip too much back
there<00:04:12.830> is<00:04:12.950> no<00:04:13.100> room<00:04:13.340> for<00:04:13.370> the<00:04:13.810> larger<00:04:14.810> tabs<00:04:14.990> to

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
there is no room for the larger tabs to

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.960 
there is no room for the larger tabs to
grab<00:04:15.380> around<00:04:15.590> the<00:04:15.709> insulation<00:04:16.250> you<00:04:16.459> won't

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
grab around the insulation you won't

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.090 
grab around the insulation you won't
have<00:04:17.180> a<00:04:17.239> secure<00:04:18.049> fit<00:04:18.320> with<00:04:18.440> your<00:04:18.560> terminal

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
have a secure fit with your terminal

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.620 
have a secure fit with your terminal
if<00:04:19.400> you<00:04:20.150> don't<00:04:20.390> strip<00:04:20.630> enough<00:04:21.020> back<00:04:22.480> you<00:04:23.480> won't

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
if you don't strip enough back you won't

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.780 
if you don't strip enough back you won't
be<00:04:23.810> able<00:04:23.960> to<00:04:24.050> attach<00:04:24.919> the<00:04:25.100> bail<00:04:25.250> wire<00:04:25.460> to<00:04:25.700> the

all<00:04:28.760> right<00:04:28.940> I<00:04:29.000> got<00:04:29.120> a<00:04:29.150> couple<00:04:29.419> examples<00:04:29.570> right

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
all right I got a couple examples right

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.980 
all right I got a couple examples right
here<00:04:29.990> of<00:04:30.410> a<00:04:30.800> good<00:04:31.310> crimp<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:31.669> a<00:04:31.730> bad<00:04:31.880> crimp<00:04:32.150> on

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
here of a good crimp and a bad crimp on

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.720 
here of a good crimp and a bad crimp on
this<00:04:33.410> terminal<00:04:33.800> you<00:04:33.950> can<00:04:34.010> see<00:04:34.220> that<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.460> long

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:34.730 
this terminal you can see that the long

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:37.630 
this terminal you can see that the long
tabs<00:04:35.030> of<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.570> terminal<00:04:35.960> are<00:04:36.370> crimped<00:04:37.370> around

tabs of the terminal are crimped around

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.880 
tabs of the terminal are crimped around
the<00:04:37.820> insulator<00:04:38.330> of<00:04:38.480> the<00:04:38.600> wire<00:04:38.750> the<00:04:39.260> short<00:04:39.650> tabs

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
the insulator of the wire the short tabs

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.640 
the insulator of the wire the short tabs
are<00:04:40.250> crimped<00:04:40.550> around<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:40.940> wire<00:04:41.120> itself

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
are crimped around the wire itself

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.830 
are crimped around the wire itself
that's<00:04:42.650> how<00:04:42.950> you<00:04:43.010> want<00:04:43.250> to<00:04:43.280> do<00:04:43.370> it<00:04:43.690> this<00:04:44.690> one

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
that's how you want to do it this one

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.230 
that's how you want to do it this one
right<00:04:44.990> here<00:04:45.290> too<00:04:46.130> much<00:04:46.370> of<00:04:46.550> the<00:04:46.669> insulation

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
right here too much of the insulation

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.050 
right here too much of the insulation
was<00:04:47.360> stripped<00:04:47.630> back<00:04:47.810> and<00:04:48.140> now<00:04:48.350> the<00:04:48.410> long<00:04:48.740> tabs

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
was stripped back and now the long tabs

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.340 
was stripped back and now the long tabs
of<00:04:50.060> the<00:04:50.210> terminal<00:04:50.660> are<00:04:50.810> crimped<00:04:51.080> around<00:04:51.290> the

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.230 
of the terminal are crimped around the
copper<00:04:51.710> so<00:04:52.370> I<00:04:52.430> was<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:52.610> short<00:04:52.850> tabs<00:04:53.060> there's

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
copper so I was the short tabs there's

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.670 
copper so I was the short tabs there's
nothing<00:04:53.540> holding<00:04:53.780> on<00:04:53.930> to<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.200> insulator

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
nothing holding on to the insulator

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.580 
nothing holding on to the insulator
that's<00:04:55.610> what<00:04:55.760> you<00:04:55.850> want<00:04:56.030> to<00:04:56.090> avoid<00:04:56.380> now<00:04:57.380> that

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
that's what you want to avoid now that

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.409 
that's what you want to avoid now that
you've<00:04:57.680> got<00:04:57.919> your<00:04:58.220> leads<00:04:58.520> through<00:04:59.270> the

00:04:59.409 --> 00:04:59.419 
you've got your leads through the

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:02.350 
you've got your leads through the
grommet<00:04:59.810> and<00:05:00.880> you've<00:05:01.880> got<00:05:02.030> the<00:05:02.120> sheathing

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 
grommet and you've got the sheathing

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.659 
grommet and you've got the sheathing
installed<00:05:02.870> you've<00:05:03.710> measured<00:05:03.979> and<00:05:04.340> cut<00:05:04.490> your

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
installed you've measured and cut your

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.590 
installed you've measured and cut your
wires<00:05:04.850> to<00:05:05.210> the<00:05:05.300> proper<00:05:05.630> length<00:05:05.840> it

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
wires to the proper length it

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.330 
wires to the proper length it
time<00:05:06.750> to<00:05:06.930> strip<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.410> insulation<00:05:07.440> back<00:05:08.040> so<00:05:08.250> we

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
time to strip the insulation back so we

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.270 
time to strip the insulation back so we
can<00:05:08.490> install<00:05:08.640> the<00:05:08.850> terminals<00:05:09.680> so<00:05:10.680> this<00:05:11.160> is

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 
can install the terminals so this is

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.650 
can install the terminals so this is
where<00:05:11.430> a<00:05:11.460> good<00:05:11.610> set<00:05:11.790> of<00:05:11.820> wire<00:05:12.000> strippers<00:05:12.420> comes

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
where a good set of wire strippers comes

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.930 
where a good set of wire strippers comes
in<00:05:12.840> makes<00:05:13.290> the<00:05:13.380> job<00:05:13.530> a<00:05:13.590> lot<00:05:13.800> easier<00:05:13.910> I'm<00:05:14.910> going

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
in makes the job a lot easier I'm going

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.310 
in makes the job a lot easier I'm going
to<00:05:15.120> go<00:05:15.210> ahead<00:05:15.270> and<00:05:15.540> strip<00:05:15.750> all<00:05:15.960> your<00:05:16.140> leads

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
to go ahead and strip all your leads

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.120 
to go ahead and strip all your leads
back<00:05:18.350> make<00:05:19.350> sure<00:05:19.530> they're<00:05:19.710> at<00:05:19.830> the<00:05:19.920> proper

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
back make sure they're at the proper

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:26.150 
back make sure they're at the proper
length<00:05:24.380> and<00:05:25.380> then<00:05:25.530> we<00:05:25.620> can<00:05:25.770> go<00:05:25.860> ahead<00:05:25.950> and

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
length and then we can go ahead and

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.120 
length and then we can go ahead and
install<00:05:26.400> the<00:05:26.520> terminals<00:05:27.410> now<00:05:28.410> I<00:05:28.620> found<00:05:28.950> the

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
install the terminals now I found the

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.620 
install the terminals now I found the
easiest<00:05:29.160> way<00:05:29.580> to<00:05:29.610> do<00:05:29.790> this<00:05:29.820> is<00:05:30.180> to<00:05:30.300> take<00:05:30.450> your

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
easiest way to do this is to take your

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:36.350 
easiest way to do this is to take your
crimp<00:05:30.780> as'<00:05:31.940> install<00:05:32.940> your<00:05:33.120> terminal<00:05:35.240> clamp<00:05:36.240> it

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 
crimp as' install your terminal clamp it

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.180 
crimp as' install your terminal clamp it
down<00:05:36.390> just<00:05:36.840> enough<00:05:37.170> to<00:05:37.350> hold<00:05:37.590> it<00:05:37.740> there<00:05:37.890> but

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
down just enough to hold it there but

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.030 
down just enough to hold it there but
don't<00:05:38.370> crush<00:05:38.610> the<00:05:38.790> tabs<00:05:39.030> in<00:05:39.300> yet<00:05:39.510> that<00:05:40.040> leaves

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
don't crush the tabs in yet that leaves

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.890 
don't crush the tabs in yet that leaves
you<00:05:41.130> free<00:05:41.160> to<00:05:41.310> take<00:05:41.550> your<00:05:41.730> wire<00:05:41.880> insert<00:05:42.750> it

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
you free to take your wire insert it

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:49.340 
you free to take your wire insert it
into<00:05:43.020> the<00:05:43.170> terminal<00:05:46.640> and<00:05:47.640> crimp<00:05:47.880> down<00:05:48.090> on<00:05:48.350> you

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
into the terminal and crimp down on you

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.630 
into the terminal and crimp down on you
can<00:05:49.470> go<00:05:49.590> ahead<00:05:49.710> and<00:05:49.950> repeat<00:05:50.160> this<00:05:50.340> for<00:05:50.610> all

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640
