00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.700 
thinking you know that ain't broken
don't<00:00:37.059> fix<00:00:37.270> it<00:00:37.600> so<00:00:37.809> I'm<00:00:37.930> sticking<00:00:38.200> to<00:00:38.410> the<00:00:38.530> same

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
don't fix it so I'm sticking to the same

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.250 
don't fix it so I'm sticking to the same
series<00:00:39.190> and<00:00:39.400> although<00:00:40.360> I<00:00:40.660> haven't<00:00:41.050> tested

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
series and although I haven't tested

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.350 
series and although I haven't tested
these<00:00:41.590> ones<00:00:41.920> out<00:00:42.130> yet<00:00:42.370> I've<00:00:42.610> heard<00:00:42.970> a<00:00:43.059> lot<00:00:43.300> of

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
these ones out yet I've heard a lot of

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.380 
these ones out yet I've heard a lot of
the<00:00:43.540> things<00:00:44.220> around<00:00:45.220> him<00:00:45.460> online<00:00:45.820> for<00:00:46.090> a<00:00:46.120> neat

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
the things around him online for a neat

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.510 
the things around him online for a neat
90<00:00:46.750> bucks<00:00:46.930> I<00:00:47.230> really<00:00:47.710> like<00:00:47.890> the<00:00:47.980> color<00:00:48.220> it<00:00:48.430> was

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
90 bucks I really like the color it was

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.640 
90 bucks I really like the color it was
between<00:00:48.670> the<00:00:49.210> vault<00:00:49.420> black<00:00:49.690> or<00:00:50.050> current<00:00:50.470> blue

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:50.650 
between the vault black or current blue

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:52.890 
between the vault black or current blue
and<00:00:50.920> it<00:00:51.129> turns<00:00:51.370> out<00:00:51.520> that<00:00:51.580> was<00:00:51.820> out<00:00:51.910> of<00:00:51.940> blue<00:00:52.210> so

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:52.900 
and it turns out that was out of blue so

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.320 
and it turns out that was out of blue so
that<00:00:53.170> made<00:00:53.350> my<00:00:53.470> decision<00:00:53.920> a<00:00:53.980> lot<00:00:54.129> easier

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330 
that made my decision a lot easier

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.490 
that made my decision a lot easier
they're<00:00:55.330> more<00:00:55.480> lightweight<00:00:55.900> compared<00:00:56.320> to<00:00:56.410> the

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
they're more lightweight compared to the

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.439 
they're more lightweight compared to the
first<00:00:56.739> Lindegaard<00:00:57.070> days<00:00:57.430> I<00:00:57.670> weighed<00:00:58.269> them

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449 
first Lindegaard days I weighed them

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:00.119 
first Lindegaard days I weighed them
just<00:00:58.659> in<00:00:58.750> case<00:00:58.809> you<00:00:59.140> guys<00:00:59.290> weren't<00:00:59.620> interested

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
just in case you guys weren't interested

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.100 
just in case you guys weren't interested
and<00:01:00.729> there<00:01:00.970> is<00:01:01.120> an<00:01:01.239> effective<00:01:01.659> difference

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
and there is an effective difference

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.619 
and there is an effective difference
which<00:01:02.559> seems<00:01:02.920> to<00:01:03.100> be<00:01:03.190> credit<00:01:03.550> to<00:01:03.640> this<00:01:03.729> year<00:01:04.089> my

around<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:07.090> back<00:01:07.299> half<00:01:07.600> of<00:01:07.750> the<00:01:07.870> shoe<00:01:08.100> also

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
around the back half of the shoe also

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.710 
around the back half of the shoe also
got<00:01:09.250> a<00:01:09.280> nice<00:01:09.490> petite<00:01:09.820> customization<00:01:10.570> there

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
got a nice petite customization there

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.300 
got a nice petite customization there
was<00:01:10.840> one<00:01:10.960> name<00:01:11.110> as<00:01:11.620> for<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:11.890> front<00:01:12.130> half

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310

they've<00:01:12.580> changed<00:01:12.850> the<00:01:13.060> game<00:01:13.240> up<00:01:13.390> a<00:01:13.479> bit<00:01:13.630> from

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
they've changed the game up a bit from

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.530 
they've changed the game up a bit from
the<00:01:13.960> previous<00:01:14.350> model<00:01:14.710> by<00:01:15.190> using<00:01:15.220> an<00:01:15.729> alpha

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
the previous model by using an alpha

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.390 
the previous model by using an alpha
going<00:01:16.840> right<00:01:17.260> round<00:01:17.500> to<00:01:17.770> cover<00:01:18.010> the<00:01:18.220> whole

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
going right round to cover the whole

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.580 
going right round to cover the whole
internet<00:01:18.820> which<00:01:19.270> I<00:01:19.390> really<00:01:19.750> like<00:01:19.930> they've

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
internet which I really like they've

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.530 
internet which I really like they've
also<00:01:20.770> covered<00:01:21.220> a<00:01:21.310> toe<00:01:21.520> with<00:01:21.729> this<00:01:22.030> sandpaper

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
also covered a toe with this sandpaper

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.990 
also covered a toe with this sandpaper
texture<00:01:22.960> which<00:01:23.290> they<00:01:23.530> did<00:01:23.740> use<00:01:24.010> on<00:01:24.400> previous

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
texture which they did use on previous

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.149 
texture which they did use on previous
learning<00:01:25.180> Gatos<00:01:25.720> but<00:01:26.080> this<00:01:26.740> time<00:01:27.010> around

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159 
learning Gatos but this time around

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.830 
learning Gatos but this time around
they'd<00:01:27.460> be<00:01:27.640> more<00:01:27.820> generous<00:01:28.240> with<00:01:28.360> it<00:01:28.570> so<00:01:28.780> it

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
they'd be more generous with it so it

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.599 
they'd be more generous with it so it
should<00:01:29.110> be<00:01:29.140> a<00:01:29.290> lot<00:01:29.560> more<00:01:29.740> effective<00:01:30.219> in<00:01:30.430> terms

00:01:30.599 --> 00:01:30.609 
should be a lot more effective in terms

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:32.700 
should be a lot more effective in terms
of<00:01:30.880> control<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:31.659> just<00:01:31.719> performing<00:01:32.320> tricks<00:01:32.500> in

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
of control and just performing tricks in

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.410 
of control and just performing tricks in
general<00:01:33.039> so<00:01:33.549> I'm<00:01:33.640> really<00:01:33.850> looking<00:01:34.030> forward<00:01:34.329> to

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
general so I'm really looking forward to

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.450 
general so I'm really looking forward to
testing<00:01:34.719> that<00:01:34.840> out<00:01:35.020> another<00:01:35.799> change<00:01:36.130> I<00:01:36.250> like

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
testing that out another change I like

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.219 
testing that out another change I like
is<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.789> sole<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.420> original<00:01:37.750> lunar<00:01:37.930> guard

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
is the sole the original lunar guard

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.380 
is the sole the original lunar guard
toes<00:01:38.439> had<00:01:38.829> a<00:01:38.859> full<00:01:39.189> gum<00:01:39.430> rubber<00:01:39.579> sole<00:01:39.939> which

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
toes had a full gum rubber sole which

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.910 
toes had a full gum rubber sole which
was<00:01:40.570> actually<00:01:40.780> one<00:01:41.020> of<00:01:41.049> the<00:01:41.170> best<00:01:41.350> groups<00:01:41.679> I've

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
was actually one of the best groups I've

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.800 
was actually one of the best groups I've
experienced<00:01:42.579> on<00:01:42.700> any<00:01:43.000> indoor<00:01:43.359> sphere<00:01:43.600> with

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
experienced on any indoor sphere with
