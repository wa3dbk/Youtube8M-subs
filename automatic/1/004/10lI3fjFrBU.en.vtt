all right sorry video number two all
right<00:00:12.910> what<00:00:13.030> happens<00:00:13.299> is<00:00:13.450> the<00:00:13.570> check<00:00:13.750> engine

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:13.930 
right what happens is the check engine

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.010 
right what happens is the check engine
lights<00:00:14.200> going<00:00:14.290> to<00:00:14.440> blink<00:00:14.680> twice<00:00:15.930> telling<00:00:16.930> you

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:17.020 
lights going to blink twice telling you

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.940 
lights going to blink twice telling you
that<00:00:17.140> it's<00:00:17.290> going<00:00:17.439> to<00:00:17.500> be<00:00:17.590> starting<00:00:17.890> the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
that it's going to be starting the

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.130 
that it's going to be starting the
diagnostic<00:00:18.580> mode<00:00:18.730> you're<00:00:19.480> going<00:00:19.689> to<00:00:19.750> idle<00:00:20.020> up

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
diagnostic mode you're going to idle up

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.480 
diagnostic mode you're going to idle up
unless<00:00:20.770> you<00:00:20.890> can<00:00:21.009> hear<00:00:21.220> it

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
unless you can hear it

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.249 
unless you can hear it
other<00:00:21.790> than<00:00:21.970> my<00:00:22.090> blended<00:00:22.450> or<00:00:22.630> which<00:00:22.869> I'm<00:00:23.140> not

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
other than my blended or which I'm not

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.120 
other than my blended or which I'm not
looking<00:00:23.410> forward<00:00:23.800> to<00:00:23.890> taking<00:00:24.130> apart<00:00:25.829> so<00:00:26.829> here

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
looking forward to taking apart so here

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.839 
looking forward to taking apart so here
we<00:00:27.189> go<00:00:27.310> the<00:00:27.489> cars<00:00:27.700> idling<00:00:28.829> idle<00:00:29.829> my<00:00:30.430> high<00:00:30.610> and

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
we go the cars idling idle my high and

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.360 
we go the cars idling idle my high and
take<00:00:31.149> a<00:00:31.180> few<00:00:31.419> minutes

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.239 

so<00:00:37.210> let's<00:00:37.480> just<00:00:37.629> wait<00:00:37.839> for<00:00:37.899> that<00:00:38.230> and<00:00:39.129> I'm

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:39.249 
so let's just wait for that and I'm

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:40.860 
so let's just wait for that and I'm
going<00:00:39.399> to<00:00:39.429> put<00:00:39.609> the<00:00:39.730> camera<00:00:40.120> right<00:00:40.149> here<00:00:40.629> so

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
going to put the camera right here so

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.579 
going to put the camera right here so
you<00:00:40.929> can<00:00:41.050> see<00:00:41.409> what<00:00:41.589> I'm<00:00:41.739> going<00:00:41.949> to<00:00:42.010> see<00:00:43.589> it's

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:44.589 
you can see what I'm going to see it's

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:46.919 
you can see what I'm going to see it's
going<00:00:44.710> to<00:00:44.859> tell<00:00:45.370> me<00:00:45.519> to<00:00:45.699> throttle<00:00:46.479> up<00:00:46.629> on<00:00:46.839> the

00:00:46.919 --> 00:00:46.929 
going to tell me to throttle up on the

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:49.680 
going to tell me to throttle up on the
engine<00:00:47.109> that's<00:00:47.469> going<00:00:47.649> to<00:00:47.710> blink<00:00:47.949> once<00:00:48.690> and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
engine that's going to blink once and

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.469 
engine that's going to blink once and
then<00:00:50.500> I'm<00:00:50.559> going<00:00:50.679> to<00:00:50.710> go<00:00:50.829> ahead<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.129> do<00:00:51.219> that

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:51.479 
then I'm going to go ahead and do that

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:54.529 
then I'm going to go ahead and do that
you're<00:00:52.479> supposed<00:00:52.689> to<00:00:52.750> turn<00:00:52.930> the<00:00:52.989> wheel<00:00:53.229> but<00:00:53.409> um

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
you're supposed to turn the wheel but um

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.569 
you're supposed to turn the wheel but um
I'm<00:00:55.539> just<00:00:55.839> not<00:00:55.960> going<00:00:56.079> to<00:00:56.140> do<00:00:56.229> that<00:00:56.430> I'm<00:00:57.430> going

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
I'm just not going to do that I'm going

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.529 
I'm just not going to do that I'm going
to<00:00:57.609> get<00:00:57.729> a<00:00:57.760> code<00:00:57.969> for<00:00:58.210> that<00:01:00.119> anyways<00:01:01.119> just

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
to get a code for that anyways just

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.929 
to get a code for that anyways just
waiting<00:01:02.129> okay<00:01:03.129> it's<00:01:03.280> going<00:01:03.369> to<00:01:03.460> throttle<00:01:03.640> down

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:03.939 
waiting okay it's going to throttle down

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:07.080 
waiting okay it's going to throttle down
a<00:01:04.000> little<00:01:04.269> bit<00:01:04.979> once<00:01:05.979> the<00:01:06.159> cycle<00:01:06.369> now<00:01:06.880> it's

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
a little bit once the cycle now it's

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.760 
a little bit once the cycle now it's
coming<00:01:07.360> down<00:01:07.539> the<00:01:08.049> blinking<00:01:08.440> is<00:01:08.560> going<00:01:08.710> to

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
coming down the blinking is going to

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.630 
coming down the blinking is going to
going<00:01:09.190> to<00:01:09.250> blink<00:01:09.520> here<00:01:09.640> in<00:01:09.729> a<00:01:09.789> minute<00:01:11.340> I'm<00:01:12.340> go

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
going to blink here in a minute I'm go

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:21.440 
going to blink here in a minute I'm go
ahead<00:01:12.789> and<00:01:12.880> roll<00:01:13.060> the<00:01:13.210> engine<00:01:15.509> that's<00:01:16.509> yet

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:35.570 

they're<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.600> codes

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:42.860 

here<00:01:36.270> we<00:01:36.360> go<00:01:36.480> more<00:01:37.290> codes

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:51.969 

I'm<00:01:43.870> just<00:01:44.110> letting<00:01:44.290> them<00:01:44.500> roll

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.920 

now<00:01:52.520> one<00:01:52.789> of<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:52.939> codes<00:01:53.180> was<00:01:53.450> I<00:01:53.689> guess<00:01:53.899> the

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
now one of the codes was I guess the

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.880 
now one of the codes was I guess the
Center<00:01:54.530> for<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:55.310> coolant<00:01:55.899> 116<00:01:56.899> you're

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
Center for the coolant 116 you're

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.039 
Center for the coolant 116 you're
getting<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.159> 116<00:01:58.850> code<00:01:59.119> which<00:01:59.360> I<00:01:59.600> was<00:01:59.750> reading

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
getting a 116 code which I was reading

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.840 
getting a 116 code which I was reading
up<00:02:00.170> on<00:02:00.320> it<00:02:01.360> at<00:02:02.360> least<00:02:02.420> wooded<00:02:02.869> was<00:02:03.200> fingers<00:02:04.189> 116

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
up on it at least wooded was fingers 116

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.589 
up on it at least wooded was fingers 116
code<00:02:05.119> I<00:02:06.670> believe<00:02:07.670> it's<00:02:07.820> one<00:02:08.000> second<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:09.560> then

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
code I believe it's one second and then

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.080 
code I believe it's one second and then
replaced<00:02:11.599> that<00:02:11.750> sensor<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.500> then<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:13.730> appears

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
replaced that sensor and then it appears

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.850 
replaced that sensor and then it appears
that<00:02:14.269> my<00:02:14.510> EGR<00:02:14.900> valve<00:02:15.170> is<00:02:15.319> one<00:02:15.530> of<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.680> codes

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
that my EGR valve is one of the codes

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.940 
that my EGR valve is one of the codes
another<00:02:16.160> one<00:02:16.370> I<00:02:16.690> replaced<00:02:17.690> it<00:02:17.930> but<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:18.560> didn't

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
another one I replaced it but I didn't

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.740 
another one I replaced it but I didn't
we<00:02:19.489> replaced<00:02:19.849> it<00:02:20.030> but<00:02:20.209> we<00:02:20.299> didn't<00:02:20.510> take<00:02:20.599> off

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750 
we replaced it but we didn't take off

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.130 
we replaced it but we didn't take off
the<00:02:20.900> two<00:02:21.049> that<00:02:21.560> it<00:02:21.680> goes<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:22.099> it<00:02:22.250> so<00:02:23.150> I<00:02:23.599> guess

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
the two that it goes to it so I guess

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.110 
the two that it goes to it so I guess
we'll<00:02:24.410> see<00:02:25.250> what's<00:02:25.459> going<00:02:25.640> on<00:02:25.700> with<00:02:25.849> that<00:02:26.000> I

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
we'll see what's going on with that I

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:45.240 
we'll see what's going on with that I
think<00:02:29.120> it's<00:02:29.269> done<00:02:30.049> not<00:02:30.319> going<00:02:30.500> to<00:02:30.560> cycle<00:02:30.920> again

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.910 

that<00:02:46.250> should<00:02:46.490> be<00:02:46.580> it<00:02:47.290> this<00:02:48.290> time<00:02:48.500> I'm<00:02:48.590> doing<00:02:48.620> it

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
that should be it this time I'm doing it

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.210 
that should be it this time I'm doing it
during<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.220> day<00:02:49.400> as<00:02:50.270> requested<00:02:51.040> alright<00:02:52.040> guys

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
during the day as requested alright guys

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.430 
during the day as requested alright guys
well<00:02:52.580> I'm<00:02:52.820> going<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.570> put<00:02:53.720> those<00:02:53.870> two<00:02:54.080> videos

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
well I'm going to put those two videos

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.190 
well I'm going to put those two videos
up<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:54.950> you<00:02:55.040> can<00:02:55.190> hopefully<00:02:55.370> see<00:02:56.200> what's

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
up and you can hopefully see what's

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.680 
up and you can hopefully see what's
going<00:02:57.500> on<00:02:57.620> you<00:02:58.190> can<00:02:58.370> definitely<00:02:59.060> see<00:02:59.510> what's

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
going on you can definitely see what's

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.770
