boxes or approximately 450 PV that's
where<00:02:44.930> we<00:02:45.049> got<00:02:45.200> the<00:02:45.349> 450<00:02:46.220> PV<00:02:46.549> every<00:02:46.970> month<00:02:47.209> we

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
where we got the 450 PV every month we

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.960 
where we got the 450 PV every month we
look<00:02:48.140> into<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:48.680> system<00:02:49.069> and<00:02:49.220> we<00:02:49.280> scan<00:02:49.790> the

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
look into the system and we scan the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.580 
look into the system and we scan the
system<00:02:50.329> and<00:02:50.480> anyone<00:02:50.750> anywhere<00:02:51.170> in<00:02:51.319> the<00:02:51.409> world

that<00:02:51.829> is<00:02:51.980> ordering<00:02:52.280> a<00:02:52.430> minimum<00:02:52.879> of<00:02:53.000> 450<00:02:53.750> PV<00:02:54.019> we

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:54.439 
that is ordering a minimum of 450 PV we

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:57.039 
that is ordering a minimum of 450 PV we
know<00:02:54.620> it's<00:02:54.799> possible<00:02:55.340> that<00:02:55.459> they<00:02:55.670> may<00:02:55.970> have<00:02:56.209> 10

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
know it's possible that they may have 10

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.890 
know it's possible that they may have 10
customers<00:02:57.349> so<00:02:57.829> they<00:02:57.980> become<00:02:58.340> a<00:02:58.579> star<00:02:59.510> achiever

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900

answer than someone who has a big family
ok<00:03:37.879> for<00:03:38.090> example<00:03:38.120> if<00:03:38.540> you<00:03:38.780> consume<00:03:39.379> 3<00:03:39.980> cups<00:03:40.340> of

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
ok for example if you consume 3 cups of

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.729 
ok for example if you consume 3 cups of
coffee<00:03:40.819> per<00:03:41.239> day<00:03:41.419> then<00:03:42.290> you're<00:03:42.650> gonna

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
coffee per day then you're gonna

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.689 
coffee per day then you're gonna
multiply<00:03:43.010> 3<00:03:43.730> times<00:03:44.290> 30<00:03:45.290> 30<00:03:46.220> days<00:03:46.489> in<00:03:46.609> a<00:03:46.669> month

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:46.699 
multiply 3 times 30 30 days in a month

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:50.800 
multiply 3 times 30 30 days in a month
equals<00:03:47.540> 90<00:03:48.500> cups<00:03:49.340> of<00:03:49.489> coffee<00:03:49.699> in<00:03:50.000> a<00:03:50.180> month<00:03:50.419> ok

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
equals 90 cups of coffee in a month ok

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.199 
equals 90 cups of coffee in a month ok
now<00:03:51.410> if<00:03:51.620> you<00:03:51.769> have<00:03:51.859> a<00:03:51.889> wife<00:03:52.160> or<00:03:52.519> children<00:03:52.849> that

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
now if you have a wife or children that

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.789 
now if you have a wife or children that
drink<00:03:53.419> hot<00:03:53.569> chocolate<00:03:53.599> or<00:03:54.199> people<00:03:54.530> living

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:54.799 
drink hot chocolate or people living

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:56.229 
drink hot chocolate or people living
there<00:03:54.949> you're<00:03:55.129> that<00:03:55.489> number<00:03:55.790> is<00:03:55.849> gonna<00:03:55.970> adjust

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
there you're that number is gonna adjust

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.990 
there you're that number is gonna adjust
but<00:03:56.449> calculate<00:03:56.959> how<00:03:57.769> much<00:03:57.949> coffee<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:58.669> tea
