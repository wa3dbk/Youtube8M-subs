00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.960
 the miraculous hour can not be 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.420
 even awake with me one hour 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.990
 said our Lord to the disciples in 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.990
 the Gethsemane garden 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.600
 brother have some difficulty for 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.100
 commit to prayer 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.380
 sometimes I have a life of 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:24.020
 rich and complete prayer for long 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.930
 periods of time but after falling 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.490
 and for months I struggle to recover that 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:33.550
 intimacy and depth with the lord 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.470
 this method of the miraculous hour arose 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.050
 at the end of a period of long dryness 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.780
 where I was ashamed of myself 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.820
 little prayer and cry out to the Lord that 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.559
 come to my help 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.620
 I woke up one morning and I shouted 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:50.050
 Mr. sir, I have to have an hour 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.269
 of quality with you but I can only 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.980
 do with your grace please please 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.500
 Help me 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.500
 he not only gave me a rich and full hour 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.960
 of grace but also taught me a 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.360
 simple way for a daily hour of 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.790
 prayer I approach a more intimacy 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.980
 deep with him and I prepare for 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:12.860
 walk my Christian path 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.140
 remember the old saying that says step to 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.390
 step is a big step 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.450
 I have divided an hour into twelve 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.220
 segments of five minutes each as 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.540
 I show on the page clock 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.860
 following 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.720
 listen to my prayer or king and my god to 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.330
 I beg you, my lord, tomorrow and 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.380
 listen to my voice told you early my 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.829
 prayer and then I hope in you 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.170
 between each segment of 5 minutes it 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.320
 can you pray an Our Father or any 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.060
 Another short sentence of your preference 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.280
 for Catholics and other Christians 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.579
 who have a relationship with the mother of 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.189
 God, I invite you to include a Hail Mary 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.780
 as a transition between sections for 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.210
 those who can pray in the gift 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.829
 charismatic of tongues I exhort you that 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.979
 this form of prayer in different 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:07.460
 Moments also be done in this hour 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.590
 miraculous it is wonderful to start the day 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.080
 with the Lord praying in the hours 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.569
 early in the morning before you start 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.330
 the daily work but since it's in 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.370
 the morning or at noon or at night is 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.470
 very beneficial to choose a time and a 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.750
 room for prayer 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.680
 and really the prayer must go through the 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.780
 transition of going from that formal time 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.970
 towards spontaneous encounters with god a 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.400
 Throughout the day 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.530
 It's wonderful when we can get to 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.840
 a freedom where the Lord is so 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.600
 real that we have conversations with him 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.750
 in our time of prayer in the 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.910
 context of all our activities 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.370
 the prayers and reflections of this 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.860

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.560

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.959

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.790
 a friend who reviewed the initial draft 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.310
 of this book commented this is going to lead to 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.739
 many people through a process of 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.840
 breaking barriers and getting rid of 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.970
 of many things in many areas of his 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.070
 life of their lives 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.650
 when she sees another friend Nancy she 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.700
 he said we had been praying for him 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.190
 someone did this 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.989
 at the end of each segment are included 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.800
 also some fragments of the 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.160
 writing 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:51.100

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:54.460

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.420

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.550
 Faith 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.070

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.680

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.259
 Sir 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.659
 there is a desperate need for 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:47.810
 people of prayer in this world of 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:49.789
 atheism and anti-Christian practices I 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.509
 I believe that God is calling his people 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:54.949
 to pray more intensely today than ever 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:56.300
 if only we could understand the 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:58.520
 immensity of God's plan for 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.710
 our lives and the importance of 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.409
 our prayers we would pay in 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.949
 dry and re-evaluate and we all our 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:09.470
 priorities immediately life is 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:12.650
 very short and very precious to arrest her 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.780
 wasting empty things joy 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.470
 when writing this I am thinking of me 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.260
 dear brother-in-law harvey smith 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.570
 to whom I dedicate this method that died in 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.150
 an accident in the Caribbean he maybe 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.480
 had only one or two minutes to 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.950
 to be able to put his life in order with God 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.650
 none of us knows how many days 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.220
 weeks or months we are left in this life 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.710
 precious 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:38.680
 At some point in my life I faced 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.110
 with cancer 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.530
 and I seriously had the possibility of 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:47.289
 to die this turned my life completely 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:49.810
 and I made a decision not to waste 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:53.320
 nor ever even a moment in things 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:56.140
