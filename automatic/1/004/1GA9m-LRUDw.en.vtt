on my outing and want to get a final
definitive<00:00:36.559> time<00:00:37.220> on<00:00:38.440> how<00:00:39.440> long<00:00:39.620> it<00:00:39.739> takes<00:00:39.920> to

impressed<00:00:42.620> with<00:00:42.980> it<00:00:43.100> I<00:00:43.190> didn't<00:00:43.430> think<00:00:43.550> that<00:00:43.790> it

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
impressed with it I didn't think that it

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.720 
impressed with it I didn't think that it
would<00:00:44.000> do<00:00:44.180> as<00:00:44.300> well<00:00:44.480> as<00:00:44.660> it<00:00:44.780> did<00:00:44.960> and<00:00:45.280> it<00:00:46.280> makes

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
would do as well as it did and it makes

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.729 
would do as well as it did and it makes
it<00:00:46.880> a<00:00:47.000> viable<00:00:47.210> option<00:00:47.480> for<00:00:47.809> certain<00:00:48.440> outings

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
it a viable option for certain outings

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.770 
it a viable option for certain outings
for<00:00:48.800> me<00:00:49.930> it's<00:00:50.930> a<00:00:51.530> no<00:00:51.820> star<00:00:52.820> no<00:00:52.850> takes<00:00:53.090> a<00:00:53.149> little

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
for me it's a no star no takes a little

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.959 
for me it's a no star no takes a little
longer<00:00:53.930> to<00:00:54.110> cook<00:00:54.290> in<00:00:54.440> some<00:00:54.649> other<00:00:54.829> fuels<00:00:55.190> but

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
longer to cook in some other fuels but

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.190 
longer to cook in some other fuels but
it's<00:00:56.360> certainly<00:00:56.539> a<00:00:56.719> viable<00:00:56.899> option

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:57.200 
it's certainly a viable option

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.100 
it's certainly a viable option
especially<00:00:57.789> if<00:00:58.789> you're<00:00:59.120> just<00:00:59.329> re<00:00:59.629> eating<00:00:59.809> food

saying<00:02:56.370> they're<00:02:56.850> probably<00:02:57.150> pre<00:02:58.910> wanted<00:02:59.910> one

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
saying they're probably pre wanted one

saying they're probably pre wanted one
of<00:03:00.239> his<00:03:00.510> uh<00:03:01.370> prototypes<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:03.769> yeah<00:03:04.769> looks<00:03:05.010> like

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
of his uh prototypes and yeah looks like

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.590 
of his uh prototypes and yeah looks like
they<00:03:05.280> can<00:03:05.430> they<00:03:05.700> can<00:03:05.730> be<00:03:05.970> just<00:03:06.239> a<00:03:06.330> little<00:03:06.360> more

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
they can they can be just a little more

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.750 
they can they can be just a little more
self<00:03:06.989> probably<00:03:07.350> just<00:03:07.500> do<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:10.489> like<00:03:11.489> I<00:03:11.580> said

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
self probably just do that like I said

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.790 
self probably just do that like I said
the<00:03:11.880> stove<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.300> is<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.600> stainless<00:03:13.410> steel<00:03:13.440> it's

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
the stove is is a stainless steel it's

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.320 
the stove is is a stainless steel it's
very<00:03:14.040> high<00:03:14.220> quality<00:03:14.489> it's<00:03:14.850> well<00:03:15.000> designed

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
very high quality it's well designed

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.570 
very high quality it's well designed
it's<00:03:15.900> making<00:03:16.049> very<00:03:16.769> efficient<00:03:17.190> use<00:03:17.340> of<00:03:17.370> the

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
it's making very efficient use of the

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.930 
it's making very efficient use of the
sterno<00:03:17.850> but<00:03:18.239> sterno<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:19.260> what<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:19.980> if

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
sterno but sterno is what it is if

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.390 
sterno but sterno is what it is if
you're<00:03:21.090> going<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.239> be<00:03:21.360> pushing<00:03:21.690> the<00:03:21.780> limits<00:03:22.140> in

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
you're going to be pushing the limits in

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.270 
you're going to be pushing the limits in
colder<00:03:23.400> weather<00:03:23.840> I<00:03:24.840> mean<00:03:25.320> this<00:03:25.470> is<00:03:25.530> just<00:03:25.860> my

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
colder weather I mean this is just my

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.850 
colder weather I mean this is just my
opinion<00:03:26.660> that<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:27.930> looks<00:03:28.170> like<00:03:28.290> it's<00:03:28.440> really

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
opinion that it looks like it's really

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.530 
opinion that it looks like it's really
pushing<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.310> limits<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.790> its<00:03:29.970> practical

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
pushing the limits of its practical

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.130 
pushing the limits of its practical
application<00:03:31.730> it's<00:03:32.730> only<00:03:32.940> it's<00:03:33.269> 57<00:03:33.900> degrees

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
application it's only it's 57 degrees

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.390 
application it's only it's 57 degrees
it's<00:03:34.620> it's<00:03:35.239> it's<00:03:36.239> not<00:03:36.390> really<00:03:36.690> you<00:03:37.080> know

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
it's it's it's not really you know

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.090 
it's it's it's not really you know
considered<00:03:38.400> cold<00:03:38.730> as<00:03:39.090> far<00:03:39.330> as<00:03:39.980> camping<00:03:40.980> and

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
considered cold as far as camping and

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.580 
considered cold as far as camping and
backpacking<00:03:41.390> but<00:03:42.390> um

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
backpacking but um

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.699 
backpacking but um
I<00:03:48.569> wouldn't<00:03:49.569> want<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.780> depend<00:03:50.050> on<00:03:50.200> it<00:03:50.349> if<00:03:50.470> it

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
I wouldn't want to depend on it if it

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:53.250 
I wouldn't want to depend on it if it
was<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.370> middle<00:03:51.459> of<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.700> winter<00:03:51.849> but<00:03:52.569> then

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
was the middle of the winter but then

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.360 
was the middle of the winter but then
again<00:03:53.290> I<00:03:53.560> could<00:03:53.650> be<00:03:53.890> done<00:03:54.040> with<00:03:54.190> doing

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
again I could be done with doing

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.710 
again I could be done with doing
something<00:03:54.519> wrong<00:03:54.849> all<00:03:55.150> I'm<00:03:55.300> going<00:03:55.390> to<00:03:55.450> do<00:03:55.599> is

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
something wrong all I'm going to do is

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.210 
something wrong all I'm going to do is
this<00:03:55.750> this<00:03:56.110> final<00:03:56.470> test<00:03:56.500> this<00:03:56.769> is<00:03:56.920> going<00:03:57.040> to<00:03:57.099> be

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
this this final test this is going to be

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.990 
this this final test this is going to be
my<00:03:57.400> final<00:03:57.790> word<00:03:57.970> on<00:03:58.590> sterno<00:03:59.590> use<00:03:59.830> because<00:04:00.040> his

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
my final word on sterno use because his

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.940 
my final word on sterno use because his
stove<00:04:01.330> is<00:04:01.590> fantastic<00:04:02.590> I<00:04:02.620> don't<00:04:02.769> know<00:04:02.830> if

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
stove is fantastic I don't know if

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.220 
stove is fantastic I don't know if
anyone's<00:04:03.250> ever<00:04:03.340> used<00:04:03.580> the<00:04:03.670> m71<00:04:04.239> and<00:04:04.989> if<00:04:05.080> they'd

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
anyone's ever used the m71 and if they'd

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.530 
anyone's ever used the m71 and if they'd
gotten<00:04:05.440> they've<00:04:05.980> got<00:04:06.190> water<00:04:06.459> to<00:04:06.610> boil<00:04:06.819> so<00:04:07.450> we

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
gotten they've got water to boil so we

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.670 
gotten they've got water to boil so we
could<00:04:07.690> send<00:04:07.870> me<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:07.989> message<00:04:08.319> and<00:04:08.440> let<00:04:08.500> me<00:04:08.650> know

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
could send me a message and let me know

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.320 
could send me a message and let me know
if<00:04:08.830> they've<00:04:08.980> ever<00:04:09.250> had<00:04:09.519> water<00:04:09.819> boil<00:04:10.090> with<00:04:10.239> the

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
if they've ever had water boil with the

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:15.600 
if they've ever had water boil with the
m71<00:04:11.160> this<00:04:12.160> is<00:04:12.370> definitely<00:04:12.970> my<00:04:14.250> guess<00:04:15.250> is<00:04:15.459> going

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
m71 this is definitely my guess is going

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.560 
m71 this is definitely my guess is going
to<00:04:15.670> do<00:04:15.790> much<00:04:16.060> better<00:04:16.269> than<00:04:16.479> the<00:04:16.630> m71<00:04:18.359> all<00:04:19.359> right

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
to do much better than the m71 all right

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.240 
to do much better than the m71 all right
guys<00:04:20.160> almost<00:04:21.160> 20<00:04:21.340> minutes<00:04:21.729> in<00:04:22.889> stick<00:04:23.889> a<00:04:23.919> probe

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.000 
what it was but it was in the 10 minute
range<00:07:27.030> probably<00:07:28.030> a<00:07:28.390> eight<00:07:29.380> to<00:07:29.590> ten<00:07:29.770> minute

you're<00:07:39.640> going<00:07:39.820> to<00:07:39.910> be<00:07:40.000> waiting<00:07:40.150> more<00:07:40.960> than<00:07:40.990> 30

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:41.380 
you're going to be waiting more than 30

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.520 
you're going to be waiting more than 30
minutes<00:07:41.940> so<00:07:42.940> and<00:07:43.360> like<00:07:43.810> I<00:07:43.960> said<00:07:44.020> right<00:07:44.380> now

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:44.530 
minutes so and like I said right now

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.500 
minutes so and like I said right now
it's<00:07:44.710> 57<00:07:45.190> degrees<00:07:45.400> but<00:07:45.790> about<00:07:45.970> a<00:07:46.030> five<00:07:46.270> mile<00:07:46.480> an

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:46.510 
it's 57 degrees but about a five mile an

00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:50.130 
it's 57 degrees but about a five mile an
hour<00:07:46.690> breeze<00:07:47.130> so<00:07:48.130> a<00:07:48.520> great<00:07:49.060> option<00:07:49.390> for<00:07:49.690> many
