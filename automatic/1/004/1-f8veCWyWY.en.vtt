00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
using the Peacekeeper with the

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.100 
using the Peacekeeper with the
suppressor<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.820> this<00:00:12.509> right<00:00:12.690> here<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.929> I'm

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
suppressor and this right here is I'm

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.600 
suppressor and this right here is I'm
not<00:00:13.230> really<00:00:13.380> going<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.590> go<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:13.830> detail<00:00:14.280> too

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
not really going to go in detail too

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.039 
not really going to go in detail too
much<00:00:14.820> about<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.179> DLC<00:00:15.540> because<00:00:15.780> I<00:00:15.809> want<00:00:15.990> to

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
much about the DLC because I want to

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.200 
much about the DLC because I want to
make<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.199> more<00:00:16.560> detailed<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.369> in-depth<00:00:17.850> video

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
make a more detailed and in-depth video

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.570 
make a more detailed and in-depth video
on<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.570> where<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:19.590> video<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.830> longer<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.279> such

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
on it where the video is longer and such

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.140 
on it where the video is longer and such
but<00:00:21.050> this<00:00:22.050> right<00:00:22.260> here<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:23.400> Peacekeeper

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
but this right here is the Peacekeeper

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.570 
but this right here is the Peacekeeper
and<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.869> SMG<00:00:25.470> feels<00:00:25.890> like<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.099> hybrid<00:00:26.310> between

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
and the SMG feels like a hybrid between

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.500 
and the SMG feels like a hybrid between
the<00:00:27.080> assault<00:00:28.080> rifle<00:00:28.500> in<00:00:28.910> like<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.939> submachine

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
the assault rifle in like a submachine

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.560 
the assault rifle in like a submachine
gun<00:00:30.720> so<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:32.040> kind<00:00:32.430> of<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:33.210> has<00:00:33.390> like

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
gun so it kind of it has like

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.569 
gun so it kind of it has like
characteristics<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.469> both<00:00:34.530> although<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.309> don't

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
characteristics of both although I don't

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.090 
characteristics of both although I don't
really<00:00:36.020> particularly<00:00:37.020> like<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.860> for

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
really particularly like it for

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.479 
really particularly like it for
close-quarter<00:00:38.700> combat<00:00:38.899> I'd<00:00:39.899> much<00:00:40.290> rather<00:00:40.489> use

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
close-quarter combat I'd much rather use

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.240 
close-quarter combat I'd much rather use
an<00:00:41.730> assault<00:00:42.090> or<00:00:42.329> an<00:00:42.989> actual<00:00:43.230> other<00:00:43.559> submachine

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
an assault or an actual other submachine

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.690 
an assault or an actual other submachine
gun<00:00:44.460> that's<00:00:44.670> not<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.829> not<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.860> Peacekeeper<00:00:47.670> I

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
gun that's not the not the Peacekeeper I

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.670 
gun that's not the not the Peacekeeper I
think<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.000> lose<00:00:48.149> most<00:00:48.420> gun<00:00:48.750> battles<00:00:49.200> up<00:00:49.410> close

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
think it lose most gun battles up close

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.650 
think it lose most gun battles up close
to<00:00:49.710> other<00:00:50.039> submachine<00:00:50.640> guns<00:00:50.850> for<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.480> most

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
to other submachine guns for the most

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.420 
to other submachine guns for the most
part<00:00:51.899> because<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.410> has<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.559> pretty<00:00:53.039> slow<00:00:53.250> rate

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
part because it has a pretty slow rate

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.029 
part because it has a pretty slow rate
of<00:00:53.460> fire<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.940> such<00:00:54.260> but<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> really<00:00:55.860> good

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
of fire and such but it is a really good

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.220 
of fire and such but it is a really good
gun<00:00:56.280> I<00:00:56.309> am<00:00:56.579> enjoying<00:00:56.910> using<00:00:57.180> I<00:00:57.510> almost<00:00:57.989> have<00:00:58.199> it

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
gun I am enjoying using I almost have it

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.260 
gun I am enjoying using I almost have it
gold<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:59.180> that's<00:01:00.180> pretty<00:01:00.390> cool<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:02.090> this<00:01:03.090> map

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
gold and that's pretty cool so this map

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.620 
gold and that's pretty cool so this map
grind<00:01:03.629> is<00:01:03.840> actually<00:01:04.199> really<00:01:04.320> good<00:01:04.439> as<00:01:04.650> well

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
grind is actually really good as well

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.750 
grind is actually really good as well
kind<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.659> like<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> skate<00:01:07.140> park<00:01:07.170> thing<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.400> I

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
kind of like a skate park thing and I

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.460 
kind of like a skate park thing and I
feel<00:01:08.970> like<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.270> map<00:01:09.479> plays<00:01:09.840> really<00:01:10.170> close

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
feel like this map plays really close

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.740 
feel like this map plays really close
quarter<00:01:10.770> combat<00:01:11.210> even<00:01:12.210> though<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.420> not<00:01:12.570> like

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
quarter combat even though it's not like

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.800 
quarter combat even though it's not like
a<00:01:12.900> small<00:01:13.350> map<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:14.250> just<00:01:14.490> like<00:01:14.549> every<00:01:15.119> turn<00:01:15.450> is

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
a small map it's just like every turn is

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.609 
a small map it's just like every turn is
like<00:01:16.820> how<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:18.090> say<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.479> it's<00:01:19.020> just<00:01:19.200> really<00:01:19.350> close

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
like how I say it it's just really close

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.060 
like how I say it it's just really close
quarters<00:01:20.150> every<00:01:21.150> turn<00:01:21.530> is<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.650> pretty<00:01:22.890> much

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
quarters every turn is a pretty much

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.190 
quarters every turn is a pretty much
engagement<00:01:23.549> just<00:01:23.970> because<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.960> how<00:01:25.049> like

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
engagement just because it's how like

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.929 
engagement just because it's how like
the<00:01:25.350> map<00:01:25.530> flows<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.130> stuff<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.520> and

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
the map flows and stuff like that and

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.390 
the map flows and stuff like that and
something<00:01:27.930> I've<00:01:28.170> really<00:01:28.409> noticed<00:01:28.710> that's

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
something I've really noticed that's

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.120 
something I've really noticed that's
good<00:01:30.000> for<00:01:30.360> these<00:01:30.659> new<00:01:31.110> maps<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.590> domination

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
good for these new maps is domination

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.460 
good for these new maps is domination
plays<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.880> want<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.299> say<00:01:33.450> almost<00:01:33.689> perfect<00:01:34.350> on

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
plays I want to say almost perfect on

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.190 
plays I want to say almost perfect on
them<00:01:34.680> except<00:01:35.100> for<00:01:35.310> hydro<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.750> spawns<00:01:37.020> are

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
them except for hydro the spawns are

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.520 
them except for hydro the spawns are
kind<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.409> bad<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.829> that<00:01:37.860> one<00:01:39.140> but<00:01:40.140> other<00:01:40.350> than

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
kind of bad on that one but other than

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.130 
kind of bad on that one but other than
that<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:41.159> want<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.909> say<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.210> Dom<00:01:42.450> actually

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
that I want to say that Dom actually

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.410 
that I want to say that Dom actually
plays<00:01:43.350> really<00:01:43.829> really<00:01:44.430> good<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.909> these<00:01:45.180> maps

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
plays really really good on these maps

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.960 
plays really really good on these maps
not<00:01:46.290> only<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.560> but<00:01:46.770> this<00:01:47.490> feels<00:01:47.759> like

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
not only that but this feels like

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.300 
not only that but this feels like
Treyarch<00:01:48.840> maps<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.590> now<00:01:49.799> I<00:01:50.040> don't<00:01:50.100> know<00:01:50.280> if

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
Treyarch maps and now I don't know if

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.039 
Treyarch maps and now I don't know if
you<00:01:50.520> guys<00:01:50.670> what<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.299> guys<00:01:51.420> think<00:01:51.630> about<00:01:51.780> black

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
you guys what you guys think about black

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.990 
you guys what you guys think about black
ops<00:01:52.229> 2<00:01:52.470> maps<00:01:52.649> but<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.189> think<00:01:53.549> they're<00:01:53.700> okay<00:01:53.790> I

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
ops 2 maps but I think they're okay I

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.460 
ops 2 maps but I think they're okay I
don't<00:01:54.270> think<00:01:54.509> there<00:01:54.630> really<00:01:54.689> anything<00:01:55.079> great

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
don't think there really anything great

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.920 
don't think there really anything great
i<00:01:55.500> don't<00:01:55.829> think<00:01:55.979> they<00:01:56.100> spent<00:01:56.430> well<00:01:57.299> thats<00:01:57.869> i

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
i don't think they spent well thats i

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.569 
i don't think they spent well thats i
didn't<00:01:58.229> spend<00:01:58.320> time<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.009> maps<00:01:59.189> but<00:01:59.399> they

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
didn't spend time on the maps but they

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.100 
didn't spend time on the maps but they
didn't<00:01:59.820> really<00:01:59.939> go<00:02:00.149> all<00:02:00.390> out<00:02:00.420> on<00:02:00.659> them<00:02:00.990> like

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
didn't really go all out on them like

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.780 
didn't really go all out on them like
the<00:02:01.259> original<00:02:01.649> black<00:02:01.860> ops<00:02:02.100> those<00:02:02.340> had<00:02:02.520> some<00:02:02.729> of

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
the original black ops those had some of

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.190 
the original black ops those had some of
the<00:02:02.880> best<00:02:02.909> maps<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.509> call<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.750> duty's<00:02:04.020> ever

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
the best maps that call of duty's ever

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.499 
the best maps that call of duty's ever
had<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.770> these<00:02:05.280> feel<00:02:05.640> like<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:06.119> same<00:02:06.329> people

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
had and these feel like the same people

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.960 
had and these feel like the same people
who<00:02:06.719> made<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.170> first<00:02:07.200> black<00:02:08.069> ops<00:02:08.340> made<00:02:08.729> these

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
who made the first black ops made these

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.029 
who made the first black ops made these
maps<00:02:09.209> as<00:02:09.479> well<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:10.289> they<00:02:10.530> kind<00:02:10.739> of<00:02:10.800> feel<00:02:11.009> like

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
maps as well so they kind of feel like

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.970 
maps as well so they kind of feel like
they're

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
they're

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.309 
they're
like<00:02:12.819> they're<00:02:13.030> pretty<00:02:13.510> much<00:02:13.659> black<00:02:13.989> ops<00:02:14.230> 1

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
like they're pretty much black ops 1

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.289 
like they're pretty much black ops 1
maps<00:02:14.709> but<00:02:14.950> designed<00:02:15.340> in<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.580> future<00:02:15.940> which<00:02:16.150> is
