00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.190
 hello to all and babouche how 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.440
 are you going today we end up 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.630
 on minecraft for an epic glitch 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.029
 that we will be able to realize in 1.7.2 which 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.160
 will be broken bedrock's blog well 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.769
 yes because it's the only block of minecraft 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.810
 who resisted our pawn cat notary at 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.130
 everything you want in vanilla except 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.080
 in game mode where we could the case it is 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.000
 so there's a hangover in survival 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.579
 we will finally be able to break this magnificent 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.989
 bedrock block especially the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.950
 case it is on the roof of an error because 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.780
 it will be very effective 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.879
 there we find ourselves on the roof of a 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.680
 error always in survival if you 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.360
 do not know how to do it yourself 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.219
 invite to see my latest video gi 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.870
 joe lead kraft foods and i'll you 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.700
 simply explains how the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.070
 so realize conditions canvas 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.600
 dinosaurs we're going to place blocks of 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.770
 earth like this I explain to you in 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.920
 does the principle 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.320
 after we will take sapling of 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.090
 big black trees that is present in 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.550
 is finally who is one of the new 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.170
 biome that can be found in a 7.2 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.700
 you'll just have to place like this after 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.970
 thanks to two in bonneville to do 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.540
 to push a tree after to break the buses 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.580
 like that to replace sapling like that 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.540
 until when does a tree grow 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.830
 integrally in the earth blocks and 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.990
 so in the rock bay and so 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.000
 look if you see when we're going 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.220
 break when we look a little bit more 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.110
 close we can we can see that in fact these 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.970
 blocks broke the b2 rock and well yes 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.100
 we can finally break the beautiful rock and 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.869
 access easily loses hours 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.150
 so see after that you make an access 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.409
 simple on the roof of an error in less 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.299
 of a few seconds more need to 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.340
 to make bugs we broke the b2 rock and 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.960
 so now so that I have 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.490
 explained and that I showed you the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.950
 principle we will realize it just 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.619
 together well to show that it's 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.030
 I who realize that this is the 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.310
 I'm not with I do not know 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.140
 what I took damage finally brief 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.390
 just to show that this shot well 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.920
 real so I'd like to send it to the 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.869
 glitch hack and do I do not know if I 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.159
 say them but in any case I thank them 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.250
 infinitely cimp the aude 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.200
 in any case it would make me very happy to 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.330
 pass on their chains so here is 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.830
 after I would like to quote source marc because 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.220

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.340
 pass on the roof of a very heather 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.130
 just because I had done my 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.470
 video on his no this one is stuck in 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.820
 the leaves of this weapon we could see 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.390
 we just realized it so when we 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.180
 get closer we can see that 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.520
 the bug has well and is realized so see 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.080
 look at break it break it just 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.580

 it's perfect you see we broke 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.910
