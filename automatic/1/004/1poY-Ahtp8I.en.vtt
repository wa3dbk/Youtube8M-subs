00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.100

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.830
 of player we go with a super super video 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.910
 they have either the state as you know me 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.070
 they like all kinds of series of 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.230
 teenage books and teenagers 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.270
 teen movies and how not the 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.550
 quintessential series for people 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:20.420
 that you like this kind of thing is 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.950
 little liars and the lakers and how 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.780
 says a video this summer about 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.670
 series that followed and this was the most 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.470
 commented for good because I decided 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.510
 make a video about the style 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.570
 four protagonists and have a bit of 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.180
 his personality so that later we see 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.650
 who we identify with the most and I 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.540
 I will also tell you who I identify with 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.880
 more on each coast because the first thing that 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.950
 let's do is identify the four 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.329
 styles that these girls have after 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.100
 I forgot who I feel more 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.110
 identified at the time of existing as 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.480
 a comments then you just put or you put 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.430
 we like more and back after 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.430
 all this we will do some small theories 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.460
 what are you analyzing is happening with a 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.710
 the first the capsule is from spencer the 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.620
 classic so to speak its way of 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.239
 dress very british plated shelf 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.460
 the old one as the announcement of the mission 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.229
 physical 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.630
 so if the white shirts 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.939
 aspects with 4 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.320
 stamped with cesc and all your stuff is 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.740
 the main feature of your wardrobe 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.649
 Spencer if you are very accomplished is very 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.720
 student of currás everything very much is 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:26.090
 perfectionist nobody is capable of 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.579
 cheat you well is very fighter too 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.770
 is the second one that I'm going to the one 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.929
 let's talk about this emilia is super 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.549
 practice that of wearing your heels and 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:36.289
 a lot of makeup and all those things like 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.810
 that does not have a pretty style 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:41.439
 normal and current time to dress and 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:44.390
 always jeans simple shirts 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.950
 converse galleras etcetera, those are 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.959
 the key pieces of your wardrobe are you 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.479
 emily in that sense and by calling the 

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:53.599
 truth is that your character is like very 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.069
 is always restless is worried me 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:56.420
 I almost never see her happy in the series 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.459
 It is never so long and it is also very 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.470
 naive is believed all over the world or 

00:01:58.459 --> 00:02:03.110
 it is too good we also have to 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.060
 alternative area to criticism is put 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.130
 anything and the truth is that what 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.530
 combines baskonia not the stylists of the 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.660
 series but his character is exposed 15 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.640
 mix any type of pattern 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.230
 any kind of material and the truth 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.450
 is that I do not have any more apart 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.650
 tiny and always wearing dresses very 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.390
 cortitos what is it that needs to be done 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.280
 for the short say for in my case and 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.560
 it was not at all it would also be to know 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.600
 if you do not settle for the normal thing with 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.580
 current you like things just like 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.270
 the topics say it you have a heart 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.850
 good and tasting read write music the 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.400
 old movies and you always look for the 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.110
 happiness of all and of course not you 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.150
 matter what they will say and we go with the 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.980
 last to see who the case is with you 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.140
 nothing that is hannah seems to me a 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.660
 perfect character for our series 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.610
 does everything for logos with enough 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.140
 list sustains wasp and is a the 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.330
 Flirty started the series as a line 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.400
 fixed repellent but hike trade the 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.470
 Dark character but full of life or 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.600
 I love it then if it's a can 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.730
 sure you feel a bit uncomfortable with 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.890
 people who do not know these things 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.350
 you are pretty but when dressing 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.140
 you do not mind changing a style today 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.450
 lady style rocker in a hippie style 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.250
 you're with a mix of all styles 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.470
 Well, this in review of styles and 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.670
 personalities I have to say and I hope 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.980
 tell me what you are 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.560
 down on comments today itself 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.720
 totally one or the other in a background 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.819
 I could say that I'm hannah but I'm not 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.069
 insecure then then the personality 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.050
 I am quite like area I am not very 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.489
 intelligent physical and mathematical 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.890
 chemistry but I am more then of the 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.080
 writing the art the design and all those 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.910
 things and the way of dressing I think that 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.319
 it's hannah because before I was pretty and 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.120
 pinilla dress 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.129
 We were I wear as you see sweatshirts with 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.480
 impossible or dress the prince 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.849
 ramones that you liked so much 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.470
 black backpack that also yes I am 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.910
 pretty jaén in that sense so I know 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.799
 can you say that I am personality like 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.580
 area and how to dress like hannah 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.350
 and of course 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.230
 we have the guys in the series that 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.390
 as they are not very good against 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.940
 a photo of the area boyfriend and boyfriend of 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.570
 Spencer that are to be eaten by the 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.850
 news as mature and leading the 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:14.030
 martic like all things the one of 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:17.090
 Spencer is a good guy in the distance is a 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.350
 born fighter sacrifices a lot and 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.170
 then there are two characters that 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:23.330
 they go crazy not the state and the other one is 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.139
 Allison's brother who did not put her in 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.759
 the group because I do not like 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:29.639
 he is also to die for and we have it 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:31.560
 without care with the theories of who the 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:33.449
 he says it 's good because I have no idea 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.310
 this has not gone up spoiler at all 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.949
 because I have not had it anywhere 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.419
 I do not know absolutely anything nor is it signed 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.279
 nothing more because two seasons are missing 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.050
 still for truth and that they create the theory 

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:44.580
 of the twin but I really do not have 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.069
 idea of ​​who sam is and who can be 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.509
 I do not think it's any character 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:50.009
 of the four I think it is although yes 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.569
 what they want to send us yes 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.520
 they come from being one of the four but 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.409
 I really do not believe it or any of the 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.479
 boyfriends that as one of the couple I 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.979
 I'm dying because they are all Spaniards 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.930
 the best can be allison's brother 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.430
 but I do not believe it so nothing down 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.319

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.150
