will still work on your computer so
let's<00:00:55.050> get<00:00:55.410> started<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.449> the<00:00:57.559> basics<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.859> a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
let's get started that the basics of a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.979 
let's get started that the basics of a
web<00:00:59.250> page<00:00:59.449> are<00:01:00.620> when<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.920> put<00:01:02.250> in<00:01:02.399> your<00:01:02.640> URL<00:01:03.210> to

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
the top of your internet browser it's

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.190 
the top of your internet browser it's
going<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.010> send<00:01:08.430> off<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.850> request<00:01:09.330> to<00:01:09.810> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
going to send off a request to the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.920 
going to send off a request to the
server<00:01:10.740> server<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.909> URL<00:01:12.090> in<00:01:12.570> this<00:01:12.720> case

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
server server of that URL in this case

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.990 
server server of that URL in this case
Google<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.920> then<00:01:14.100> Google's<00:01:14.549> going<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.729> return

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
Google and then Google's going to return

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.170 
Google and then Google's going to return
back<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.540> document<00:01:16.320> which<00:01:17.040> contains<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.030> web

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180

exists<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:49.620> now<00:02:49.739> I've<00:02:49.799> got<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.010> blank<00:02:50.310> HTML<00:02:50.549> file

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
exists so now I've got a blank HTML file

exists so now I've got a blank HTML file
ready<00:02:51.359> to<00:02:51.569> start<00:02:51.810> putting<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.379> my<00:02:52.889> HTML<00:02:53.639> case

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
ready to start putting in my HTML case

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.300 
ready to start putting in my HTML case
so<00:02:55.200> it's<00:02:55.349> thought<00:02:55.530> of<00:02:55.680> that<00:02:55.889> that's<00:02:56.069> just

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
so it's thought of that that's just

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.750 
so it's thought of that that's just
write<00:02:56.489> in<00:02:56.639> HTML<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:58.590> just<00:02:58.799> lets<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.129> doc<00:02:59.310> the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
write in HTML that just lets the doc the

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.330 
write in HTML that just lets the doc the
browser<00:03:00.329> know<00:03:00.689> that<00:03:01.530> our<00:03:01.680> document<00:03:02.099> is<00:03:02.219> in

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
browser know that our document is in

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.959 
browser know that our document is in
HTML<00:03:02.909> and<00:03:03.200> then<00:03:04.200> at<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:04.919> bottom<00:03:05.069> just<00:03:05.760> put

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:05.969 
HTML and then at the bottom just put

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:08.720 
HTML and then at the bottom just put
forward<00:03:06.299> slash<00:03:06.629> HTML<00:03:07.200> BAM<00:03:07.709> there<00:03:07.950> don't<00:03:08.639> worry

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
forward slash HTML BAM there don't worry

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.330 
coming through on here and that's
because<00:04:04.390> these<00:04:04.540> are<00:04:04.600> just<00:04:04.960> tags<00:04:05.380> that<00:04:05.890> HTML

users<00:04:06.790> to<00:04:07.330> inform<00:04:07.720> the<00:04:07.870> browser<00:04:08.110> of<00:04:08.410> what

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.210 
information it's about to pass it and

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.390 
information it's about to pass it and
where<00:04:10.480> it<00:04:10.570> needs<00:04:10.750> to<00:04:10.840> put<00:04:11.050> it<00:04:11.230> so<00:04:12.100> we'll<00:04:12.250> come

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
where it needs to put it so we'll come

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.840 
where it needs to put it so we'll come
into<00:04:12.550> them<00:04:12.790> more<00:04:13.030> in<00:04:13.360> later<00:04:14.020> tutorials<00:04:14.850> but

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
into them more in later tutorials but

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.670 
into them more in later tutorials but
your<00:04:16.120> web<00:04:16.900> page<00:04:17.140> should<00:04:17.320> be<00:04:17.410> coming<00:04:17.650> through

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 
your web page should be coming through

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.920 
your web page should be coming through
just<00:04:17.890> saying<00:04:18.280> hello<00:04:18.670> world<00:04:18.910> if<00:04:19.570> you're

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
just saying hello world if you're

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.170 
just saying hello world if you're
bringing<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.530> tags<00:04:20.800> through<00:04:21.100> then<00:04:21.730> you

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
bringing the tags through then you

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.660 
bringing the tags through then you
haven't<00:04:22.330> done<00:04:22.570> your<00:04:22.750> format<00:04:23.260> and<00:04:23.470> plain<00:04:24.190> text

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
haven't done your format and plain text

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.730 
haven't done your format and plain text
so<00:04:25.210> just<00:04:25.420> make<00:04:25.570> sure<00:04:25.600> that's<00:04:26.020> done<00:04:26.290> properly

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
so just make sure that's done properly

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.400
