00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
pink to hold'em it's a little bit of a

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.980 
pink to hold'em it's a little bit of a
jelly<00:00:20.189> finish<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.880> it's<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.330> beautiful<00:00:21.750> shade

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
jelly finish and it's a beautiful shade

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.460 
jelly finish and it's a beautiful shade
very<00:00:22.529> glossy<00:00:22.920> very<00:00:23.609> shiny<00:00:24.060> but<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.869> just<00:00:25.140> chips

very glossy very shiny but it just chips
so<00:00:26.010> easily<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.699> didn't<00:00:27.240> put<00:00:27.330> on<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.480> top<00:00:27.750> coat<00:00:28.050> so

so easily I didn't put on a top coat so

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.859 
so easily I didn't put on a top coat so
perhaps<00:00:28.980> that<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.699> why<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.359> I<00:00:30.420> haven't<00:00:30.689> really

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869

concept of this collection but the

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.229 
concept of this collection but the
family<00:03:54.739> didn't<00:03:54.950> apply<00:03:55.130> that<00:03:55.340> evenly<00:03:55.760> so<00:03:56.180> I'm

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
family didn't apply that evenly so I'm

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.180
