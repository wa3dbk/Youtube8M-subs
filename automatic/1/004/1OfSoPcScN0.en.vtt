controller basic now it looks like it's

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.220 
controller basic now it looks like it's
just<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.879> USB<00:00:45.239> interface<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.870> saw<00:00:46.050> other

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
just a USB interface and I saw other

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.250 
just a USB interface and I saw other
systems<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.710> had<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.430> keyboard<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.300> mouse<00:00:48.629> so

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.810 
idea because it's just like every time
you<00:01:28.860> get<00:01:28.950> another<00:01:29.220> gun<00:01:29.369> you're<00:01:29.520> like<00:01:29.640> all<00:01:29.759> I

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
you get another gun you're like all I

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.370 
you get another gun you're like all I
want<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.060> bigger<00:01:30.240> better<00:01:30.479> badder<00:01:30.630> one<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.140> of

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
want a bigger better badder one and of

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.630 
want a bigger better badder one and of
course<00:01:31.409> anyone<00:01:31.829> tuning<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.250> right<00:01:32.280> now<00:01:32.520> is

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
course anyone tuning in right now is

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.460 
course anyone tuning in right now is
like<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:33.030> thought<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.540> was<00:01:33.659> III<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.290> game

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
like I thought this was III this game

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.859 
like I thought this was III this game
looks<00:01:34.890> very<00:01:35.159> old<00:01:36.530> well<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.970> point<00:01:39.390> here<00:01:39.720> in

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
looks very old well the point here in

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.590 
looks very old well the point here in
this<00:01:40.020> case<00:01:40.290> is<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.799> not<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.579> games<00:01:41.880> as<00:01:42.150> much<00:01:42.360> as

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
this case is is not the games as much as

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.480 
this case is is not the games as much as
the<00:01:42.840> fact<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.320> don't<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:44.070> opens<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
the fact that you don't this opens the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.609 
the fact that you don't this opens the
gaming<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> new<00:01:45.210> market<00:01:45.420> gaming<00:01:46.290> companies

in<00:01:53.070> some<00:01:53.310> ways<00:01:53.659> but<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:54.810> don't<00:01:54.990> have<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.170> have

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
in some ways but you don't have to have

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.600 
in some ways but you don't have to have
a<00:01:55.350> high-end<00:01:55.649> machine<00:01:55.950> all<00:01:56.100> right<00:01:56.189> let's<00:01:56.399> test

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
a high-end machine all right let's test

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.959 
a high-end machine all right let's test
the<00:01:56.729> latency<00:01:57.149> yeah<00:01:57.869> i'm<00:01:58.049> not<00:01:58.259> i'm<00:01:58.530> not<00:01:59.040> really

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
the latency yeah i'm not i'm not really

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.870 
the latency yeah i'm not i'm not really
noticing<00:02:00.689> any<00:02:00.930> light<00:02:01.200> latency<00:02:01.920> or<00:02:02.130> if<00:02:02.670> there

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
noticing any light latency or if there

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.569 
noticing any light latency or if there
is<00:02:03.000> any<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.509> certainly<00:02:03.869> not<00:02:04.079> any<00:02:04.710> worse<00:02:05.189> than

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
is any it's certainly not any worse than

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.270 
is any it's certainly not any worse than
you<00:02:05.969> would<00:02:06.180> get<00:02:07.110> like<00:02:07.320> out<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.740> team

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
you would get like out of a team

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.380 
you would get like out of a team

demanding game in history but no no but
but<00:02:15.880> but<00:02:16.090> regardless<00:02:16.480> like<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:16.780> you<00:02:17.260> know<00:02:17.290> that

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
but but regardless like a you know that

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.860 
but but regardless like a you know that
from<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.920> moment<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.250> hit<00:02:18.400> playable<00:02:18.910> yeah<00:02:19.270> oh

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
from the moment you hit playable yeah oh

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.140 
from the moment you hit playable yeah oh
absolutely<00:02:20.500> playable<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.850> would<00:02:21.970> imagine

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
absolutely playable and I would imagine

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.050 
absolutely playable and I would imagine
that<00:02:22.390> you<00:02:22.630> you<00:02:23.500> know<00:02:23.620> you<00:02:23.680> feel<00:02:24.100> you<00:02:24.459> feel<00:02:24.490> it

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
that you you know you feel you feel it

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.810 
that you you know you feel you feel it
feels<00:02:25.660> just<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.990> slightly<00:02:26.680> soupy<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:27.250> would<00:02:27.580> say

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
feels just a slightly soupy I would say

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.720 
feels just a slightly soupy I would say
but<00:02:28.300> again<00:02:28.620> what<00:02:29.620> I<00:02:29.860> would<00:02:30.130> wager<00:02:30.340> this<00:02:30.580> is<00:02:30.700> a

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
but again what I would wager this is a

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.850 
but again what I would wager this is a
much<00:02:30.880> superior<00:02:31.060> experience<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:32.080> if<00:02:32.500> you<00:02:32.650> don't

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
much superior experience to if you don't

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.250 
much superior experience to if you don't
have<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.130> hardware<00:02:33.400> to<00:02:33.640> run<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.910> game<00:02:34.260> this
