collector's<00:00:11.700> edition<00:00:12.240> now<00:00:12.540> remember<00:00:12.780> this<00:00:13.080> is

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
collector's edition now remember this is

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.770 
collector's edition now remember this is
just<00:00:13.320> speculation<00:00:13.759> so<00:00:14.759> upon<00:00:15.360> closer

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
just speculation so upon closer

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.439 
just speculation so upon closer
inspection<00:00:16.049> this<00:00:16.949> thing<00:00:17.220> looks<00:00:17.490> kinda<00:00:18.420> like

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
inspection this thing looks kinda like

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.130 
inspection this thing looks kinda like
an<00:00:18.949> incomplete<00:00:19.949> sort<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.520> weapon<00:00:20.730> now<00:00:21.630> what<00:00:22.109> I

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
an incomplete sort of weapon now what I

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.230 
an incomplete sort of weapon now what I
think<00:00:22.439> this<00:00:22.590> might<00:00:22.650> be<00:00:22.890> is<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.939> could<00:00:24.210> be

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
think this might be is that it could be

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.349 
think this might be is that it could be
an<00:00:24.420> add<00:00:24.660> on<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:25.410> another<00:00:25.830> weapon<00:00:26.369> or<00:00:26.880> maybe<00:00:27.090> you

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
an add on to another weapon or maybe you

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.150 
an add on to another weapon or maybe you
need<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.630> get<00:00:27.779> a<00:00:27.810> legendary<00:00:28.320> weapon<00:00:28.769> from<00:00:28.980> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
need to get a legendary weapon from the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.710 
need to get a legendary weapon from the
new<00:00:29.340> rate<00:00:29.550> that's<00:00:29.849> coming<00:00:30.179> with<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.390> taken

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
new rate that's coming with the taken

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.990 
new rate that's coming with the taken
King<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.230> then<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.560> equip<00:00:31.890> that<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.550> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
King and then you equip that to the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.240 
King and then you equip that to the
sleeper<00:00:33.630> stimulant<00:00:34.170> then<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.590> becomes<00:00:34.950> a

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
sleeper stimulant then it becomes a

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.400 
King collector's edition it looks kind
of<00:00:41.910> cool<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.390> it<00:00:42.540> also<00:00:42.690> looks<00:00:43.020> kind<00:00:43.320> of

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
of cool but it also looks kind of

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.229 
of cool but it also looks kind of
incomplete<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.460> also<00:00:44.579> looks<00:00:44.820> kind<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.180> weird

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
incomplete it also looks kind of weird

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.360 
incomplete it also looks kind of weird
but<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:45.960> also<00:00:46.110> looks<00:00:46.440> like<00:00:46.620> something<00:00:47.129> that

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
but it also looks like something that

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.500 
but it also looks like something that
fuck<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.120> up<00:00:49.129> in<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.610> ass<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:51.000> course<00:00:51.210> we

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
can't factor out the fact that it could

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.540 
can't factor out the fact that it could
be<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:54.360> heavy<00:00:54.690> weapon<00:00:54.930> itself<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.920> brand<00:00:56.250> new

be a heavy weapon itself a brand new
heavy<00:00:56.820> weapon<00:00:57.149> at<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.480> because<00:00:57.660> I<00:00:57.960> have

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
heavy weapon at that because I have

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.189 
heavy weapon at that because I have
never<00:00:58.320> seen<00:00:58.739> something<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.640> different<00:01:00.390> in<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
gonna be kind of like a charge beam

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.310 
gonna be kind of like a charge beam
cannon<00:01:05.610> sort<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:05.939> heavy<00:01:06.210> weapon<00:01:06.540> look<00:01:07.170> at<00:01:07.260> this

thing<00:01:07.560> in<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.830> middle<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.640> like<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
thing in the middle that is like the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.700 
thing in the middle that is like the
cannon<00:01:09.570> blaster<00:01:10.020> thing<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.680> thing

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
cannon blaster thing and the thing

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.980 
cannon blaster thing and the thing
around<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.610> looks<00:01:11.820> like<00:01:12.000> it'll<00:01:12.240> rotate<00:01:12.510> to

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
around it looks like it'll rotate to

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.140 
around it looks like it'll rotate to
charge<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.710> then<00:01:14.159> once<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.549> gets<00:01:14.729> all<00:01:14.909> of<00:01:15.000> its

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
charge and then once it gets all of its

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.990 
charge and then once it gets all of its
charge<00:01:15.540> up<00:01:15.810> it'll<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.619> ejaculate<00:01:17.460> into<00:01:17.700> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
charge up it'll like ejaculate into the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.760 
charge up it'll like ejaculate into the
community<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.780> looks<00:01:18.930> like<00:01:18.990> it'll<00:01:19.290> shoot<00:01:19.560> out

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
community it looks like it'll shoot out

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.039 
community it looks like it'll shoot out
a<00:01:19.950> beam<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.400> light<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.970> has<00:01:21.270> some<00:01:21.570> sort<00:01:21.930> of

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
a beam of light that has some sort of

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.870 
a beam of light that has some sort of
travel<00:01:22.439> time<00:01:22.619> kind<00:01:22.979> of<00:01:23.009> like<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.340> rocket<00:01:23.729> so

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
travel time kind of like the rocket so

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.700 
travel time kind of like the rocket so
it<00:01:24.000> won't<00:01:24.150> be<00:01:24.270> as<00:01:24.479> overpowered<00:01:25.200> but<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.680> course

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
it won't be as overpowered but of course

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.770 
it won't be as overpowered but of course
it's<00:01:26.130> an<00:01:26.220> exotic<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.850> think<00:01:27.180> it'll<00:01:27.420> probably

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
it's an exotic so I think it'll probably

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.870 
it's an exotic so I think it'll probably
electrocute<00:01:28.650> or<00:01:28.890> do<00:01:29.040> some<00:01:29.310> sort<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.640> weird

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
electrocute or do some sort of weird

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.999 
electrocute or do some sort of weird
damage<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.900> other<00:01:30.990> team<00:01:31.320> now<00:01:31.590> people<00:01:31.799> are

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
damage to the other team now people are

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.310 
damage to the other team now people are
speculating<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.729> this<00:01:33.060> can<00:01:33.360> also<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.869> a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
speculating that this can also be a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.760 
speculating that this can also be a
sniper<00:01:34.680> rifle<00:01:35.340> now<00:01:36.240> I<00:01:36.540> don't<00:01:37.170> like<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> idea

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
sniper rifle now I don't like the idea

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.800 
sniper rifle now I don't like the idea
that<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.310> gonna<00:01:38.460> be<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.670> sniper<00:01:38.909> rifle<00:01:39.390> cuz<00:01:39.689> of

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
that it's gonna be a sniper rifle cuz of

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.480 
that it's gonna be a sniper rifle cuz of
those<00:01:39.960> floating<00:01:40.320> Illuminati<00:01:40.860> triangles<00:01:41.430> that

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
those floating Illuminati triangles that
