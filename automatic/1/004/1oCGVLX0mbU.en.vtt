and<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.960> saw<00:00:37.230> this<00:00:37.730> subculture<00:00:38.730> come<00:00:39.000> out<00:00:39.120> of

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
and I saw this subculture come out of

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.720 
and I saw this subculture come out of
America<00:00:39.269> that<00:00:39.809> subway<00:00:40.199> art<00:00:40.379> where<00:00:41.250> people

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
America that subway art where people

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.130 
America that subway art where people
were<00:00:41.820> painting<00:00:42.239> their<00:00:42.360> names<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.870> trains

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
were painting their names on the trains

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.189 
were painting their names on the trains
and<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:44.579> just<00:00:44.790> instantly<00:00:45.210> appealed<00:00:45.540> to<00:00:45.629> me<00:00:45.809> yeah

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
and I just instantly appealed to me yeah

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.079 
and I just instantly appealed to me yeah
they're<00:00:46.469> opening<00:00:46.710> up<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.890> pain<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.790> such<00:00:48.059> a

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.089 
they're opening up to pain on such a

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.649 
they're opening up to pain on such a
large<00:00:48.329> scale<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.409> just<00:00:49.739> took<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:51.000> idea<00:00:51.480> of

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:51.659 
large scale so I just took the idea of

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:54.020 
large scale so I just took the idea of
drawing<00:00:52.260> a<00:00:52.470> band<00:00:52.710> name<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.250> just<00:00:53.399> substituted

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
drawing a band name and just substituted

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.600 
drawing a band name and just substituted
that<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.390> my<00:00:54.510> only<00:00:54.890> my<00:00:55.890> tag<00:00:56.159> and<00:00:56.399> then<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.550> took

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
that for my only my tag and then I took

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.660 
that for my only my tag and then I took
that<00:00:56.790> out<00:00:57.210> into<00:00:57.920> public<00:00:58.920> space<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.640> just

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
that out into public space and just

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.740 
that out into public space and just
started<00:01:00.059> spraying<00:01:00.809> angry<00:01:02.210> now<00:01:03.210> started<00:01:03.629> off

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
started spraying angry now started off

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.560 
started spraying angry now started off
emulating<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.649> New<00:01:04.739> York<00:01:04.979> thing<00:01:05.220> but<00:01:06.090> there's

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
emulating the New York thing but there's

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.260 
emulating the New York thing but there's
only<00:01:06.690> a<00:01:06.810> certain<00:01:07.020> amount<00:01:07.259> of<00:01:07.789> time<00:01:08.789> you<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.000> do

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
only a certain amount of time you can do

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.400 
only a certain amount of time you can do
that<00:01:09.450> before<00:01:10.289> that<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:11.670> not<00:01:11.929> fulfilling<00:01:12.929> you

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:13.410 
that before that is not fulfilling you

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.139 
that before that is not fulfilling you
know<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.590> have<00:01:13.800> to<00:01:13.979> inject<00:01:14.220> personality<00:01:14.880> into

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
know you have to inject personality into

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.520 
know you have to inject personality into
it<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:17.420> think<00:01:18.420> it's<00:01:18.570> just<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.869> expressive

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
work what am I see myself it's kind of

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.130 
work what am I see myself it's kind of
the<00:02:27.670> best<00:02:27.880> way<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:28.060> explaining<00:02:28.480> it<00:02:28.750> is<00:02:28.930> it's

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
the best way of explaining it is it's

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:35.340 
the best way of explaining it is it's
like<00:02:31.470> 20<00:02:32.470> minutes<00:02:32.860> or<00:02:33.040> so<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:34.780> don't<00:02:35.260> know

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
like 20 minutes or so you don't know

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.410 
like 20 minutes or so you don't know
where<00:02:35.530> it's<00:02:36.340> gonna<00:02:36.610> end<00:02:36.700> you<00:02:37.209> don't<00:02:37.300> know

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
where it's gonna end you don't know

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.970 
where it's gonna end you don't know
what's<00:02:37.600> gonna<00:02:37.690> happen<00:02:37.930> but<00:02:38.290> once<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:38.709> start

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
what's gonna happen but once you start

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.949 
what's gonna happen but once you start
it's<00:02:39.310> like<00:02:39.580> it's<00:02:39.970> on<00:02:40.120> you<00:02:40.360> just<00:02:40.480> have<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:40.840> go

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
it's like it's on you just have to go

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.740 
it's like it's on you just have to go
with<00:02:41.140> it<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.760> commit<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.790> that<00:02:43.030> moment<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:43.600> I

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
with it and commit to that moment and I

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.270 
with it and commit to that moment and I
think<00:02:43.840> that's<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.260> thing<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.530> really<00:02:44.770> like<00:02:44.890> is

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
think that's the thing I really like is

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.340 
think that's the thing I really like is
committing<00:02:45.820> to<00:02:45.850> that<00:02:47.820> that<00:02:48.820> point<00:02:49.720> in<00:02:49.930> time<00:02:50.110> of

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
committing to that that point in time of

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.380 
committing to that that point in time of
having<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.920> make<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.130> painting<00:02:51.430> when<00:02:52.209> I'm<00:02:52.300> in

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
having to make a painting when I'm in

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.800 
having to make a painting when I'm in
the<00:02:52.480> studio<00:02:52.690> I<00:02:52.900> can<00:02:53.080> take<00:02:53.350> as<00:02:53.470> long<00:02:53.590> as<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.830> want

the studio I can take as long as I want

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.010 
the studio I can take as long as I want
deliberate<00:02:55.810> over<00:02:56.110> every<00:02:56.530> stroke<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.280> be<00:02:57.459> very

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
deliberate over every stroke and be very

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.479 
deliberate over every stroke and be very
critical<00:02:59.020> and<00:02:59.470> I<00:02:59.530> end<00:02:59.680> up<00:02:59.770> painting<00:03:00.190> over<00:03:00.340> a

critical and I end up painting over a
lot<00:03:00.640> of<00:03:00.730> things<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.150> working<00:03:01.510> back<00:03:01.750> but<00:03:02.320> in

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.009 
that moment when you've got people
watching<00:03:05.860> you<00:03:06.280> you<00:03:07.209> just<00:03:07.390> have<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.720> do<00:03:07.870> it

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
watching you you just have to do it

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.740

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
process is actually about editing it's

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.280 
process is actually about editing it's
about<00:03:40.090> seeing<00:03:40.360> what<00:03:40.600> I've<00:03:40.720> done<00:03:40.930> in<00:03:41.080> a<00:03:41.140> public

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
about seeing what I've done in a public

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.850 
about seeing what I've done in a public
space<00:03:41.769> and<00:03:42.070> then<00:03:42.370> how<00:03:42.549> I<00:03:42.579> feel<00:03:42.850> about<00:03:43.000> that<00:03:43.860> so

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
space and then how I feel about that so

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.470 
space and then how I feel about that so
the<00:03:45.040> next<00:03:45.250> time<00:03:45.459> I<00:03:45.489> go<00:03:45.670> to<00:03:45.730> do<00:03:46.030> that<00:03:46.209> how<00:03:46.450> I

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
the next time I go to do that how I

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.090 
the next time I go to do that how I
adjust<00:03:46.989> and<00:03:47.320> what<00:03:48.070> I<00:03:48.100> see<00:03:48.370> working<00:03:48.820> and
