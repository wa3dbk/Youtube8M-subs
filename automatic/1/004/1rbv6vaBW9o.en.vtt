00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:06.160
 remember to always disconnect the 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.840
 electrical items to test myself before 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.160
 to introduce some hands to him that 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.110
 may suffer an electric shock 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.090
 hello friends good today 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.219
 I want to show something that I just saw 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.369
 here in my aquarium one of my fish 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:22.509
 guppy has died a machito 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.509
 it's here floating adrift 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.170
 I had not realized if they were 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.130
 sick fish just today note 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.040
 that this press is dead sometimes 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.890
 it's a bit sad to see our fish 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.850
 they die but good it exists of the aquarium 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.520
 cold is that we strive to give it a 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.170
 good inhabited our fish but then 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.860
 also knowing that as living beings 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.949
 they can get sick they can die then 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.300
 this as good and see this thing that touched me 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.300
 I fish and all dead 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.809
 and there are people who have asked me what 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.519
 do when I need die many 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.250
 they think it's good to leave it inside the 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.470
 aquarium for this fish to be 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.690
 so that the other fish eat it 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.620
 serve as food but that does not make me 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.620
 it seems good idea 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.540
 because we do not know if the fish died for 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.310
 some disease if the fish died for 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.259
 illness and the others are going to eat it 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.450
 Well they are going to get infected from that 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:28.750
 disease so the most indicated is 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.890
 that with a small network we take out 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.270
 our aquarium fish 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.100
 and we can see it 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.100
 we are going to take it out of the aquarium 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.659
 and we are going to take it to a place where 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:48.880
 we can deposit our little fish 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.400
 so here we have our little fish 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.760
 dead in a network 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.530
 what I advise is that always 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.620
 dead little fish we remove them from 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.530
 aquarium let's observe each other to see if 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.180
 they do not show signs of any disease 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.520
 and well, I 'm going to observe the rest 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.520
 I see them well the temperature is fine 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.989
 all the values ​​of which he 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.750
 find normal so it's good 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.180
 I think that this fish would have had 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.540
 its low defenses and that's why simply 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.780
 died I can not find another explanation but 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.880
 well let's take it to the cemetery 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.100
 of the fish 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.410
 a good place to place our 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.230
 little fish dead, it's going to be a pot 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.000
 with a plant because the fish is going to 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.000
 serve as fertilizer to that plant 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.830
 well then let's take our 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.830
 little fish 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.510
 and then like that with my hands because when 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.070
 humidity does not disgust me but if you do not 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.980
 you like to do it that well you can 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.250
 take like a glove let's make a 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.000
 small milestone in the ground 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.630
 flower pot 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.400
 then you can see 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.860
 Well, the little fish is already there 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.860
 land let's cover it with the earth 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.590
 and that is going to be the cemetery of our 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:18.220
 little fish serves that this then it goes 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:20.290

 do when our fish die is what 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.360
 that I always do with the little fish
