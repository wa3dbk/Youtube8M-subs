00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:03.240 
now of course the slab roller is the

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.210 
now of course the slab roller is the
easier<00:00:03.659> way<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.959> go<00:00:04.200> but<00:00:04.470> not<00:00:04.589> everybody<00:00:05.009> owns

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
easier way to go but not everybody owns

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.980 
easier way to go but not everybody owns
that<00:00:05.580> piece<00:00:05.790> of<00:00:05.940> equipment<00:00:06.029> so<00:00:06.720> I'm<00:00:06.839> going<00:00:06.960> to

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
that piece of equipment so I'm going to

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.750 
that piece of equipment so I'm going to
show<00:00:07.230> you<00:00:07.259> how<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.589> make<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.799> nice<00:00:08.010> slab<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.610> clay

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
show you how to make a nice slab of clay

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.060 
show you how to make a nice slab of clay
with<00:00:09.389> just<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.750> rolling<00:00:09.990> pin<00:00:10.320> in<00:00:10.559> your<00:00:10.590> table

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
with just a rolling pin in your table

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.789 
with just a rolling pin in your table
now<00:00:11.610> my<00:00:11.910> table<00:00:12.389> here<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.750> covered<00:00:13.230> in<00:00:13.349> canvas

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
now my table here is covered in canvas

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.369 
now my table here is covered in canvas
that<00:00:14.580> way<00:00:14.759> when<00:00:14.940> I'm<00:00:15.089> throwing<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.809> clay<00:00:16.109> it's

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
that way when I'm throwing the clay it's

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.010 
that way when I'm throwing the clay it's
not<00:00:16.560> sticking<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.460> gives<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:17.880> nice<00:00:18.060> surface

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
not sticking it gives it a nice surface

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.720 
not sticking it gives it a nice surface
to<00:00:19.230> absorb<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> little<00:00:19.859> bit<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.100> water<00:00:20.279> as<00:00:20.490> well

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
to absorb a little bit of water as well

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.660 
to absorb a little bit of water as well
if<00:00:20.970> you're<00:00:21.150> letting<00:00:21.480> your<00:00:21.600> clay<00:00:21.840> set<00:00:22.109> up<00:00:22.519> so<00:00:23.519> in

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
if you're letting your clay set up so in

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.700 
if you're letting your clay set up so in
order<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.880> make<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> nice<00:00:24.359> big<00:00:24.960> slab<00:00:25.380> with<00:00:25.619> the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
order to make a nice big slab with the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.429 
order to make a nice big slab with the
rolling<00:00:26.099> pin<00:00:26.130> I'm<00:00:26.789> gonna<00:00:27.689> stretch<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.199> out<00:00:28.380> a

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
rolling pin I'm gonna stretch this out a

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.790 
rolling pin I'm gonna stretch this out a
little<00:00:28.710> bit<00:00:28.859> more<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:30.320> probably<00:00:31.320> want<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.679> get

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
little bit more I probably want to get

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.280 
little bit more I probably want to get
it<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.099> be<00:00:32.369> in<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:33.030> end<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.570> little<00:00:33.899> bit<00:00:34.020> more

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
it to be in the end a little bit more

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.650 
it to be in the end a little bit more
than<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> quarter<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.860> an<00:00:35.010> inch<00:00:35.100> thick<00:00:35.510> that's<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
than a quarter of an inch thick that's a

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.440 
than a quarter of an inch thick that's a
good<00:00:36.840> thickness<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:38.309> be<00:00:38.579> sturdy<00:00:38.969> enough<00:00:39.059> to

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
good thickness to be sturdy enough to

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.900 
good thickness to be sturdy enough to
use<00:00:41.930> and<00:00:43.129> thick<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.309> know<00:00:44.430> thick<00:00:44.640> enough<00:00:44.850> to

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
use and thick you know thick enough to

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.720 
use and thick you know thick enough to
hold<00:00:45.030> up<00:00:45.829> so<00:00:46.829> I've<00:00:46.980> got<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.399> little<00:00:47.489> bit

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
hold up so I've got it a little bit

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.090 
hold up so I've got it a little bit
thicker<00:00:47.940> than<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.360> right<00:00:48.570> now<00:00:48.800> I'm<00:00:49.800> going<00:00:50.010> to

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
thicker than that right now I'm going to

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.540 
thicker than that right now I'm going to
take<00:00:50.280> my<00:00:50.430> really<00:00:50.760> big<00:00:50.850> rolling<00:00:51.270> pin<00:00:51.480> here<00:00:52.550> and

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
take my really big rolling pin here and

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.580 
take my really big rolling pin here and
I'm<00:00:53.789> just<00:00:54.000> going<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.570> kind<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.170> stretch<00:00:55.559> that

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
I'm just going to kind of stretch that

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.569 
I'm just going to kind of stretch that
out<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.070> little<00:00:56.280> bit<00:00:56.520> more<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:02.010> make<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.340> nice

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
out a little bit more and make it nice

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.289 
out a little bit more and make it nice
and<00:01:02.609> smooth<00:01:07.159> having<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.250> really<00:01:08.549> wide<00:01:08.790> rolling

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
and smooth having a really wide rolling

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.210 
and smooth having a really wide rolling
pin<00:01:09.510> helps<00:01:09.780> because<00:01:10.229> then<00:01:10.710> you're<00:01:11.040> more

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
pin helps because then you're more

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.010 
pin helps because then you're more
likely<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.030> same<00:01:12.060> thickness<00:01:12.689> all

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
likely to have the same thickness all

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.469 
likely to have the same thickness all
the<00:01:13.140> way<00:01:13.290> across<00:01:13.729> you<00:01:14.729> have<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.880> really<00:01:15.180> thin

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
the way across you have a really thin

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.109 
the way across you have a really thin
rolling<00:01:15.990> pin<00:01:16.430> you're<00:01:17.430> gonna<00:01:17.549> have<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.880> do<00:01:17.970> it

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
rolling pin you're gonna have to do it

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.580 
rolling pin you're gonna have to do it
in<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.390> couple<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.689> different<00:01:18.990> places<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.500> you

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
in a couple of different places and you

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.560 
in a couple of different places and you
might<00:01:19.770> end<00:01:19.799> up<00:01:19.979> with<00:01:20.100> ridges<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.670> middle

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.810 

so<00:01:24.570> once<00:01:24.780> you've<00:01:24.930> got<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.229> rolled<00:01:25.470> out<00:01:25.820> to

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
so once you've got it rolled out to

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.569 
so once you've got it rolled out to
about<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.180> thickness<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.900> want<00:01:28.579> you

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
about the thickness that you want you

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.910 
about the thickness that you want you
want<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.790> take<00:01:30.030> some<00:01:30.990> kind<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.259> drywall<00:01:31.560> knife

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
want to take some kind of drywall knife

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.399 
want to take some kind of drywall knife
and<00:01:33.320> smooth<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.950> surface<00:01:35.329> helps<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:37.170> clean

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
and smooth the surface helps to to clean

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.280 
and smooth the surface helps to to clean
off<00:01:37.530> your<00:01:37.710> knife<00:01:37.860> first<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:39.390> you're<00:01:40.110> just

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
off your knife first and you're just

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.010 
off your knife first and you're just
compressing<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:41.070> clay<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.930> smoothing<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
compressing the clay and smoothing the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.350 
compressing the clay and smoothing the
surface<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:44.189> did<00:01:44.399> get<00:01:44.549> some<00:01:44.579> compression

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
surface you did get some compression

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.469 
surface you did get some compression
with<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.659> rolling<00:01:46.020> pin<00:01:47.090> but<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.240> gives<00:01:48.390> you

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
with that rolling pin but this gives you

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.410 
with that rolling pin but this gives you
just<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.750> little<00:01:48.840> bit<00:01:49.020> more

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.630 

and<00:01:54.990> if<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.440> have<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.620> few<00:01:55.860> ridges<00:01:56.010> that's<00:01:56.340> okay

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
and if you have a few ridges that's okay

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.130 
and if you have a few ridges that's okay
because<00:01:56.820> we're<00:01:57.360> probably<00:01:57.479> going<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.840> end<00:01:58.020> up

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
because we're probably going to end up

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.440 
because we're probably going to end up
wiping<00:01:59.130> those<00:01:59.340> out<00:01:59.580> in<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.850> next<00:01:59.970> steps<00:02:00.330> of

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
wiping those out in the next steps of

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.899 
wiping those out in the next steps of
the<00:02:00.540> process<00:02:00.720> so<00:02:01.620> now<00:02:01.740> we<00:02:01.800> have<00:02:02.010> a<00:02:02.040> nice<00:02:02.340> slab

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
the process so now we have a nice slab

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.210 
the process so now we have a nice slab
of<00:02:03.060> clay
