00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 to do then our skewer of 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.090
 picanha what we do not need to use a 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.440
 picanha and we will cut in butter 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.529
 its a little Worcestershire sauce 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:20.449
 beer onion finely chopped garlic 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:24.600
 finely chopped parsley salt 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:26.580
 pepper and a delicious farofinha 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.730
 so let's get to what cutting in 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.800
 beef proved correct 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.420
 Look, we'll get to stay and let's go. 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.860
 enjoy two cuts 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.879
 We are going to make a cut for the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:42.629
 and we're going to make a cut for 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:45.480
 roast beef to eat just taking the picanha 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:48.899
 bebek from the background at a time where 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.000
 here be proportional to the front 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.969
 people make our roast beef we come 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.629
 here o 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.590
 and then we have to hit the two 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.199
 sides 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.510
 where is in a straight line to also 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:13.790
 thinking of the ruby â€‹â€‹victory that comes here 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:17.270
 makes a beautiful line that so, and also 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.270
 on the other side 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:28.490
 so here I have the cuts that I go 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.000
 use to make respective and this one 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.100
 I'll use it to make a beautiful roast beef 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.330
 You saw that I was generous, right? 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.280
 remove the sides to make a 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.050
 skewer that we are the beautiful one 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.810
 so the beautiful little skewer 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:44.990
 So, now, just right here. 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.600
 Size of the pieces a nice piece 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.610
 As he tunes, you let him 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.310
 thicker 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:02:00.130
 here the same thing the finer part 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:03.710
 thicker cut out separates and also makes 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.690
 good bits to stay 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.259
 this is already thinking about succulence 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:12.700
 I'm going to cut it all out 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:15.500
 let's go peta not yet let's go 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.959
 marinai then we 're going to drop here 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:26.739
 O 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:26.739
 and here we go the onion and the garlic 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:36.489
 for a little bit of panties for tastes 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:45.760
 here the rest is to the end to stay 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:45.760
 right along here english beer sauce 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.340
 chili 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:02.600
 we'll just touch 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.400
 This is what we let ourselves marinating here for. 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.900
 at least 40 minutes 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.640
 let's go now then past one still 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.730
 good marinade it changes color 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:20.760
 We will not forget to measure 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.240
 if the skewer fits in the skillet today 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:28.140
 will win respective will not work 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:31.650
 then the pt is something fat and 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.180
 skewer never comes through always comes 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.130
 to the side 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:39.660
 if I put there in the middle I will have fat 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:43.230
 then raw to the side and then there goes 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:45.780
 waking you will do all the 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.960
 does not necessarily mean that the 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.740
 she has to stay the same side but 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:58.950
 you can arrange to stay there is 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:04:04.700
 picanha the picanha barely passed 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:07.739
 It's not meant to be this way. 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:12.150
 bleeding point and more in the case 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:15.959
 of the pt but at least ill past the iptu 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:19.500
 and we put it here what we want 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:22.320
 and plump and liquid forms sequinho 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.000
 and will cook instead of winning that is 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.260
 a trick that will do their respective 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.340
 It gets much better. 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.620
 Then I will respect all of them. 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:35.100
 He's ready already, we ran. 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:38.340
 quite the heated butter skillet 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:44.460
 It's fundamental here is a bit of 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:46.890
 butter spreads and for her not to burn 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.430
 We already come with their respective attempts. 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:53.490
 start with the fat down to give 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:56.600
 a look at where the fat and little 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.600
 fat to the underside 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:05.730
 so here I will now work for 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:09.389
 here the 56 minutes turning and their 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:11.340
 respective until the point given point 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:14.669
 I'm going to take it, do not let it perspire. 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.630
 here is not a finish and all the 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.850
 sides 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:24.530
 The fat will look good in fine 

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:27.030
 there is aa super delicious and juicy delight 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.160
 Sukkur skewers before so why on the 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:34.710
 time to cut you need to master 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:38.790
 now here then goes our marinade the 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:49.970
 high to be a very fast job at 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:49.970
 remaining parsley is losing stirred 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:57.090
 just to pull the flavors that were here 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:59.520
 picanha Fat Butter 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:05.330
 juice that came out here we have a 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.330
 I look for the cool one for our receptive 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:15.249
 they could not get out and if they die it's a 

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:19.479
 I look to pass the skewer as it goes 

00:06:15.249 --> 00:06:21.819
 eating like this and why it crosses 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:24.789
 by a wall in that through will get the 

00:06:21.819 --> 00:06:26.229
 sporting will get wet here and will convince 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:27.759
 using a code that no one will look at 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:29.979
 in what way 

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:33.639
 Actually, that's when it's ready. 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:35.859
 our steak spicy juicy the 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:39.099
 small bunch which is the basis of his marinade 

00:06:35.859 --> 00:06:41.619
 in beer and a farofinha mb what the 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:44.769
 people want you to eat well and drink 

00:06:41.619 --> 00:06:47.429
 well okay to be much happier here with 12 

00:06:44.769 --> 00:06:47.429
 Years are already there.
