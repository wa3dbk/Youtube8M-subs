00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
actually already in theory inform or

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.560 
actually already in theory inform or
however<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.860> say<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.250> but<00:01:59.969> yeah<00:02:00.329> let's<00:02:00.479> go

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
so top on my bike here and let's just

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.679 
so top on my bike here and let's just
head<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.579> the<00:02:05.610> left<00:02:05.820> of<00:02:05.969> this<00:02:06.030> place<00:02:06.299> he<00:02:06.450> place

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
head to the left of this place he place

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.749 
head to the left of this place he place
so<00:02:07.259> this<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.530> really<00:02:07.799> easy<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.399> do<00:02:08.550> of<00:02:08.729> course

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
so this is really easy to do of course

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.040 
so this is really easy to do of course
