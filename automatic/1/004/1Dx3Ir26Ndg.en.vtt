California the San Andreas Fault split

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.870 
California the San Andreas Fault split
the<00:02:17.660> volcanic<00:02:18.660> field<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.380> as<00:02:19.739> one<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.760> the

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
the volcanic field and as one of the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.569 
the volcanic field and as one of the
plates<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.569> Pacific<00:02:22.079> plate<00:02:22.230> moved<00:02:22.739> Northwest

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
plates the Pacific plate moved Northwest

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.839 
plates the Pacific plate moved Northwest
it<00:02:24.090> tore<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.900> volcanic<00:02:25.680> field<00:02:25.890> into<00:02:26.370> so

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
it tore the volcanic field into so

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.330 
it tore the volcanic field into so
millions<00:02:27.269> of<00:02:27.480> years<00:02:27.750> later<00:02:28.049> you<00:02:28.380> have<00:02:28.709> what<00:02:29.310> we

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
millions of years later you have what we

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.520 
millions of years later you have what we

formation part of it is up here the
other<00:02:42.150> half<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.900> near<00:02:43.410> Lancaster<00:02:43.889> California

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
other half is near Lancaster California

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.150 
other half is near Lancaster California
and<00:02:45.359> it's<00:02:45.510> known<00:02:45.720> as<00:02:45.930> an<00:02:46.139> image<00:02:46.440> formation

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
and it's known as an image formation

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.090 
and it's known as an image formation
that<00:02:47.970> part<00:02:48.450> has<00:02:48.720> been<00:02:48.930> severely<00:02:49.440> eroded<00:02:49.650> away

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
that part has been severely eroded away

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.210 
that part has been severely eroded away
and<00:02:50.630> doesn't<00:02:51.630> look<00:02:51.959> like<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.470> pinnacles<00:02:52.980> that

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
and doesn't look like the pinnacles that

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.190 
and doesn't look like the pinnacles that
we<00:02:53.340> know<00:02:53.549> today<00:02:53.910> but<00:02:54.450> yeah<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.690> could<00:02:54.959> take<00:02:55.170> a

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
we know today but yeah you could take a

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.559 
we know today but yeah you could take a
rock<00:02:55.560> from<00:02:55.829> here<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.700> put<00:02:57.209> it<00:02:57.299> side-by-side

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
rock from here and put it side-by-side

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.259 
rock from here and put it side-by-side
with<00:02:58.260> one<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.620> rocks<00:02:58.829> from<00:02:59.060> Lancaster<00:03:00.060> and

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
with one of the rocks from Lancaster and

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.629 
with one of the rocks from Lancaster and
they<00:03:00.810> would<00:03:00.959> match<00:03:01.139> yes<00:03:01.950> they<00:03:02.160> would<00:03:02.340> it's

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:02.639 
they would match yes they would it's

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.849 
they would match yes they would it's
similar<00:03:02.819> like<00:03:03.269> a<00:03:03.299> fingerprint<00:03:04.049> torn<00:03:04.680> in<00:03:04.829> half

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:04.859 
similar like a fingerprint torn in half

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:07.970 
similar like a fingerprint torn in half
you<00:03:05.730> could<00:03:05.910> get<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.389> rock<00:03:06.630> from<00:03:07.319> either<00:03:07.799> side

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
you could get the rock from either side

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.550 
you could get the rock from either side
and<00:03:08.519> they<00:03:08.850> would<00:03:09.150> be<00:03:09.540> very<00:03:09.750> similar<00:03:10.079> in

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
and they would be very similar in

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.099 
and they would be very similar in
chemical<00:03:11.519> structure<00:03:12.090> give<00:03:12.690> us<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.959> word
