00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:09.310 

okay<00:00:01.979> guys<00:00:02.190> so<00:00:05.029> using<00:00:06.049> this<00:00:07.049> I<00:00:07.820> was<00:00:08.820> able<00:00:08.970> to

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
okay guys so using this I was able to

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.270 
okay guys so using this I was able to
put<00:00:10.320> on<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:11.990> put<00:00:12.990> on<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.320> seal<00:00:13.590> such<00:00:13.920> as<00:00:14.070> that

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
put on the put on the seal such as that

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.420 
put on the put on the seal such as that
and<00:00:14.639> top<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.210> with<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.360> rubber<00:00:15.570> mallet<00:00:16.279> and<00:00:17.279> I

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
and top it with a rubber mallet and I

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.730 
and top it with a rubber mallet and I
think<00:00:17.730> it's<00:00:17.940> sealed<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:19.020> there<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.260> lot<00:00:19.470> better

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
think it's sealed in there a lot better

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.990 
think it's sealed in there a lot better
it's<00:00:20.010> nice<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.820> flush<00:00:21.060> around<00:00:21.510> here<00:00:22.970> like<00:00:23.970> I

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
it's nice and flush around here like I

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.160 
it's nice and flush around here like I
got<00:00:24.240> no<00:00:24.390> lip<00:00:24.630> it's<00:00:24.840> it's<00:00:26.029> some<00:00:27.029> key<00:00:27.210> and<00:00:27.330> just<00:00:27.510> a

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
got no lip it's it's some key and just a

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.479 
got no lip it's it's some key and just a
fraction<00:00:29.070> there<00:00:31.640> feels<00:00:32.640> pretty<00:00:32.910> smooth<00:00:34.489> what

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
fraction there feels pretty smooth what

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.160 
fraction there feels pretty smooth what
I'm<00:00:35.610> concerned<00:00:36.030> about<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:38.239> whilst<00:00:39.239> pushing<00:00:39.809> it

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
I'm concerned about is whilst pushing it

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.660 
I'm concerned about is whilst pushing it
in<00:00:40.910> while<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:41.940> was<00:00:42.270> pushing<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:43.340> this<00:00:44.340> little

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
in while I was pushing it in this little

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.979 
in while I was pushing it in this little
bit<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.879> rubber<00:00:45.860> peeled<00:00:46.860> away<00:00:47.660> along<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.690> edge

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
bit of rubber peeled away along the edge

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.810 
bit of rubber peeled away along the edge
here<00:00:49.760> I<00:00:50.760> pulled<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.510> out<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.960> think<00:00:52.920> what<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.670> is

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
here I pulled it out I think what it is

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.260 
here I pulled it out I think what it is
is<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.210> look<00:00:54.390> at<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.629> old<00:00:55.260> one<00:00:56.120> is<00:00:57.980> I<00:00:58.980> think<00:00:59.760> it's

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
is I look at the old one is I think it's

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.880 
is I look at the old one is I think it's
that<00:01:00.510> middle<00:01:01.320> lip<00:01:01.710> there<00:01:02.070> that<00:01:02.670> ripped<00:01:02.940> off

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
that middle lip there that ripped off

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.340 
that middle lip there that ripped off
now<00:01:04.890> my<00:01:05.820> logic<00:01:06.299> tells<00:01:06.570> me<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.900> that's<00:01:07.140> not

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
now my logic tells me that that's not

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.880 
now my logic tells me that that's not
good<00:01:08.689> I'd<00:01:09.689> like<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.049> hear<00:01:10.170> from<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.500> guys<00:01:10.650> as

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
good I'd like to hear from you guys as

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.910 
good I'd like to hear from you guys as
to<00:01:11.010> what<00:01:11.159> you<00:01:11.280> think<00:01:12.290> whether<00:01:13.290> or<00:01:13.409> not<00:01:13.619> this

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
to what you think whether or not this

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.749 
to what you think whether or not this
brand<00:01:14.280> new<00:01:14.460> seal<00:01:15.140> is<00:01:16.140> no<00:01:16.439> good<00:01:16.740> or<00:01:16.979> whether<00:01:17.580> or

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
brand new seal is no good or whether or

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.640 
brand new seal is no good or whether or
not<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.090> little<00:01:18.390> rubber<00:01:18.540> lip<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:19.320> here

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
not this little rubber lip on here

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.289 
not this little rubber lip on here
really<00:01:19.950> makes<00:01:20.340> much<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.790> difference<00:01:20.820> in

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
really makes much of a difference in

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.780 
really makes much of a difference in
terms<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.689> sealing<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.490> realized<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.610> that

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
terms of sealing I realized that that

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.340 
terms of sealing I realized that that
probably<00:01:24.180> seats<00:01:24.659> in<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.380> groove<00:01:25.740> they're

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
probably seats in that groove they're

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.020 
probably seats in that groove they're
said<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.380> provide<00:01:28.950> some<00:01:29.220> kind<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.520> seal<00:01:29.759> but

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
said to provide some kind of seal but

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.740 
said to provide some kind of seal but
with<00:01:30.570> this<00:01:30.780> ring<00:01:31.079> here<00:01:32.150> I'm<00:01:33.150> hoping<00:01:33.450> that

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
with this ring here I'm hoping that

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.190 
with this ring here I'm hoping that
would<00:01:33.900> prevent<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.409> from<00:01:34.439> popping<00:01:34.770> off<00:01:36.110> let<00:01:37.110> me

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
would prevent it from popping off let me

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.719 
would prevent it from popping off let me
know<00:01:37.290> what<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.470> guys<00:01:37.590> think<00:01:37.860> I<00:01:38.130> think<00:01:38.430> it's<00:01:38.579> in

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
know what you guys think I think it's in

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.300 
know what you guys think I think it's in
there<00:01:38.850> nice<00:01:39.030> now<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:40.140> nice<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.619> even<00:01:41.189> all

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
the way around and maybe could work in

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.690 
the way around and maybe could work in
just<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.560> little<00:01:43.590> bit<00:01:43.799> here<00:01:44.100> there's<00:01:44.310> just<00:01:44.579> a

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
want to take a closer look here

00:01:50.730 --> 00:02:02.210 
want to take a closer look here
around<00:01:51.000> see<00:01:53.840> find<00:01:54.840> her<00:02:00.140> so<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.560> right<00:02:02.160> there

around see find her so that right there

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.810 
around see find her so that right there
I'm<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.760> little<00:02:03.120> concerned<00:02:03.330> with<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:05.460> just

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
I'm a little concerned with and just

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.770 
I'm a little concerned with and just
over<00:02:06.180> here<00:02:06.480> but<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:08.150> think<00:02:09.150> it's<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.420> pretty<00:02:09.660> good

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
over here but I think it's a pretty good

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.400 
over here but I think it's a pretty good
seal<00:02:11.450> all<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.510> way<00:02:12.660> around<00:02:12.750> there<00:02:13.410> so<00:02:15.350> yeah

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
seal all the way around there so yeah

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.140 
seal all the way around there so yeah
this<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.070> what<00:02:17.220> happens<00:02:17.700> when<00:02:17.910> a<00:02:18.420> non<00:02:18.900> mechanic

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
this is what happens when a non mechanic

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.310 
this is what happens when a non mechanic
attempts<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.300> try<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.570> fix<00:02:21.870> some<00:02:22.110> of<00:02:22.230> this

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
attempts to try to fix some of this

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.650 
attempts to try to fix some of this
stuff<00:02:24.290> belt<00:02:25.290> blew<00:02:25.470> off<00:02:26.210> thought<00:02:27.210> I<00:02:27.240> could<00:02:27.480> just

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
stuff belt blew off thought I could just

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.980 
stuff belt blew off thought I could just
pull<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.930> clutches<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:29.510> fix<00:02:30.510> them<00:02:30.750> then

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
pull the clutches and fix them then

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.960 
pull the clutches and fix them then
decided<00:02:31.500> well<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:31.950> also<00:02:32.070> place<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.430> seal

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
decided well and I also place a seal

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.730 
decided well and I also place a seal
well<00:02:33.240> I've<00:02:33.390> got<00:02:33.570> them<00:02:33.780> off<00:02:33.990> because<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.560> looked

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
well I've got them off because it looked

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.820 
well I've got them off because it looked
a<00:02:34.830> little<00:02:34.950> ratty<00:02:35.310> little<00:02:35.700> old<00:02:36.440> now<00:02:37.440> I've<00:02:37.620> done

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
a little ratty little old now I've done

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.200 
a little ratty little old now I've done
that<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.280> think<00:02:38.400> I've<00:02:38.670> created<00:02:39.000> myself

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
that and I think I've created myself
