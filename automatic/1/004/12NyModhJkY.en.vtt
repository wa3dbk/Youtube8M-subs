00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:42.109 
up there it is that's a big front door

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:46.300 
up there it is that's a big front door
by<00:01:42.319> the<00:01:42.349> way<00:01:43.179> that's<00:01:44.179> what<00:01:44.450> he<00:01:44.990> said<00:01:45.099> I<00:01:46.099> don't

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
by the way that's what he said I don't

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.069 
by the way that's what he said I don't
know<00:01:46.369> but<00:01:46.609> let's<00:01:47.149> break<00:01:47.479> through<00:01:47.749> I<00:01:47.779> don't

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
know but let's break through I don't

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:49.209 
know but let's break through I don't
believe<00:01:48.259> there's<00:01:48.380> anything<00:01:48.649> on<00:01:48.799> the<00:01:48.919> inside

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
believe there's anything on the inside

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.219 
believe there's anything on the inside
there's<00:01:49.729> some<00:01:49.909> trees<00:01:50.329> it<00:01:50.569> looks<00:01:50.749> like<00:01:50.929> let's

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
there's some trees it looks like let's

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.010 
there's some trees it looks like let's
just<00:01:51.349> kind<00:01:51.439> of<00:01:51.529> break<00:01:51.889> it<00:01:52.039> yeah<00:01:52.939> as<00:01:53.240> I<00:01:53.689> figured

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
just kind of break it yeah as I figured

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.529 
just kind of break it yeah as I figured
there's<00:01:54.289> nothing<00:01:54.619> really<00:01:54.799> honey<00:01:55.130> inside<00:01:55.789> but

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
there's nothing really honey inside but

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.569 
there's nothing really honey inside but
that's<00:01:56.719> fine<00:01:56.990> because<00:01:57.049> it<00:01:57.919> is<00:01:58.039> co<00:01:58.189> all<00:01:58.219> that's

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
that's fine because it is co all that's

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:00.569 
that's fine because it is co all that's
interesting<00:01:59.029> sometimes<00:01:59.240> how<00:01:59.659> they<00:01:59.840> do<00:02:00.109> that

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:00.579 
interesting sometimes how they do that

00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:02.589 
interesting sometimes how they do that
