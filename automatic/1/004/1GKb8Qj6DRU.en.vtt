00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.629
 good night great team match and 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.519
 great match of liquidated 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.349
 It is true that I have already commented 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.210
 that I personally have left 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.420
 things well but it is difficult if it is not with 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.039
 the help of colleagues can take 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.150
 at your best moment of your career 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.850
 good sports is clear 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.820
 that I am not conformist and always always 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.619
 I try to go to Asia more but good 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.900
 knowing also that there are things there 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.820
 to fix but good as long as it 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.340
 alive at times like this is important for 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.629
 a soccer player because it gives you confidence 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.250
 to continue working and continue 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.440
 improving already let's finish with the 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.540
 personal aspect defends attacks today from 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.120
 right lateral has ended afterwards by 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:47.000
 in front of coke assist goals what 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.320
 you have everything good it's clear that 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.910
 that I have said many times that 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.950
 lateral is not my position I try 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.080
 do try to do the best 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.620
 and you can see that sometimes good in 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.390
 very very specific band players 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.309
 Maybe it's a bit difficult for me to defend 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.559
 but hey, he always said that it is 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.960
 is to work it is to try to improve each 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.440
 day but good as long as you get better with 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.790
 good results and with good ones and with 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.500
 good personal things then good 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.420
 it's always better I think I'm not going to 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.020
 be very exaggerated has been in the box 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.750
 Vicente from the forest that tells you that is 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.000
 Clearly that as a coach because he 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.119
 will like to see the matches of the 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.130
 Spanish teams that we are in 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.229
 I imagine that I would also be 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.090
 yesterday in the field watching watching the 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.520
 barÃ§a match good I said 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.470
 many times I do not play to be 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.479
 international it is clear that it is a dream 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.520
 for all the players I try 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.190
 do the work in the field and if at 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.030
 Finally, the one who is the boss 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.770
 I think I deserve it 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.230
 I'm calm because I already say that I 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.660
 I always try to focus on mine and 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.760
 end all the rewards that are my 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.310
 if it is that then they are more special 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.280
 we change the third to 90 minutes of 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.830
 dream of warsaw we knew we were going to 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.890
 be complicated nine players cities 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.780
 consecutive is not available to all 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.780
 we have been doing a year 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.300
 things things very well and good is 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.820
 Of course we are going to fight for to 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.980
 to arrive and good to give a joy to all 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.620
 and ourselves last because 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.650
 the bus leaves although the hostel 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.680
 It's close and we're still talking about 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.180
 team but also from the hobby you 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.650
 you enjoy a lot when you play here in 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.230
 home with the hobby what today has been 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.610
 spectacular 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.070
 the truth that 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.280
 I really do not know what 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.490
 words to put to the hobby because 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.000
 because, well 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.420
 I think it goes beyond the adjectives 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.850
 that can be put to them to go not 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.310
 It is clear that every day they demonstrate and 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.170
 they surprise more the support they have 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.640
 that have the soccer players and us 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.140
 in the only way that we can only 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.420
 rewarding is how we are doing 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.740
 and I hope that in the end, well, as I have 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.540
 said we can take a weakness 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.640
 all together that I think they deserve it 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.860

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.120
