welcome back sethbling here in front of

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.579 
welcome back sethbling here in front of
me<00:00:02.550> I've<00:00:02.850> got<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.419> block<00:00:03.720> dispenser<00:00:04.350> it

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
me I've got a block dispenser it

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.680 
me I've got a block dispenser it
dispenses<00:00:05.130> blocks<00:00:05.460> in<00:00:05.759> this<00:00:05.850> case<00:00:06.089> the<00:00:06.509> block

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
dispenses blocks in this case the block

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.830 
dispenses blocks in this case the block
is<00:00:06.899> TNT<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.820> this<00:00:08.820> one<00:00:09.030> is<00:00:09.240> infinitely

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
is TNT and this one is infinitely

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.560 
is TNT and this one is infinitely
expandable<00:00:10.260> you<00:00:10.830> can<00:00:11.010> have<00:00:11.580> as<00:00:11.759> many<00:00:11.940> blocks

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
expandable you can have as many blocks

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.930 
expandable you can have as many blocks
as<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.870> want<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.290> dispenser<00:00:13.799> and<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.790> will

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
as you want the dispenser and it will

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.570 
as you want the dispenser and it will
keep<00:00:15.210> providing<00:00:15.509> until<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:15.960> runs<00:00:16.080> out<00:00:16.460> so<00:00:17.460> let

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
keep providing until it runs out so let

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.000 
keep providing until it runs out so let
me<00:00:17.640> show<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:17.850> when<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.660> push<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.990> button<00:00:19.020> it

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
me show you when I push the button it

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.880 
me show you when I push the button it
pushes<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> TNT<00:00:20.820> into<00:00:21.119> place<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.689> then<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:22.230> TNT

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
pushes a TNT into place and then the TNT

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.340 
pushes a TNT into place and then the TNT
gets<00:00:23.100> ignited<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.760> drops<00:00:24.000> down<00:00:24.199> if<00:00:25.199> you

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
gets ignited and it drops down if you

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.300 
gets ignited and it drops down if you
watch<00:00:25.500> again<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.099> push<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.970> button<00:00:27.439> a<00:00:28.439> distance

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
watch again I push the button a distance

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.659 
watch again I push the button a distance
sort<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.580> sneak<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.119> TNT<00:00:30.539> around<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.669> it

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
sort of sneak the TNT around so that it

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.090 
sort of sneak the TNT around so that it
pushes<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.540> so<00:00:33.750> that<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.410> keep<00:00:34.649> getting<00:00:34.860> a

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
pushes it so that we keep getting a

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.940 
pushes it so that we keep getting a
supply<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.610> TNT<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.360> what<00:00:37.200> allows<00:00:37.320> us<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.739> do

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
supply of TNT and what allows us to do

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.160 
supply of TNT and what allows us to do
that<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.790> there's<00:00:39.059> gravel<00:00:39.540> over<00:00:39.629> here

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
that is that there's gravel over here

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.860 
that is that there's gravel over here
that<00:00:40.410> keeps<00:00:40.620> getting<00:00:40.890> pushed<00:00:41.070> into<00:00:41.190> place

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
that keeps getting pushed into place

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.680 
that keeps getting pushed into place
every<00:00:42.870> time<00:00:43.050> that<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.379> push<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> button<00:00:44.489> so<00:00:45.390> it

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
every time that I push the button so it

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.650 
every time that I push the button so it
kind<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:45.989> fills<00:00:46.320> in<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.770> snake<00:00:47.399> so<00:00:48.180> that

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
kind of fills in the snake so that

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.470 
kind of fills in the snake so that
there's<00:00:49.649> always<00:00:49.820> something<00:00:50.820> for<00:00:51.180> each<00:00:51.210> piston

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
there's always something for each piston

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.760 
there's always something for each piston
to<00:00:51.719> push<00:00:51.860> so<00:00:53.420> the<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.930> thing<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.379> makes<00:00:55.620> this

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
to push so the the thing that makes this

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.869 
to push so the the thing that makes this
infinitely<00:00:56.550> expandable<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:59.670> could

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
infinitely expandable is that you could

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.630 
infinitely expandable is that you could
use<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> single<00:01:00.480> column<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.050> gravel<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.489> that

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
use a single column of gravel but that

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.270 
use a single column of gravel but that
would<00:01:02.730> only<00:01:02.820> allow<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.390> have<00:01:03.860> 128<00:01:04.860> or<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
would only allow you to have 128 or a

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.679 
would only allow you to have 128 or a
little<00:01:05.549> bit<00:01:05.640> less<00:01:05.790> than<00:01:05.970> that

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
little bit less than that

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.960 
little bit less than that
maximum<00:01:07.500> blocks<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.040> dispenser<00:01:08.549> because

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
maximum blocks in the dispenser because

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.440 
maximum blocks in the dispenser because
once<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.659> single<00:01:09.990> pallet<00:01:10.320> runs<00:01:10.470> out<00:01:11.180> you'd<00:01:12.180> be

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
once the single pallet runs out you'd be

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.630 
once the single pallet runs out you'd be
you'd<00:01:13.200> be<00:01:13.320> screwed<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:13.920> what<00:01:14.310> I've<00:01:14.400> got<00:01:14.430> here

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
you'd be screwed so what I've got here

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.190 
you'd be screwed so what I've got here
is<00:01:16.400> several<00:01:17.400> different<00:01:17.880> piles<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.450> basically

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
is several different piles and basically

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
is several different piles and basically
every<00:01:19.530> time<00:01:19.850> one<00:01:20.850> pile<00:01:21.060> runs<00:01:21.390> out<00:01:22.040> or<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.130> about

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
every time one pile runs out or is about

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.270 
every time one pile runs out or is about
to<00:01:23.430> run<00:01:23.549> out<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.240> for<00:01:24.390> instance<00:01:24.979> well<00:01:25.979> okay<00:01:26.220> so

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
to run out so for instance well okay so

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.010 
to run out so for instance well okay so
when<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:26.520> push<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.880> button<00:01:27.180> it<00:01:27.479> activates<00:01:27.659> this

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
when I push the button it activates this

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.210 
when I push the button it activates this
monostable<00:01:28.439> circuit<00:01:29.390> which<00:01:30.390> just<00:01:31.189> sends<00:01:32.189> a

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
monostable circuit which just sends a

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.980 
monostable circuit which just sends a
pulse<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.700> all<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.180> Pistons<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.750> are

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
pulse to all of the Pistons that are

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.289 
pulse to all of the Pistons that are
here<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:35.130> also<00:01:35.250> triggers<00:01:35.729> all<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.119> the

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
here and it also triggers all of the

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.740 
here and it also triggers all of the
Pistons<00:01:36.750> in<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.900> snake<00:01:37.759> but<00:01:38.759> it'll<00:01:39.420> trigger

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
Pistons in the snake but it'll trigger

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.960 
Pistons in the snake but it'll trigger
them<00:01:39.930> all<00:01:40.020> simultaneously<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:41.009> if<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.670> push<00:01:41.850> one

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
them all simultaneously so if I push one

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.600 
them all simultaneously so if I push one
more<00:01:42.180> time<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:43.079> will<00:01:43.200> use<00:01:43.409> up<00:01:43.710> another<00:01:44.130> gravel

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
more time it will use up another gravel

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.710 
more time it will use up another gravel
from<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:45.180> pile<00:01:46.880> but<00:01:47.880> now<00:01:48.090> each<00:01:48.299> time<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.659> I

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
from this pile but now each time that I

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.020 
from this pile but now each time that I
push<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.049> button<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:50.340> going<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.700> trigger

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
push the button it's going to trigger

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.690 
push the button it's going to trigger
this<00:01:51.899> piston<00:01:52.380> also<00:01:52.740> which<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.070> going<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.399> have

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
this piston also which is going to have

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.310 
this piston also which is going to have
it<00:01:53.850> push<00:01:54.119> all<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.360> blocks<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.079> pile

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
it push all the blocks so that this pile

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.630 
it push all the blocks so that this pile
will<00:01:55.590> run<00:01:55.890> out<00:01:56.070> until<00:01:56.450> this<00:01:57.450> paddles<00:01:57.899> run<00:01:58.079> out

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
will run out until this paddles run out

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.940 
will run out until this paddles run out
and<00:01:59.640> then<00:01:59.850> after<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.360> pile<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.600> run<00:02:00.840> out<00:02:00.990> this

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
and then after this pile is run out this

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.249 
and then after this pile is run out this
will<00:02:02.100> get<00:02:02.219> one<00:02:02.430> lower<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.990> piston
