00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.160
 this place let me tell you is a 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:17.330
 extraordinary product because in addition to 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.330
 the assets that we already know 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.810
 In addition to the fiber plus the extract 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:27.240
 soy plus green tea technique 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.939
 has a gross component of Peru that 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.300
 dedicate as she with her tuber 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.900
 native of Peru and this plant has 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.559
 active in the tuber and managers in 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.559
 leaves 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.680
 and these assets have proven to be a 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.539
 type 15 lies natural who wants 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.609
 deciding province lies means 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:57.100
 in lowering blood glucose by 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:59.680
 that reason all the people who are 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.019
 fond of consuming carbohydrates what 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:06.820
 they use but they also use it well 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:08.710
 diabetics evidently do notice 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.009
 this function contains 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.630
 if the Hindu lina that is fiber that by 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.850
 example we had said that it has effect 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.700
 of drag helps me eliminate the 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.840
 excess sugar helps you eliminate the 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.920
 excess blood fat if it improves 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.740
 the pace of devastation 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.990
 intestinal is combined with the 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.210
 phytosterols that are present in the 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.990
 soy extract bit sterols are 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.509
 a component that are very similar very 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.860
 similar to cholesterol cholesterol 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.620
 animal origin to which it comes for example 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.740
 with red meat 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:46.890
 it is said that the phytosterols that do 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.460
 they are fixed to the receivers and they determine 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.160
 the absorption of the cholesterol coming 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.909
 of the animal race and that way they avoid 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.299
 what 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.740
 the cholesterol of animal origin that comes 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.929
 in the diet has been absorbed 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.939
 completely there is a percentage this 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.240
 cholesterol that is not going to absolve from 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.490
 that way cholesterol is reduced 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.850
 blood 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.030
 and good the green tea that is a burning 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.349
 also natural fat 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.230
 recommended for people with problems 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:22.920
 in the metabolism of sugar green tea 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.930
 has this ability scientifically 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.299
 proven in different studies this 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.569
 study we liked if it increases the 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:32.640
 thermogenesis not at 43% in other words 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.260
 helps me burn calories what 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.700
 recommend diabetics because one of 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.159
 the concomitant problems with the 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.069
 diabetes or upside down one of the problems 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:42.680
 concomitant with obesity is the 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.849
 diabetes and with diabetes obesity 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.760
 then this one burns fat like tea 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:50.239
 green is important but the heart of 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.400
 This product is yacon as 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:56.250
 Natural hypoglycemic helps me 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.870
 natural way to reduce levels of 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.239
 sugar 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.819

 and
