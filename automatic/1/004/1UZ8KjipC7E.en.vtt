think<00:01:45.590> a<00:01:46.010> lot<00:01:46.520> of<00:01:46.550> what<00:01:46.760> they<00:01:46.880> did<00:01:47.210> with

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
think a lot of what they did with

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.050 
think a lot of what they did with
instrumentals<00:01:48.320> on<00:01:48.470> these<00:01:48.650> songs<00:01:48.890> just<00:01:49.400> were

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
instrumentals on these songs just were

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.420 
instrumentals on these songs just were
very<00:01:50.360> lackluster<00:01:50.659> compared<00:01:51.650> to<00:01:51.830> their<00:01:52.130> past

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
very lackluster compared to their past

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.570

two albums I'm definitely a fan of some

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.370

attack<00:02:02.960> and<00:02:03.200> release<00:02:03.490> but<00:02:04.490> this<00:02:05.150> record<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:05.720> me

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
attack and release but this record to me

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.039 
attack and release but this record to me
just<00:02:06.260> does<00:02:06.650> not<00:02:06.830> feel<00:02:07.250> like<00:02:07.640> the<00:02:08.509> Black<00:02:08.720> Keys

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
just does not feel like the Black Keys

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:11.350 
just does not feel like the Black Keys
it<00:02:09.379> feels<00:02:09.560> like<00:02:09.799> more<00:02:10.099> of<00:02:10.129> an<00:02:10.280> identity<00:02:10.729> crisis

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
it feels like more of an identity crisis

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.199 
it feels like more of an identity crisis
um<00:02:11.659> there<00:02:12.409> are<00:02:12.590> some<00:02:12.980> really<00:02:13.130> solid<00:02:13.400> tracks<00:02:13.850> on

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
um there are some really solid tracks on

um there are some really solid tracks on
this<00:02:14.390> record

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
this record

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.510 
this record
of<00:02:15.959> course<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.349> got<00:02:16.470> my<00:02:16.620> criticisms<00:02:17.190> out<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.459> the

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
of course I got my criticisms out of the

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.940 
of course I got my criticisms out of the
way<00:02:17.640> first<00:02:18.090> weight<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.959> love<00:02:19.170> really<00:02:19.560> kicks

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
way first weight of love really kicks

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.790 
way first weight of love really kicks
off<00:02:20.130> this<00:02:20.370> record<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.380> non-typical<00:02:22.380> Black

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
off this record and non-typical Black

Keys fashion doing a song with six

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.750 
Keys fashion doing a song with six
minutes<00:02:25.170> long<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.650> pretty<00:02:25.860> much<00:02:26.010> unheard<00:02:26.580> of

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
minutes long is pretty much unheard of

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.240 
minutes long is pretty much unheard of
in<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.180> Black<00:02:27.360> Keys<00:02:27.630> book<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.890> think<00:02:29.130> it

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
in the Black Keys book and I think it

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.100 
in the Black Keys book and I think it
was<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.400> really<00:02:29.670> cool<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.360> interesting<00:02:30.510> way<00:02:31.050> to

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
was a really cool and interesting way to

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.890 
was a really cool and interesting way to
get<00:02:31.650> like<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.890> vibe<00:02:32.280> going<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:33.000> groove<00:02:33.360> with<00:02:33.690> the

get like a vibe going to groove with the
record<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.980> was<00:02:35.400> excited<00:02:35.760> for<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.150> record

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
record and I was excited for the record

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.140 
record and I was excited for the record
it<00:02:36.840> has<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.319> really<00:02:37.560> cool<00:02:37.650> long<00:02:38.250> instrumental<00:02:39.120> a

it has a really cool long instrumental a
lot<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.569> guitar<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:40.680> feels<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:41.069> little<00:02:41.190> bit

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
lot of guitar it feels a little bit

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.640 
lot of guitar it feels a little bit
bluesy<00:02:41.910> a<00:02:41.940> little<00:02:42.390> bit<00:02:42.510> like<00:02:42.780> homage<00:02:43.319> to<00:02:43.350> their

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
bluesy a little bit like homage to their

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.309 
bluesy a little bit like homage to their
roots<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.489> same<00:02:44.730> with<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.120> track<00:02:45.390> in<00:02:45.690> time

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
roots the same with the track in time

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.229 
roots the same with the track in time
the<00:02:46.739> first<00:02:46.890> two<00:02:47.160> tracks<00:02:47.430> started<00:02:47.880> things<00:02:48.090> off

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
the first two tracks started things off

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.570 
the first two tracks started things off
right<00:02:48.690> but<00:02:49.319> then<00:02:49.500> we<00:02:49.680> get<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:50.010> know<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.310> track

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
right but then we get to know the track

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.930 
right but then we get to know the track
turning<00:02:51.390> blue<00:02:51.840> which<00:02:52.620> is<00:02:52.800> probably<00:02:53.370> my<00:02:53.610> least

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
turning blue which is probably my least

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.699 
turning blue which is probably my least
favorite<00:02:54.480> on<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.780> entire<00:02:55.080> record

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
favorite on the entire record

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.550 
favorite on the entire record
it's<00:02:56.069> very<00:02:56.370> psychedelic<00:02:57.209> very<00:02:57.750> far<00:02:58.019> out<00:02:58.260> there

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
it's very psychedelic very far out there

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.320 
it's very psychedelic very far out there
and<00:02:58.980> it's<00:02:59.220> not<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.549> worst<00:02:59.850> thing<00:03:00.120> I've<00:03:00.299> ever

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
and it's not the worst thing I've ever

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.710 
and it's not the worst thing I've ever
heard<00:03:00.810> but<00:03:01.140> it's<00:03:01.560> just<00:03:01.890> very<00:03:02.400> very<00:03:02.700> bland<00:03:03.420> and

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
heard but it's just very very bland and

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.530 
heard but it's just very very bland and
mediocre<00:03:03.989> for<00:03:04.590> the<00:03:04.650> Black<00:03:05.430> Keys<00:03:05.819> they<00:03:06.360> have

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
mediocre for the Black Keys they have

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.080 
mediocre for the Black Keys they have
such<00:03:06.840> I<00:03:07.560> have<00:03:07.830> such<00:03:08.130> high<00:03:08.340> standards<00:03:08.790> for<00:03:08.910> what

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
such I have such high standards for what

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.210 
such I have such high standards for what
I<00:03:09.180> expect<00:03:09.600> when<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:09.810> hear<00:03:10.110> something<00:03:10.650> from<00:03:10.950> them

I expect when I hear something from them

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.650 
I expect when I hear something from them
and<00:03:11.549> just<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:11.970> way<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.269> they've<00:03:12.420> done

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
and just the way that they've done

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.110 
and just the way that they've done
production<00:03:13.650> on<00:03:13.799> their<00:03:13.950> past<00:03:14.190> stuff<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:14.850> know

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
I just feel like this time around it

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:25.849 
I just feel like this time around it
just<00:03:24.299> did<00:03:24.690> not<00:03:24.870> get<00:03:25.079> highlighted<00:03:25.739> as

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
just did not get highlighted as

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:28.880 
just did not get highlighted as
prominently<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.940> wasn't<00:03:27.329> displayed<00:03:27.900> in<00:03:28.260> full

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.460 
prominently it wasn't displayed in full
effort<00:03:29.340> what<00:03:29.640> they<00:03:29.760> can<00:03:29.910> actually<00:03:30.150> do<00:03:30.660> bullet

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
effort what they can actually do bullet

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.410 
effort what they can actually do bullet
in<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:31.650> brain<00:03:31.799> was<00:03:32.220> another<00:03:32.459> standout<00:03:33.090> track

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
in the brain was another standout track

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.289 
in the brain was another standout track
for<00:03:33.690> me<00:03:33.840> I<00:03:34.070> really<00:03:35.070> like<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.400> guitars<00:03:35.760> mixed

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
for me I really like the guitars mixed

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.210 
for me I really like the guitars mixed
with<00:03:36.510> some<00:03:37.079> synthesizers<00:03:37.859> there<00:03:38.040> in<00:03:38.130> the

that is one of the strongest on the

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.410 
that is one of the strongest on the
record<00:03:42.840> I<00:03:43.290> first<00:03:44.220> heard<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.579> live<00:03:44.850> performance

of<00:03:45.600> it<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:45.959> it<00:03:46.380> seemed<00:03:46.769> a<00:03:46.859> little<00:03:46.950> bit<00:03:47.160> more

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
of it and it seemed a little bit more

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.069 
of it and it seemed a little bit more
sympathy<00:03:47.850> there<00:03:48.060> on<00:03:48.209> that<00:03:48.359> one<00:03:48.540> but<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:48.870> seems

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
sympathy there on that one but it seems

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.020 
sympathy there on that one but it seems
a<00:03:49.170> little<00:03:49.260> bit<00:03:49.500> more<00:03:49.530> good<00:03:49.829> guitar<00:03:50.310> led<00:03:50.579> on<00:03:50.880> the

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
a little bit more good guitar led on the

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:52.550 
a little bit more good guitar led on the
actual<00:03:51.420> album<00:03:51.660> so<00:03:52.019> I<00:03:52.109> thought<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.440> was

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
actual album so I thought that was

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.930

are<00:05:15.710> in<00:05:15.740> there<00:05:16.040> I<00:05:16.310> mean<00:05:16.580> there's<00:05:16.820> so<00:05:17.030> many

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
are in there I mean there's so many

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.730 
are in there I mean there's so many
other<00:05:17.390> things<00:05:17.720> that<00:05:17.930> they've<00:05:18.050> kind<00:05:18.169> of<00:05:18.290> had<00:05:18.350> in

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
other things that they've kind of had in

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.200 
other things that they've kind of had in
there<00:05:18.890> to<00:05:19.070> try<00:05:19.250> to<00:05:19.310> go<00:05:19.460> for<00:05:19.490> this<00:05:19.760> psychedelic

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
there to try to go for this psychedelic

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.970 
there to try to go for this psychedelic
feel<00:05:20.840> you<00:05:21.230> think<00:05:21.410> it's<00:05:21.530> too<00:05:21.710> much

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
feel you think it's too much

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.490 
feel you think it's too much
um<00:05:22.280> I<00:05:22.760> would<00:05:23.300> say<00:05:23.450> it's<00:05:23.630> too<00:05:23.810> much<00:05:23.990> mostly

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
um I would say it's too much mostly

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.710 
um I would say it's too much mostly
because<00:05:25.990> well<00:05:26.990> it's<00:05:27.290> on<00:05:27.530> every<00:05:28.010> track<00:05:28.370> and<00:05:29.270> it

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
because well it's on every track and it

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.600 
because well it's on every track and it
kinda<00:05:30.110> is<00:05:30.200> repetitive<00:05:30.560> I<00:05:30.950> think<00:05:31.190> the<00:05:31.280> album

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
kinda is repetitive I think the album

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.760 
kinda is repetitive I think the album
really<00:05:31.850> doesn't<00:05:32.300> tend<00:05:32.540> to<00:05:32.660> drag<00:05:32.960> I<00:05:33.290> mean<00:05:33.530> like

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:33.770 
really doesn't tend to drag I mean like

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:35.800 
really doesn't tend to drag I mean like
like<00:05:34.640> I'm<00:05:34.820> me<00:05:34.970> and<00:05:35.000> Tyler<00:05:35.210> were<00:05:35.419> even<00:05:35.660> talking

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
like I'm me and Tyler were even talking

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.240 
like I'm me and Tyler were even talking
before<00:05:36.260> this<00:05:36.440> and<00:05:36.650> we<00:05:36.740> were<00:05:36.830> supposed<00:05:37.190> to

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
before this and we were supposed to

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.580 
before this and we were supposed to
greeing<00:05:38.180> that<00:05:38.450> the<00:05:38.540> album<00:05:38.840> just<00:05:39.050> kind<00:05:39.320> of<00:05:39.410> as<00:05:39.560> a

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590 
greeing that the album just kind of as a

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:42.130 
greeing that the album just kind of as a
whole<00:05:39.830> feels<00:05:40.130> boring<00:05:40.520> you<00:05:41.150> know<00:05:41.180> to<00:05:41.870> really

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
whole feels boring you know to really

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:45.650 
you feel about it like most of the

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.380 
you feel about it like most of the
tracks<00:05:45.950> I<00:05:46.130> mean<00:05:46.250> it<00:05:46.370> opens<00:05:46.729> up<00:05:46.880> good<00:05:47.150> with
