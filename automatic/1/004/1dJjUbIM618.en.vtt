teaching you guys how to mix and color
match<00:00:20.189> a<00:00:20.400> matte<00:00:21.029> finish<00:00:21.439> so<00:00:22.439> we're<00:00:22.560> going<00:00:22.650> to

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
match a matte finish so we're going to

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.740 
match a matte finish so we're going to
start<00:00:23.039> off<00:00:23.220> with<00:00:23.490> our<00:00:23.519> flattening<00:00:24.269> binder

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
start off with our flattening binder

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.650 
start off with our flattening binder
here<00:00:25.019> this<00:00:25.740> instance<00:00:26.250> I'm<00:00:26.460> using<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:27.269> crow

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
here this instance I'm using the crow

Maxx brand au 175 make sure you always
give<00:00:31.289> it<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.439> really<00:00:31.769> good<00:00:31.920> stir<00:00:31.980> because<00:00:32.489> it

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
give it a really good stir because it

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.520 
give it a really good stir because it
seems<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.300> settle<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.840> bottom<00:00:33.960> there's<00:00:34.469> a

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
seems to settle to the bottom there's a

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.500 
seems to settle to the bottom there's a
lot<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.829> powder<00:00:35.100> that<00:00:35.430> seems<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:35.910> go<00:00:36.090> down<00:00:36.120> to

lot of powder that seems to go down to

lot of powder that seems to go down to
the<00:00:36.630> bottom<00:00:36.809> if<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.200> don't<00:00:37.440> stare<00:00:37.739> that

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
the bottom if you don't stare that

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.920 
the bottom if you don't stare that
property<00:00:38.280> you'll<00:00:38.399> actually<00:00:38.550> be<00:00:38.850> changing<00:00:39.420> not

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
property you'll actually be changing not

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.170 
property you'll actually be changing not
just<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.590> color<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.399> you're<00:00:41.489> doing<00:00:41.760> now<00:00:41.940> but

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
just the color that you're doing now but

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.700 
just the color that you're doing now but
the<00:00:42.300> future<00:00:42.480> colors<00:00:42.960> once<00:00:43.200> you've<00:00:43.350> got<00:00:43.559> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
the future colors once you've got the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.619 
the future colors once you've got the
flattening<00:00:44.250> Viners<00:00:44.730> stirred<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.390> got<00:00:45.600> to

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
flattening Viners stirred up you got to

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.350 
flattening Viners stirred up you got to
decide<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.559> level<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.340> flatness<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.239> you're

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
decide the level of flatness that you're

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.690 
decide the level of flatness that you're
looking<00:00:48.719> for<00:00:48.989> so<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> rule<00:00:50.039> of<00:00:50.250> thumb<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.520> I

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
looking for so a rule of thumb that I

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.290 
looking for so a rule of thumb that I
usually<00:00:50.969> use<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.840> 40%<00:00:52.770> flattening<00:00:53.579> bonded<00:00:54.059> to

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
usually use is 40% flattening bonded to

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.110 
usually use is 40% flattening bonded to
60%<00:00:54.809> clear<00:00:55.410> will<00:00:55.680> give<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.370> semi-gloss

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
60% clear will give you a semi-gloss

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.610 
60% clear will give you a semi-gloss
finish<00:00:58.129> 60%<00:00:59.129> flattening<00:01:00.090> binder<00:01:00.510> to<00:01:00.750> 40%

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.539 
finish 60% flattening binder to 40%
clear<00:01:01.980> will<00:01:02.399> give<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:03.000> satin<00:01:03.750> finish<00:01:03.989> and

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
clear will give you a satin finish and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.260

75% flattening binder to 25% clear will

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.600 
75% flattening binder to 25% clear will
give<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.630> full<00:01:10.200> matte<00:01:10.470> finish<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.070> also<00:01:11.280> like

give you a full matte finish I also like

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.580 
give you a full matte finish I also like
to<00:01:11.640> mix<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.060> up<00:01:12.119> by<00:01:12.330> volume<00:01:12.810> not<00:01:13.049> by<00:01:13.290> weight<00:01:13.560> so

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
to mix it up by volume not by weight so

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.039 
to mix it up by volume not by weight so
for<00:01:14.159> instance<00:01:14.549> if<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.880> was<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.180> mix<00:01:15.420> up<00:01:15.630> four

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
for instance if I was to mix up four

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.550 
for instance if I was to mix up four
litres<00:01:16.530> of<00:01:16.740> flat<00:01:17.430> clear<00:01:17.850> I'd<00:01:18.119> be<00:01:18.570> putting<00:01:18.930> 3

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
litres of flat clear I'd be putting 3

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.760 
litres of flat clear I'd be putting 3
litres<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.250> flattening<00:01:21.180> binder<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:22.350> 1

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
litres of flattening binder in to 1

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.170 
litres of flattening binder in to 1
litre<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.340> clear<00:01:24.119> not<00:01:24.659> 3<00:01:25.200> kilograms<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.700> 1

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
litre of clear not 3 kilograms to 1

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.910 
litre of clear not 3 kilograms to 1
kilogram<00:01:27.540> because<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.200> flattening<00:01:28.560> binder

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
kilogram because the flattening binder

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.770 
kilogram because the flattening binder
is<00:01:29.070> heavier<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.729> you'll<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:30.060> end<00:01:30.299> up<00:01:30.509> with

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
is heavier and you'll just end up with

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.410 
is heavier and you'll just end up with
funny<00:01:31.170> amounts<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.040> paint<00:01:32.430> left<00:01:32.790> at<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.270> end

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
funny amounts of paint left at the end

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.420 
funny amounts of paint left at the end
but<00:01:33.720> look<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.140> really<00:01:34.439> doesn't<00:01:35.009> matter<00:01:35.130> as

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
but look it really doesn't matter as

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.480 
but look it really doesn't matter as
long<00:01:35.490> as<00:01:35.759> you<00:01:36.090> get<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.659> desired<00:01:37.470> flatness<00:01:38.280> and

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
long as you get the desired flatness and

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.060 
long as you get the desired flatness and
the<00:01:38.960> finish<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.170> you're<00:01:40.290> looking<00:01:40.770> for<00:01:40.979> it

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
the finish that you're looking for it

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.679 
the finish that you're looking for it
really<00:01:41.220> doesn't<00:01:41.610> matter<00:01:41.670> how<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.000> mix<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.570> up

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
really doesn't matter how you mix it up

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.270 
really doesn't matter how you mix it up
as<00:01:42.840> long<00:01:43.049> as<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.320> know<00:01:43.500> what<00:01:43.710> you've<00:01:43.860> done<00:01:44.100> to

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
as long as you know what you've done to

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.980 
as long as you know what you've done to
reproduce<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.390> for<00:01:45.570> this<00:01:45.659> video<00:01:45.810> I'll

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
reproduce that so for this video I'll

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.840 
reproduce that so for this video I'll
just<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.350> showing<00:01:46.649> you<00:01:46.829> guys<00:01:46.979> one<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
just be showing you guys one of the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.120 
just be showing you guys one of the
mixes<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.540> I've<00:01:48.659> done<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.590> mixture

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
mixes that I've done and this mixture

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.240 
mixes that I've done and this mixture
here<00:01:50.369> was<00:01:50.579> 60%<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.689> wasn't<00:01:52.290> quite<00:01:52.560> sure<00:01:52.619> how<00:01:52.950> it

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
here was 60% I wasn't quite sure how it

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.310 
here was 60% I wasn't quite sure how it
was<00:01:53.399> going<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.820> come<00:01:54.060> out<00:01:54.119> so<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.570> did<00:01:54.810> one<00:01:55.020> and

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
was going to come out so I did one and

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.260 
was going to come out so I did one and
then<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.530> did<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.770> couple<00:01:56.009> more<00:01:56.340> sprouts<00:01:56.909> later

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
then I did a couple more sprouts later

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.359 
then I did a couple more sprouts later
on<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.630> I'll<00:01:57.719> show<00:01:57.930> you<00:01:57.990> all<00:01:58.110> those<00:01:58.590> 3<00:01:58.979> spray

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
on and I'll show you all those 3 spray

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.889 
on and I'll show you all those 3 spray
outs<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.820> I've<00:01:59.939> got<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.329> you'll<00:02:00.509> be<00:02:00.630> able<00:02:00.750> to

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
outs that I've got so you'll be able to

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.130 
outs that I've got so you'll be able to
see<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.680> difference<00:02:02.159> in<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.759> overall<00:02:03.540> finish

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
see the difference in the overall finish

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.900 
see the difference in the overall finish
from<00:02:04.799> 40<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.909> 60<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.750> 75%<00:02:07.489> flattening<00:02:08.489> binder

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
from 40 to 60 to 75% flattening binder

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.639 
from 40 to 60 to 75% flattening binder
so<00:02:09.060> once<00:02:09.270> you've<00:02:09.420> mixed<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.840> up<00:02:09.929> you<00:02:10.140> still<00:02:10.470> go

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
so once you've mixed it up you still go

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.040 
so once you've mixed it up you still go
put<00:02:10.920> your<00:02:11.009> harder<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.550> on

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
put your harder in on

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.740 
put your harder in on
top<00:02:12.260> so<00:02:12.740> I<00:02:13.040> always<00:02:13.220> do<00:02:13.700> that<00:02:14.000> all<00:02:14.150> those<00:02:14.420> ratios

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
top so I always do that all those ratios

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.810 
top so I always do that all those ratios
that<00:02:14.990> I<00:02:15.260> was<00:02:15.380> telling<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.830> guys<00:02:15.860> about<00:02:16.040> before

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
that I was telling you guys about before

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.810 
that I was telling you guys about before
that<00:02:17.300> was<00:02:17.510> all<00:02:17.780> pre<00:02:18.320> hardener<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.430> you

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
that was all pre hardener so you you

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.510 
that was all pre hardener so you you
make<00:02:20.060> your<00:02:20.300> batch<00:02:20.570> of<00:02:20.870> unhardened<00:02:21.830> clear<00:02:22.280> and

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
make your batch of unhardened clear and

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.580 
make your batch of unhardened clear and
then<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:23.060> put<00:02:23.300> your<00:02:23.450> hardener<00:02:23.960> to<00:02:24.140> suit<00:02:24.380> on

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
then you put your hardener to suit on

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.250 
then you put your hardener to suit on
top<00:02:24.950> in<00:02:25.640> this<00:02:25.850> instance<00:02:26.390> I'm<00:02:26.690> using<00:02:26.720> a

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
top in this instance I'm using a

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.380

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
two-to-one clear most clear as I found

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.300 
two-to-one clear most clear as I found
out<00:02:29.600> two-to-one<00:02:30.110> however<00:02:30.470> there<00:02:30.680> are<00:02:30.830> some<00:02:31.010> 5

funny<00:02:33.590> ratios<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:34.340> you'll<00:02:35.120> just<00:02:35.300> have<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.630> do

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
funny ratios and you'll just have to do

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.470 
funny ratios and you'll just have to do
some<00:02:36.020> experiments<00:02:36.710> to<00:02:36.860> find<00:02:37.100> out<00:02:37.310> exactly<00:02:37.580> how

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
some experiments to find out exactly how

some experiments to find out exactly how
that's<00:02:38.720> going<00:02:38.960> to<00:02:39.050> work<00:02:39.200> for<00:02:39.260> you<00:02:39.590> if<00:02:39.890> that's

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
that's going to work for you if that's

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.710 
that's going to work for you if that's
the<00:02:40.250> case<00:02:40.490> if<00:02:40.790> that's<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.120> kind<00:02:41.330> of<00:02:41.390> clear<00:02:41.600> that

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
the case if that's a kind of clear that

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.450 
the case if that's a kind of clear that
you're<00:02:41.840> using<00:02:42.080> I've<00:02:42.500> been<00:02:42.710> told<00:02:42.950> by<00:02:43.070> few

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
you're using I've been told by few

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.700 
you're using I've been told by few
people<00:02:43.490> that<00:02:44.180> you're<00:02:44.360> better<00:02:44.540> off<00:02:44.630> using<00:02:44.990> slow

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
people that you're better off using slow

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.650 
people that you're better off using slow
hardeners<00:02:46.250> when<00:02:46.490> you're<00:02:46.640> using<00:02:46.850> that<00:02:47.120> clears

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
hardeners when you're using that clears

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.510 
hardeners when you're using that clears
because<00:02:48.110> the<00:02:48.320> active<00:02:48.620> ingredient<00:02:49.160> in<00:02:49.340> there

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
because the active ingredient in there

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.780 
because the active ingredient in there
basically<00:02:49.820> is<00:02:50.300> talc<00:02:50.660> so<00:02:50.960> those<00:02:51.140> powders<00:02:51.790> they

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
basically is talc so those powders they

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.150 
basically is talc so those powders they
rise<00:02:53.090> to<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.450> top<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:53.900> if<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:54.710> give<00:02:54.920> it<00:02:55.040> that

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
rise to the top and if you give it that

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.620 
rise to the top and if you give it that
little<00:02:55.370> bit<00:02:55.610> longer<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:56.090> rise<00:02:56.300> to<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:56.570> top

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
little bit longer to rise to the top

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.440 
little bit longer to rise to the top
you've<00:02:56.990> got<00:02:57.170> less<00:02:57.470> chance<00:02:57.500> of<00:02:58.130> having<00:02:58.670> the

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
you've got less chance of having the

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.810 
you've got less chance of having the
color<00:03:00.020> mottle<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:00.830> you<00:03:00.890> might<00:03:01.130> think<00:03:01.430> just<00:03:01.490> a

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
color mottle so you might think just a

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.940 
color mottle so you might think just a
flat<00:03:02.240> or<00:03:02.480> matte<00:03:02.690> finishes<00:03:03.230> are<00:03:03.410> really<00:03:03.740> easy

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
flat or matte finishes are really easy

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.800 
flat or matte finishes are really easy
to<00:03:04.190> paint<00:03:04.520> because<00:03:04.910> it's<00:03:05.090> something<00:03:05.300> anyone

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
to paint because it's something anyone

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.870 
to paint because it's something anyone
can<00:03:06.080> do<00:03:06.260> just<00:03:06.470> in<00:03:06.560> their<00:03:06.740> garages<00:03:07.070> and<00:03:07.430> aerosol

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
can do just in their garages and aerosol

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.780 
can do just in their garages and aerosol
cans<00:03:08.150> to<00:03:08.780> make<00:03:08.960> it<00:03:09.140> actually<00:03:09.320> look<00:03:09.800> good<00:03:10.160> it's

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
cans to make it actually look good it's

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.940 
cans to make it actually look good it's
actually<00:03:11.330> probably<00:03:11.510> I<00:03:11.690> would<00:03:11.960> say<00:03:11.990> more

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
actually probably I would say more

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.980 
actually probably I would say more
difficult<00:03:13.550> than<00:03:13.760> painting<00:03:14.180> just<00:03:14.600> your<00:03:14.810> normal

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
difficult than painting just your normal

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.250 
difficult than painting just your normal
clear<00:03:15.470> so<00:03:15.860> they<00:03:16.340> can<00:03:16.670> model<00:03:17.360> and<00:03:17.690> you<00:03:17.810> can<00:03:18.050> get

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
clear so they can model and you can get

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.260 
clear so they can model and you can get
wet<00:03:18.470> patches<00:03:18.770> and<00:03:19.220> as<00:03:19.370> I<00:03:19.489> was<00:03:19.550> saying<00:03:19.790> before<00:03:19.940> a

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
wet patches and as I was saying before a

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.090 
wet patches and as I was saying before a
wet<00:03:20.660> patch<00:03:20.900> will<00:03:21.140> actually<00:03:21.440> be<00:03:21.590> more<00:03:21.860> glossy

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
wet patch will actually be more glossy

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.790 
wet patch will actually be more glossy
err<00:03:22.340> than<00:03:22.550> another<00:03:22.790> so<00:03:23.239> when<00:03:24.170> I<00:03:24.200> planted<00:03:24.650> this

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
err than another so when I planted this

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.880 
err than another so when I planted this
car<00:03:25.100> here<00:03:25.400> I<00:03:25.610> made<00:03:25.880> sure<00:03:26.239> that<00:03:26.270> I<00:03:26.690> bolted<00:03:27.650> all

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
car here I made sure that I bolted all

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.490 
car here I made sure that I bolted all
the<00:03:28.070> panels<00:03:28.400> up<00:03:28.640> and<00:03:28.910> that<00:03:29.750> way<00:03:29.959> I<00:03:29.989> wouldn't

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
the panels up and that way I wouldn't

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.080 
the panels up and that way I wouldn't
have<00:03:30.590> any<00:03:30.830> color<00:03:31.130> difference<00:03:31.550> from<00:03:31.730> panel<00:03:32.060> to

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
have any color difference from panel to

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.180 
have any color difference from panel to
panel<00:03:32.209> I<00:03:32.690> would<00:03:32.870> imagine<00:03:33.230> weather<00:03:33.770> would<00:03:34.010> also

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
panel I would imagine weather would also

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.020 
panel I would imagine weather would also
play<00:03:34.700> a<00:03:34.730> big<00:03:34.850> part<00:03:35.060> in<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.950> gloss<00:03:37.489> levels<00:03:37.910> as

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
play a big part in the gloss levels as

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.510 
play a big part in the gloss levels as
well<00:03:38.239> so<00:03:38.780> if<00:03:39.110> it<00:03:39.320> was<00:03:39.440> really<00:03:39.770> warm<00:03:40.010> I<00:03:40.280> probably

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
well so if it was really warm I probably

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.880 
well so if it was really warm I probably
would<00:03:40.760> be<00:03:40.910> using<00:03:41.450> the<00:03:41.720> slow<00:03:42.050> hardener<00:03:42.560> however

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
would be using the slow hardener however

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:44.590 
would be using the slow hardener however
it's<00:03:43.130> pretty<00:03:43.340> cold<00:03:43.670> here<00:03:43.820> at<00:03:43.910> the<00:03:44.030> moment<00:03:44.420> so<00:03:44.540> I

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
it's pretty cold here at the moment so I

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.270 
it's pretty cold here at the moment so I
decided<00:03:44.959> that<00:03:45.110> standard<00:03:45.650> harden<00:03:45.980> would<00:03:46.130> be

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
decided that standard harden would be

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.199 
decided that standard harden would be
all<00:03:46.520> I<00:03:46.550> needed

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
all I needed

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.060 
all I needed
look<00:03:47.480> there's<00:03:47.720> a<00:03:47.810> few<00:03:48.050> little<00:03:48.290> pluses<00:03:48.620> few

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
look there's a few little pluses few

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.860 
look there's a few little pluses few
little<00:03:49.280> miscellaneous<00:03:49.970> some<00:03:50.239> door<00:03:50.510> handles

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
little miscellaneous some door handles

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.840 
little miscellaneous some door handles
and<00:03:50.989> stuff<00:03:51.020> like<00:03:51.410> that<00:03:51.620> I<00:03:51.770> use<00:03:52.130> fly<00:03:52.400> starting

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
and stuff like that I use fly starting

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.070 
and stuff like that I use fly starting
on<00:03:52.970> it<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:53.239> that<00:03:53.390> went<00:03:53.600> fine

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 
on it and that went fine

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.560 
on it and that went fine
it's<00:03:54.380> more<00:03:54.680> so<00:03:54.950> doing<00:03:55.459> a<00:03:55.489> big<00:03:55.760> panel<00:03:56.180> it<00:03:56.330> don't

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
it's more so doing a big panel it don't

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.479 
it's more so doing a big panel it don't
want<00:03:56.780> any<00:03:56.989> uneven<00:03:57.650> patches<00:03:57.860> in<00:03:58.220> that<00:03:58.370> you'd

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
want any uneven patches in that you'd

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.520 
want any uneven patches in that you'd
want<00:03:58.730> to<00:03:58.790> use<00:03:58.940> that<00:03:59.120> slower<00:03:59.480> hardener<00:04:00.020> in<00:04:00.140> also

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
want to use that slower hardener in also

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.800 
want to use that slower hardener in also
very<00:04:00.800> important<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.430> make<00:04:01.760> sure<00:04:01.790> you<00:04:02.239> strain

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
very important to make sure you strain

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.260 
very important to make sure you strain
it<00:04:02.840> like<00:04:03.290> filters<00:04:03.920> because<00:04:04.130> I've<00:04:04.550> used<00:04:04.910> some

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
it like filters because I've used some

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.390 
it like filters because I've used some
of<00:04:05.390> the<00:04:05.480> stand-up<00:04:05.959> stuff<00:04:06.290> before<00:04:06.739> and<00:04:06.890> also

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
of the stand-up stuff before and also

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.220 
of the stand-up stuff before and also
the<00:04:07.550> glycerate<00:04:08.060> stuff<00:04:08.330> and<00:04:08.600> you<00:04:08.720> can<00:04:08.900> strain

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
the glycerate stuff and you can strain

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.110 
the glycerate stuff and you can strain
it<00:04:09.260> and<00:04:09.500> strain<00:04:09.739> it<00:04:09.890> and<00:04:10.010> strain<00:04:10.340> it<00:04:10.489> and<00:04:10.640> it

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
it and strain it and strain it and it

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.000 
it and strain it and strain it and it
always<00:04:11.420> just<00:04:11.810> ends<00:04:12.170> up<00:04:12.260> with<00:04:12.410> these<00:04:12.530> little

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
always just ends up with these little

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.710 
always just ends up with these little
high<00:04:13.190> spots<00:04:13.670> these<00:04:13.880> little<00:04:14.150> lumps<00:04:14.450> and

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
high spots these little lumps and

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.990 
high spots these little lumps and
there's<00:04:15.410> nothing<00:04:15.860> you<00:04:15.950> can<00:04:16.100> do<00:04:16.280> about<00:04:16.400> it<00:04:16.790> so

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
there's nothing you can do about it so

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.060 
there's nothing you can do about it so
this<00:04:17.239> DuPont<00:04:17.810> one<00:04:18.049> or<00:04:18.230> the<00:04:18.380> chrome<00:04:18.620> acts<00:04:18.830> are

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
this DuPont one or the chrome acts are

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.340 
this DuPont one or the chrome acts are
it<00:04:19.340> is<00:04:19.820> actually<00:04:20.359> a<00:04:20.390> good<00:04:20.660> flattening<00:04:21.109> point

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
it is actually a good flattening point

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.140 
it is actually a good flattening point
if<00:04:21.470> you're<00:04:21.590> having<00:04:21.770> troubles<00:04:22.310> maybe<00:04:22.760> just<00:04:23.000> go

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
if you're having troubles maybe just go

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.170 
if you're having troubles maybe just go
and<00:04:23.300> give<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.660> chromic<00:04:24.200> stuff<00:04:24.500> a<00:04:24.650> go

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
and give the chromic stuff a go

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.920 
and give the chromic stuff a go
175<00:04:26.169> so<00:04:26.770> you<00:04:26.889> go<00:04:27.009> there's<00:04:27.250> three<00:04:27.610> different

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
175 so you go there's three different

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.200 
175 so you go there's three different
gloss<00:04:28.930> levels<00:04:29.380> here's<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.490> Tirana<00:04:30.820> when<00:04:31.090> it's

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
gloss levels here's the Tirana when it's

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.570 
gloss levels here's the Tirana when it's
finished<00:04:31.539> off<00:04:31.720> so<00:04:31.750> that's<00:04:32.080> 75%<00:04:32.770> flattening

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
finished off so that's 75% flattening

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.680 
finished off so that's 75% flattening
binder<00:04:34.320> 25%<00:04:35.320> normal<00:04:36.160> Claire<00:04:36.490> and<00:04:37.240> then<00:04:37.449> mix

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
binder 25% normal Claire and then mix

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.779 
binder 25% normal Claire and then mix
that<00:04:37.780> it's<00:04:38.020> two<00:04:38.199> to<00:04:38.350> one<00:04:38.410> ratio<00:04:38.710> no<00:04:39.310> reducer

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
that it's two to one ratio no reducer

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:41.850 
that it's two to one ratio no reducer
required<00:04:40.240> with<00:04:40.780> standard<00:04:41.289> hardener<00:04:41.680> I'll

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
required with standard hardener I'll

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.920 
required with standard hardener I'll
make<00:04:42.070> a<00:04:42.100> quick<00:04:42.370> mention<00:04:42.580> to<00:04:43.120> just<00:04:43.449> before<00:04:43.780> we

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
make a quick mention to just before we

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.650 
make a quick mention to just before we
finish<00:04:44.169> off<00:04:44.650> that<00:04:44.979> you<00:04:45.130> can<00:04:45.160> put<00:04:45.820> flattening

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
finish off that you can put flattening

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.409 
finish off that you can put flattening
binders<00:04:47.169> into<00:04:47.710> two<00:04:48.100> case<00:04:48.370> solid<00:04:48.910> colors<00:04:49.240> as

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
binders into two case solid colors as

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:52.140 
binders into two case solid colors as
well<00:04:49.570> so<00:04:49.900> just<00:04:49.930> in<00:04:50.229> single<00:04:50.830> stages<00:04:51.340> and<00:04:51.520> I've

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
well so just in single stages and I've

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.090 
well so just in single stages and I've
included<00:04:52.780> a<00:04:53.050> little<00:04:53.289> bit<00:04:53.410> of<00:04:53.530> just<00:04:53.830> a<00:04:53.889> couple

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
included a little bit of just a couple

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.129 
included a little bit of just a couple
of<00:04:54.310> photos<00:04:54.699> at<00:04:54.970> the<00:04:55.000> very<00:04:55.330> end<00:04:55.570> here<00:04:55.780> of<00:04:55.990> a

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
of photos at the very end here of a

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.020 
of photos at the very end here of a
trailer<00:04:56.440> that<00:04:56.740> I<00:04:56.800> did<00:04:57.070> I<00:04:57.250> wouldn't<00:04:57.849> really

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
trailer that I did I wouldn't really

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.400 
trailer that I did I wouldn't really
want<00:04:58.300> to<00:04:58.419> be<00:04:58.599> going<00:04:58.870> anything<00:04:59.560> above<00:04:59.830> 40%<00:05:00.340> for

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
want to be going anything above 40% for

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.659 
want to be going anything above 40% for
you<00:05:02.410> to<00:05:02.560> okay<00:05:02.800> because<00:05:02.949> you're<00:05:03.190> going<00:05:03.370> to<00:05:03.550> be

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 
you to okay because you're going to be

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:05.999 
you to okay because you're going to be
losing<00:05:04.199> coverage<00:05:05.199> as<00:05:05.349> well<00:05:05.530> because<00:05:05.830> it's

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
losing coverage as well because it's

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:07.830 
losing coverage as well because it's
see-through<00:05:06.250> it's<00:05:06.580> obviously<00:05:06.849> clear<00:05:07.270> so

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
see-through it's obviously clear so

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.990 
see-through it's obviously clear so
anything<00:05:08.620> above<00:05:08.710> that<00:05:09.099> and<00:05:09.220> you<00:05:09.340> just<00:05:09.610> get<00:05:09.880> to

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
anything above that and you just get to

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.339 
anything above that and you just get to
the<00:05:10.030> point<00:05:10.360> where<00:05:10.479> you<00:05:10.570> have<00:05:10.690> to<00:05:10.840> put<00:05:11.020> too<00:05:11.169> many

00:05:11.339 --> 00:05:11.349 
the point where you have to put too many

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:13.140 
the point where you have to put too many
coats<00:05:11.680> on<00:05:11.949> it's<00:05:12.160> just<00:05:12.220> not<00:05:12.490> worth<00:05:12.669> it<00:05:12.910> so<00:05:13.000> you'd

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
coats on it's just not worth it so you'd

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.480 
coats on it's just not worth it so you'd
be<00:05:13.270> better<00:05:13.479> off<00:05:13.570> using<00:05:13.690> clear<00:05:14.320> over<00:05:14.620> base<00:05:14.860> so

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
be better off using clear over base so

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.980 
be better off using clear over base so
that's<00:05:15.729> this<00:05:15.910> one<00:05:15.970> here<00:05:16.180> that's<00:05:16.539> just<00:05:16.780> a<00:05:16.840> bit

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
that's this one here that's just a bit
