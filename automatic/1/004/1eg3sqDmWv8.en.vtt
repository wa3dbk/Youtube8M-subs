00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
just just how you know I've always tend

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.750 
just just how you know I've always tend
to<00:01:37.140> do<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:37.560> my<00:01:37.680> head<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.160> would<00:01:38.310> say<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.610> is

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
to do it in my head I would say this is

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.730 
to do it in my head I would say this is
the<00:01:38.790> right<00:01:39.030> way<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.330> my<00:01:39.450> head<00:01:39.630> when<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.650> go

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
the right way in my head when you go

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.900 
the right way in my head when you go
from<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:40.980> side<00:01:41.160> to<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.370> side<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.700> take<00:01:41.850> it

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
from this side to the side you take it

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.290 
from this side to the side you take it
over<00:01:42.980> like<00:01:43.980> I<00:01:44.040> said<00:01:44.340> if<00:01:44.760> you're<00:01:44.940> gonna<00:01:45.090> do<00:01:45.270> a

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
over like I said if you're gonna do a

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.380 
over like I said if you're gonna do a
different<00:01:45.810> you<00:01:46.530> can<00:01:46.680> go<00:01:46.890> different<00:01:47.400> do

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
different you can go different do

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.570

whatever<00:01:48.600> way<00:01:48.870> you<00:01:48.930> like<00:01:49.200> but<00:01:49.500> that's<00:01:50.310> just

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
whatever way you like but that's just

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.270 
whatever way you like but that's just
like<00:01:50.760> my<00:01:50.970> code<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.420> my<00:01:51.450> head<00:01:51.860> like<00:01:52.860> that's<00:01:53.130> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
like my code in my head like that's the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.240 
like my code in my head like that's the
right<00:01:53.460> way<00:01:54.200> make<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.229> loose<00:01:55.560> or<00:01:55.770> as<00:01:55.800> tight<00:01:55.890> as

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
right way make it loose or as tight as

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:13.059 
right way make it loose or as tight as
you<00:01:56.340> want

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.320 

again<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:14.220> go<00:02:14.310> over<00:02:14.580> top<00:02:14.819> make<00:02:15.180> sure

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
again you go over top make sure

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.790 
again you go over top make sure
sometimes<00:02:15.660> it<00:02:15.990> turns<00:02:16.200> why<00:02:16.500> are<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.650> putting

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
sometimes it turns why are you putting

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.699 
sometimes it turns why are you putting
it<00:02:16.980> in<00:02:17.630> I'm<00:02:18.630> doing<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:18.990> quick<00:02:19.170> usually<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.530> just

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
it in I'm doing it quick usually I just

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.230 
it in I'm doing it quick usually I just
keep<00:02:19.830> my<00:02:20.010> in<00:02:20.190> there<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.520> once<00:02:20.670> it<00:02:20.790> goes<00:02:20.880> oh<00:02:21.090> it

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
keep my in there and once it goes oh it

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.809 
keep my in there and once it goes oh it
keeps<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.600> straight<00:02:21.840> but<00:02:22.400> like<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.489> said<00:02:23.550> if<00:02:23.730> it

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:23.819 
keeps it straight but like I said if it

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:34.370 
keeps it straight but like I said if it
turns<00:02:24.030> just<00:02:24.270> turn<00:02:24.480> it<00:02:24.630> back<00:02:24.810> simple<00:02:33.230> like<00:02:34.230> see

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
turns just turn it back simple like see

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:48.229 
turns just turn it back simple like see
this<00:02:34.530> one<00:02:34.680> just<00:02:34.830> turned<00:02:35.069> a<00:02:35.220> little<00:02:35.310> bit<00:02:47.239> so

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
this one just turned a little bit so

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.370 
this one just turned a little bit so
what<00:02:48.360> make<00:02:48.480> sure<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.750> can<00:02:48.870> keep<00:02:48.989> on<00:02:49.170> loose

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
what make sure you can keep on loose

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.170 
what make sure you can keep on loose
because<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.739> can<00:02:49.860> always<00:02:50.040> switch<00:02:50.370> change

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
because you can always switch change

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.199 
because you can always switch change
back<00:02:51.360> later<00:02:51.660> if<00:02:52.350> they're<00:02:52.620> too<00:02:52.800> loose<00:02:53.090> what<00:02:54.090> if

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
back later if they're too loose what if

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.150 
back later if they're too loose what if
they're<00:02:54.360> too<00:02:54.510> tight<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.930> neck<00:02:55.130> we're<00:02:56.130> going

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
they're too tight the neck we're going

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:08.510 
they're too tight the neck we're going
to<00:02:56.310> take<00:02:57.090> out<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.239> lot<00:02:57.390> of<00:02:57.510> strings<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.019> go<00:02:58.140> back

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.030
