00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.480
 try on youtube with you dima and today i 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.309
 showing base t x 7 for someone something you 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.889
 them like hot cakes 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:16.470
 snapping up at night see here plus you 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.970
 him for such that she may not have been afraid 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.490
 ty probably 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.740
 very few people use it moms 8 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.759
 I have never seen it for the first time 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.070
 everybody else i've come across wild 

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:34.710
 see the pros you go such that around 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.210
 stand heavy building after all there fat on 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.489
 2 thousand two thousand health each . 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.010
 laws are attacking they hang on them and 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.480
 airs start working on it 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.939
 plus huts and builders I do not know 4 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.250
 just maybe a tracer try 

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:57.750
 put them in the corners our feed canal 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.699
 dragons they start it can kill 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.930
 can not be thought that if the dragon 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.990
 turn on the attack but more often all merge 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.890
 dragon car center on the side of the building 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:15.710
 do not pay special attention to time 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.060
 Now his mouth can Katya cut 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.979
 the addition as now 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.490
 push in combat you immediately comes time 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.520
 she doesn't count there after some 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.010
 time you released the dragon everything went 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.040
 the heat can go some way you want 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.659
 and that's why you need to put on the seventh 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.170
 when to drag the dragon 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.130
 builders on the sides vozdushki I set 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.900
 near because experience divisions on 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.450
 different ends of the base and in general 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.940
 no kitty breaks very easily 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:52.600
 dragons in this base column became 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:56.650
 secondary, that is, it does not have such a straight 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.780
 super super important roles he was worth me 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.430
 would certainly put the center but in the center 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.170
 worth the cleaner now I'm talking about him too 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.490
 I will say 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.700
 the bar has become worth it to score 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.180
 naturally needed but just scoring 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.960
 him 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.240
 War do not put in the center there is the most 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.300
 look at the place of the cleaner 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.550
 there's a radius like you all saw this 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.830
 the radius can be seen when attacking the r.d. 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:26.860
 let him find the base you push 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:30.580
 on purgatory arc even probably yes 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.760
 other and not visible at what distance 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.280
 he will blow here the trick is that you 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:40.590
 check yourself which side of you more often 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.590
 will attack and change its direction 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.959
 here and change right 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.930
 the fact that such a direction in which he was 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.390
 here you are changing to the other side where more often 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.550
 they will attack what I do not know how she is 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.400
 will show itself in a fight from which country it will be 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:01.010
 attack i think that 's what to attack 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.170
 with this gone and lie 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.120
 arsenic i would myself change then we are so 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.870
 more comfortable and out 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.989
 a place of dark elixir some which 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.360
 was where the clone of the fire now stands need 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.370
 set that is in the direction 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.590
 sweeper dragons will lose on it 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.440
 time and move forward in the database can 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.349
 even like i happen to change on think 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.430
 earth can begin to attack and not really 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:30.260
 pull out and i'm doing great 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.079
 Well, that's all such a base 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.060
 i'm quiet there if they attack 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.329
 see showing attack with this 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.120
 parties 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:44.209
 dark transfer here 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:52.430
 camp are linking on the other this is 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:56.540
 imagine the nose camp in the woods on 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:01.629
 cage swap camp gift 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.629
 put here closer visible 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:10.080
 here and there are parts blowing completely here 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:11.960
 his dark leave and I must have come 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.000
 Packages for better treatment 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:18.900
 regular basis then there is everything but this 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.200
