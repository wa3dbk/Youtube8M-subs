00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello friends says and shows 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.720
 pashkin frezer and now i will have 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.799
 interesting video about how you can 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.110
 mark up 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.730
 I need an ellipse for this 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.109
 pencil not. 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.900
 ruler sewed 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.150
 or a needle well, and may need 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.990
 scissors to prune 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.330
 an extra string but for starters a little 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:33.410
 theories you need to know in order to 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:39.030
 post your ellipse now i'm rude 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:41.360
 draw something similar and show what you need 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:46.379
 know to mark up alice 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:50.520
 ellipse there is an axial line to this axial 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:54.059
 lines lie two points these two points 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.180
 are the foundational ellipse and from 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:01.829
 them happens the reference system we need 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:05.939
 know between the axial of these two points is 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:13.920
 first first it means this here 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:18.210
 size further even the most axial line on 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:27.140
 which lie these two points cuts like 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:30.150
 or sun in half and on the perimeter of the ellipse 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.720
 there are still two such 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.259
 we only have enough points and need to know 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.829
 distance from here this point here this 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.759
 point second means you need to know this one 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.479
 that's the size of knowing these two sizes 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.290
 can build 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.530
 ellipse now i'll show you how 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:57.180
 back to our 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:02:01.790
 first place means first thing 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.790
 we do draw a center line 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.979
 here is our center line let's say i need 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.970
 to build 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:16.850
 ellipse distance between two points 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:21.620
 about which I told you gorillas should 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:28.460
 be 10 centimeters mark these two 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:30.890
 points well let's say this means here first 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.870
 distance second distance let it be 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:44.630
 we have three centimeters here 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:45.350
 here is the next step between the first two 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.390
 dots 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:49.360
 rather the first two points you need 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.190
 make a hole 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.090
 if you make holes in your case 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.130
 is impossible 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:00.130
 need to come up with something similar 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:09.770
 we make a hole in these holes 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:10.790
 we thread our thread here as you see 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.260
 do not . 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:18.050
 threaded and now our task is 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.260
 to tie a knot like that 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:24.910
 way that he was here in this 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.910
 place here at this point 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:40.760
 so everything turned out well now with 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.650
 using scissors and to I trim 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:49.230
 superfluous so that it does not hang out and not 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:51.689
 interfered with this way 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.450
 formed means formed here 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:57.390
 such a loop and this nodule and I 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:01.829
 hide it down so that it does not interfere in the process 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:05.209
 markup pull it down like this 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:07.769
 way it all means with this business with us 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.019
 completed complete further me 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.750
 need a pencil but a pencil 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.840
 uneasy sharpened in a special way 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:19.590
 Now I will show you what it looks like. 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.530
 sharpening a pencil looks like this 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.300
 sharpen a pencil this little one 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.550
 the barrel has been made specifically for thread 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.880
 for this thread 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:40.620
 take our thread and pull it up 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:43.380
 groove as you can see pencil holds 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:45.889
 thread further produce 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.889
 size 

00:04:53.849 --> 00:05:01.379
 it has not impressed you yet if you are you 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:07.169
 it already impressed you can 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:12.509
 Like and very impressed 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:17.580
 you can leave a comment on this i 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:20.599
 I say thank you for your attention and wish 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.599
 best wishes
