00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.180
 Well, let's help all that 

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:07.060
 people who are stuck in this 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.160
 secondary mission of the game when 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.500
 they play on normal difficulty that 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:16.200
 logically does not match the videoguide 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.200
 that we have of this mission in the channel 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:32.259
 one 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.190
 well then as first request already 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.960
 you know they ask us for food and we have it 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.680
 to go look for a machine 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.480
 vending machine that is on the street depends 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.790
 the difficulty that we play you already know that 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.530
 change the location this time to 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.510
 playing it is normal we will find it 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.780
 right at this point that you marked in the 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.780
 Map 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.650
 obviously does not match the location 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.110
 of the vending machine that we saw in 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.300
 the video that we dedicate in this channel to 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.340
 this same secondary mission but 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.140
 playing the on easy difficulty 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.189
 We have used some coins to 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.240
 buy that energy bar and we're going to 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.240
 take it to the beggar 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.890
 get me press 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.350
 city 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.900
 this 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.900
 and I have the oracle niupi funk 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.900
 one 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.560
 and from the surgery room 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.240
 second beggar's request in this 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.970
 chance we have to go find a 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.940
 coat 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.030
 to be able to continue with the mission 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.670
 secondary also on this occasion the 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.860
 Location changes but always not very 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.560
 away from the one we already know playing in 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.720
 easy difficulty as you see the store that 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.240
 we visit is the same one we visited 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.410
 when we play in easy what happens is 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.780
 that we will not find that coat 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.850
 at the entrance to the left according to 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.850
 we enter the left inside that 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.180
 local but more specifically in the 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.180
 warehouse 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.540
 in easy we would find it just 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.540
 here 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.480
 and the normal we would find it fair 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.790
 as we enter through this door towards the 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.740
 right in a press hanging from one of 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.610
 the shelves 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.010
 there you have it 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.510
 that overcoat that we're going to have 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.360
 have to take the beggar back to 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.850
 continue with the secondary mission of 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.990
 game remind you that we are playing in 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.990
 normal difficulty 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.060
 yes 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:13.780
 snacks saw me there was a humidity me 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.780
 support 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.640
 strauss 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:30.630
 in the same way of activism actions 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:30.630
 on sensitive topics by 6 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:40.909
 wright 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.909
 first of all I'm not one of luck 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.039
 good and finally it 's time to 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:51.069
 look for the controversial fishing rod that in 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:53.289
 so many difficulties he has given so much 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:55.449
 many people 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.369
 especially playing on this difficulty 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.770
 Believe me, it's not hard to find 

00:04:57.369 --> 00:05:01.899
 it's a matter of looking around 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.649
 where we found her playing in 

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:04.649
 easy difficulty 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.130
 on this occasion and taking advantage of that 

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.830
 I'm commenting on this video for 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.530
 help you in everything I can I will 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:19.289
 say the location of the fishing rod 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.620
 in each of the difficulties of 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.620
 game 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.030
 for example if you come remember in 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.270
 Easy difficulty fishing rod 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.490
 we would find at the end of this street 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.710
 direction towards the springs right in that 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.120
 point that you see on screen in these 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.940
 moments 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:49.010
 if we played hard on the cane 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.010
 we would find fishing going here 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:56.770
 going through this side of the pier and here 

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:58.990
 at the bottom on the right next to the nhtsa 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:03.470
 what we see would be the fishing rod 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:05.540
 playing on difficult difficulty 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.060
 but as we are playing on difficulty 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:10.100
 normal the fishing rod we're going to 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.990
 find a little bit more removed but not 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:15.880
 much of the area in which we 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.880
 we find in these moments 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:27.700
 as well someone commented on the channel to 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:30.770
 foot of the previous video played in easy 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:33.530
 the fishing rod in this difficulty in 

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:35.300
 normal we find it in this access that 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.200
 we have towards the sewers of 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.290
 silent hill 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:43.760
 over here right at the point that I frame you 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:43.760
 on the map right now 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.170
 so that you have no loss 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.180
 in fact it's a corridor that we're going to 

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:53.380
 use several times throughout the 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.000
 game 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:07:00.960
 we go down the stairs and as we go 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.960
 towards the entrance of the sewers 

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:07.010
 on the right we have the fishing rod 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.050
 and well, it's time to pick it up 

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.210
 and take it to the beggar so 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:18.789
 finish this secondary mission 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:21.120
 I hope you have served for Help A 

00:07:18.789 --> 00:07:21.120
 greeting 

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.940
 efe 

00:07:54.249 --> 00:07:59.459
