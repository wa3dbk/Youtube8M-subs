00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello how welcome are you to this video 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.069
 education about the care of the 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.230
 iguana see in this video we will focus 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.580
 in three main points that are the 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.780
 hot 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.780
 feeding 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.040
 and the light 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.250
 we will take as illustrative basis a 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.840
 glass terrarium that is with which the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.270
 Most started with their iguanas backwards 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.830
 this must be higher than the long and 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.380
 be well sealed on top 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.970
 to avoid any obvious escape 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.770
 as our animals grow 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.530
 we will have to provide them with a space 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.250
 greater so that they can move 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.250
 properly and in freedom 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.400
 depending on the size and place of 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.020
 our terrarium we can use several 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.480
 tools to provide heat to 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.610
 our iguanas as they are heaters 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.120
 of room infrared spotlights and 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.610
 ceramic mats 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.740
 each one has certain limits and expenses 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.270
 different energy so always 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.850
 should be monitored with a 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.920
 thermometer so you can choose the one 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.770
 more suits us range 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.320
 temperatures that we will look for will be from 25 to 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.090
 38 degrees centigrade being the 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.970
 lower temperatures at night and 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.800
 early morning as we mentioned we will use 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.670
 some kind of thermometer to control 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.690
 this is either a mechanical mercury 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.500
 electronic or with humidity meters 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.500
 integrated 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.500
 the iguanas are folk herbivorous animals 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.020
 and borox all his life this means 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.020
 that they eat only plants and 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.210
 not of animal products yet not 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.250
 all plants are the same 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.110
 Iguanas need a diet based on 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.350
 leaves and legumes with a high content 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.009
 of fiber such as alfalfa quelite 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.770
 epazote and cilantro parsley papalo 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.190
 watercress we should avoid including in more than 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.039
 30% fruits and vegetables in the food already 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.239
 that these are mostly 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.380
 carbohydrates and are not part of the diet 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.380
 Normal of the Iguana 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.370
 light is a fundamental part in the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.840
 life of the iguana since certain 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.569
 radiations like light 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.909
 it stimulates your appetite and tells you 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:33.069
 changes between day and night and in 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.739
 three seasons of the year while the 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.629
 vb light allows you to synthesize vitamin d 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.790
 essential for the application and 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.790
 mobilization of calcium in the body 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.480
 the baby light we can provide it 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.970
 two different ways 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.310
 by sunbathing 20 to 40 minutes 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.310
 daily or through special bulbs 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.739
 of light your baby 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.220
 these bulbs should always be used with a 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.330
 bell but avoid damaging our sight 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.090
 besides not being more than 30 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.580
 centimeters of the animal's body what 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.550
 Medically advisable to use them is 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.200
 for one or two hours a day since this 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.180
 is more than enough for the animal 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.170
 can centralize the vitamin d that 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:16.170
 will use during the day 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.110
 with this we finish this little guide 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.420
 that covers the most essential thing you need 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.970
 have before taking your iguana to your 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.280
 House remembers that there is still much more 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.140
 for knowing about them so it's good 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.989
 to consult with a doctor 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.609
 veterinary specialist in reptiles or 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.220
 reading information with backup 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:43.140
 proper scientist also keep in mind 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.659
 that it is advisable to take our 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.359
 animals the review at least two or three 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:50.340
 times a year so they have a checkup 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:54.349
 complete doctor and be able to prevent 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.349
 any problem before it happens
