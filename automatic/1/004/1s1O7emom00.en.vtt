00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
this is pretty much the downside of it

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:19.260 
this is pretty much the downside of it
but<00:01:17.740> it's<00:01:17.950> actually<00:01:18.369> a<00:01:18.430> pretty<00:01:18.460> good<00:01:18.729> anyways

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
but it's actually a pretty good anyways

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.179 
but it's actually a pretty good anyways
it's<00:01:19.420> so<00:01:19.539> good<00:01:19.750> the<00:01:20.350> server<00:01:20.619> gets<00:01:20.829> destroyed

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
it's so good the server gets destroyed

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.060 
it's so good the server gets destroyed
after<00:01:21.399> 24<00:01:22.000> hours<00:01:22.149> or<00:01:22.719> whenever<00:01:23.350> an<00:01:23.530> activity

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070

they are actually working on a way to
extend<00:01:26.200> your<00:01:26.530> time<00:01:26.740> but<00:01:27.100> at<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.460> moment<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
extend your time but at the moment the

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.990 
extend your time but at the moment the
server<00:01:28.899> only<00:01:29.109> works<00:01:29.409> for<00:01:29.530> 24<00:01:30.009> hours<00:01:30.159> then<00:01:30.759> it

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
server only works for 24 hours then it

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.090 
server only works for 24 hours then it
just<00:01:31.179> gets<00:01:31.390> deleted<00:01:31.780> exterminated<00:01:32.770> whatever

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:01.359 
loading and it normally doesn't take a

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.059 
loading and it normally doesn't take a
long<00:02:01.479> time<00:02:01.689> but<00:02:01.899> since<00:02:02.079> i<00:02:02.170> am<00:02:02.380> in<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.679> basement
