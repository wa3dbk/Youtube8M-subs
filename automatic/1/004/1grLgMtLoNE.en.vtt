00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.280 
did too - okay and then I think we
should<00:02:10.459> do<00:02:10.700> a<00:02:10.729> splash<00:02:11.090> of<00:02:11.270> that<00:02:11.330> sometime<00:02:11.900> and

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
should do a splash of that sometime and

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.140 
should do a splash of that sometime and
then<00:02:12.470> we<00:02:12.620> made<00:02:12.800> cut<00:02:13.220> converts<00:02:13.580> in<00:02:13.820> this<00:02:13.940> era

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
then we made cut converts in this era

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.420 
then we made cut converts in this era
and<00:02:14.720> then<00:02:14.810> do<00:02:14.959> just<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.290> tiny<00:02:15.320> bit<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.770> tiny<00:02:16.190> bit

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
and then do just a tiny bit a tiny bit

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.270 
and then do just a tiny bit a tiny bit
