00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
this indicate that we kinda have to

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.990 
this indicate that we kinda have to
escape<00:00:45.510> out<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.870> back<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.260> pizza<00:00:46.530> real

who<00:00:48.000> knows<00:00:48.239> there<00:00:49.170> could<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.440> bunch<00:00:49.710> of

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
who knows there could be a bunch of

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.959 
who knows there could be a bunch of
different<00:00:49.920> mechanics<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.489> were<00:00:50.640> not<00:00:50.730> ready

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
different mechanics that were not ready

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.250 
different mechanics that were not ready
to<00:00:51.620> that<00:00:52.620> we're<00:00:52.739> not<00:00:52.829> really<00:00:53.039> used<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.699> yet<00:00:54.260> now

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
to that we're not really used to yet now

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.470 
to that we're not really used to yet now
you'll<00:00:55.500> see<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:56.160> yes<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.789> map<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.300> same

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
you'll see that yes this map is the same

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.849 
you'll see that yes this map is the same
one<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.840> steam<00:00:58.079> greenlight<00:00:58.289> picture

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
one on the steam greenlight picture

one on the steam greenlight picture
however<00:00:59.670> as<00:00:59.870> is<00:01:00.870> customary<00:01:01.379> with<00:01:01.620> all<00:01:01.829> of

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
however as is customary with all of

however as is customary with all of
Scott<00:01:02.219> games<00:01:02.460> pictures<00:01:02.940> i<00:01:03.149> took<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.199> image<00:01:04.409> i

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
Scott games pictures i took the image i

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.770 
Scott games pictures i took the image i
helped<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.159> brightness<00:01:05.549> up<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.330> contrast

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
helped the brightness up the contrast

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.660 
helped the brightness up the contrast
and<00:01:06.990> found<00:01:07.680> there<00:01:07.830> was<00:01:07.890> an<00:01:08.010> extra<00:01:08.250> border

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
and found there was an extra border

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.520 
and found there was an extra border
underneath<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.990> regular<00:01:10.380> pizza<00:01:10.880> map<00:01:12.530> this

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
underneath the regular pizza map this

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.870 
underneath the regular pizza map this
looks<00:01:13.799> like<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.070> could<00:01:14.100> indicate<00:01:14.460> some<00:01:14.850> sort

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
looks like it could indicate some sort

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.570 
looks like it could indicate some sort
of<00:01:15.090> larger<00:01:15.750> underground<00:01:16.259> sub<00:01:16.560> layer<00:01:16.770> which

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
of larger underground sub layer which

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.719 
of larger underground sub layer which
could<00:01:17.850> mean<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.270> big<00:01:18.890> like<00:01:19.890> warehouse<00:01:20.430> full<00:01:20.670> of

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
could mean a big like warehouse full of

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.670 
could mean a big like warehouse full of
old<00:01:21.000> animatronics<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:22.020> they<00:01:22.140> were<00:01:22.200> finding

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
old animatronics that they were finding

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.789 
old animatronics that they were finding
and<00:01:22.950> using<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.369> put<00:01:23.549> together<00:01:24.560> stuff<00:01:25.560> for<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
and using to put together stuff for the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.609 
and using to put together stuff for the
new<00:01:26.100> horror<00:01:26.759> attraction<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.200> fazbear's

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
new horror attraction like the fazbear's

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.300 
new horror attraction like the fazbear's
horror<00:01:28.860> thing<00:01:29.750> which<00:01:30.890> could<00:01:31.890> be<00:01:32.009> kind<00:01:32.250> of

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
horror thing which could be kind of

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.580 
horror thing which could be kind of
creepy<00:01:32.490> but<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.420> map<00:01:33.570> boundary<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.079> also<00:01:34.350> seen

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
creepy but the map boundary is also seen

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.130 
creepy but the map boundary is also seen
the<00:01:34.799> grayed<00:01:35.790> out<00:01:35.820> map<00:01:36.150> boundaries<00:01:36.600> also<00:01:36.900> seem

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
the grayed out map boundaries also seem

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.920 
the grayed out map boundaries also seem
to<00:01:37.549> match<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.060> entire<00:01:39.390> boundary<00:01:39.840> of

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
to match that of the entire boundary of

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.440 
to match that of the entire boundary of
the<00:01:40.140> original<00:01:40.590> Freddy's<00:01:41.009> one<00:01:41.250> map<00:01:41.520> without

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
the original Freddy's one map without

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.090 
the original Freddy's one map without
the<00:01:42.750> cross<00:01:42.930> sections<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.439> between<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:43.920> just

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the cross sections in between it's just

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.490 
the cross sections in between it's just
kinda<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.270> big<00:01:45.509> outline<00:01:45.960> around<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.409> old

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
kinda like a big outline around the old

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.039 
kinda like a big outline around the old
map<00:01:47.149> because<00:01:48.149> you'll<00:01:48.390> notice<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
map because you'll notice that the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.620 
map because you'll notice that the
Freddy's<00:01:49.649> 3<00:01:49.680> map<00:01:50.070> even<00:01:50.399> though<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:51.119> pizzeria

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
Freddy's 3 map even though the pizzeria

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.760 
Freddy's 3 map even though the pizzeria
looks<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.229> one<00:01:52.350> from<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.590> first

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
looks like it's the one from the first

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.380 
looks like it's the one from the first
game<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.130> map<00:01:53.280> doesn't<00:01:53.460> exactly<00:01:53.850> match<00:01:54.149> up

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
game the map doesn't exactly match up

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.020 
game the map doesn't exactly match up
with<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.570> map<00:01:54.869> like<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.590> map<00:01:56.549> screen<00:01:56.759> from

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
with the map like the map screen from

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.870 
with the map like the map screen from
the<00:01:57.090> first<00:01:57.360> game<00:01:57.450> so<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.860> could<00:01:59.100> be<00:01:59.310> that

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
the first game so it could be that

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.660 
the first game so it could be that
they've<00:02:00.869> blocked<00:02:01.200> off<00:02:01.350> sections<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.100> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
they've blocked off sections of the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.340 
they've blocked off sections of the
pizzeria<00:02:03.210> from<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.509> first<00:02:03.689> game<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.049> we<00:02:04.170> have

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350
