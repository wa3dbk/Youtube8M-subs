feel like what is supposed to sound like
so<00:01:15.140> you<00:01:15.229> can<00:01:15.380> bend<00:01:15.670> now<00:01:17.200> let's<00:01:18.200> talk<00:01:18.350> about

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
so you can bend now let's talk about

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:19.959 
so you can bend now let's talk about
playing<00:01:18.829> stretching<00:01:19.340> when<00:01:19.430> I<00:01:19.520> started<00:01:19.850> out

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:19.969 
playing stretching when I started out

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:22.899 
playing stretching when I started out
and<00:01:20.149> played<00:01:20.390> this<00:01:20.570> thing<00:01:20.780> here<00:01:21.640> that's<00:01:22.640> got<00:01:22.880> a

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
and played this thing here that's got a

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.590 
and played this thing here that's got a
lot<00:01:23.119> of<00:01:23.170> stretch<00:01:24.170> a<00:01:24.439> lot<00:01:24.590> of<00:01:24.740> hammer<00:01:24.950> on<00:01:25.189> it

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
lot of stretch a lot of hammer on it

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.010 
lot of stretch a lot of hammer on it
pull<00:01:26.600> off<00:01:26.780> so<00:01:27.049> let's<00:01:28.009> say<00:01:28.189> we<00:01:28.689> scale<00:01:29.689> it<00:01:29.719> back

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
pull off so let's say we scale it back

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.870 
pull off so let's say we scale it back
and<00:01:30.289> do<00:01:30.350> a<00:01:30.380> simple<00:01:30.649> exercise<00:01:30.799> to<00:01:31.340> start<00:01:31.609> and<00:01:31.729> go

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
and do a simple exercise to start and go

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.240 
and do a simple exercise to start and go
like<00:01:32.060> this

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:48.640 

a<00:01:46.330> variation<00:01:47.330> on<00:01:47.630> that<00:01:47.840> would<00:01:47.990> be<00:01:48.020> to<00:01:48.260> stretch

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
a variation on that would be to stretch

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:58.180 
a variation on that would be to stretch
your<00:01:49.340> first<00:01:49.640> to<00:01:56.229> do<00:01:57.229> that<00:01:57.380> on<00:01:57.619> every<00:01:57.890> string

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
your first to do that on every string

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.430 
your first to do that on every string
and<00:01:58.520> then<00:01:58.729> experience<00:01:59.600> it<00:01:59.750> further<00:02:00.140> up<00:02:00.320> the

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
and then experience it further up the

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.280 
and then experience it further up the
neck<00:02:00.470> you<00:02:01.369> combine<00:02:01.760> that<00:02:01.900> strength<00:02:02.900> building

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
neck you combine that strength building

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:11.890 
neck you combine that strength building
with<00:02:03.560> this<00:02:03.740> kind<00:02:03.979> of<00:02:04.040> exercise<00:02:10.540> so<00:02:11.540> you've<00:02:11.690> got

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
with this kind of exercise so you've got

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:22.960 
with this kind of exercise so you've got
basically<00:02:20.110> all<00:02:21.110> those<00:02:21.320> variations<00:02:21.950> there<00:02:22.190> one

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
basically all those variations there one

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.310 
basically all those variations there one
other<00:02:23.120> thing<00:02:23.360> I<00:02:23.420> used<00:02:23.570> to<00:02:23.690> have<00:02:23.840> my<00:02:23.989> students

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
other thing I used to have my students

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.710 
other thing I used to have my students
do<00:02:24.500> was<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:24.860> same<00:02:25.070> kind<00:02:25.280> of<00:02:25.570> hammer<00:02:26.570> on

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
do was the same kind of hammer on

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.940 
do was the same kind of hammer on
exercise<00:02:27.200> where<00:02:27.380> you<00:02:27.440> didn't<00:02:27.620> have<00:02:27.709> to<00:02:27.830> worry

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
exercise where you didn't have to worry

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:35.770 
exercise where you didn't have to worry
about<00:02:27.980> what<00:02:28.250> cue<00:02:28.459> in<00:02:28.610> one<00:02:28.790> like<00:02:28.940> this<00:02:34.780> just

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
about what cue in one like this just

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:45.460 
about what cue in one like this just
kind<00:02:36.050> of<00:02:36.110> get<00:02:36.230> used<00:02:36.380> to<00:02:36.500> doing<00:02:36.680> this

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.590 

just<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.590> build<00:02:46.710> up<00:02:46.890> your<00:02:46.920> strength

stuff in this to scale this is a great
exercise<00:03:04.140> for<00:03:04.350> warming<00:03:04.830> up<00:03:04.950> I'm<00:03:05.460> not<00:03:05.670> really

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
exercise for warming up I'm not really

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.330 
exercise for warming up I'm not really
warmed<00:03:06.180> up<00:03:06.270> right<00:03:06.420> now<00:03:06.600> so<00:03:06.920> you'll<00:03:07.920> get<00:03:08.070> to<00:03:08.130> see

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
warmed up right now so you'll get to see

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:18.590 
warmed up right now so you'll get to see
somebody<00:03:08.700> warming<00:03:09.030> up<00:03:09.150> right<00:03:17.300> same<00:03:18.300> kind<00:03:18.510> of

somebody warming up right same kind of
thing<00:03:18.750> on<00:03:18.870> first<00:03:19.380> four<00:03:19.590> strings<00:03:27.470> first<00:03:28.470> couple

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
thing on first four strings first couple

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:37.340 
thing on first four strings first couple
strings<00:03:29.070> -<00:03:34.670> so<00:03:35.670> like<00:03:35.820> a<00:03:35.880> tongue<00:03:36.210> twister<00:03:36.360> for

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
strings - so like a tongue twister for

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.650 
strings - so like a tongue twister for
your<00:03:37.470> fingers<00:03:37.860> it's<00:03:38.700> a<00:03:38.760> great<00:03:38.970> way<00:03:39.120> to<00:03:39.150> warm<00:03:39.420> up

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
your fingers it's a great way to warm up

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.080 
your fingers it's a great way to warm up
I<00:03:39.930> do<00:03:40.140> this<00:03:40.350> every<00:03:40.620> night<00:03:40.650> or<00:03:41.160> show<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:41.820> use

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
I do this every night or show you use

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.110 
I do this every night or show you use
any<00:03:42.240> chord<00:03:42.570> form<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.960> do<00:03:43.110> it<00:03:43.260> you<00:03:43.380> can<00:03:43.560> use<00:03:43.590> a

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
any chord form to do it you can use a

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:57.140 
any chord form to do it you can use a
let's<00:03:45.120> say<00:03:45.300> this<00:03:45.360> diminished<00:03:45.990> chords<00:03:56.030> one<00:03:57.030> and

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
let's say this diminished chords one and

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.770 
let's say this diminished chords one and
so<00:03:57.240> forth<00:03:57.270> again<00:03:58.200> the<00:03:58.320> idea<00:03:58.590> is<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.770> stay<00:03:58.950> loose

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
so forth again the idea is to stay loose

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.540 
so forth again the idea is to stay loose
work<00:04:00.780> away<00:04:01.050> any<00:04:01.230> kind<00:04:01.410> of<00:04:01.530> tension<00:04:01.920> don't<00:04:02.310> play

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
work away any kind of tension don't play

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.340 
work away any kind of tension don't play
for<00:04:02.610> Hertz<00:04:03.030> and

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
for Hertz and

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:07.920 
for Hertz and
with<00:04:05.650> as<00:04:05.800> much<00:04:05.980> economy<00:04:06.580> as<00:04:06.970> you<00:04:07.240> possibly<00:04:07.690> can

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
with as much economy as you possibly can

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.690 
with as much economy as you possibly can

whole new sort of technique of its own

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.200 
whole new sort of technique of its own
because<00:04:47.860> you<00:04:48.040> find<00:04:48.310> you<00:04:48.430> have<00:04:48.460> to<00:04:48.880> lift<00:04:49.060> up

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
because you find you have to lift up

because you find you have to lift up
your<00:04:49.420> fingers<00:04:49.780> in<00:04:50.260> a<00:04:50.440> different<00:04:50.800> way<00:04:50.950> because

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
your fingers in a different way because

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.370 
your fingers in a different way because
of<00:04:52.120> the<00:04:52.210> size<00:04:52.450> of<00:04:52.660> the<00:04:52.720> string<00:04:52.960> and<00:04:53.140> then<00:04:53.260> as

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
of the size of the string and then as

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.870 
of the size of the string and then as
you<00:04:53.530> go<00:04:53.680> up<00:04:53.710> same<00:04:54.010> thing<00:04:54.040> when<00:04:54.430> you<00:04:54.520> get<00:04:54.640> to<00:04:54.760> the

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
you go up same thing when you get to the

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.850 
you go up same thing when you get to the
top<00:04:55.120> we're<00:04:55.780> halfway<00:04:56.050> up<00:04:56.260> let's<00:04:56.590> say<00:04:56.710> the

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
top we're halfway up let's say the

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.960 
top we're halfway up let's say the
twelfth<00:04:57.160> fret<00:04:57.250> when<00:04:57.490> you<00:04:57.550> go<00:04:57.670> backwards<00:04:59.970> this

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
twelfth fret when you go backwards this

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.640 
twelfth fret when you go backwards this
whole<00:05:01.180> movement<00:05:01.450> like<00:05:01.840> this<00:05:02.170> here<00:05:02.500> is

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
whole movement like this here is

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.160 
whole movement like this here is
essential<00:05:03.190> because<00:05:03.570> it's<00:05:04.570> really<00:05:04.930> teaching

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
essential because it's really teaching

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.600 
essential because it's really teaching
you<00:05:05.410> that<00:05:05.530> there's<00:05:05.740> lots<00:05:05.950> of<00:05:06.130> ways<00:05:06.340> of<00:05:06.550> getting

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
you that there's lots of ways of getting

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.630 
you that there's lots of ways of getting
fingerings<00:05:07.800> to<00:05:08.800> work<00:05:08.980> out<00:05:09.160> even<00:05:09.340> though<00:05:09.520> they

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:09.640 
fingerings to work out even though they

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.610 
fingerings to work out even though they
may<00:05:09.790> look<00:05:09.820> awkward

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
may look awkward

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.500 
may look awkward
there's<00:05:11.620> no<00:05:11.800> getting<00:05:12.340> it<00:05:12.460> together<00:05:12.610> where<00:05:13.090> if

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
there's no getting it together where if

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.790 
there's no getting it together where if
you<00:05:13.630> practice<00:05:14.020> it<00:05:14.110> enough<00:05:14.380> it<00:05:14.560> becomes

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.890 

now<00:05:20.490> to<00:05:20.550> get<00:05:20.790> out<00:05:20.970> of<00:05:21.090> the<00:05:21.180> box<00:05:21.390> of<00:05:21.660> doing

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
now to get out of the box of doing

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.700 
now to get out of the box of doing
scales<00:05:22.200> just<00:05:22.860> to<00:05:23.100> oxygen<00:05:23.550> three<00:05:23.820> octaves

something<00:05:25.710> that<00:05:25.890> I<00:05:26.490> learned<00:05:27.210> from<00:05:27.500> Lennie

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
something that I learned from Lennie

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.550 
something that I learned from Lennie

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
cover the entire neck so let's say to

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:53.240 
cover the entire neck so let's say to
see<00:05:43.200> me<00:05:43.320> play<00:05:51.530> worry<00:05:52.530> about<00:05:52.710> timing<00:05:53.010> your
