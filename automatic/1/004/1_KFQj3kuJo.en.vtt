00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
and play a couple matches probably will

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.209 
and play a couple matches probably will
be<00:00:51.780> because<00:00:51.989> it's<00:00:52.379> always<00:00:52.649> fun<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.949> do

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
be because it's always fun to do

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.220 
be because it's always fun to do
something<00:00:53.250> different<00:00:53.640> besides<00:00:54.570> playing<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
something different besides playing the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.860 
something different besides playing the
same<00:00:55.949> game<00:00:56.160> every<00:00:56.430> day<00:00:56.610> here<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.690> thought

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
same game every day here it is I thought

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.380 
same game every day here it is I thought
you<00:00:58.079> could<00:00:58.230> go<00:00:58.350> through<00:00:58.559> there<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.090> then<00:01:00.090> walk

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
you could go through there and then walk

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.029 
you could go through there and then walk
around<00:01:00.539> or<00:01:00.809> something<00:01:00.930> with<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.680> was<00:01:01.800> actually

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039
