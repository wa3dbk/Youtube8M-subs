paint it on and you can tell if your

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.100 
paint it on and you can tell if your
skis<00:02:39.740> need<00:02:40.740> a<00:02:41.040> base<00:02:41.430> coat<00:02:41.700> when<00:02:42.660> they<00:02:42.840> start

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
getting really white it's best to get a

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.360 
getting really white it's best to get a
good<00:02:45.030> base<00:02:45.360> what<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.750> know<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:46.200> protect<00:02:46.650> them
