stuff<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:38.239> really<00:00:39.239> must<00:00:39.390> wanted<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.840> bring

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
stuff so I really must wanted to bring

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.049 
stuff so I really must wanted to bring
back<00:00:40.140> something<00:00:40.410> like<00:00:40.559> mutilate<00:00:40.980> but<00:00:41.640> I<00:00:41.879> think

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
back something like mutilate but I think

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.110 
back something like mutilate but I think
that's<00:00:42.210> too<00:00:42.329> powerful<00:00:42.719> unfortunately<00:00:43.559> but<00:00:44.120> I

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
that's too powerful unfortunately but I

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.400 
that's too powerful unfortunately but I
think<00:00:45.570> it'd<00:00:45.660> still<00:00:45.780> be<00:00:45.840> cool<00:00:46.020> that<00:00:46.260> would<00:00:46.320> be

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
think it'd still be cool that would be

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.500 
think it'd still be cool that would be
like<00:00:46.530> I'm<00:00:46.680> twelve<00:00:46.920> or<00:00:47.010> something<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:47.820> my

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
like I'm twelve or something so it's my

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.479 
like I'm twelve or something so it's my
own<00:00:48.600> opinion<00:00:49.129> but<00:00:50.899> yet<00:00:51.920> so<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.219> basically

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
own opinion but yet so that basically

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:01.220 
own opinion but yet so that basically
functions<00:00:53.969> as<00:00:55.070> to<00:00:56.070> brio<00:00:56.280> Titans<00:00:58.489> for<00:01:00.230> vampire

like dumb people for doom blade do blaze

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.660 
like dumb people for doom blade do blaze
basically<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.799> there<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.280> originally<00:01:41.610> was

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
basically in there that originally was

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.499 
basically in there that originally was
smothered<00:01:43.040> unfortunately<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.390> some<00:01:45.390> other

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
smothered unfortunately like some other

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.819 
smothered unfortunately like some other
kind<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.720> became<00:01:45.930> useless<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.439> late<00:01:46.590> game

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
kind of became useless in the late game

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.410 
kind of became useless in the late game
because<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.280> have<00:01:47.460> something<00:01:47.970> like<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> six

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
because you have something like a six

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.620 
because you have something like a six
drop<00:01:48.630> down<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.250> you<00:01:50.250> get<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.520> smother<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.970> so

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
drop down and you get to smother it so

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.300 
drop down and you get to smother it so
employed<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.439> nice<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:53.009> only<00:01:53.189> unfortunate

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
employed is nice the only unfortunate

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.789 
employed is nice the only unfortunate
thing<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.360> know<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.689> minus<00:01:55.079> iron<00:01:55.590> on

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
thing is that you know the minus iron on

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.350 
thing is that you know the minus iron on
black<00:01:56.130> cloth<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.610> kind<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:56.939> bitch<00:01:57.119> because

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
black cloth is kind of a bitch because

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.700 
black cloth is kind of a bitch because
you<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.719> actually<00:01:57.810> hit<00:01:58.020> like<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> posing<00:01:58.560> grave

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710

you can actually hit like a posing grave
titans<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.189> stuff<00:01:59.369> like<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.869> but<00:02:00.869> for<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
titans and stuff like that but for the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.010 
titans and stuff like that but for the
most<00:02:01.680> part<00:02:01.799> um<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.820> think<00:02:03.329> being<00:02:03.630> blitz<00:02:03.810> really

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
most part um I think being blitz really

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.830 
most part um I think being blitz really

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
basically just trying to test for states

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.840 
basically just trying to test for states
here<00:06:06.210> to<00:06:06.420> them<00:06:06.540> and<00:06:07.310> doing<00:06:08.310> as<00:06:08.490> much<00:06:08.610> testing

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
here to them and doing as much testing

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.350 
here to them and doing as much testing
as<00:06:09.030> I<00:06:09.090> did<00:06:09.240> I<00:06:09.270> tested<00:06:09.720> like<00:06:10.640> way<00:06:11.640> way<00:06:12.090> way<00:06:12.330> too

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
as I did I tested like way way way too

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.990 
as I did I tested like way way way too
many<00:06:12.540> matchups<00:06:13.170> my<00:06:13.290> mind<00:06:13.560> is<00:06:13.710> just<00:06:13.740> like<00:06:14.070> right

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
many matchups my mind is just like right

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.400 
many matchups my mind is just like right
now<00:06:16.100> yeah<00:06:17.100> it's<00:06:17.850> really<00:06:18.240> hard<00:06:18.450> to<00:06:18.570> test<00:06:18.810> for<00:06:19.140> an

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
now yeah it's really hard to test for an

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.010 
now yeah it's really hard to test for an
unknown<00:06:19.680> environment<00:06:20.460> unfortunately<00:06:21.030> like

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
unknown environment unfortunately like

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.110 
unknown environment unfortunately like
you<00:06:22.530> get<00:06:22.650> a<00:06:22.680> lot<00:06:22.980> of<00:06:23.010> thought<00:06:23.520> process<00:06:23.700> up

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
you get a lot of thought process up

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.490 
you get a lot of thought process up
there<00:06:24.330> and<00:06:24.570> then<00:06:24.690> you<00:06:24.780> basically<00:06:24.960> just<00:06:25.230> sort

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
there and then you basically just sort

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:28.670 
there and then you basically just sort
of<00:06:25.530> like<00:06:25.650> well<00:06:26.750> what<00:06:27.750> do<00:06:27.810> I<00:06:27.870> gonna<00:06:28.050> do<00:06:28.170> and<00:06:28.530> then

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
of like well what do I gonna do and then

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.020 
of like well what do I gonna do and then
you<00:06:29.400> start<00:06:29.640> looking<00:06:29.730> at<00:06:30.150> top<00:06:30.840> deck<00:06:31.050> list<00:06:31.320> like

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:32.030 
you start looking at top deck list like

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.900 
you start looking at top deck list like
the<00:06:33.030> new<00:06:33.300> york<00:06:33.480> city<00:06:34.490> event<00:06:35.490> that<00:06:35.610> happened

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:35.910 
the new york city event that happened

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.630 
the new york city event that happened
like<00:06:36.270> a<00:06:36.360> week<00:06:36.510> or<00:06:36.600> two<00:06:36.660> ago<00:06:37.220> for<00:06:38.220> you<00:06:38.520> know

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:38.640 
like a week or two ago for you know

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:39.810 
like a week or two ago for you know
inspiration<00:06:38.940> of<00:06:39.300> what

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:39.820 
inspiration of what

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.030 
inspiration of what
we'll<00:06:39.940> be<00:06:40.090> playing<00:06:40.440> and<00:06:41.440> you<00:06:41.530> start<00:06:41.800> kissing

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.040 
we'll be playing and you start kissing

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.670 
we'll be playing and you start kissing
against<00:06:42.190> that<00:06:42.340> shit<00:06:42.550> so<00:06:42.930> I<00:06:43.930> think<00:06:44.230> the<00:06:44.410> deck<00:06:44.560> is

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
against that shit so I think the deck is

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.610 
against that shit so I think the deck is
a<00:06:44.710> pretty<00:06:44.920> good<00:06:45.190> you<00:06:45.520> know<00:06:45.990> they<00:06:46.990> are<00:06:47.290> pretty

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
a pretty good you know they are pretty

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.280 
a pretty good you know they are pretty
good<00:06:48.090> matchups<00:06:49.090> against<00:06:49.330> the<00:06:49.450> field<00:06:49.630> for<00:06:50.140> what

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:50.290 
good matchups against the field for what

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:52.140 
good matchups against the field for what
I<00:06:50.350> tested<00:06:50.650> anyway<00:06:50.860> you<00:06:51.850> know<00:06:51.940> the<00:06:52.030> only

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150 
I tested anyway you know the only

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.060 
I tested anyway you know the only
problem<00:06:52.510> it<00:06:52.630> really<00:06:52.840> deals<00:06:53.050> that<00:06:53.680> has<00:06:53.860> deal

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.070 
problem it really deals that has deal

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.460 
problem it really deals that has deal
with<00:06:54.100> is<00:06:54.400> like<00:06:54.930> validation<00:06:55.930> range<00:06:56.110> deal<00:06:56.350> in

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:56.470 
with is like validation range deal in

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.680 
with is like validation range deal in
your<00:06:56.590> store<00:06:56.740> Markov<00:06:57.160> or<00:06:57.550> your<00:06:58.060> side<00:06:58.510> to

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.690 
your store Markov or your side to

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:59.610 
your store Markov or your side to
implode<00:06:58.900> weights<00:06:59.140> or<00:06:59.260> something<00:06:59.290> like<00:06:59.530> that

00:06:59.610 --> 00:06:59.620 
implode weights or something like that

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:02.820 
implode weights or something like that
but<00:07:00.100> overall<00:07:00.460> it's<00:07:01.330> pretty<00:07:01.360> good<00:07:01.690> so<00:07:02.230> tell

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
but overall it's pretty good so tell

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.890 
but overall it's pretty good so tell
later<00:07:02.980> after<00:07:03.640> magic<00:07:04.090> or<00:07:04.240> if<00:07:04.540> they<00:07:04.690> made<00:07:04.870> it

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:04.900 
later after magic or if they made it

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.380 
later after magic or if they made it
pools<00:07:05.170> of<00:07:05.260> these
