we're<00:00:13.410> going<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.590> show<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:13.889> guys<00:00:14.099> how<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.340> do

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
we're going to show you guys how to do

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.300 
we're going to show you guys how to do
some<00:00:14.730> scrubbing<00:00:15.260> first<00:00:16.260> on<00:00:16.500> a<00:00:16.529> Supercross

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
some scrubbing first on a Supercross

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.040 
some scrubbing first on a Supercross
triple<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.060> then<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.330> like<00:00:18.510> an<00:00:18.630> outdoor

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
triple and then on like an outdoor

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.880 
triple and then on like an outdoor
environment<00:00:19.289> double<00:00:20.750> so<00:00:21.750> basically<00:00:22.410> my

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
environment double so basically my

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.700 
environment double so basically my
technique<00:00:23.430> for<00:00:23.609> scrubbing<00:00:23.970> in<00:00:24.420> this<00:00:24.630> game<00:00:24.869> use

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
technique for scrubbing in this game use

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.300 
technique for scrubbing in this game use
one<00:00:26.099> stick<00:00:26.460> only<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.150> my<00:00:27.990> forward<00:00:28.529> back<00:00:29.010> and

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
one stick only so my forward back and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.939 
one stick only so my forward back and
left<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:30.240> right<00:00:30.390> lean<00:00:30.689> are<00:00:30.960> all<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:31.800> same

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
left to right lean are all on the same

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.870 
left to right lean are all on the same
stick<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:33.090> basically<00:00:33.450> what<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.690> do<00:00:33.809> in<00:00:34.230> this

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
stick so basically what I do in this

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.979 
stick so basically what I do in this
triple<00:00:35.880> jump<00:00:36.090> right<00:00:36.210> here<00:00:36.270> because<00:00:36.840> I'm

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
triple jump right here because I'm

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.350 
triple jump right here because I'm
scrubbing<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.250> leaning<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.790> right<00:00:38.879> I

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
scrubbing and leaning to the right I

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.299 
scrubbing and leaning to the right I
come<00:00:39.780> up<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.020> jump<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.469> lean<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> little<00:00:41.129> bit

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
come up to the jump I lean a little bit

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.340 
come up to the jump I lean a little bit
forward<00:00:41.430> on<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.059> come<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.450> coming<00:00:43.020> up<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
forward on the come on coming up to the

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.979 
forward on the come on coming up to the
jump<00:00:43.879> and<00:00:44.879> obviously<00:00:45.270> lean<00:00:45.539> over<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.899> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
jump and obviously lean over to the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.680 
jump and obviously lean over to the
right<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.379> get<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.559> bike<00:00:46.770> laid<00:00:47.070> over<00:00:47.460> and<00:00:47.700> as<00:00:48.329> I

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
right to get the bike laid over and as I

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.540 
right to get the bike laid over and as I
take<00:00:48.899> off<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.289> lean<00:00:49.649> back<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.309> then

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
take off I lean back and then

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.209 
take off I lean back and then
immediately<00:00:51.420> start<00:00:52.050> turning<00:00:52.440> left<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:53.190> that

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
immediately start turning left so that

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.069 
immediately start turning left so that
the<00:00:53.430> bike<00:00:53.640> will<00:00:53.820> kind<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.180> start<00:00:54.390> evening<00:00:54.960> out

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the bike will kind of start evening out

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.959 
the bike will kind of start evening out
in<00:00:55.230> midair<00:00:55.440> as<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.250> see<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.610> side<00:00:56.789> by

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
in midair as you can see in this side by

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.700 
in midair as you can see in this side by
shot<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.449> difference<00:00:57.840> between<00:00:57.989> scrubbing

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
shot the difference between scrubbing

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.920 
shot the difference between scrubbing
and<00:00:58.829> not<00:00:58.980> scrubbing<00:00:59.370> obviously<00:01:00.149> my<00:01:00.270> body<00:01:00.510> much

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
and not scrubbing obviously my body much

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.930 
and not scrubbing obviously my body much
higher<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> air<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.010> one<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
higher in the air and that one and the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.460 
higher in the air and that one and the
bike<00:01:03.120> about<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.510> same<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:03.989> it's<00:01:04.110> definitely

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
bike about the same but it's definitely

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.200 
bike about the same but it's definitely
staying<00:01:04.739> lower<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> ground<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.820> general

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
staying lower to the ground in general

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.420 
staying lower to the ground in general
so<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.450> get<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:07.530> power<00:01:07.799> back<00:01:08.189> down

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
so you can get that that power back down

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.280 
so you can get that that power back down
but<00:01:09.090> basically<00:01:09.479> yeah<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:09.900> kind<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.110> like<00:01:10.260> a

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
but basically yeah it's kind of like a

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.950 
but basically yeah it's kind of like a
rolling<00:01:10.799> technique<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:12.420> roll<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
rolling technique you you roll to the

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.359 
rolling technique you you roll to the
right<00:01:13.260> right<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:13.890> see<00:01:14.010> I've<00:01:14.100> rolled

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
right right here you can see I've rolled

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.010 
right right here you can see I've rolled
to<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.490> right<00:01:14.700> lean<00:01:15.090> back<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.720> immediately

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
to the right lean back and immediately

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.289 
to the right lean back and immediately
start<00:01:16.530> turning<00:01:16.860> left<00:01:17.130> again<00:01:17.520> that's<00:01:18.090> why<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
start turning left again that's why the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.940 
start turning left again that's why the
bars<00:01:18.630> are<00:01:18.869> turning<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.350> right<00:01:19.560> if<00:01:19.799> you've

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
bars are turning to the right if you've

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.260 
bars are turning to the right if you've
ever<00:01:20.100> played<00:01:20.369> at<00:01:20.490> my<00:01:20.580> simulator<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.119> know

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
ever played at my simulator you know

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.660 
ever played at my simulator you know
that<00:01:21.479> basically<00:01:22.380> if<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.650> turn<00:01:23.130> right<00:01:23.159> your

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
that basically if you turn right your

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.179 
that basically if you turn right your
bars<00:01:23.939> will<00:01:24.150> go<00:01:24.270> left<00:01:24.540> it's<00:01:24.869> kind<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.380> reverse

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
bars will go left it's kind of a reverse

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.580 
bars will go left it's kind of a reverse
turn<00:01:27.000> angle<00:01:27.390> feel<00:01:27.630> effect<00:01:28.110> if<00:01:28.259> you've<00:01:28.409> ever

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
turn angle feel effect if you've ever

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.130 
turn angle feel effect if you've ever
seen<00:01:28.860> like<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.220> MotoGP<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.820> stuff<00:01:30.180> but<00:01:31.020> you

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
seen like in MotoGP and stuff but you

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.380 
seen like in MotoGP and stuff but you
kind<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.470> throw<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.220> immediately<00:01:33.000> start

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
kind of throw it and immediately start

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.090 
kind of throw it and immediately start
trying<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:33.720> bring<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.049> back<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.500> never<00:01:34.799> get

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
trying to bring it back so you never get

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.590 
trying to bring it back so you never get
too<00:01:35.310> far<00:01:35.610> because<00:01:35.850> basically<00:01:36.090> what<00:01:36.450> you're

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
too far because basically what you're

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.510 
too far because basically what you're
doing<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.960> sliding<00:01:37.290> your<00:01:37.590> front<00:01:37.740> tire<00:01:38.040> off<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
doing is sliding your front tire off the

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.840 
doing is sliding your front tire off the
top<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.000> jump<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:40.189> it's<00:01:41.189> too<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.759> know

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
top of the jump and it's too you know

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.730 
top of the jump and it's too you know
