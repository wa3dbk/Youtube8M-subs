00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
they were stunned they were able to get

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.890 
they were stunned they were able to get
him<00:00:10.580> he's<00:00:10.790> the<00:00:10.820> highest<00:00:11.120> rated<00:00:11.509> point<00:00:11.690> guard

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900

him he's the highest rated point guard
in<00:00:11.960> the<00:00:12.019> draft<00:00:12.320> I<00:00:12.559> thought<00:00:13.040> they<00:00:13.809> felt<00:00:14.809> like

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
in the draft I thought they felt like

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.720 
in the draft I thought they felt like
there<00:00:15.139> was<00:00:15.230> no<00:00:15.259> way<00:00:15.530> they<00:00:15.650> could<00:00:15.679> get<00:00:15.920> him<00:00:16.070> and

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
there was no way they could get him and

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.269 
there was no way they could get him and
I<00:00:17.119> think<00:00:17.720> they<00:00:17.869> like<00:00:18.079> his<00:00:18.380> toughness<00:00:18.680> I<00:00:19.070> think

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.470 
of all they have a glaring need the Jazz
i<00:00:24.169> should<00:00:24.349> say<00:00:24.500> have<00:00:24.710> a<00:00:24.739> glaring<00:00:25.250> need<00:00:25.279> of<00:00:25.700> at

Point<00:00:26.869> garden<00:00:27.320> and<00:00:27.559> but<00:00:28.250> they<00:00:28.369> didn't<00:00:28.669> think

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
Point garden and but they didn't think

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.889
