Wade<00:03:23.709> credit<00:03:24.370> for<00:03:25.120> being<00:03:25.590> LeBron's<00:03:26.590> not<00:03:26.920> only

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
Wade credit for being LeBron's not only

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.759

his<00:03:27.250> big<00:03:27.489> brother<00:03:27.790> but<00:03:28.390> his<00:03:28.570> psychologist<00:03:29.500> I

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
his big brother but his psychologist I

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.490 
his big brother but his psychologist I
think<00:03:30.190> Duane<00:03:30.820> taught<00:03:31.299> him<00:03:31.570> a<00:03:31.600> lot<00:03:31.810> about<00:03:32.110> how

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
think Duane taught him a lot about how

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.170 
think Duane taught him a lot about how
to<00:03:32.560> break<00:03:32.890> through<00:03:33.190> and<00:03:33.310> finally<00:03:33.730> win<00:03:33.910> an<00:03:34.030> NBA

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
to break through and finally win an NBA
