00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
since last Thursday so that's been a

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.560 
since last Thursday so that's been a
week<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.200> three<00:00:34.410> days<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.920> really<00:00:35.880> like<00:00:36.149> it<00:00:36.390> but

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
week in three days I really like it but

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.970 
week in three days I really like it but
there<00:00:36.750> are<00:00:36.809> some<00:00:36.960> things<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.350> don't<00:00:37.410> like<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.800> by

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
there are some things I don't like a by

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.500 
there are some things I don't like a by
the<00:00:38.040> sauce<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.489> would<00:00:38.640> think<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.090> really

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
the sauce so I would think that I really

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.770 
the sauce so I would think that I really
do<00:00:39.690> like<00:00:39.899> um<00:00:40.610> first<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.820> like<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.149> curl<00:00:42.390> pattern

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
do like um first I like the curl pattern

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.580 
do like um first I like the curl pattern
I<00:00:42.870> like<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.789> you<00:00:44.789> know<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:45.329> pretty<00:00:45.960> curly

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
I like that you know it's pretty curly

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.040 
I like that you know it's pretty curly
naturally<00:00:47.160> curly<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:48.329> comes<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.930> two

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
naturally curly and it comes in two

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.709 
naturally curly and it comes in two
different<00:00:49.079> lengths<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.860> comes<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.219> 214<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.420> 12

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
different lengths it comes in 214 the 12

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.950 
different lengths it comes in 214 the 12
10<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.739> 8<00:00:53.010> so<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.730> really<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.210> I'd<00:00:54.690> later

really<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.530> i<00:01:01.710> like<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.309> coat<00:01:02.550> pattern

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789

really like it i like the coat pattern
and<00:01:03.210> how<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.780> not<00:01:03.930> too<00:01:04.170> tight<00:01:04.439> at<00:01:04.619> first<00:01:04.650> it

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
and how it's not too tight at first it

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.890 
and how it's not too tight at first it
was<00:01:05.220> kind<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.549> tight<00:01:05.790> but<00:01:06.299> then<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.600> curls

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
was kind of tight but then the curls

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.750 
was kind of tight but then the curls
fall<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.470> they<00:01:07.590> fall<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.250> they<00:01:08.460> look<00:01:08.640> like

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760

and<00:01:40.890> there<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.850> go<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.299> it's<00:01:42.509> pretty<00:01:42.720> it's<00:01:43.049> an

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
and there you go so it's pretty it's an

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.160 
and there you go so it's pretty it's an
easy<00:01:43.560> look<00:01:44.159> that<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.850> do<00:01:45.030> if<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.079> don't

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
easy look that you can do if you don't

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.810 
easy look that you can do if you don't
really<00:01:46.409> have<00:01:46.560> time<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:46.920> morning<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.670> you

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
really have time in the morning just you

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.880 
really have time in the morning just you
know<00:01:47.970> but<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.780> still<00:01:48.960> wouldn't<00:01:49.079> be<00:01:49.170> cute<00:01:49.439> this

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
know but you still wouldn't be cute this

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.850 
know but you still wouldn't be cute this
is<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> good<00:01:50.490> hair<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.030> get<00:01:51.240> as<00:01:51.990> far<00:01:52.229> as<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.530> cons

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
is a good hair to get as far as the cons

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.880 
is a good hair to get as far as the cons
I<00:01:53.189> would<00:01:53.490> say<00:01:53.909> that<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:55.140> does<00:01:55.500> get<00:01:55.829> very

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
I would say that it does get very

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.459 
I would say that it does get very
tangling<00:01:56.790> unlike<00:01:57.420> you<00:01:57.540> can<00:01:57.719> see<00:01:57.869> right<00:01:57.899> here

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
tangling unlike you can see right here

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.520 
tangling unlike you can see right here
it's<00:01:58.979> kind<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.280> tingly<00:01:59.670> um<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.930> got<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.409> out

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
it's kind of tingly um it got you out

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.929 
it's kind of tingly um it got you out
kind<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.829> have<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:01.950> force<00:02:02.280> your<00:02:02.490> way<00:02:02.610> through

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
kind of have to force your way through

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.050 
kind of have to force your way through
so<00:02:03.750> that's<00:02:04.049> not<00:02:04.170> really<00:02:04.290> good<00:02:04.579> good<00:02:05.579> thing<00:02:05.850> but

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
so that's not really good good thing but

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.830 
so that's not really good good thing but
when<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.780> get<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.799> tangles<00:02:08.190> out<00:02:08.340> they<00:02:09.330> pretty

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
when you get the tangles out they pretty

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.290 
when you get the tangles out they pretty
much<00:02:09.959> stay<00:02:10.709> out<00:02:10.979> so<00:02:11.280> it's<00:02:11.370> not<00:02:11.489> that<00:02:11.700> bad<00:02:11.879> no

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
much stay out so it's not that bad no

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.640 
much stay out so it's not that bad no
the<00:02:12.360> thing<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:12.690> don't<00:02:12.960> like<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.350> that<00:02:13.380> it

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
the thing that I don't like is that it

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.720 
the thing that I don't like is that it
sheds<00:02:13.980> um<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.790> did<00:02:14.970> have<00:02:15.120> my<00:02:15.150> coming<00:02:15.690> here

to be ever seen yeah you can see just a

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.150 
to be ever seen yeah you can see just a
little<00:02:27.390> bit<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.630> shedding<00:02:27.900> um<00:02:29.810> but<00:02:30.810> yeah<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.620> it

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
little bit of shedding um but yeah so it

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.490 
little bit of shedding um but yeah so it
does<00:02:32.970> which<00:02:33.390> I<00:02:33.630> mean<00:02:33.810> you<00:02:33.960> know<00:02:34.050> all<00:02:34.260> have

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500

does which I mean you know all have
chefs<00:02:34.830> but<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.070> think<00:02:35.370> it<00:02:35.490> sheds<00:02:35.760> more<00:02:36.480> than

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780
