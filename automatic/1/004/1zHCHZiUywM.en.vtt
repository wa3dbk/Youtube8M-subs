part of the park and you know it's just
a<00:00:18.900> simple<00:00:19.350> basics<00:00:20.130> jump<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:21.480> know<00:00:21.600> then<00:00:21.900> mini

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
a simple basics jump you know then mini

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.740 
a simple basics jump you know then mini
halfpipe<00:00:25.160> next<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.340> got<00:00:26.810> this<00:00:29.119> the<00:00:30.119> rails<00:00:30.390> part

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
halfpipe next we got this the rails part

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.280 
halfpipe next we got this the rails part
this<00:00:31.170> it<00:00:31.320> has<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.710> be<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.009> hardest<00:00:32.930> part<00:00:33.930> of

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
this it has to be the hardest part of

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.459 
this it has to be the hardest part of
park<00:00:35.210> there's<00:00:36.210> four<00:00:36.600> parts<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.079> park<00:00:37.320> by

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
park there's four parts of this park by

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.950 
park there's four parts of this park by
the<00:00:37.530> way<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.969> it's<00:00:38.969> pretty<00:00:39.360> hard<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.719> actually

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
the way and it's pretty hard to actually

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.400 
the way and it's pretty hard to actually
land<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.710> perfectly<00:00:41.219> but<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.660> possible

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
land that perfectly but it is possible

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.660 
land that perfectly but it is possible
on<00:00:43.829> all<00:00:44.160> three<00:00:44.460> rails<00:00:44.700> just<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.690> know<00:00:45.780> for<00:00:46.680> you

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
on all three rails just you know for you

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.279 
on all three rails just you know for you
know<00:00:47.789> just<00:00:48.090> in<00:00:48.239> case<00:00:48.300> some<00:00:48.690> people<00:00:48.989> think<00:00:49.140> is

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
know just in case some people think is

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.270 
know just in case some people think is
it<00:00:49.410> possible<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.190> know<00:00:50.280> there<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.520> go<00:00:50.719> ok

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
it possible and you know there you go ok

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.250 
it possible and you know there you go ok
so<00:00:53.280> for<00:00:53.520> those<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:54.180> who<00:00:54.390> don't<00:00:54.629> think

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
so for those of you who don't think

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.790 
so for those of you who don't think
that's<00:00:55.649> possible<00:00:55.800> well<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.420> got<00:00:57.800> you

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
that's possible well you just got you

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.240 
that's possible well you just got you
know<00:00:58.890> I<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.070> proved<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.579> and<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.480> its<00:01:00.629> aims<00:01:01.250> so

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
know I just proved it and it its aims so

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.939 
know I just proved it and it its aims so
next<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.270> pretty<00:01:03.870> much<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.140> simplest<00:01:04.830> of

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
next this is pretty much the simplest of

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:12.010 
next this is pretty much the simplest of
all<00:01:05.100> these<00:01:06.380> it<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.520> tube<00:01:08.790> just<00:01:10.010> just<00:01:11.010> to<00:01:11.130> do

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
all these it is the tube just just to do

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.300 
all these it is the tube just just to do
now<00:01:13.020> for<00:01:13.229> some<00:01:13.409> reason<00:01:13.560> people<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:14.100> trouble

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
now for some reason people have trouble

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.640 
now for some reason people have trouble
getting<00:01:14.640> into<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.180> tube<00:01:15.450> for<00:01:16.200> whatever

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
getting into this tube for whatever

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.520 
getting into this tube for whatever
reason<00:01:17.330> when<00:01:18.330> my<00:01:18.450> friends<00:01:18.810> did<00:01:18.990> but<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.409> don't

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
reason when my friends did but I don't

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.160 
reason when my friends did but I don't
know<00:01:19.710> why<00:01:19.860> but<00:01:20.100> if<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.210> do<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> grab<00:01:21.689> trick<00:01:21.990> it's

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
know why but if you do a grab trick it's

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.819 
know why but if you do a grab trick it's
so<00:01:22.380> much<00:01:22.560> easier<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.890> get<00:01:23.040> in<00:01:24.229> we<00:01:25.880> all<00:01:26.880> fail

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 
so much easier to get in we all fail

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.510 
so much easier to get in we all fail
anyways<00:01:28.829> then<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.970> final<00:01:30.420> one

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
anyways then this final one

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.109 
anyways then this final one
this<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.719> being<00:01:34.619> blocked<00:01:34.950> by<00:01:35.159> every<00:01:35.579> possible

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
this is being blocked by every possible

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.980 
this is being blocked by every possible
thing<00:01:36.359> on<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.950> screen<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:39.119> other<00:01:39.299> two<00:01:39.570> the
