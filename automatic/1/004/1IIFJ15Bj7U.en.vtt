of a wet blanket on well with all these

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.640 
of a wet blanket on well with all these
mining<00:02:30.920> guys<00:02:31.280> who<00:02:31.820> are<00:02:32.020> saying<00:02:33.020> how<00:02:33.290> we're<00:02:33.470> all

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
mining guys who are saying how we're all

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.140 
mining guys who are saying how we're all
going<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:33.890> become<00:02:34.220> if<00:02:34.340> not<00:02:34.520> millionaires

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
going to become if not millionaires

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.060 
going to become if not millionaires
maybe<00:02:35.480> billionaires<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.410> I<00:02:36.470> was<00:02:36.650> saying<00:02:36.860> you

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.010 
know what we've had a good lawn party
already<00:02:39.620> maybe<00:02:40.580> we<00:02:40.820> should<00:02:41.060> chill<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:41.930> a

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
already maybe we should chill it a

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.690 
already maybe we should chill it a
little<00:02:42.200> bit<00:02:42.440> so<00:02:42.620> that<00:02:42.650> was<00:02:43.010> the<00:02:43.190> essence<00:02:43.550> of

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
little bit so that was the essence of

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.030 
little bit so that was the essence of
what<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:43.940> said<00:02:44.300> despite<00:02:45.260> all<00:02:45.440> of<00:02:45.470> the<00:02:45.680> issues

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
what I said despite all of the issues

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.250 
what I said despite all of the issues
the<00:02:46.220> political<00:02:46.810> issues<00:02:47.810> environmental

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
the political issues environmental

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.310 
the political issues environmental
issues<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.430> NGOs<00:02:50.000> everything<00:02:50.450> else<00:02:50.630> you

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
issues the NGOs everything else you

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.780 
issues the NGOs everything else you
still<00:02:51.560> think<00:02:51.770> there's<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:52.010> boom<00:02:52.220> in<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.460> mining

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
still think there's a boom in the mining

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.240 
still think there's a boom in the mining
stocks<00:02:53.090> coming<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.690> do<00:02:54.170> because<00:02:54.980> I've<00:02:55.220> been

ninety five percent they fall more than
they<00:03:16.100> go<00:03:16.280> up<00:03:16.460> because<00:03:16.640> most<00:03:17.000> of<00:03:17.180> them<00:03:17.330> are

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
they go up because most of them are

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.650 
they go up because most of them are

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
intrinsically worthless these stocks and

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.350 
intrinsically worthless these stocks and
I<00:03:21.260> think<00:03:21.740> with<00:03:22.010> the<00:03:22.250> government's<00:03:22.820> all<00:03:23.030> around

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
I think with the government's all around

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.410 
I think with the government's all around
the<00:03:23.480> world<00:03:23.660> creating<00:03:24.520> trillions<00:03:25.520> of<00:03:25.760> currency

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
the world creating trillions of currency

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.190 
the world creating trillions of currency
units<00:03:26.780> in<00:03:26.990> a<00:03:27.110> futile<00:03:27.980> attempt<00:03:28.520> to<00:03:28.790> prop<00:03:29.270> up<00:03:29.300> the

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 
way into commodities particularly gold

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.020 
way into commodities particularly gold
and<00:03:41.260> some<00:03:42.260> of<00:03:42.410> that<00:03:42.980> money<00:03:43.160> is<00:03:43.459> going<00:03:43.700> to<00:03:43.820> find

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
its way into a junior mining companies

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.400 
its way into a junior mining companies
which<00:03:48.410> are<00:03:48.590> actually<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:49.520> most<00:03:49.700> volatile

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
which are actually the most volatile

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.900 
which are actually the most volatile
securities<00:03:51.410> on<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:52.040> face<00:03:52.190> of<00:03:52.220> the<00:03:52.490> earth<00:03:52.520> more

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
securities on the face of the earth more

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.580 
securities on the face of the earth more
volatile<00:03:53.390> than<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.690> internet<00:03:54.020> stocks<00:03:54.320> ever

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
volatile than the internet stocks ever

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.010 
volatile than the internet stocks ever
were<00:03:54.830> so<00:03:55.730> I<00:03:56.060> think<00:03:56.120> there's<00:03:56.480> an<00:03:56.570> excellent

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
were so I think there's an excellent

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.620 
were so I think there's an excellent
chance<00:03:57.730> notwithstanding<00:03:58.730> the<00:03:59.240> fact<00:03:59.420> that

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
chance notwithstanding the fact that

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.380 
chance notwithstanding the fact that
mining<00:04:00.080> is<00:04:00.200> a<00:04:00.230> lousy<00:04:00.740> business<00:04:01.190> I<00:04:01.610> think

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
mining is a lousy business I think

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.570 
mining is a lousy business I think
there's<00:04:02.540> an<00:04:02.660> excellent<00:04:03.080> chance<00:04:03.430> that<00:04:04.430> we're

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
there's an excellent chance that we're

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.430 
there's an excellent chance that we're
going<00:04:04.730> to<00:04:04.790> see<00:04:05.030> a<00:04:05.060> real<00:04:05.510> bubble<00:04:05.990> in<00:04:06.140> these

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
going to see a real bubble in these

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.170 
going to see a real bubble in these
mining<00:04:06.740> stocks<00:04:07.130> it<00:04:07.550> could<00:04:07.790> be<00:04:07.880> the<00:04:07.970> biggest

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
mining stocks it could be the biggest

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.090 
mining stocks it could be the biggest
one<00:04:08.480> ever<00:04:08.510> now<00:04:09.050> do<00:04:09.350> you<00:04:09.440> mean<00:04:09.590> all<00:04:09.830> mining

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
one ever now do you mean all mining
