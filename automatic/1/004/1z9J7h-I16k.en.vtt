 Peruvian who comes to participate in the 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.440
 South American chili has been prepared 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.300
 since the beginning of the year and will seek 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.510
 improve your participation in 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.909
 modalities of only duet and equipment and so 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.579
 leave the name as high as possible 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:06.770
 from Peru we were very nervous 6 super 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:10.290
 nervous also very this one 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.600
 motivated that we're going to go 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.340
 and the truth is that all we want is 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.830
 do a good role in the Pan-American 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.720
 representing our country and leaving the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.220
 double but well of so much we have to 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.140
 be very concentrated that we do not have 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.940
 to let the nerves not think and 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.980
 always controlling ourselves 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.080
 our minds and showing an attitude 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.540
 competitive that we have been training 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.760
 about two months ago two months and 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.280
 medium 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.320
 we start with many forces many 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.160
 you win because we wanted him to be in this 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:42.770
 gone but this step we're going to get past 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.900
 forward we are well prepared our 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.790
 team is doing very well at 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.530
 expectations of this competition I think 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.660
 which is to show that we have improved 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.090
 between the South American that was in March 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.750
 now the Pan American raise the score 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.850
 both technically that figures and 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.560
 artistic that is the routine will be three 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.840
 athletes will compete in the 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.840
 juniors category and ten in the juvenile 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.729
 optimism is at its maximum and while it is 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.750
 true will try to locate among the 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.240
 first places 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.520
 the goal of these girls goes beyond 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.340
 of getting a medal the girls 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.960
 they are prepared they are confident of everything 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.630
 the work they have done in these in 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.300
 this season and the truth we are with 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.950
 many encouragement to represent Peru and 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.540
 to improve the look of technical aspect 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.590
 especially in the last presentation that 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.840
 we had in the South American in Chile 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.910
 and improve this aspect not the goal 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.340
 beyond getting a medal 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.470
 I'm going to get a medal is to improve 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.820
 the performance we had in the last 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.670
 competition as such I'm mentioning 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.860
 in the South American because the medal in 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.950
 a Pan-American really is quite 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.680
 ambitious and to be frank our 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.290
 level is not yet for that talent 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.660
 there's just need more support and 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.300
 dissemination by the authorities 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.580
 we have a work plan that I hope 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:07.070
 that is supported by the ipe of the 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.260
 federation so that girls can 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.840
 be prepared with a preparer 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.180
 physical that a psychologist is prepared 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.220
 with a work team so that 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.710
 this way girls can grow up in 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.680
 the synchronized swimming and so have 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:24.940
 results in 2014-2015 can see a 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.940
 much stronger selection
