00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.330
 draw me a knight to draw 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.040
 a knight it's very easy 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.559
 let's start by drawing in 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:21.750
 flattened rhombus with two kinds 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:24.240
 on the sides then draws 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.340
 a semicircle above the rhombus and 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.340
 a small square above the half circle 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:37.500
 starting from the square draws to the knight 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.300
 a well rounded ponytail one has to 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:45.780
 feel like she's coming out of the door 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:48.450
 and the eyelashes a horizontal line under the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.520
 rhombus which must exceed 3 cm 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.460
 left and a little bit on the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.199
 right from each side of the mans 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:04.199
 will try these two big very rounded 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:06.299
 that come together at the tip end makes 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.900
 again the same shape smaller to 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.900
 interior 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.110
 you now have the shape of the shield of 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.090
 your knight now draws the cost 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:24.270
 of your knight and begins to draw 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:26.340
 a rounded for his shoulder draws 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:36.840
 the knight's epaulet and his second 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:38.610
 shoulder half hidden by asses in 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.550
 starting from the epaulette you can draw 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.380
 two sticks that will form the arm and 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.630
 makes an angle to show that the arm 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:51.150
 is folded it is necessary that we see well 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.860
 the rounding of the arm on this second 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:55.460
 part of the signs of small scratches 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.460
 courbet 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.960
 at the end of the arm draws a hand like 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.350
 if she held something must 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.350
 to close 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.650
 at the bottom of the hand traces of small 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:25.080
 traits and a ball that will be part of the 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:27.060
 mans I pay them now draws a 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.120
 elongated rectangle on the top of the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.120
 hand 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.130
 from there you can shoot two big 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.700
 traits that meet at the end in 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.700
 point 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.700
 you now have a big feature at 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.980
 middle of the sword starting from the bottom and 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:52.350
 stop before the box your sword and 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.870
 draw signs the bust of the 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.970
 knight in two stages first the 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:06.390
 long part then another part more 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:08.430
 always rounded on the same line of the 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.500
 bust you can draw the first leg 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.540
 of the knight by not forgetting 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.540
 mark very high level of the knees 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:29.540
 now draws the right foot that 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:31.010
 share on the very long side you can 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.800
 now as for the first 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.980
 draw the second leg that will be hidden 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.360
 half by the knight's shield 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.550
 think well to do the traits that mark 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.020
 the knees and to make the foot off 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.020
 from the other direction to the left 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.670
 you can now do some very 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.060
 rounded on both feet keeping the 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.060
 Same direction 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.630
 then you have to make it a real cap 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.459
 knight and for that starts with the 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.970
 left draws a line that starts from 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.260
 shield the effect of wavelets at the end 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.329
 between his legs continues the 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.139
 wavelets and the right side the same 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.810
 stroke and ripples all knight 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.730
 to a cape ready to fly in the wind it is necessary 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.440
 that you trace the grill of his helmet 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.040
 with small vertical strokes in 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.040
 all the rhombus 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:39.210
 and now you can color your 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.210
 knight
