00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.020 
sort of ride that the original car was
meant<00:02:10.989> to<00:02:11.080> have<00:02:11.349> now<00:02:12.160> as<00:02:12.400> well<00:02:12.580> as<00:02:12.790> new

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
meant to have now as well as new

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.360 
meant to have now as well as new
suspension<00:02:13.420> it's<00:02:13.810> also<00:02:14.140> got<00:02:14.650> adaptive

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
suspension it's also got adaptive

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.880 
suspension it's also got adaptive
damping<00:02:15.970> which<00:02:16.420> alters<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.140> shock<00:02:17.379> absorbers

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
damping which alters the shock absorbers

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.009 
damping which alters the shock absorbers
depending<00:02:18.370> on<00:02:18.489> the<00:02:18.610> road<00:02:18.790> surface<00:02:19.150> and<00:02:19.569> the

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
depending on the road surface and the

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.920 
depending on the road surface and the
speed<00:02:20.379> and<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.950> works<00:02:21.220> well<00:02:21.610> now<00:02:22.480> over<00:02:22.840> this

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
speed and it works well now over this

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.100 
speed and it works well now over this
really<00:02:23.379> potholed<00:02:24.069> nasty<00:02:24.849> tarmac<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.750> ride<00:02:25.930> is

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
really potholed nasty tarmac the ride is

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.470 
really potholed nasty tarmac the ride is
commendably<00:02:26.560> smooth<00:02:26.920> but<00:02:27.489> if<00:02:27.849> I<00:02:28.000> start<00:02:28.330> to

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
commendably smooth but if I start to

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.100 
commendably smooth but if I start to
drive<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:28.930> like<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.110> stone

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
drive it like a stone

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.210 
drive it like a stone
then<00:02:30.410> things<00:02:30.710> firm<00:02:31.070> up<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.550> beast<00:02:31.790> handling

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
then things firm up to beast handling

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.940 
then things firm up to beast handling
so<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.120> a-class<00:02:34.450> is<00:02:34.540> good<00:02:34.990> but<00:02:35.320> is<00:02:35.530> it<00:02:35.710> good

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
so the a-class is good but is it good

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.010 
so the a-class is good but is it good
enough<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.220> beat<00:02:36.460> our<00:02:36.640> favourite<00:02:37.210> compact<00:02:37.750> car

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
enough to beat our favourite compact car

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.650 
enough to beat our favourite compact car

sit much lower down

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.340

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
in throwing the thing about the steering

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.540 
in throwing the thing about the steering
is<00:02:50.050> more<00:02:50.290> heavily<00:02:50.560> weighted<00:02:50.650> delivering

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
is more heavily weighted delivering

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.150 
is more heavily weighted delivering
better<00:02:51.820> feedback<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.720> because<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.740> controls

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
better feedback and because the controls

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.800 
better feedback and because the controls
in<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.370> dash<00:02:54.610> are<00:02:54.850> tilted<00:02:55.300> towards<00:02:55.750> the

be the quickest but both surprisingly

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.440 
be the quickest but both surprisingly
have<00:03:13.459> similar<00:03:13.910> stopping<00:03:14.300> power<00:03:15.910> but<00:03:16.910> if<00:03:17.239> your

priority for a baby prestige car is

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.420 
priority for a baby prestige car is
practicality<00:03:20.900> then<00:03:21.410> the<00:03:21.590> Merc<00:03:21.800> beats<00:03:22.280> the

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
practicality then the Merc beats the

practicality then the Merc beats the
Beemer<00:03:22.819> hands-down<00:03:24.459> with<00:03:25.459> that<00:03:25.670> engine

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
Beemer hands-down with that engine

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.820 
Beemer hands-down with that engine
cunningly<00:03:26.540> hidden<00:03:26.690> under<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.290> front<00:03:27.470> seats

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
cunningly hidden under the front seats

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.620 
cunningly hidden under the front seats
the<00:03:28.099> a-class<00:03:28.430> doesn't<00:03:28.970> need<00:03:29.090> a<00:03:29.120> long<00:03:29.360> bonnet

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
the a-class doesn't need a long bonnet

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.410 
the a-class doesn't need a long bonnet
so<00:03:30.200> it's<00:03:30.410> noticeably<00:03:30.830> shorter<00:03:31.310> and<00:03:31.700> hand<00:03:32.269> it

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
so it's noticeably shorter and hand it

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.520 
so it's noticeably shorter and hand it
to<00:03:32.450> park<00:03:34.450> there's<00:03:35.450> more<00:03:35.810> rear<00:03:36.049> legroom<00:03:36.080> than

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
to park there's more rear legroom than

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.490 
to park there's more rear legroom than
the<00:03:36.860> BM<00:03:37.160> and<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:38.090> feels<00:03:38.360> far<00:03:38.720> more<00:03:38.870> spacious

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
the BM and it feels far more spacious

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.360 
the BM and it feels far more spacious
because<00:03:39.860> the<00:03:40.160> roofline<00:03:40.580> is<00:03:40.880> so<00:03:41.090> much<00:03:41.269> higher

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
because the roofline is so much higher

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.520 
because the roofline is so much higher
and<00:03:43.450> because<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.569> rear<00:03:44.720> seats<00:03:44.959> are<00:03:45.080> removable

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
and because the rear seats are removable

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.740 
and because the rear seats are removable
you're<00:03:45.860> a<00:03:46.010> class<00:03:46.250> can<00:03:46.489> be<00:03:46.580> turned<00:03:46.850> into<00:03:47.000> a<00:03:47.269> van

you're a class can be turned into a van

at last we have a baby Mercedes that's
worth<00:03:51.410> spending<00:03:51.709> money<00:03:52.280> on<00:03:52.370> now<00:03:53.120> okay<00:03:53.690> it<00:03:53.930> may

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
worth spending money on now okay it may

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.110 
worth spending money on now okay it may
