00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.120
 2. 3 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.150
 frank what are the expectations for 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.150
 appear second semester of the tournament 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:21.000
 good afternoon and always one when 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.800
 start or restart something is with the best 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.300
 expectation 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.300
 more of reality and from 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.580
 none can not be seen of that 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.680
 always try to 73 overcome the 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.270
 own reality there is an anxiety of the 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.739
 fans calculations that you also for 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.350
 the issue of reinforcements could speak 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.180
 something with the leadership today is constant 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.690
 the dialogue with the market leadership 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.690
 It's very difficult 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.890
 it would be good 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:53.620
 that the reinforcements are in time in 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.900
 form they fit within the 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.630
 economic logic are framed within 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:01.320
 the football need and also 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.320
 within 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.510
 the features that are needed 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.570
 it's easy then it happens in the 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.570
 times that I do not eat like 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.690
 as counselor of the team would pretend 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.320
 and the figures that are handled are 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.320
 sidereal 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.280
 and we need to bring 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.480
 punctually players whose 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.340
 characteristics comply with their own 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.350
 needs not of positions and hierarchy 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.060
 the posts are going to be midfield and 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.340
 forward as it comes naming 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.700
 points towards that is aimed towards that or 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.600
 be 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.600
 our need 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.180
 positional 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.440
 would imply that they are within 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.850
 options that you raise 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.230
 but it also has to do with 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.030
 characteristics of one's own 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.100
 versatility that those 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.380
 players in that group only one 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.530
 position we will see that we can 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.660
 achieve if they do not reach 22 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.460
 strong you want to fix with the 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.729
 who are or would seek some reinforcement for 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.400
 to sell 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.400
 and to translate those two possibilities 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.020
 I will repeat 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.120
 one as a technician can ask 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.290
 with his own name and in fact 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.760
 I have done it but 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.230
 then good in as I said earlier 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.739
 you have to reconcile a lot of 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.190
 other factors that make another series of 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:37.110
 needs and possibilities 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.090
 the idea is to bring the two reinforcements and 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.880
 these three talking about the names of 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.280
 frank of milk to disk in the last 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.070
 days that you would like to play in hurricane not 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.720
 I know if you could hear it and we want 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.700
 know how much is true that there is a 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.030
 interest in the quilmes goal scorer 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.300
 good we 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:01.280
 we already have it in a TV 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:04.220
 grid so to speak of options 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.400
 is not the only one is a power that brings together 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.090
 important conditions 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.090
 by characteristics by 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.090
 goal scorer 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.489
 but I insist it is inside him 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.709
 of several options or some options 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:22.599
 more that is very good now yes it 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.069
 consulted by two players Juan JosÃ© 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.079
 arraya and alejandro capurro that in the 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.790
 last days some were heard 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.860
 rumors that maybe they could not 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.450
 continue on campus or maybe that 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.980
 they had offers of other equipment 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.050
 I can talk to you with them that we 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.160
 can you say about it 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.160
 tell him what 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:44.959
 that rumor is the first I hear it 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.400
 and I do not handle myself because of rumors 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.219
 things both in football and in life 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.280
 or in life as in football has that 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:54.409
 reality if some do not want to continue in 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.060
 the campus will surely say it yet 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:57.650
 they did not tell him anything 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.480
 absolutely the opposite I have spoken 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.909
 with both justly but of others 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.680
 aspects and the need we have for 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:05.500
 the team and in which they form 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.690
 part so 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.400
 I can not answer something I do not know and 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.380
 the second good that can tell us of 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.400
 luca soda and lucas youth bells 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.810
 who are going to perform their first 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.730
 preseason 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.800
 well that's done 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.630
 if I'm not wrong a month that is 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:23.820
 practicing with us when in the 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.800
 stage that ended last year 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.840
 and bell we have the best 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.190
 references given by the coaching staff 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.850
 Matthew 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.340
 so it's not bad that you enter 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:39.070
 a new preseason for them is 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.900
 important if they know how to take advantage of 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.610
 few days it ended up going to the rangers 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.460
 of chile alexis ferrero you wanted 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.100
 to have him maybe he wanted me not to 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:52.230
 have it on campus or not so clear what 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:55.150
 what happens that today Mr. money 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:58.480
 is above any other 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.180
 any kind of options that one can 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.380
 have and is understood beyond what 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:08.479
 I would have loved 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:08.479
 you did not have the routine to
