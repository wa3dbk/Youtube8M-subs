after<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:47.100> certain<00:01:47.399> point<00:01:47.790> right<00:01:48.210> once<00:01:48.479> I

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
after a certain point right once I

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.929 
after a certain point right once I
stopped<00:01:48.930> making<00:01:49.350> content<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:50.280> almost<00:01:50.520> felt

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
stopped making content it almost felt

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.289 
stopped making content it almost felt
like<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.990> was<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.619> difficult<00:01:53.130> to<00:01:53.579> just<00:01:53.790> restart

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
like it was so difficult to just restart

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.469 
like it was so difficult to just restart
doing<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.780> stuff<00:01:55.020> because<00:01:56.210> every<00:01:57.210> time<00:01:57.240> I

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
doing the stuff because every time I

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.209 
doing the stuff because every time I
would<00:01:57.659> just<00:01:57.840> try<00:01:58.049> to<00:01:58.079> write<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> script<00:01:58.950> for

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
would just try to write a script for

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.600 
would just try to write a script for
something<00:01:59.329> you<00:02:00.329> know<00:02:00.479> for<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.140> review<00:02:01.770> or<00:02:01.979> an

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
something you know for a review or an

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.760 
something you know for a review or an
opinion<00:02:03.149> based<00:02:03.329> video<00:02:03.689> or<00:02:03.960> whatever<00:02:04.200> right<00:02:04.560> I

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
opinion based video or whatever right I

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.530 
opinion based video or whatever right I
would<00:02:05.250> just<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.670> would<00:02:05.729> just<00:02:06.000> write<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.360> right

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
would just I would just write it right

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.510 
would just I would just write it right
now<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:06.960> motor<00:02:07.590> dissatisfied<00:02:08.280> with<00:02:08.310> that

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
now this motor dissatisfied with that

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.090 
now this motor dissatisfied with that
and<00:02:08.700> then<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.179> would<00:02:09.330> just<00:02:09.569> I<00:02:09.780> would<00:02:10.080> look<00:02:10.470> at<00:02:10.679> it

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
and then I would just I would look at it

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.220 
and then I would just I would look at it
and<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.640> for<00:02:12.030> some<00:02:12.300> reason<00:02:12.330> all<00:02:12.870> these

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
and and for some reason all these

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.430 
and and for some reason all these
insecurities<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:15.360> confidence<00:02:15.990> in<00:02:16.200> my

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
insecurities and in confidence in my

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.130 
insecurities and in confidence in my
content<00:02:17.190> would<00:02:17.610> creep<00:02:17.850> up<00:02:18.030> in<00:02:18.270> my<00:02:18.420> head<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:18.840> I

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
content would creep up in my head and I

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.780 
content would creep up in my head and I
just<00:02:19.320> wouldn't<00:02:19.560> be<00:02:19.650> able<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.890> finish<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:20.280> up<00:02:20.550> to

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
just wouldn't be able to finish it up to

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.890 
just wouldn't be able to finish it up to
follow<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.240> through<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:22.190> I<00:02:23.270> think<00:02:24.270> it's

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
follow it through and I think it's

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.950 
follow it through and I think it's
largely<00:02:25.200> because<00:02:25.560> i'm<00:02:25.710> retarded<00:02:26.210> right<00:02:27.210> that

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
largely because i'm retarded right that

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.270 
largely because i'm retarded right that
there's<00:02:28.140> no<00:02:28.260> justification<00:02:28.620> i<00:02:28.860> cannot<00:02:29.160> say

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
there's no justification i cannot say

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.740 
there's no justification i cannot say
like<00:02:29.430> oh<00:02:29.550> yeah<00:02:29.730> because<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.150> was<00:02:30.270> terrible<00:02:30.600> i

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
like oh yeah because it was terrible i

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.870 
like oh yeah because it was terrible i
think<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.410> was<00:02:31.500> pretty<00:02:31.680> good<00:02:31.920> just<00:02:32.550> for<00:02:32.700> some

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
think it was pretty good just for some

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.840 
think it was pretty good just for some
