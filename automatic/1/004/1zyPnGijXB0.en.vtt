this industrial looking home that I'm

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.790 
this industrial looking home that I'm
touring<00:00:14.610> today<00:00:15.030> and<00:00:15.299> what<00:00:15.870> makes<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.289> truly

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
touring today and what makes it truly

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.099 
touring today and what makes it truly
unique<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.850> it's<00:00:18.029> made<00:00:18.300> out<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.779> used

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
unique is that it's made out of used

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:33.430 
unique is that it's made out of used
shipping<00:00:19.800> containers

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.079 

my<00:00:34.440> education<00:00:35.039> and<00:00:35.129> environmental<00:00:35.609> design

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:36.089 
my education and environmental design

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:39.259 
my education and environmental design
led<00:00:36.750> me<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.109> very<00:00:37.260> green<00:00:37.589> direction<00:00:37.769> and<00:00:38.489> all

00:00:39.259 --> 00:00:39.269 
led me in a very green direction and all

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:41.119 
led me in a very green direction and all
the<00:00:39.390> alternatives<00:00:39.960> are<00:00:40.320> there<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.769> wanted<00:00:41.039> to

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
the alternatives are there I wanted to

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.829 
the alternatives are there I wanted to
explore<00:00:41.489> one<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.729> the<00:00:41.789> newer<00:00:41.940> ones<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.629> there

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:42.839 
explore one of the newer ones that there

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:44.899 
explore one of the newer ones that there
are<00:00:43.170> only<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.800> couple<00:00:43.949> examples<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.579> container

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:44.909 
are only a couple examples of container

00:00:44.909 --> 00:00:46.790 
are only a couple examples of container
houses<00:00:45.329> all<00:00:45.600> across<00:00:45.899> Canada<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.409> only<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> few

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
houses all across Canada and only a few

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.439 
houses all across Canada and only a few
in<00:00:47.309> throughout<00:00:47.699> North<00:00:47.940> America

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
in throughout North America

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:49.880 
in throughout North America
it<00:00:48.539> takes<00:00:48.809> a<00:00:48.930> lot<00:00:49.049> of<00:00:49.079> preparation<00:00:49.379> and

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
it takes a lot of preparation and

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.100 
it takes a lot of preparation and
planning<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:51.119> beauty<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.390> containers<00:00:51.960> is

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
planning the beauty of containers is

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.209 
planning the beauty of containers is
that<00:00:52.350> they're<00:00:52.589> very<00:00:54.500> predictable<00:00:55.500> in<00:00:55.890> size

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
that they're very predictable in size

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.000 
that they're very predictable in size
and<00:00:56.670> shape<00:00:57.059> innovation<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.109> often<00:00:58.409> the<00:00:58.769> key

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
and shape innovation is often the key

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.189 
and shape innovation is often the key
with<00:00:59.339> green<00:00:59.609> practices<00:00:59.909> and<00:01:00.420> development<00:01:00.989> and

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
with green practices and development and

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.709 
with green practices and development and
when<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.799> comes<00:01:01.979> to<00:01:02.280> turning<00:01:02.549> retired<00:01:03.180> metal

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
when it comes to turning retired metal

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.930 
when it comes to turning retired metal
boxes<00:01:04.199> into<00:01:04.440> modern<00:01:04.890> housing<00:01:05.369> that

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
boxes into modern housing that

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.240 
boxes into modern housing that
innovation<00:01:06.630> begins<00:01:06.869> with<00:01:07.409> simple<00:01:07.890> building

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
innovation begins with simple building

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.790 
innovation begins with simple building
blocks<00:01:08.569> quite<00:01:09.569> often<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.050> early<00:01:10.289> stages

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
blocks quite often in the early stages

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.040 
blocks quite often in the early stages
of<00:01:10.950> development<00:01:11.460> -<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.819> design<00:01:12.179> I'll<00:01:12.659> start

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
of development - the design I'll start

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.460 
of development - the design I'll start
with<00:01:14.000> containers<00:01:15.000> models<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.050> I<00:01:16.140> got<00:01:16.319> from

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
with containers models that I got from

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.320 
with containers models that I got from
the<00:01:16.619> local<00:01:16.890> hobby<00:01:17.069> store<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.759> lot<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:18.030> train

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
the local hobby store a lot of train

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.190 
the local hobby store a lot of train
collectors<00:01:18.810> use<00:01:19.440> these<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:20.159> create<00:01:20.640> villages

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
collectors use these to create villages

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.559 
collectors use these to create villages
but<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.259> between<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:23.130> stack<00:01:23.729> together<00:01:24.149> and<00:01:24.420> get

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:24.569 
but I between to stack together and get

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:26.270 
but I between to stack together and get
a<00:01:24.600> feeling<00:01:24.840> for<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.200> shape<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.679> size<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.130> a

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
a feeling for the shape and size of a
