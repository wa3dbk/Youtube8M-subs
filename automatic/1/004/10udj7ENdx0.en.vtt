00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
a feeling the you stones aren't gonna

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.620 
a feeling the you stones aren't gonna
match<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:41.510> maybe<00:02:42.510> he<00:02:43.019> won't<00:02:43.410> like<00:02:44.330> looks<00:02:45.330> of

youth<00:02:56.760> parts<00:02:58.160> they're<00:02:59.160> supposed<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.580> be<00:02:59.760> good
