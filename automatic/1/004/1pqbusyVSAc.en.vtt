00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
is pretty too but I'm just gonna cut

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.390 
is pretty too but I'm just gonna cut
their<00:02:26.030> hair<00:02:26.270> because<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:26.960> don't<00:02:27.410> want<00:02:27.650> any<00:02:27.950> hair

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
their hair because I don't want any hair

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.260 
their hair because I don't want any hair
in<00:02:28.730> my<00:02:29.180> face<00:02:29.650> and<00:02:30.650> the<00:02:31.010> hair<00:02:31.280> is<00:02:31.550> really<00:02:31.880> soft

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
in my face and the hair is really soft

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.560 
in my face and the hair is really soft
to<00:02:32.510> touch<00:02:32.810> but<00:02:33.140> it<00:02:33.290> does<00:02:33.590> tangle<00:02:34.250> on<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:35.330> box

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
to touch but it does tangle on the box

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.720 
to touch but it does tangle on the box
it<00:02:35.810> says<00:02:35.840> tangle<00:02:36.560> free<00:02:36.590> but<00:02:37.190> I<00:02:37.220> guess<00:02:37.520> because

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
it says tangle free but I guess because

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.510 
it says tangle free but I guess because
it<00:02:38.030> synthetic<00:02:38.360> hair<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:39.440> know<00:02:39.560> it's<00:02:39.740> wrong<00:02:40.070> to

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
it synthetic hair you know it's wrong to

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.380 
it synthetic hair you know it's wrong to
tangle<00:02:41.210> so<00:02:41.480> that's<00:02:41.690> normal

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
tangle so that's normal

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.940 
tangle so that's normal
I'm<00:02:44.390> just<00:02:44.600> going<00:02:44.720> to<00:02:44.870> take<00:02:45.050> my<00:02:45.260> scissors<00:02:45.590> and

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
I'm just going to take my scissors and

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.690 
I'm just going to take my scissors and

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.560 
slant Li but I prefer to cut straight
down<00:02:51.770> because<00:02:52.580> I<00:02:52.700> want<00:02:52.970> it<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.240> be<00:02:53.390> really
