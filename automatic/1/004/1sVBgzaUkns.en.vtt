00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
waves of battle pods and then once

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.110 
waves of battle pods and then once
they're<00:02:12.840> done<00:02:13.050> you'll<00:02:13.770> fly<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.550> left<00:02:14.790> and

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
they're done you'll fly to the left and

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.680 
they're done you'll fly to the left and
take<00:02:15.599> out<00:02:15.780> some<00:02:16.069> more<00:02:17.069> battle<00:02:17.370> pots<00:02:17.580> go<00:02:18.240> figure

take out some more battle pots go figure

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.000 
take out some more battle pots go figure
but<00:02:19.620> you'll<00:02:19.770> also<00:02:19.890> get<00:02:20.160> some<00:02:21.090> reentry<00:02:21.480> pods

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
but you'll also get some reentry pods

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.280 
but you'll also get some reentry pods
which<00:02:23.510> you<00:02:24.510> know<00:02:24.630> come<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.840> think<00:02:25.110> of<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.260> I

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
which you know come to think of it I

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.020 
which you know come to think of it I
don't<00:02:25.470> think<00:02:25.620> we've<00:02:25.740> actually<00:02:25.770> seen<00:02:26.610> range

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
don't think we've actually seen range

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.940 
don't think we've actually seen range
repots<00:02:27.450> yet<00:02:27.810> as<00:02:28.319> far<00:02:28.590> as<00:02:28.770> fighting<00:02:30.950> but

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
repots yet as far as fighting but

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.680 
repots yet as far as fighting but
there's<00:02:32.130> an<00:02:32.459> entry<00:02:32.910> pod<00:02:33.090> you<00:02:33.300> don't<00:02:33.450> have<00:02:33.569> to

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
there's an entry pod you don't have to

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.460 
there's an entry pod you don't have to
take<00:02:33.870> him<00:02:33.989> out<00:02:34.140> but<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:34.650> like<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.890> do<00:02:35.010> it<00:02:35.099> anyway

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.890 

and<00:02:39.010> nobody<00:02:39.370> leaves<00:02:39.580> alive<00:02:39.820> when<00:02:40.180> I'm<00:02:40.300> on<00:02:40.450> when

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
and nobody leaves alive when I'm on when

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.700 
and nobody leaves alive when I'm on when
I'm<00:02:41.020> on<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.290> job<00:02:42.510> so<00:02:43.510> fly<00:02:43.660> over<00:02:43.870> here<00:02:43.900> help<00:02:44.620> out

I'm on the job so fly over here help out

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:46.260 
I'm on the job so fly over here help out
here<00:02:44.890> oh<00:02:44.950> he's<00:02:45.310> not<00:02:45.550> really<00:02:45.730> gonna<00:02:45.880> help<00:02:46.090> you

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
here oh he's not really gonna help you

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.060 
here oh he's not really gonna help you
much<00:02:47.550> he's<00:02:48.550> kind<00:02:48.790> of<00:02:48.850> a<00:02:48.970> useless<00:02:49.210> tool<00:02:50.070> there's

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
much he's kind of a useless tool there's

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.820 
much he's kind of a useless tool there's
another<00:02:51.220> entry<00:02:51.550> pod<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:52.000> can<00:02:52.150> take<00:02:52.300> them<00:02:52.480> out

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
another entry pod you can take them out

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.440 
another entry pod you can take them out
it's<00:02:53.830> a<00:02:53.860> good<00:02:53.950> idea<00:02:54.100> too<00:02:54.520> because<00:02:54.880> they<00:02:55.300> can

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
it's a good idea too because they can

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.390 
it's a good idea too because they can
have<00:02:55.630> several<00:02:55.870> waves<00:02:56.140> of<00:02:56.590> battle<00:02:57.100> pods<00:02:57.280> that

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
have several waves of battle pods that

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.740 
have several waves of battle pods that
come<00:02:57.610> out<00:02:57.730> and<00:02:57.880> if<00:02:57.970> you<00:02:58.060> take<00:02:58.180> out<00:02:58.300> a<00:02:58.360> raid<00:02:58.570> tree

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
come out and if you take out a raid tree

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.100 
come out and if you take out a raid tree
pod<00:02:59.220> before<00:03:00.220> it's<00:03:00.550> landed<00:03:01.030> or<00:03:01.270> as<00:03:01.480> its<00:03:01.750> landing

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
pod before it's landed or as its landing

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:05.400 
pod before it's landed or as its landing
it'll<00:03:02.830> eliminate<00:03:03.040> all<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:04.210> battle<00:03:04.960> pods<00:03:05.140> in

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
it'll eliminate all the battle pods in

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.160 
it'll eliminate all the battle pods in
it<00:03:05.560> so<00:03:05.830> for<00:03:06.790> example<00:03:07.210> here<00:03:07.480> take<00:03:07.750> this<00:03:07.840> battle

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
it so for example here take this battle

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.150 
it so for example here take this battle
this<00:03:08.440> guy<00:03:08.620> out<00:03:08.970> know<00:03:09.970> about<00:03:10.150> a<00:03:10.180> positive<00:03:10.420> face

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
this guy out know about a positive face

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.320 
this guy out know about a positive face
trick<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.280> taking<00:03:12.520> them<00:03:12.640> out<00:03:12.790> is<00:03:12.820> like<00:03:13.090> taking

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
trick to taking them out is like taking

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.060 
trick to taking them out is like taking
out<00:03:13.510> those<00:03:13.720> intronic<00:03:14.050> shuttles<00:03:14.500> you<00:03:14.860> want<00:03:15.010> to

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
out those intronic shuttles you want to

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.520 
out those intronic shuttles you want to
be<00:03:15.130> in<00:03:15.220> fighter<00:03:15.460> mode<00:03:15.700> use<00:03:16.240> a<00:03:16.270> your<00:03:17.230> heavy

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
be in fighter mode use a your heavy

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.130 
be in fighter mode use a your heavy
missile<00:03:17.830> payload<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.610> you're<00:03:19.240> having<00:03:19.420> cannon

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
missile payload and you're having cannon

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.900 
missile payload and you're having cannon
fire<00:03:20.320> and<00:03:20.530> that'll<00:03:21.220> take<00:03:21.370> care<00:03:21.400> of<00:03:21.640> them<00:03:21.790> the

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
fire and that'll take care of them the

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.740 
fire and that'll take care of them the
quickest<00:03:22.240> I<00:03:23.340> think<00:03:24.340> there's<00:03:24.490> only<00:03:24.580> like<00:03:24.820> two

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
quickest I think there's only like two

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.210 
quickest I think there's only like two
or<00:03:25.960> three<00:03:27.060> waves<00:03:28.680> individual<00:03:29.680> waves<00:03:29.920> of

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
or three waves individual waves of

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.760 
or three waves individual waves of
Rentschler<00:03:31.000> pods<00:03:31.210> for<00:03:31.390> you<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:31.570> take<00:03:31.750> out<00:03:31.930> so

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:32.770 
Rentschler pods for you to take out so

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.290 
Rentschler pods for you to take out so
just<00:03:32.920> kind<00:03:33.100> of<00:03:33.160> flying<00:03:33.370> around<00:03:33.490> take<00:03:34.000> out<00:03:34.090> some

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
just kind of flying around take out some

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.270 
just kind of flying around take out some
more<00:03:34.390> battle<00:03:34.660> pods<00:03:34.870> and<00:03:35.200> then<00:03:35.380> there'll<00:03:36.160> be<00:03:36.190> a

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
more battle pods and then there'll be a

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.100 
more battle pods and then there'll be a
little<00:03:36.490> cutscene<00:03:37.030> here<00:03:37.330> showing<00:03:37.750> you<00:03:37.780> why

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
little cutscene here showing you why

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:39.600 
little cutscene here showing you why
this<00:03:38.170> is<00:03:38.320> called<00:03:38.590> a<00:03:38.710> little<00:03:38.890> Mesa<00:03:39.070> massacre

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
this is called a little Mesa massacre

00:03:39.610 --> 00:04:25.390 
this is called a little Mesa massacre
and<00:03:39.790> then<00:03:40.720> I'll<00:03:40.840> pick<00:03:41.050> it<00:03:41.110> up<00:03:41.260> there

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.940 

okay<00:04:26.400> so<00:04:26.460> right<00:04:27.419> quick<00:04:27.690> just<00:04:28.080> if<00:04:28.620> you<00:04:28.740> can

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
okay so right quick just if you can

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.970 
okay so right quick just if you can
targets<00:04:29.760> this<00:04:30.570> wave<00:04:30.810> of<00:04:30.840> battle<00:04:31.260> pods<00:04:31.470> I<00:04:31.830> don't

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
targets this wave of battle pods I don't

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.070 
targets this wave of battle pods I don't
know<00:04:32.070> why<00:04:32.250> I<00:04:32.280> didn't<00:04:32.550> fire<00:04:32.840> but<00:04:33.840> come<00:04:34.050> over

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
know why I didn't fire but come over

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.480 
know why I didn't fire but come over
here<00:04:34.470> and<00:04:34.680> ignore<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:36.980> entry<00:04:37.980> pod<00:04:38.160> sitting

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
here and ignore the entry pod sitting

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.710 
here and ignore the entry pod sitting
right<00:04:38.580> there<00:04:38.760> you<00:04:38.910> need<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.150> go<00:04:39.300> for<00:04:39.690> the

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
right there you need to go for the

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.540 
right there you need to go for the
battle<00:04:40.080> pods<00:04:40.290> that<00:04:40.590> come<00:04:41.130> in<00:04:41.250> this<00:04:41.370> way

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
battle pods that come in this way

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.610 
battle pods that come in this way
because<00:04:41.850> they<00:04:42.540> are<00:04:42.750> going<00:04:42.930> for<00:04:43.139> the<00:04:43.200> bunkers

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
because they are going for the bunkers

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.400 
because they are going for the bunkers
and<00:04:43.860> you<00:04:43.979> need<00:04:44.130> to<00:04:44.190> protect<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.639> bunkers

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
and you need to protect the bunkers

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.320 
and you need to protect the bunkers
again<00:04:46.410> first<00:04:46.979> priority<00:04:47.430> is<00:04:47.520> going<00:04:47.639> to<00:04:47.729> be<00:04:47.880> the

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
again first priority is going to be the
