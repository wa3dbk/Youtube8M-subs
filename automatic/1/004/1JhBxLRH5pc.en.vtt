00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.309
 the idea quite simple to take one 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.740
 today's motorcycle equipped with the best 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.570
 technologies and exploit it to make the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.900
 test two bridgestone tire sets 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.360
 on the road and on the track he read 20 tires 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.520
 sporty good for everything and brand new 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.350
 t30 a chromatic tourist that is not 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.560
 he pulls back in front of some beautiful 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.560
 fold 

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.910
 here it is the first tire on 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.200
 bridgestone battlax t30 a tire 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.180
 brand new and above all voted for 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.100
 tourism as can be easily seen from 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.110
 design of the grooves arriving 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.610
 almost touching the shoulder for the 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.010
 later it was certainly a design 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.020
 classic swirl sheikh while for 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.090
 the front an unprecedented tic rosco le 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.220
 t-shaped grooves to have a 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.010
 better water drainage than to say 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.710
 for those who remember it is the heir of bt 0 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.900
 23 tire devoted to tourism where 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.210
 but 30 improves a little in all 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.489
 sectors especially in the phase of 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.830
 heating the one in which it lights up 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.780
 the bike proceeds right away maybe even 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.290
 in the wet the more 30 promises to be 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.290
 one thousand 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.659
 on the other hand there is the 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:16.630
 bridgestone battlax s20 an old one 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.729
 knowledge because it is already almost a year 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.619
 which is on the market is immediately conquered 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.780
 the heart of the fans because it is 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.780
 soon said why you can do it with him 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.270
 you can go to work there a little 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.240
 you can go to the track for a few rounds e 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.469
 you can even go under the downpour 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.740
 instead the bi-compound technology remains 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:38.170
 which offers the most rigid carcass in the 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.390
 softer central part instead towards 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.299
 the shoulder this to have two effects 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.679
 one will definitely increase the grip on the 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.130
 wet and two the distance 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:47.130
 mileage 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.040
 for the bike opted for the newest one 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.750
 April at the north end 1200 because before 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.820
 everything is a very versatile bike thanks 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.550
 to the side cases to the position of 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.810
 relaxed driving but above all because a 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.880
 electronic trinkets of last 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.399
 generations like seed suspensions 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.100
 active and now let 's try the north cape e 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.989
 Bridgestone T30 tires on hairpin bends 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.989
 sea ​​view of the overview of gabicce 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.030
 in the street I liked the t 30 immediately 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.770
 as he speaks to the pilot offers so much 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.780
 grip but above all you always have the 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.220
 feeling of knowing what is happening 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.500
 really under the wheels 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.750
 in particular in the case of loss of 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.780
 grip you are always warned with wide 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.780
 advance 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.239
 another positive factor certainly is 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.860
 speed to enter temperature 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.380
 practically never need to wait 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.379
 you will turn on the bike and give you gas and 30 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.400
 already offer a lot of grip 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:52.769
 also the running noise is excellent 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.810
 really exemplary and the rigidity of the 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.470
 carcass never starting to sway 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.470
 strange or unexpected 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.060
 well on the road surely all right but 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.980
 to find the limit of t 30 o 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.550
 decided to take him to the cremona san track 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:13.550
 martino of the lake 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.680
 obviously a tire like that goes 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.540
 soon in crisis especially for a 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.159
 speech of temperatures but the 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.260
 bridgestone t30 surprised me anyway 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:45.780
 even in a hostile environment like him 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.030
 the track is true the grip once you do 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.859
 begins to drive seriously decreases but 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.659
 the adherence losses here more than in 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.730
 road are always well marked in 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:57.090
 advance and all the time to think about 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.799
 how to remedy any damage 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.989
 eye however because when it begins to 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.879
 push forcing the inputs into the curve 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:12.299
 the front end is waiting for a while by car 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:16.939
 straighten up now let's change the tires 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.939
 we assemble the s20 and lower the times 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.050
 on the track there are 20 bridgestones 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.970
 find the level immediately at ease 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.500
 of grip here is higher than on t 30 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.509
 the feeling of being up is more 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.620
 tracks even when you enter thought and 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:47.810
 the outgoing gas is thrown open or teeth 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.490
 as the t 30 on the other hand is not hyper 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.860
 fast down in the fold but down 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.570
 in short, I liked the linear round 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.210
 a lot especially because I'm like with 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.680
 whose laps strong turns well but without having to 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.840
 put the chassis in hand 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.669
 heavy will not have the performances of a 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.889
 slick tire but the level is a lot 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:06.760
 high and ease of use compensates 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.760
 widely peter 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:21.240
 and you know it's his 20's so good 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:24.020
 on the road and on the track that the use also for 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.020
 go back home
