for not advertising their system at all
among<00:00:36.180> other<00:00:36.420> issues<00:00:37.070> but<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.250> thing<00:00:38.460> is<00:00:38.489> it's

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
among other issues but the thing is it's

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.920 
among other issues but the thing is it's
not<00:00:39.420> just<00:00:40.489> Nintendo<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:42.059> not<00:00:42.329> just<00:00:44.120> sales<00:00:45.120> if

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930
