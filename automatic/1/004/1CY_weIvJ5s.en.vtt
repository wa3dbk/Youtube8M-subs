the<00:00:24.210> body<00:00:25.070> this<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.490> body<00:00:26.699> which<00:00:27.710> I

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
the body this is the body which I

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:35.660 
the body this is the body which I
receive<00:00:29.130> from<00:00:29.480> eBay<00:00:32.870> and<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:34.590> cut<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.280> fender

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
a road on the body due to lose mountain

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.289 
a road on the body due to lose mountain
self<00:01:49.979> now<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.790> thing

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
self now this thing

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.660 
self now this thing
mounts<00:01:52.020> very<00:01:52.229> perfectly<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.040> very<00:01:53.340> strongly

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
mounts very perfectly and very strongly

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.550 
mounts very perfectly and very strongly
onto<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.329> chassis<00:01:55.969> so<00:01:56.990> almost<00:01:57.990> everything<00:01:58.320> is

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
onto the chassis so almost everything is

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.490 
onto the chassis so almost everything is
done<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.920> also<00:01:59.189> had<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.700> cut<00:02:00.180> some<00:02:01.110> parts<00:02:01.290> of

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
done I also had to cut some parts of

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.940 
done I also had to cut some parts of
thing<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:02.570> inside<00:02:03.570> of<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.840> interior<00:02:04.320> from

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
thing in inside of the interior from

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.270 
thing in inside of the interior from
underneath<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:06.360> remove<00:02:07.020> any<00:02:07.170> binding<00:02:07.710> with

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
underneath to remove any binding with

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.660 
underneath to remove any binding with
either<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:09.239> gearbox<00:02:09.660> or<00:02:10.400> the<00:02:11.400> spur<00:02:11.670> gear<00:02:11.700> and

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
either the gearbox or the spur gear and

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.250 
either the gearbox or the spur gear and
here<00:02:12.819> or<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:14.770> motor<00:02:15.550> over<00:02:16.420> anything<00:02:17.020> over

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
here or the motor over anything over

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.839 
here or the motor over anything over
here<00:02:18.120> and<00:02:19.590> after<00:02:20.590> doing<00:02:20.770> all<00:02:20.890> that<00:02:20.950> now<00:02:21.520> it

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:21.849 
here and after doing all that now it

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.120 
here and after doing all that now it
fits<00:02:22.090> perfectly<00:02:22.630> on<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.900> chassis<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.590> now<00:02:24.069> I

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
fits perfectly on the chassis and now I

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.210 
fits perfectly on the chassis and now I
can<00:02:24.550> actually<00:02:24.940> go<00:02:25.330> on<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.720> start<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.260> try<00:02:27.099> to

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
can actually go on and start and try to

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.809 
can actually go on and start and try to
run<00:02:27.550> this<00:02:27.760> for<00:02:28.300> a<00:02:28.750> few<00:02:29.080> seconds<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:29.620> am<00:02:30.459> what<00:02:30.790> I

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
run this for a few seconds I am what I

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.790 
run this for a few seconds I am what I
also<00:02:31.030> did<00:02:31.300> was<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:32.400> created<00:02:33.400> a<00:02:34.319> baffle<00:02:35.319> box<00:02:35.350> or

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
also did was I created a baffle box or

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.759 
also did was I created a baffle box or
base<00:02:36.100> you<00:02:36.400> for<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:37.090> small<00:02:37.480> speaker<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:38.410> can<00:02:38.440> see

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
base you for a small speaker you can see

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:44.490 
base you for a small speaker you can see
here<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:41.860> attached<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.940> speaker<00:02:43.269> to<00:02:44.110> an

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
here and I attached the speaker to an

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.559 
here and I attached the speaker to an
electric<00:02:45.190> chip<00:02:46.230> here<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:49.180> electric

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
electric chip here and this electric

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.259 
electric chip here and this electric
chip<00:02:49.780> is<00:02:50.019> connected<00:02:50.500> in<00:02:50.680> between<00:02:51.069> the<00:02:51.489> ESC<00:02:52.000> and
