this<00:00:03.449> video<00:00:03.750> is<00:00:04.049> going<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.470> be<00:00:04.680> a<00:00:04.920> tutorial<00:00:05.819> on

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
this video is going to be a tutorial on

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.509 
this video is going to be a tutorial on
how<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.569> read<00:00:06.899> binary<00:00:07.170> on<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.680> binary<00:00:08.040> clock

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
how to read binary on a binary clock

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.520 
how to read binary on a binary clock
like<00:00:08.760> this<00:00:09.030> so<00:00:09.780> this<00:00:09.960> is<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.139> pretty<00:00:10.349> simple

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
like this so this is a pretty simple

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.700 
like this so this is a pretty simple
clock<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:11.219> pretty<00:00:11.490> small<00:00:11.730> is<00:00:12.030> square<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:12.809> has

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
clock is pretty small is square and has

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.790 
clock is pretty small is square and has
four<00:00:14.490> eight<00:00:14.730> actually<00:00:15.179> in<00:00:15.690> account<00:00:16.020> two<00:00:16.650> two

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
four eight actually in account two two

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.400 
four eight actually in account two two
six<00:00:17.039> that's<00:00:17.279> six<00:00:17.670> columns<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.390> lights<00:00:19.050> and

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
six that's six columns of lights and

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.400 
six that's six columns of lights and
these<00:00:20.250> lights<00:00:20.490> basically<00:00:21.119> say<00:00:21.689> what<00:00:21.900> time<00:00:22.230> it

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
these lights basically say what time it

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.820 
these lights basically say what time it
is

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
is

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.429 
is
so<00:00:23.039> as<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:24.000> can<00:00:24.060> see<00:00:24.300> these<00:00:24.600> keep<00:00:24.900> moving<00:00:25.289> for

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
so as you can see these keep moving for

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.349 
so as you can see these keep moving for
each<00:00:25.590> second<00:00:26.130> which<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.580> means<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:27.000> seven<00:00:27.269> of

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
each second which it means it's seven of

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.540 
each second which it means it's seven of
these<00:00:27.449> seconds<00:00:27.990> these<00:00:28.590> two<00:00:28.800> here<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.039> second

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
these seconds these two here a second

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.849 
these seconds these two here a second
these<00:00:29.939> two<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.150> minutes<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.779> these<00:00:31.349> two<00:00:31.590> are

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
these two a minutes and these two are

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.200 
these two a minutes and these two are
hours<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.610> is<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.480> 24-hour<00:00:34.380> format<00:00:34.969> so<00:00:35.969> how<00:00:36.149> to

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
hours and is a 24-hour format so how to

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.060 
hours and is a 24-hour format so how to
actually<00:00:36.719> read<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.050> actual<00:00:37.469> proof<00:00:37.649> simple

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
actually read this actual proof simple

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.549 
actually read this actual proof simple
what<00:00:38.309> once<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.700> get<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.030> gist<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:40.230> may

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
what once you get the gist of it it may

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.380 
what once you get the gist of it it may
be<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.739> little<00:00:40.890> hard<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.309> understand<00:00:41.760> if<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.270> do

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
be a little hard to understand if you do

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.810 
be a little hard to understand if you do
not<00:00:42.629> I'll<00:00:42.870> definitely<00:00:43.379> post<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.280> link<00:00:44.610> in<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
not I'll definitely post a link in the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.209 
not I'll definitely post a link in the
description<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.390> how<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:46.710> can<00:00:46.920> read

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
description on how to so you can read

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.819 
description on how to so you can read
more<00:00:47.610> into<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:49.079> okay<00:00:49.320> let's<00:00:49.559> start<00:00:49.710> off

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
more into it so okay let's start off

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.520 
more into it so okay let's start off
with<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.100> hours<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:50.670> they<00:00:50.910> don't<00:00:51.120> move<00:00:51.300> around

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
with the hours as they don't move around

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.760 
with the hours as they don't move around
so<00:00:52.530> currently<00:00:54.079> it<00:00:55.079> goes<00:00:55.230> around<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:55.620> this

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
so currently it goes around like this

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.160 
so currently it goes around like this
binary<00:00:56.340> consists<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.059> ones<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.690> zeros

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
binary consists of ones and zeros

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.290 
binary consists of ones and zeros
there's<00:00:58.649> no<00:00:58.890> other<00:00:59.160> number<00:00:59.579> only<00:00:59.850> one<00:01:00.059> and

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
there's no other number only one and

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.650 
there's no other number only one and
three<00:01:00.480> zero<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:02.039> turn<00:01:02.460> off<00:01:02.670> light<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> zero

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
three zero so a turn off light is a zero

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.469 
three zero so a turn off light is a zero
and<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.439> light<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:04.949> turned<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.489> isn't<00:01:06.330> one

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
and a light that is turned on isn't one

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.090 
and a light that is turned on isn't one
so<00:01:07.439> we<00:01:07.890> have<00:01:08.159> but<00:01:09.090> basically<00:01:09.630> this<00:01:10.439> up<00:01:10.770> here

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
so we have but basically this up here

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.850 
so we have but basically this up here
the<00:01:11.400> columns<00:01:11.880> up<00:01:12.030> there<00:01:12.270> are<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.990> amount<00:01:13.470> that

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
the columns up there are the amount that

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.719 
the columns up there are the amount that
you<00:01:14.189> have<00:01:14.540> so<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.080> this<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.530> one<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.490> a

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
you have so so this is the one this is a

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.330 
you have so so this is the one this is a
to<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:18.509> day<00:01:18.720> four<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.439> is<00:01:19.530> an<00:01:19.619> eight<00:01:19.830> so

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
to this day four and this is an eight so

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.050 
to this day four and this is an eight so
if<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.640> have<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> turn<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.299> light<00:01:21.720> let's<00:01:22.560> say

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
if you have a turn on light let's say

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.300 
if you have a turn on light let's say
here<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.270> here<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.409> gives<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.740> three<00:01:26.070> if

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
here and here and it gives a three if

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.719 
here and here and it gives a three if
there<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.970> one<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.540> if<00:01:28.110> they're<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.650> two<00:01:29.009> so

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
there and one and if they're a two so

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.330 
there and one and if they're a two so
it's<00:01:29.850> currently<00:01:30.060> two<00:01:30.530> over<00:01:31.530> here<00:01:31.710> it's<00:01:31.829> two<00:01:32.159> as

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
it's currently two over here it's two as

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.109 
it's currently two over here it's two as
well<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.720> must<00:01:34.049> be<00:01:34.170> 22<00:01:34.950> that's<00:01:35.280> 10<00:01:35.759> p.m.

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
well so it must be 22 that's 10 p.m.

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.590 
well so it must be 22 that's 10 p.m.
then<00:01:37.079> we<00:01:37.170> have<00:01:37.290> a<00:01:37.320> 1<00:01:37.740> over<00:01:37.770> here<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:39.000> 8<00:01:39.299> over

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
then we have a 1 over here and of 8 over

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.740 
then we have a 1 over here and of 8 over
there<00:01:39.930> is<00:01:40.470> 20<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.220> 18<00:01:42.049> which<00:01:43.049> with<00:01:43.560> one<00:01:44.040> two

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
there is 20 to 18 which with one two

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.280 
there is 20 to 18 which with one two
that<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:46.110> equals<00:01:46.530> three<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.600> over<00:01:48.600> here<00:01:48.869> keeps

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
that it equals three and over here keeps

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.499 
that it equals three and over here keeps
moving<00:01:49.649> nine<00:01:50.299> there<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.630> now<00:01:52.369> 40<00:01:53.369> 42<00:01:54.119> 43<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.590> 22

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
moving nine there so now 40 42 43 so 22

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.899 
moving nine there so now 40 42 43 so 22
18<00:01:57.860> 18<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.329> soon<00:02:00.329> for<00:02:01.170> 50<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.460> that's

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
18 18 and soon for 50 so that's

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.670 
18 18 and soon for 50 so that's
basically<00:02:03.329> basically<00:02:03.930> how<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.110> read<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.409> I'll

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
basically basically how you read it I'll

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.889 
basically basically how you read it I'll
also<00:02:04.920> be<00:02:05.100> posting<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.700> video<00:02:05.880> or<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.210> video

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899

response to this video as a review of
this<00:02:08.970> specific<00:02:09.539> binary<00:02:09.929> clock<00:02:10.200> is<00:02:10.379> after

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
this specific binary clock is after

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.120 
this specific binary clock is after
pretty<00:02:10.860> simple<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.340> read<00:02:11.520> once<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.940> get

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
pretty simple to read once you get

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.920 
pretty simple to read once you get
the<00:02:12.220> hang<00:02:12.400> of<00:02:12.520> it<00:02:12.790> if<00:02:12.970> you<00:02:13.150> didn't<00:02:13.450> Ella<00:02:13.600> said

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
the hang of it if you didn't Ella said

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.570 
the hang of it if you didn't Ella said
go<00:02:14.200> in<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.410> description<00:02:14.950> and<00:02:15.070> you<00:02:15.190> can<00:02:15.340> see

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
go in the description and you can see

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.030 
go in the description and you can see
how<00:02:15.850> to<00:02:16.270> read<00:02:16.450> it<00:02:16.630> more<00:02:17.080> carefully<00:02:17.380> it<00:02:17.890> is

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
how to read it more carefully it is

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.530 
how to read it more carefully it is
actually<00:02:18.430> pretty<00:02:18.640> fast<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:19.030> learn<00:02:19.240> once<00:02:19.450> you

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
actually pretty fast to learn once you

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.750 
actually pretty fast to learn once you
get<00:02:19.690> the<00:02:19.780> gist<00:02:20.050> of<00:02:20.140> it<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.410> binary<00:02:21.310> clock<00:02:21.610> is

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
get the gist of it a binary clock is

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.280 
get the gist of it a binary clock is
something<00:02:22.060> from<00:02:22.240> pretty<00:02:22.480> nice<00:02:22.630> to<00:02:22.780> have<00:02:22.810> but

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
something from pretty nice to have but

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.930 
something from pretty nice to have but
it<00:02:23.650> takes<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:23.980> little<00:02:24.070> while<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.310> decode<00:02:24.730> at

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
it takes a little while to decode at

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.970 
it takes a little while to decode at
least<00:02:25.240> in<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.540> beginning<00:02:25.660> once<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.590> really

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
least in the beginning once you really

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.830 
least in the beginning once you really
really<00:02:27.100> get<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.430> hang<00:02:27.550> of<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.820> it<00:02:28.270> takes<00:02:28.600> them

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
really get the hang of it it takes them

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.660 
really get the hang of it it takes them
don't<00:02:29.320> need<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.560> little<00:02:29.950> more<00:02:30.100> time<00:02:30.400> than

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
don't need a little more time than

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.150 
don't need a little more time than
another<00:02:30.910> clock<00:02:31.240> but<00:02:31.810> out<00:02:31.960> definitely<00:02:32.740> or<00:02:33.100> I

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
another clock but out definitely or I

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.680 
another clock but out definitely or I
think<00:02:33.670> that's<00:02:33.820> actually<00:02:34.150> really<00:02:34.270> nice<00:02:34.420> not<00:02:34.660> a

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
think that's actually really nice not a

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.990 
think that's actually really nice not a
regret<00:02:35.140> this<00:02:35.350> clock<00:02:35.680> at<00:02:35.890> all<00:02:36.100> so<00:02:36.760> thank<00:02:36.940> you

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
regret this clock at all so thank you

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.830 
regret this clock at all so thank you
very<00:02:37.030> much<00:02:37.240> for<00:02:37.330> watching<00:02:37.450> this<00:02:37.690> video

very much for watching this video
there's<00:02:38.200> an<00:02:38.290> FF<00:02:38.560> car<00:02:38.590> pal<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.160> I'll<00:02:39.790> see<00:02:40.120> you

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
there's an FF car pal and I'll see you

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.620 
there's an FF car pal and I'll see you
guys<00:02:40.270> in<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:40.750> next<00:02:40.900> video<00:02:41.140> bye-bye
