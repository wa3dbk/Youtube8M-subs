00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.050
 The referee is often referred to as a shadow director, but now the rugby referee is exactly with the director 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.850
 To make the game live 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:14.510
 Focus on running rugby directors to make it a good game for politics and fans alike 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.400
 And was 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.420
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.530
 I can not speak No. 2 ribose 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.400
 It seems that will not be 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.400

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:29.060
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:34.059
 The rugby season is finally over 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.059
 By the way, have you never thought about this season 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.410
 By the way do not eat 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.390
 I'm smart 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.500
 There was me who did not respond to falling or muddy 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.500
 That cat 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.489
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:00.800
 That with a microphone from the toy season more fun trying to get in free TV relay 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:06.320
 The words began to flow on the air 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:11.300
 Toka still hard to move the referee but reputation I have a that was also wearing chest or more is very best 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.020
 Or it that I mean bought and extra sound enters the opposite has been now Kedomo era I is of 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:19.140

 Make communication with customers clearer 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:33.040
 Has been that there is better not to talk too much in the decade Re until before Perry was resolute attitude 

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:37.390
 Now it is ideal to communicate with the players and make the game run smoothly 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.410
 By the way, it has changed to say that there is individuality in each referee 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.150
 I understand 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:44.160
 600005 minutes 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.160
 Some people call by the player's number 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.760
 Thats not 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.880
 Try 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.390
 To those who think that you are bad 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.990

 I also realize I really want to get into town 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:29.670
 In many of the competition has been thought to the main role is to crack down on the referee or promotional but rugby 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:35.430
 Be careful not to make observations 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:37.510
 In other words we have a Oite judge always in mind the car to prevent how promotional 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:44.470
 It is good 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:47.730
 The second generation sung to Nya nya nya atmosphere familiar Hamar key 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.730

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:58.490
 p Do n't get rid of the cargo course and get rid of it. 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:03.360
 There's no use like Hayase 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:06.120
 The play that thinks that I am taking a paso child from the bottom is also cut off 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:11.460

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:20.569
 By saying 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:25.269
 I think I'm doing on the boat of the request 12 in the sport to warn the players while running 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.269
 Hard rugby fighting is not easy 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.829
 Bad do 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.829

 A class referee Ishii, Masaru 41-year-old is often blow the whistle in the big game 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:49.450

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:47.290
 Besides this , I will do training like this between classes 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.290

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:46.780
 Because we went at this time, it is within about 10m 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:50.639
 Every time here 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.639
 Therefore, it often if brought into invention 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:06:00.389
 Mr. Ishii who reciprocates between Hakodate and Kanto Kansai many times during the season 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:01.910
 This day was kind to Tokyo for the quarterfinals of national rugby nationals 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:06.220
 Firmly on the theme of song man 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.220
 Are snacks in the last deep 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:20.880
 How is it so bad that I don't feel in touch with the players? 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.810
 Firmly by beautiful Ya Do side we are projecting a foul even though I know so 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:27.390
 Jersey is doing 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:31.110

 Patty reason and its through story talk so so ok person ok 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:44.930
 After all, Tokyo is I number 10 cormorants even does not let off the Tokyo tripartite ok 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.610
 It is full of rice statistics 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:50.230
 Ah ah ah 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:53.810
 Now for good and bad games with your own rappelling 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:58.970
 It is said that you always say so and go out to the ground 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:07:01.270
 This game is a one-sided development of Kobe Steel, and Ricoh's reluctance is about to disappear 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.270
 Was 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.110

 Let's do our best until the end Let's play good 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:18.140
 Such as in the word that comes into Tossa Ishii's rugby Les Perry of thought has been put 

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:18.140
 I felt like 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.120
 Here is the moon 

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.830
 Player is good 

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:42.590
 It is in between that there will have Do this Nuki' or came band 

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:44.930
 I think that sex life Deb is standing 

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:48.340
 It takes 5 minutes to reconsider 

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:48.340
 There is not two to inform 

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:51.910
 After all appears 

00:07:52.580 --> 00:08:02.270
 That's a third party before the war before in as a third party that was also increased to wet fun 

00:07:57.289 --> 00:08:03.580
 We must bridge if there along with speaking the only thing there I do not think that is the important role so 

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:08.470
 It is not without 

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:10.490
 Only also I'm'm literally the referee's're saying do it that a doctor be it great 

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:14.620
