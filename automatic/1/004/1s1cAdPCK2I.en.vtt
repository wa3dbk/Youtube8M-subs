00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
that the color pops and that's why I

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.189 
that the color pops and that's why I
picked<00:00:19.980> these<00:00:20.189> up<00:00:20.250> now<00:00:20.810> it's<00:00:21.810> a<00:00:21.840> really<00:00:21.990> nice

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
picked these up now it's a really nice

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.170 
picked these up now it's a really nice
shoe<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.740> really<00:00:23.310> didn't<00:00:23.580> prefer<00:00:23.730> its

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
shoe I really didn't prefer its

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.210 
shoe I really didn't prefer its
predecessor<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:25.170> really<00:00:25.470> hated<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.099> original

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
predecessor I really hated the original

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.460 
predecessor I really hated the original
features<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.210> came<00:00:27.359> out<00:00:27.480> early<00:00:27.720> last<00:00:27.930> year<00:00:28.109> I

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
features that came out early last year I

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.189 
features that came out early last year I
think<00:00:29.160> mainly<00:00:29.609> because<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.449> top<00:00:30.689> was<00:00:30.900> woven

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
think mainly because the top was woven

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.470 
think mainly because the top was woven
and<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.650> really<00:00:31.949> just<00:00:32.130> cannot<00:00:32.550> stand<00:00:32.880> woven

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
and I really just cannot stand woven

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.000 
and I really just cannot stand woven
talks<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.930> me<00:00:34.050> they're<00:00:34.230> disgusting<00:00:34.800> I'd

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
talks to me they're disgusting I'd

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.190 
talks to me they're disgusting I'd
really<00:00:35.190> don't<00:00:35.460> even<00:00:35.520> prefer<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.600> Flyknit

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
really don't even prefer the Flyknit

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.549 
really don't even prefer the Flyknit
material<00:00:38.059> especially<00:00:39.059> on<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.270> Roshi's<00:00:39.690> but

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
material especially on the Roshi's but

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.650 
material especially on the Roshi's but
I'm<00:00:41.070> sure<00:00:41.280> I'm<00:00:41.489> gonna<00:00:41.610> get<00:00:41.790> used<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.329> in<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
I'm sure I'm gonna get used to it in the

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.510 
I'm sure I'm gonna get used to it in the
future

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
future

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.889

getting into the review and speaking of
Roshi's<00:00:46.410> these<00:00:46.620> remind<00:00:46.920> me<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> lot<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.550> row

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
Roshi's these remind me a lot of row

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.420 
Roshi's these remind me a lot of row
she's<00:00:48.149> just<00:00:48.719> for<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.960> fact<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.350> it's<00:00:50.280> a

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
she's just for the fact that it's a

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.150 
she's just for the fact that it's a
really<00:00:50.730> simple<00:00:50.940> shoe<00:00:51.300> alongside<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.890> fact

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
really simple shoe alongside the fact

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.950 
really simple shoe alongside the fact
that<00:00:53.309> it's<00:00:53.550> covered<00:00:53.969> in<00:00:54.180> mesh<00:00:56.719> like<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.809> said

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
that it's covered in mesh like I said

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.139 
that it's covered in mesh like I said
it's<00:00:58.109> really<00:00:58.320> it's<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.829> simple<00:00:58.980> shoe<00:00:59.309> there's

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149

it's really it's a simple shoe there's
nothing<00:01:00.539> special<00:01:01.020> about<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.829> shoe<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.430> it

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
nothing special about this shoe but it

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.390 
nothing special about this shoe but it
is<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> comfortable<00:01:03.329> shoe<00:01:03.830> the<00:01:04.830> row<00:01:05.010> she's<00:01:05.250> I

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
is a comfortable shoe the row she's I

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.340 
is a comfortable shoe the row she's I
could<00:01:05.549> stick<00:01:05.760> my<00:01:05.790> hand<00:01:06.210> inside<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.750> shoe<00:01:07.049> and

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
could stick my hand inside the shoe and

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.399 
could stick my hand inside the shoe and
you<00:01:07.619> would<00:01:07.740> see<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.820> my<00:01:09.299> finger<00:01:09.570> imprint<00:01:10.049> on

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
you would see the my finger imprint on

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.200 
you would see the my finger imprint on
the<00:01:10.619> toe<00:01:10.830> here<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.580> showing<00:01:11.729> that<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.119> was

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
the toe here just showing that it was

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.560 
the toe here just showing that it was
really<00:01:12.450> flexible<00:01:13.040> but<00:01:14.040> these<00:01:14.400> aren't<00:01:15.060> really

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
really flexible but these aren't really

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.539 
really flexible but these aren't really
like<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.990> because<00:01:16.350> it's<00:01:16.650> more<00:01:16.860> padded<00:01:17.340> on

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
like that because it's more padded on

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.690 
like that because it's more padded on
the<00:01:17.610> toe<00:01:17.939> section<00:01:18.360> here<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.400> on<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.549> heel

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
the toe section here and on the heel

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.280 
the toe section here and on the heel
section<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.240> back<00:01:21.390> which<00:01:21.869> makes<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.200> a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
section of the back which makes for a

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.539 
section of the back which makes for a
more<00:01:22.409> comfortable<00:01:22.650> shoe<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.159> mean<00:01:23.400> there's

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
more comfortable shoe I mean there's

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.940 
more comfortable shoe I mean there's
nothing<00:01:23.820> wrong<00:01:23.970> with<00:01:24.030> that

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
nothing wrong with that

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.350 
nothing wrong with that
overall<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.130> shoe<00:01:26.340> looks<00:01:26.520> really<00:01:26.850> smooth<00:01:27.150> it

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
overall the shoe looks really smooth it

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.999 
overall the shoe looks really smooth it
looks<00:01:27.509> really<00:01:27.780> clean<00:01:27.960> it's<00:01:28.320> very<00:01:28.350> comfortable

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
looks really clean it's very comfortable

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.359 
looks really clean it's very comfortable
I<00:01:30.229> wouldn't<00:01:31.229> bother<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.650> these<00:01:31.829> though<00:01:32.100> I

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
I wouldn't bother on these though I

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.460 
I wouldn't bother on these though I
think<00:01:32.790> they're<00:01:33.119> listed<00:01:33.509> as<00:01:33.659> basketball<00:01:34.229> shoes

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
think they're listed as basketball shoes

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:35.929 
think they're listed as basketball shoes
but<00:01:34.680> me<00:01:34.890> personally<00:01:35.130> I<00:01:35.430> just<00:01:35.490> wouldn't

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
but me personally I just wouldn't

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.460 
but me personally I just wouldn't
balling<00:01:36.240> them<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.600> mean<00:01:36.810> if<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.990> had<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.380> would

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
balling them I mean if I had to I would

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.310 
balling them I mean if I had to I would
but<00:01:38.159> they're<00:01:38.820> just<00:01:39.150> more<00:01:39.390> shoes<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.200> would

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
but they're just more shoes that I would

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.010 
but they're just more shoes that I would
just<00:01:40.470> like<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.979> know<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:42.540> maintain<00:01:42.990> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
just like you know so just maintain the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.289 
just like you know so just maintain the
structure<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:43.979> take<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:44.880> out<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.180> the
