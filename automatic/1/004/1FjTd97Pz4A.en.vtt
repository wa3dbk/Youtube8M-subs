00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hello everybody, we're here for one more 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.529
 bike minute today to talk about a one 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.860
 a boring situation that is a tire 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.780
 bored and we'll teach you how to trade it 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.179
 almost a patch of bed 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.180
 first let's see some things be 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.060
 a pump or a co2 pump that the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.710
 practice is already a patch game today. 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.199
 I have two types here I have one use 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.010
 conventional glue or dispensing use 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.939
 the use of new queues dispatch the first 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.640
 step 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.640
 let's take the camera inside the tire 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:52.230
 how to identify the location of the pure 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:01:01.140
 arrived to use the bomb was a little 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:03.539
 silly because we can not 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.470
 identify already on the face 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:11.670
 means the future, or we 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.850
 pick up dirty plug as local sanding of the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.850
 landing 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:33.689
 the second enclosure easy when 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:36.420
 was using a camera a patch 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.250
 with the bag today to use the 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.640
 which avoids the use of rope that is of 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:50.490
 show goes where the excess of dirt in the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.470
 put thought 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.100
 a little bit in me I was already 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:00.240
 mended we put the camera on the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.030
 that tire is the cause of the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.759
 hurricane the bus that has bore holes and 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.170
 some nails I paint to remove some 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.640
 thing very carefully 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.640
 Let's mount the camera. 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.530
 I came back from the automaker to make the 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:58.130
 co2 pump that is working only 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.180
 put on the bike and it was very good 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.520
 folks 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.650
 This was another bike minute tip.
