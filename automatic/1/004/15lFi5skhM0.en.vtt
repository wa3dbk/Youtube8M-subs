00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.010
 to this the shirt and itself and leave with 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.310
 the right foot with a win I think that 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.840
 encouraging encouraging for the personal 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.760
 and obviously on the team we hope 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.930
 and keep adding as you go 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.550
 incorporating other colleagues and 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.769
 let's hope 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.110
 that the performance of the 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:35.530
 young people that for me was very prominent what 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.829
 what they did keeps on rising until the time 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:42.190
 it costs us a long time that much 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:45.790
 I came thinking now it was officially coming 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.020
 it seems that it was more I think that of course 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.470
 last match of the tournament 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.850
 before ancestor ancestor a party 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.060
 the cup but a long time that does not play 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.650
 not feeling officially 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.770
 I 'm preparing for that I 'm not 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.830
 preparing to go improving go 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.600
 Feeling better and trying to adapt 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.760
 the best possible and as fast as possible 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.140
 also to the group so with a lot 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.360
 will as a team 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.270
 If one day it was clear to us, I do not have a 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.109
 very young team 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.780
 but when you see them train me 

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:23.960
 He had to meet him now and train them 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.049
 how they were doing there on the court and 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.040
 you were happy to witness that guy 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.750
 of growth so 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.270
 both they and we have 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.520
 to be satisfied with what they did 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.620
 what 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.450
 do not wait to go back to 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.160
 to the triumphs next weekend 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.110
 which is obviously a very difficult game 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.450
 the minute all because you see a 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.010
 very complicated instance in which you have 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.840
 that traveling has to present a team 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.040
 a team will be going to be in the cup 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.450
 another one that is going to be playing here 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.690
 championship and everything has to be 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.080
 adding minutes and I think that to the extent 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.640
 that we continue contributing in this way 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.040
 God wants to win I find it more or 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.360
 less responsibility I think it's going to 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.970
 be positive fourth the team was more 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.160
 strong of some linear experience and 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.260
 overcome that also important and logical 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.030
 that the one who has to play is that they are 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.980
 more experience but but the young 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.130
 they also beat you and I showed 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.350
 the day of the strong center of roberto and 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:24.920
 as they came strong from the center of the head 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:27.800
 and it came out stronger still I threw 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.690
 I ended up very tired come if I think that 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.900
 the case is normal after 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.900
 vacation back now 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:39.040
 go through a period of adaptation of 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.610
 return to the competition that is not very 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.470
 strong and I think that way we could all 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.800
 take out the task on vacation 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.590
 nuanced with monday friday 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:53.330
 I do not know if so much that is never seen and 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.330
 permission and then central 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.710
 with a small little turn was a 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.650
 little little turn 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.480
 to fulfill the goal of winning in the 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.750
 first match beyond the team that 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.300
 I was very young today if you say so 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.330
 very young but not for being young is not going to 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.670
 have the desire to win and give 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:19.200
 first three points 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.660
 to our team 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.030
 despite the small age of the time 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.630
 experience 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.150
 we ran a lot and that perhaps is supplied 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:33.160
 what technically still does not 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.160
 we can achieve was the substitute below 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.990
 I do not know I work for me later 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.870
 working well since cadet 

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:44.569
 that kept me 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.569
 in playing at first and staying 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:53.879
 did not have big complications roberto 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.849
 Gonzalez is the task of defense and 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:04:00.990
 archer keep the arc at zero and so 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:04.110
 we have more chances of winning 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:06.000
 antofagasta so all parties 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:10.040
 are important from this that 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.960
 played now and we're going to focus 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.670
 in what before I almost all 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.430
 holders we a team that never 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.810
 I had never seen the boys without him 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.510
 that already debuted and those that were not 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.820
 when we did it very well, I think 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.410
 that the result was worth 400 of 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.520
 we were the team that wanted to be 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.230
 protagonist 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.060
 they also arrived but we tried 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:36.510
 put it there are other matches back I think 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:39.180
 that states more if it is I think it is 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.550
 impossible not to look exhausted with some 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.460
 days of work double days where no 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.920
 we have stopped I arrived on Sunday 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.060
 I've been training for a week and nothing 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.060
 I think we're doing well 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.790
 but I got married 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:59.960
 a few days of leave and now alternate and 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.960
 get ready for who is talking 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.420
 I think we did it well inside all 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:10.080
 parties explained that we wanted to win the 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.080
 back them 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.210
 I wanted him to make us to rye for the 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.560
 medium but it came out through the aria that 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.570
 we occupy in the steps we try to 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.940
 explain all the balls were given to us 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.710
 things and joseba is not a 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.750
 special circumstance a risk that 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:32.470
 we assume controlled but a risk to 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.480
 end knowing that we play a team that 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.040
 had more physical tone or more tone 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.590
 football that ours but I 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.930
 it seems that you win the desire of our 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.430
 youth very exciting performances 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.490
 like the one of juan fuente it seems to me that it is 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:48.490
 worth noting then the anxiety of 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:51.160
 melt party and we started the 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.740
 changes but we won a valuable match 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.590
 three very valuable points to start a 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.420
 tournament and finding again to follow 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.639
 winning with seven players trained in 

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.449
 good house miren 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:06.069
 for me or it is not merit the structure of 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:08.680
 lower divisions of ojÃ©n has given 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:11.830
 shows when we need young people 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.229
 two young people exist and it would be consequent 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.819
 or I am consistent in believing that those 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:18.279
 young people need opportunities to 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:20.159
 options today the circumstance of 

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:22.419
 that many played together but 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:24.490
 they answered I'm very happy with your 

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:26.669
 response with that of the team in general 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:30.219
 with the people who four days ago 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:33.250
 started and finished a game exhausted but 

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:35.259
 who knew how to take him we won a match 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.550
 difficult against a difficult opponent and they are 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:46.539
 three very valuable points certain 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:50.199
 players have it I told you when 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:52.000
 we started we designed a preseason one 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:53.620
 planning bent in two a 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.449
 team where 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:57.610
 he suffered the burden of the party of the year 

00:06:55.449 --> 00:06:59.530
 last and needed to rest 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.870
 rejoined yesterday morning and we 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:03.689
 we incorporate all together with different 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:06.779
 tasks or different 

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:09.569
 exercise load but imagining of 

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:11.999
 that we are all together if we wait 

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:15.239
 the arrival of two players more than 

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:17.060
 reinforce us and then good 

00:07:15.239 --> 00:07:18.830
 we will start the 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:21.380
 the competition every two or three days 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:24.040
 knowing that you have to distribute minutes 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.040
 between all 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:30.260
 first the triumph always very 

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:32.690
 important to win after the performances 

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:35.600
 of young people having taken on a 

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:38.200
 party with little preparation and having it 

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:41.650
 taken forward win always 

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:43.510
 it brings a good climate and for what we 

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:46.000
 there are days of concentration of 

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:48.580
 much physical burden that is appreciated me 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.900
 I go satisfied I congratulate the young people in 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.090
 your debut 

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:54.449
 and have shown that we can count 

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:54.449
 with them
