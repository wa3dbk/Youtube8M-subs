kind of frustrated how Nintendo really
refuses<00:01:14.619> to<00:01:14.829> use<00:01:14.979> voice<00:01:15.369> acting<00:01:15.999> in<00:01:16.179> the

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270

capacity<00:01:16.299> I<00:01:17.079> really<00:01:17.799> feel<00:01:18.039> like<00:01:18.070> voice<00:01:18.369> acting

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
capacity I really feel like voice acting

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:21.179 
capacity I really feel like voice acting
wasn't<00:01:19.119> been<00:01:19.299> optimal<00:01:19.899> cuz<00:01:20.350> these<00:01:20.710> characters

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
wasn't been optimal cuz these characters

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:22.649 
wasn't been optimal cuz these characters
are<00:01:21.340> personally<00:01:21.729> very<00:01:21.909> very<00:01:22.119> you<00:01:22.630> know

animated<00:01:23.289> I<00:01:23.380> guess<00:01:23.560> that's<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:23.799> best<00:01:23.859> way<00:01:24.189> to

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
animated I guess that's the best way to

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.160 
animated I guess that's the best way to
describe<00:01:24.609> them<00:01:24.820> they<00:01:25.030> posted<00:01:25.630> it<00:01:25.659> was<00:01:25.990> have<00:01:26.109> a

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.440 
describe them they posted it was have a
lot<00:01:26.259> of<00:01:26.289> personality<00:01:26.890> and<00:01:27.549> when<00:01:27.909> these<00:01:28.090> people

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450

obviously<00:03:11.380> it's<00:03:11.800> not<00:03:11.980> perfect<00:03:12.490> but<00:03:13.030> at<00:03:13.120> the

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
obviously it's not perfect but at the

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.450 
obviously it's not perfect but at the
same<00:03:13.390> time<00:03:13.630> every<00:03:13.900> this<00:03:14.020> is<00:03:14.140> not<00:03:14.460> manufactured

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
same time every this is not manufactured

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.210
