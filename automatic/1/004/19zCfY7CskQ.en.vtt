00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:12.860
 to make a cheesecake 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:17.110
 we need 3 eggs 300 of cream for 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:21.650
 Cook half condensed milk tube 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:25.490
 a tub and weight to spread and sugar to 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:28.670
 taste if you like it really sweet it would be 300 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.039
 grams for 3 eggs before mixing 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:35.860
 the ingredients we will put the oven 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:39.770
 preheated to 180 degrees up and down 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.580
 we started laying the eggs 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.580
 in a bowl 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.750
 as we said before there were three after 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.750
 we put the kitchen cream 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.580
 the whole boat 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.760
 half tube of condensed milk 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.810
 the one that are odd 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.549
 and as we said before sugar to taste 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.070
 in my house I like it very sweet so 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.060
 we only put a little 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.480
 and now we're going missing 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.960
 it's a thread 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.540
 using the blender once all 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.100
 beaten and well united taking care not to 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.080
 there are lumps of cheese 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.409
 we'll see that the dough is pretty 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.979
 liquida the vertebrate very carefully in 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.979
 mold 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.460
 once the oven is already hot 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.460
 we can put 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.459
 we'll leave it for 40 minutes in the oven 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.620
 controlling when it set 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:26.140
 we will check if it is already cooked not 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.690
 you scare because it swells 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:33.750
 the stick has come out clean means 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.750
 that is ready to adore him 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.460
 As you can see now, the 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.740
 volume and we'll let it take the 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.350
 room temperature once there is 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.810
 At room temperature, we can 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.620
 put it in the fridge about six eight 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.420
 hours so that it takes more consistency 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.620
 after having the cake at least 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:03.130
 68 hours in the fridge we can proceed to 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.840
 dismantle we will pass it with the tip of the 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.319
 knife by the edge 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:13.840
 of the mold to take it off 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.840
 we will try to make it face up 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.140
 so that it looks good when 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.140
 toasted 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.630
 We can serve our cake with a 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.930
 little bit of red fruit jam or 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.200
 strawberry or a splash of syrup 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.560
 chocolate and you have it ready for 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.560
 eat
