about<00:01:25.750> seven<00:01:26.110> eight<00:01:26.229> wraps<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.729> then<00:01:27.850> you're

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
about seven eight wraps and then you're

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.990 
about seven eight wraps and then you're
going<00:01:28.030> to<00:01:28.090> take<00:01:28.210> your<00:01:28.420> line<00:01:28.630> your<00:01:29.170> tag<00:01:29.409> end<00:01:29.680> and

going to take your line your tag end and
push<00:01:31.000> it<00:01:31.150> just<00:01:31.390> up<00:01:32.159> underneath<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:34.180> loops<00:01:34.390> you

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
push it just up underneath the loops you

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.649 
push it just up underneath the loops you
made<00:01:34.690> over<00:01:34.900> your<00:01:34.990> fingers<00:01:36.299> let's<00:01:37.299> go<00:01:37.420> this

made over your fingers let's go this

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.050 
made over your fingers let's go this
little<00:01:37.930> loop<00:01:38.350> right<00:01:38.380> here<00:01:38.620> it's<00:01:39.610> nice<00:01:39.760> to<00:01:39.940> go

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
little loop right here it's nice to go

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.030 
little loop right here it's nice to go
slow<00:01:40.390> right<00:01:40.659> now<00:01:41.049> otherwise<00:01:41.680> you're<00:01:41.890> going<00:01:41.979> to

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:42.040 
slow right now otherwise you're going to

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.789 
slow right now otherwise you're going to
end<00:01:42.100> up<00:01:42.220> with<00:01:42.280> a<00:01:42.340> mess<00:01:43.290> as<00:01:44.290> you<00:01:44.350> can<00:01:44.560> see

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
end up with a mess as you can see

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.840 
end up with a mess as you can see
there's<00:01:45.010> one<00:01:45.070> end<00:01:45.490> this<00:01:46.270> is<00:01:46.420> our<00:01:46.570> tag<00:01:46.750> end

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
there's one end this is our tag end

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.160 
there's one end this is our tag end
these<00:01:48.850> are<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.090> loops<00:01:49.299> that<00:01:49.540> we<00:01:49.630> made<00:01:49.869> and

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
these are the loops that we made and

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.940 
these are the loops that we made and
they're<00:01:50.470> going<00:01:50.799> up<00:01:50.950> our<00:01:51.100> doubled<00:01:51.640> braid<00:01:52.950> just

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
they're going up our doubled braid just

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.330 
they're going up our doubled braid just
pull<00:01:54.159> them<00:01:54.280> down<00:01:54.310> nice<00:01:54.760> and<00:01:54.790> easy

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
pull them down nice and easy

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.530 
pull them down nice and easy
doesn't<00:01:57.340> have<00:01:57.430> to<00:01:57.490> be<00:01:57.640> confusing<00:01:57.820> if<00:01:58.270> you<00:01:58.299> take

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
doesn't have to be confusing if you take

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.440 
doesn't have to be confusing if you take
your<00:01:58.720> time<00:01:59.670> then<00:02:00.670> you<00:02:00.790> can<00:02:00.939> see<00:02:01.119> we've<00:02:01.299> got

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
your time then you can see we've got

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.109 
your time then you can see we've got
these<00:02:01.600> loops<00:02:01.900> going<00:02:02.229> up<00:02:02.350> our<00:02:02.500> line<00:02:03.119> slowly

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
these loops going up our line slowly

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.750 
these loops going up our line slowly
begin<00:02:04.600> pulling<00:02:04.990> them<00:02:05.110> taunt<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:06.490> is<00:02:06.670> the

begin pulling them taunt this is the

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.520 
begin pulling them taunt this is the
most<00:02:06.909> important<00:02:07.420> step<00:02:07.659> to<00:02:07.930> doing<00:02:08.349> a

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
most important step to doing a

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.190 
most important step to doing a
successful<00:02:09.159> spider<00:02:09.849> hitch<00:02:10.090> is<00:02:10.360> to<00:02:11.019> make<00:02:11.170> sure

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
successful spider hitch is to make sure

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.640 
successful spider hitch is to make sure
that<00:02:11.439> the<00:02:11.769> legs<00:02:12.040> of<00:02:12.450> this<00:02:13.450> braid<00:02:13.810> tighten<00:02:14.590> up

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
that the legs of this braid tighten up

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.670 
that the legs of this braid tighten up
evenly<00:02:15.220> if<00:02:15.939> they<00:02:16.180> don't<00:02:16.420> you're<00:02:17.200> not<00:02:17.379> going<00:02:17.620> to

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
evenly if they don't you're not going to

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.380 
evenly if they don't you're not going to
be<00:02:17.769> messed<00:02:17.980> up<00:02:18.159> and<00:02:18.459> you're<00:02:18.939> going<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.090> have<00:02:19.239> to

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
be messed up and you're going to have to

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.170 
be messed up and you're going to have to
retie

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.900 

and<00:02:25.180> I<00:02:25.390> just<00:02:25.540> work<00:02:25.660> down<00:02:25.840> those<00:02:26.080> loops<00:02:26.350> slowly

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
and I just work down those loops slowly

nice<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.230> slow<00:02:35.790> so<00:02:36.790> you<00:02:36.850> can<00:02:37.000> see<00:02:37.209> how<00:02:37.390> it

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
nice and slow so you can see how it

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:44.150 
nice and slow so you can see how it
tightens<00:02:39.010> up<00:02:39.220> just<00:02:40.060> like<00:02:40.270> that

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.479 

that's<00:02:45.160> our<00:02:45.340> not<00:02:45.490> very<00:02:45.850> very<00:02:46.030> slim<00:02:47.310> purpose<00:02:48.310> of

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
that's our not very very slim purpose of

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.199 
that's our not very very slim purpose of
doubling<00:02:49.150> your<00:02:49.300> braids<00:02:49.540> is<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:51.730> double<00:02:52.180> the

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
doubling your braids is to double the

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.280 
doubling your braids is to double the
diameter<00:02:52.770> connection<00:02:53.770> to<00:02:54.370> your<00:02:54.489> leader<00:02:55.290> thin

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
diameter connection to your leader thin

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.190 
diameter connection to your leader thin
diameter<00:02:56.560> braids<00:02:57.360> can<00:02:58.360> cut<00:02:58.720> through<00:02:58.930> your

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
diameter braids can cut through your

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.590 
diameter braids can cut through your
leader<00:02:59.440> during<00:02:59.950> a<00:02:59.980> long<00:03:00.160> fight<00:03:00.430> or<00:03:01.209> a<00:03:01.239> really

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
leader during a long fight or a really

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.130 
leader during a long fight or a really
hard<00:03:01.810> strike<00:03:02.230> like<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:02.709> tarpon<00:03:03.130> often<00:03:03.430> does<00:03:04.140> so

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
hard strike like a tarpon often does so

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.430 
hard strike like a tarpon often does so
it's<00:03:05.260> important<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.650> double<00:03:05.890> your<00:03:06.010> braids<00:03:07.440> so

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
it's important to double your braids so

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.530 
it's important to double your braids so
now<00:03:08.470> we're<00:03:08.709> going<00:03:08.800> to<00:03:08.860> connect<00:03:09.220> our<00:03:09.370> leader<00:03:09.940> to

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
now we're going to connect our leader to

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.020 
now we're going to connect our leader to
our<00:03:10.660> double<00:03:10.959> braid<00:03:11.459> using<00:03:12.459> a<00:03:12.550> worm<00:03:12.790> knot<00:03:15.030> you

our double braid using a worm knot you

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.840 
our double braid using a worm knot you
can<00:03:16.090> use<00:03:16.390> the<00:03:16.630> Albright<00:03:16.989> special<00:03:17.620> a<00:03:17.860> uni<00:03:18.730> to

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
can use the Albright special a uni to

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.110 
can use the Albright special a uni to
uni<00:03:19.739> I've<00:03:20.739> been<00:03:21.070> using<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.430> worm<00:03:21.580> knot<00:03:21.820> for

uni I've been using the worm knot for

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.060 
uni I've been using the worm knot for
about<00:03:22.269> a<00:03:22.300> year<00:03:22.630> now<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:23.080> it<00:03:23.530> works<00:03:23.709> really

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
about a year now and it works really

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.530 
about a year now and it works really
really<00:03:24.280> well<00:03:24.550> and<00:03:25.480> it<00:03:25.780> holds<00:03:26.049> very<00:03:26.079> reliably

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
the main line and we're going to take

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.520 
the main line and we're going to take
our<00:04:35.680> tag<00:04:35.860> in<00:04:36.040> and<00:04:36.160> go<00:04:36.280> out<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.940> same<00:04:37.240> way<00:04:37.530> the

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
our tag in and go out the same way the

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.830 
our tag in and go out the same way the
other<00:04:38.680> bit<00:04:38.889> of<00:04:38.979> mono<00:04:39.160> is<00:04:39.430> facing<00:04:39.910> it's<00:04:40.630> very

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
other bit of mono is facing it's very

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.990 
other bit of mono is facing it's very
very<00:04:41.139> important<00:04:41.560> right<00:04:41.710> there<00:04:41.919> so<00:04:42.760> this<00:04:42.850> is

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
very important right there so this is

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.310 
very important right there so this is

see something like this what you do is
you<00:04:46.810> pull<00:04:46.990> on<00:04:47.139> both<00:04:47.410> legs<00:04:47.770> of<00:04:48.220> your<00:04:48.669> braid<00:04:48.699> of

the hitch and both ends of the mono
that's<00:04:51.940> the<00:04:52.270> tag<00:04:52.479> end<00:04:52.720> and<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:52.960> main<00:04:53.139> line

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
that's the tag end and the main line

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.689
