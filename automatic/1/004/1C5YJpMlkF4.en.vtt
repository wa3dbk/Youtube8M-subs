00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.420
 give movement and lengthen our prayers 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.430
 that normally 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:18.450
 and things that 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.450
 the hands once they achieved 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.650
 demonstrate what they are 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.180
 the important thing was to open them to touch the curl 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.180
 to achieve naturalness
