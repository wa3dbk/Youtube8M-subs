00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 good morning omniscient the god asks 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.580
 i know why everybody else is doing 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.440
 car driver always everything wrong and me 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.330
 do everything right now god that is 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.250
 when driving completely normal 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.620
 It's sort of a street law 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.570
 you always do everything right while 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.590
 everyone else is always doing everything wrong 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.640
 damn right on the left 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.250
 I still have that to destroy 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.050
 well , but do not worry 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.970
 there is only so if you are the one 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.650
 the only one who always does everything right 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.300
 and everyone else is always wrong 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.650
 then you can do that too 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.180
 dangerous situations in the 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.800
 Road traffic lead something 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.540
 Drink belongs when you turn right 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.600
 wants and danger 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.219
 just because he has not flashed the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.450
 do everything wrong because the problem is 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.430
 not necessarily that the others always 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.200
 Doing everything wrong the problem is that 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.489
 you always do everything right and you 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.600
 then it excites the others 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.100
 always doing everything wrong 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.840
 problem solving exists in principle two 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.670
 possibilities either you care for it 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.780
 that in the future everyone else will always 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.250
 apologize for everything right 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.449
 Maybe you can turn right 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.039
 I just wanted to drive him briefly 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.570
 explain how the rules of the right of way 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.680
 crossing works or you say 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.199
 just for being in the future 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.970
 always doing everything wrong by 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.900
 For example, you turn first and then 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.900
 the blinker sets 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:16.760
 where I still have to think about the traffic light 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.760
 to answer text messages 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.300
 smoke during the ride 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.270
 as a tourist in a strange city 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:39.490
 just in the middle of the street itself 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:42.460
 if you do not know anymore on the 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:48.270
 highway a truck of 100 drives with 110 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.270
 about very well, although at 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.460
 20 to 30 minutes to act during the 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.930
 ride 111 on facebook post once 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:02.450
 No, I need the front camera 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:04.880
 how is it here now or eight 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.140
 with the passenger arguing but then 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:11.510
 but no , that's enough 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.680
 but well the last example was 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.820
 maybe a bit far-fetched 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.230
 but if you like these simple tips 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.090
 you will surely be noticed soon 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.590
 drive just as bad as everyone else 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.150
 car driver and yes it will ever 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.110
 no more noticeable the more expensive 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:35.300
 We do not all have others either 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:36.800
 bicycled racers what in your 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.510
 favorite driving error with others 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.640
 car drivers and you roar around and 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.290
 then improve all or fathers easily 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.850

 people of ford rule for yours 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.390
