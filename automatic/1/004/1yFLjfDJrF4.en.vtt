00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
wicked I'm just gonna put some of that

wicked I'm just gonna put some of that
on<00:00:35.160> my<00:00:35.609> paper<00:00:35.850> here<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.390> I'm<00:00:37.199> taking<00:00:37.379> my

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
on my paper here and I'm taking my

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.770 
on my paper here and I'm taking my
little<00:00:38.190> detail<00:00:38.579> brush<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.089> I'm<00:00:39.300> just<00:00:39.359> going

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
little detail brush and I'm just going

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:48.619 
little detail brush and I'm just going
to<00:00:40.109> line<00:00:40.800> my<00:00:41.100> cuticle<00:00:41.760> area<00:00:45.980> and<00:00:47.359> this<00:00:48.359> is<00:00:48.480> one

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
to line my cuticle area and this is one

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.000 
to line my cuticle area and this is one
of<00:00:48.719> those<00:00:48.839> designs<00:00:49.199> where<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.559> doesn't<00:00:49.769> really

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
of those designs where it doesn't really

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.639 
of those designs where it doesn't really
matter<00:00:50.730> too<00:00:51.120> bad<00:00:51.329> if<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.809> flood<00:00:52.109> the<00:00:52.140> cuticle

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
matter too bad if you flood the cuticle

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.319 
matter too bad if you flood the cuticle
a<00:00:52.739> little<00:00:53.010> bit<00:00:53.190> because<00:00:53.640> it'll<00:00:53.850> actually<00:00:53.969> help

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
a little bit because it'll actually help

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.529 
a little bit because it'll actually help
the<00:00:54.719> effect<00:00:55.319> of<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.679> design<00:00:56.179> but<00:00:57.179> preferably

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
the effect of the design but preferably

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.259 
the effect of the design but preferably
just<00:00:57.899> get<00:00:58.019> really<00:00:58.409> close<00:00:58.649> without<00:00:59.519> flooding

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
just get really close without flooding

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.029 
just get really close without flooding
so<00:01:00.629> you're<00:01:00.749> basically<00:01:00.989> creating<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.739> reverse

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
so you're basically creating a reverse

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.369 
so you're basically creating a reverse
French<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:03.269> I'm<00:01:03.510> just<00:01:03.690> going<00:01:03.839> to<00:01:03.899> carry<00:01:04.199> this

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
French so I'm just going to carry this

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.100 
French so I'm just going to carry this
side<00:01:04.620> down<00:01:05.190> and<00:01:05.550> make<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.909> kind<00:01:06.210> of<00:01:06.270> thin<00:01:06.900> out<00:01:07.079> a

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
side down and make it kind of thin out a

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.719 
side down and make it kind of thin out a
little<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.829> then<00:01:08.070> at<00:01:08.219> the<00:01:08.340> end<00:01:08.430> I'm<00:01:08.640> gonna

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
little and then at the end I'm gonna

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.050 
little and then at the end I'm gonna
give<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.090> bit<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.509> sort<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.079> a<00:01:10.200> bulbous

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
give it a bit of a sort of a bulbous

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.880 
give it a bit of a sort of a bulbous
return<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:13.020> I'm<00:01:13.140> gonna<00:01:13.229> do<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.500> same<00:01:13.680> thing

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
return and I'm gonna do the same thing

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.969 
return and I'm gonna do the same thing
for<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.100> other<00:01:14.219> side<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.759> I'm<00:01:15.090> going<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.979> add

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
for the other side and I'm going to add

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.039 
for the other side and I'm going to add
some<00:01:17.520> more<00:01:17.729> sort<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.180> blood<00:01:18.539> drop<00:01:18.840> it's

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
some more sort of blood drop it's

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.690 
some more sort of blood drop it's
actually<00:01:19.409> easier<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.860> do<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.100> Reverse<00:01:20.399> like

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
actually easier to do it in Reverse like

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.749 
actually easier to do it in Reverse like
this<00:01:20.969> so<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:22.020> create<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.649> sort<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.219> fats

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
this so you can create a sort of fats

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.350 
this so you can create a sort of fats
blotch<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.539> then<00:01:24.780> thin<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.619> out<00:01:26.090> as<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.240> get

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
blotch and then thin it out as you get

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.810 
blotch and then thin it out as you get
towards<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.719> cuticle<00:01:28.219> okay<00:01:29.219> so<00:01:29.399> now<00:01:29.549> I've<00:01:29.640> got

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
towards the cuticle okay so now I've got

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.550 
towards the cuticle okay so now I've got
the<00:01:29.969> basic<00:01:30.329> sort<00:01:30.539> of<00:01:30.600> line<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:31.049> where<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.289> want

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the basic sort of line of where I want

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.529 
the basic sort of line of where I want
everything<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.670> I'm<00:01:32.759> going<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:32.969> go<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.329> and

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
everything so I'm going to go in and

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.740 
everything so I'm going to go in and
sort<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.810> continue<00:01:34.560> and<00:01:35.219> just<00:01:35.250> sort<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.750> dark

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
sort of continue and just sort of dark

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.959 
sort of continue and just sort of dark
in<00:01:36.930> all<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.200> these<00:01:37.320> areas<00:01:37.560> I'm<00:01:38.549> also<00:01:38.700> gonna

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:38.969 
in all of these areas I'm also gonna

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:41.480 
in all of these areas I'm also gonna
thicken<00:01:39.450> up<00:01:39.659> that<00:01:40.079> line<00:01:40.380> by<00:01:40.560> my<00:01:40.710> cuticle<00:01:41.219> and

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
thicken up that line by my cuticle and

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.060 
thicken up that line by my cuticle and
it's<00:01:42.000> gonna<00:01:42.119> sort<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.509> have<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.719> random<00:01:43.320> depth

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
it's gonna sort of have a random depth

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.679 
it's gonna sort of have a random depth
it's<00:01:44.369> not<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.700> be<00:01:44.789> continuous<00:01:45.420> all<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
it's not going to be continuous all the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.919 
it's not going to be continuous all the
way<00:01:45.810> through<00:01:46.079> once<00:01:47.039> you've<00:01:47.219> given<00:01:47.429> your

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
way through once you've given your

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.410 
way through once you've given your
bloody<00:01:48.929> nails<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.619> chance<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:50.100> dry<00:01:50.340> finish<00:01:51.270> your

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
bloody nails a chance to dry finish your

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.969 
bloody nails a chance to dry finish your
design<00:01:51.659> off<00:01:51.899> with<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> layer<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.500> top<00:01:52.679> coat<00:01:52.740> to

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
design off with a layer of top coat to

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.830 
design off with a layer of top coat to
help<00:01:53.219> seal<00:01:53.609> it<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.119> make<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.600> nice<00:01:54.780> and

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
help seal it in and make it nice and
