since<00:00:02.690> my<00:00:02.840> last<00:00:03.020> video<00:00:03.350> I<00:00:03.910> have<00:00:04.910> been<00:00:05.149> playing

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.270 
since my last video I have been playing

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.389 
since my last video I have been playing
around<00:00:05.479> for<00:00:05.750> Sketchup<00:00:06.200> and<00:00:06.500> come<00:00:07.040> up<00:00:07.190> with<00:00:07.339> a

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:07.399 
around for Sketchup and come up with a

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:09.850 
around for Sketchup and come up with a
sign<00:00:07.700> and<00:00:08.240> that's<00:00:08.450> just<00:00:08.629> as<00:00:09.049> you<00:00:09.230> can<00:00:09.379> see<00:00:09.590> here

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:09.860 
sign and that's just as you can see here

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.779 
sign and that's just as you can see here
this<00:00:10.369> is<00:00:10.610> a<00:00:10.639> is<00:00:11.539> not<00:00:11.869> really<00:00:12.650> the<00:00:12.920> size<00:00:13.400> I<00:00:13.610> want

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:13.789 
this is a is not really the size I want

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.720 
this is a is not really the size I want
it<00:00:13.969> to<00:00:14.000> be<00:00:14.119> but<00:00:14.449> mostly<00:00:14.840> was<00:00:15.049> to<00:00:15.400> try<00:00:16.400> out<00:00:16.550> some

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
it to be but mostly was to try out some

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.890 
it to be but mostly was to try out some
concepts<00:00:17.240> and<00:00:18.790> and<00:00:19.790> yeah<00:00:20.120> and<00:00:20.570> get<00:00:20.750> familiar

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
concepts and and yeah and get familiar

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.340 
concepts and and yeah and get familiar
with<00:00:21.170> Sketchup<00:00:21.680> itself<00:00:22.630> it<00:00:23.630> should<00:00:24.170> actually

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
with Sketchup itself it should actually

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.470 
with Sketchup itself it should actually
work<00:00:24.590> the<00:00:24.950> CNC<00:00:25.370> but<00:00:25.610> it's<00:00:25.789> too<00:00:26.030> big<00:00:26.210> for<00:00:26.450> my

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
work the CNC but it's too big for my

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.500 
work the CNC but it's too big for my
room<00:00:27.289> wang<00:00:27.650> and<00:00:27.950> go<00:00:28.130> and<00:00:28.250> place<00:00:28.430> it<00:00:28.610> I<00:00:28.760> will

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
room wang and go and place it I will

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.450 
room wang and go and place it I will

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
if if you want to and then you can play

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.690 
if if you want to and then you can play
around<00:00:35.750> with<00:00:36.110> yourself<00:00:36.739> and<00:00:36.950> see<00:00:37.340> if<00:00:37.430> you<00:00:37.520> want

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
around with yourself and see if you want

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.180 
around with yourself and see if you want
to<00:00:37.790> build<00:00:37.940> this<00:00:38.060> one<00:00:38.270> now<00:00:38.930> some<00:00:39.230> things<00:00:39.500> that<00:00:39.860> I

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
to build this one now some things that I

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.020 
to build this one now some things that I
have<00:00:40.520> gnosis<00:00:41.060> when<00:00:41.239> I<00:00:41.390> I<00:00:42.190> decided<00:00:43.190> this<00:00:43.460> how

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
have gnosis when I I decided this how

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.360 
have gnosis when I I decided this how
I'm<00:00:44.180> going<00:00:44.360> to<00:00:44.420> join<00:00:44.750> these<00:00:45.110> science<00:00:45.980> and<00:00:46.250> now

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
I'm going to join these science and now

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.160 
I'm going to join these science and now
now<00:00:46.790> in<00:00:46.910> my<00:00:47.030> head<00:00:47.210> it<00:00:47.540> looked<00:00:47.780> like<00:00:47.870> a<00:00:47.989> good

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
now in my head it looked like a good

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.690 
now in my head it looked like a good
idea<00:00:48.230> to<00:00:48.590> drill<00:00:48.800> a<00:00:48.829> hole<00:00:48.890> and<00:00:49.309> then<00:00:49.399> make<00:00:49.670> a

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:49.700 
idea to drill a hole and then make a

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.220 
idea to drill a hole and then make a
square<00:00:50.660> for<00:00:51.079> the<00:00:51.110> nun<00:00:51.350> and<00:00:51.559> in<00:00:52.520> reality<00:00:52.700> I<00:00:53.239> went

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
square for the nun and in reality I went

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.680 
square for the nun and in reality I went
down<00:00:54.380> to<00:00:54.559> the<00:00:54.590> shop<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.130> then<00:00:55.850> I<00:00:55.880> bought<00:00:56.390> some

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
down to the shop and then I bought some

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.220 
down to the shop and then I bought some
some<00:00:57.230> wood<00:00:57.440> in<00:00:57.590> mdf<00:00:58.460> and<00:00:58.790> I<00:00:59.540> tried<00:00:59.780> cutting<00:01:00.020> up

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
some wood in mdf and I tried cutting up

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.430 
some wood in mdf and I tried cutting up
some<00:01:00.410> pieces<00:01:00.590> like<00:01:00.829> this<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:01.989> the<00:01:02.989> first<00:01:03.200> idea

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
some pieces like this and the first idea

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.800 
some pieces like this and the first idea
was<00:01:03.530> to<00:01:03.860> cut<00:01:03.980> the<00:01:04.100> square<00:01:04.339> but<00:01:04.549> I<00:01:04.579> figure<00:01:05.449> when

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
was to cut the square but I figure when

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.410 
was to cut the square but I figure when
I<00:01:05.840> had<00:01:06.109> to<00:01:06.259> do<00:01:06.380> this<00:01:06.619> 100<00:01:07.189> times<00:01:07.880> in<00:01:08.030> one<00:01:08.179> piece

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
I had to do this 100 times in one piece

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.499 
I had to do this 100 times in one piece
it<00:01:09.319> would<00:01:09.560> be<00:01:09.740> quite<00:01:10.069> tedious<00:01:10.310> so<00:01:10.939> I<00:01:10.969> came<00:01:11.149> up

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:11.509 
it would be quite tedious so I came up

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:13.719 
it would be quite tedious so I came up
with<00:01:11.539> drilling<00:01:11.990> a<00:01:12.139> hole<00:01:12.170> like<00:01:12.499> this<00:01:12.560> and<00:01:13.039> then

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
with drilling a hole like this and then

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.489 
with drilling a hole like this and then
another<00:01:14.329> top<00:01:14.719> and<00:01:14.959> then<00:01:15.049> used<00:01:15.259> to<00:01:15.380> be

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:15.499 
another top and then used to be

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:18.399 
another top and then used to be
schooling<00:01:15.770> together<00:01:16.130> now<00:01:16.789> this<00:01:17.389> work<00:01:17.659> finally

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
schooling together now this work finally

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.069 
schooling together now this work finally
the<00:01:18.649> in<00:01:19.369> the<00:01:19.549> head<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:19.969> I<00:01:20.179> aren't<00:01:20.479> even<00:01:20.840> here

00:01:21.069 --> 00:01:21.079 
the in the head and I aren't even here

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:23.230 
the in the head and I aren't even here
but<00:01:21.740> some<00:01:21.979> of<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:22.159> pieces<00:01:22.340> were<00:01:22.639> quite<00:01:22.909> small

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
but some of the pieces were quite small

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.379 
but some of the pieces were quite small
so<00:01:23.299> I<00:01:23.569> was<00:01:24.039> kind<00:01:25.039> of<00:01:25.189> scared<00:01:25.310> that<00:01:25.579> that<00:01:26.240> the

00:01:26.379 --> 00:01:26.389 
so I was kind of scared that that the

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:28.149 
so I was kind of scared that that the
whole<00:01:26.600> would<00:01:26.779> be<00:01:26.959> too<00:01:27.289> big<00:01:27.469> it<00:01:27.649> like<00:01:27.889> you<00:01:28.009> can

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
whole would be too big it like you can

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.370 
whole would be too big it like you can
see<00:01:28.279> here<00:01:28.490> there<00:01:29.060> wouldn't<00:01:29.209> be<00:01:29.420> enough<00:01:29.689> around

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
see here there wouldn't be enough around

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.989 
see here there wouldn't be enough around
the<00:01:30.529> science<00:01:30.889> here<00:01:31.009> to<00:01:31.159> keep<00:01:31.369> interest<00:01:31.729> rate

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:31.999 
the science here to keep interest rate

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:34.870 
the science here to keep interest rate
and<00:01:32.679> when<00:01:33.679> I<00:01:33.709> tighten<00:01:34.069> it<00:01:34.279> up<00:01:34.429> down<00:01:34.639> it<00:01:34.789> I

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
and when I tighten it up down it I

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.870 
and when I tighten it up down it I
actually<00:01:35.060> broke<00:01:35.569> it<00:01:35.749> this<00:01:36.200> way<00:01:36.349> so<00:01:37.009> so<00:01:37.520> I<00:01:37.549> tried

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
actually broke it this way so so I tried

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.459 
actually broke it this way so so I tried
to<00:01:37.909> make<00:01:38.209> a<00:01:38.240> smaller<00:01:38.569> hole<00:01:38.810> like<00:01:38.959> this<00:01:38.990> one<00:01:39.289> and

00:01:39.459 --> 00:01:39.469 
to make a smaller hole like this one and

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:41.499 
to make a smaller hole like this one and
I've<00:01:39.590> actually<00:01:39.920> worked<00:01:40.219> out<00:01:40.459> quite<00:01:40.639> well<00:01:40.759> it

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
I've actually worked out quite well it

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:43.929 
I've actually worked out quite well it
did<00:01:41.779> the<00:01:42.170> nuts<00:01:42.349> it's<00:01:42.619> really<00:01:43.310> firm<00:01:43.549> in<00:01:43.729> there

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
did the nuts it's really firm in there

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.489 
did the nuts it's really firm in there
and<00:01:44.270> then<00:01:44.389> you<00:01:44.539> just<00:01:44.719> tighten<00:01:44.990> this<00:01:45.200> one<00:01:45.259> down

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:45.499 
and then you just tighten this one down

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:48.399 
and then you just tighten this one down
and<00:01:45.770> it's<00:01:46.069> drawn<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:47.090> so<00:01:47.569> I'm<00:01:47.869> probably

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
and it's drawn and so I'm probably

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.190 
and it's drawn and so I'm probably
mainly<00:01:48.709> going<00:01:48.919> to<00:01:49.039> use<00:01:49.189> this<00:01:49.340> joint<00:01:49.669> and<00:01:50.200> and

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
mainly going to use this joint and and

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.959 
mainly going to use this joint and and
not<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:51.709> that<00:01:51.889> much<00:01:52.099> this<00:01:52.279> one<00:01:52.490> because<00:01:52.700> this

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
not so that much this one because this

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:55.089 
not so that much this one because this
is<00:01:53.029> going<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.599> get<00:01:53.689> easier<00:01:54.049> over<00:01:54.349> time<00:01:54.679> thing

00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:55.099 
is going to get easier over time thing

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:59.050 
is going to get easier over time thing
and<00:01:55.749> for<00:01:56.749> the<00:01:56.840> next<00:01:56.959> thing<00:01:57.459> you<00:01:58.459> can<00:01:58.639> see<00:01:58.849> it<00:01:58.939> up

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
and for the next thing you can see it up

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.440 
and for the next thing you can see it up
here

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.010 

and<00:02:02.200> it's<00:02:02.439> somewhere<00:02:02.829> of<00:02:03.039> linear<00:02:03.759> in

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
and it's somewhere of linear in

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.279 
and it's somewhere of linear in
lingering<00:02:05.020> bearings<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.159> then<00:02:06.549> I<00:02:06.930> came<00:02:07.930> up

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
lingering bearings and then I came up

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.680 
lingering bearings and then I came up
with<00:02:08.470> this<00:02:08.590> one<00:02:08.830> see<00:02:09.429> some<00:02:09.640> other<00:02:09.789> gases<00:02:10.239> and

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
with this one see some other gases and

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.119 
with this one see some other gases and
the<00:02:10.810> internets<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.379> think<00:02:11.650> i'm<00:02:11.739> going<00:02:11.920> to<00:02:12.010> use

00:02:12.119 --> 00:02:12.129 
the internets and think i'm going to use

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:15.210 
the internets and think i'm going to use
the<00:02:12.250> same<00:02:12.459> so<00:02:13.090> i<00:02:13.120> made<00:02:13.390> this<00:02:13.709> template<00:02:14.709> so<00:02:15.190> i

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
the same so i made this template so i

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.699 
the same so i made this template so i
can<00:02:15.550> test<00:02:16.090> it<00:02:16.239> up<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:16.629> see<00:02:17.019> how<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.290> would<00:02:17.470> sit

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
can test it up and see how it would sit

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.360 
can test it up and see how it would sit
and<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.989> just<00:02:19.989> works<00:02:20.170> quite<00:02:20.380> well<00:02:20.410> so<00:02:20.769> I'm

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
and it just works quite well so I'm

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.500 
and it just works quite well so I'm
think<00:02:21.610> I'm<00:02:21.700> going<00:02:21.910> to<00:02:21.970> stick<00:02:22.180> with<00:02:22.239> this<00:02:22.450> one

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
think I'm going to stick with this one

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.270 
think I'm going to stick with this one
and<00:02:24.569> yeah<00:02:25.569> well<00:02:26.080> that's<00:02:26.440> actually<00:02:26.950> what<00:02:27.250> i

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
and yeah well that's actually what i

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.300 
and yeah well that's actually what i
have<00:02:27.549> been<00:02:27.760> doing<00:02:27.819> over<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.360> last<00:02:28.769> 14<00:02:29.769> days<00:02:29.980> i

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
have been doing over the last 14 days i

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.550 
have been doing over the last 14 days i
have<00:02:30.549> a<00:02:30.690> mainly<00:02:31.690> getting<00:02:32.170> familiar<00:02:32.530> with

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
have a mainly getting familiar with

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.280 
have a mainly getting familiar with
sketchup<00:02:33.129> and<00:02:33.310> trying<00:02:34.209> to<00:02:34.360> come<00:02:34.599> up<00:02:34.810> with<00:02:34.930> some

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
sketchup and trying to come up with some

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.660 
sketchup and trying to come up with some
signs<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:36.069> in<00:02:37.000> my<00:02:37.180> head<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.599> then<00:02:37.720> try<00:02:38.110> to

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
signs and in my head and then try to

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.600 
signs and in my head and then try to
prove<00:02:39.670> some<00:02:39.849> concepts<00:02:40.390> on<00:02:40.660> the<00:02:41.370> sketchup<00:02:42.370> from

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
prove some concepts on the sketchup from

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.740 
prove some concepts on the sketchup from
here<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.799> as<00:02:44.799> i<00:02:45.010> said<00:02:45.069> if<00:02:45.790> this<00:02:46.000> one<00:02:46.329> the<00:02:46.480> idea

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
here and as i said if this one the idea

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.089 
here and as i said if this one the idea
is<00:02:46.870> that<00:02:46.989> if<00:02:47.620> i<00:02:47.769> remove<00:02:48.069> this<00:02:48.310> that<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:50.099> one

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:51.099 
is that if i remove this that the one

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.830 
is that if i remove this that the one
stepping<00:02:51.400> motor<00:02:51.640> goes<00:02:51.910> here<00:02:52.180> in<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.660> back

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
stepping motor goes here in the back

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
stepping motor goes here in the back
then<00:02:53.829> another<00:02:54.130> one<00:02:54.340> on<00:02:54.430> top<00:02:54.700> here<00:02:55.030> and<00:02:55.709> one<00:02:56.709> on

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
then another one on top here and one on

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.400 
then another one on top here and one on
the<00:02:57.040> side<00:02:57.220> here<00:02:57.280> I<00:02:57.819> don't<00:02:58.660> know<00:02:58.780> what<00:02:58.989> time<00:02:59.200> but

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
the side here I don't know what time but

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.680 
the side here I don't know what time but
as<00:02:59.680> I<00:02:59.860> said<00:03:00.010> this<00:03:00.190> isn't<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.760> 1i<00:03:01.060> want<00:03:01.420> to<00:03:01.510> use

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
as I said this isn't the 1i want to use

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.110 
as I said this isn't the 1i want to use
it's<00:03:02.590> just<00:03:02.860> one<00:03:03.069> on<00:03:03.190> me<00:03:03.340> to<00:03:03.549> prove<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:03.910> concept

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
it's just one on me to prove the concept

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.300 
it's just one on me to prove the concept
and<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.599> get<00:03:04.750> familiar<00:03:04.959> with<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.560> sketch<00:03:06.130> of

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
and to get familiar with the sketch of

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.509 
and to get familiar with the sketch of
itself<00:03:06.639> so<00:03:07.450> if<00:03:08.079> you<00:03:08.200> want<00:03:08.380> to<00:03:08.440> download<00:03:08.590> links

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:09.519 
itself so if you want to download links

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.670 
itself so if you want to download links
should<00:03:09.639> be<00:03:09.819> in<00:03:10.030> the<00:03:10.239> description<00:03:11.230> bar<00:03:11.410> and

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
should be in the description bar and

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.809 
should be in the description bar and
then<00:03:12.459> well<00:03:13.239> go<00:03:13.569> ahead<00:03:14.290> and<00:03:14.680> we'll<00:03:15.609> see<00:03:15.730> you

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
then well go ahead and we'll see you

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.620 
then well go ahead and we'll see you
next<00:03:15.940> time<00:03:16.209> i<00:03:16.720> get<00:03:16.989> something<00:03:17.350> to<00:03:17.470> learn
