 Hi, I'm Esther and this time we're going 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.360
 to make this case by recycling a tube 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.620
 cardboard and a piece of cloth and also what 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.860
 let's do without sewing 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.860
 [Music] 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.550
 to do it we're going to need a tube 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.640
 cardboard fabric a zipper silicone 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:33.190
 hot or cold pencil and scissors 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:35.590
 [Music] 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.719
 We are going to use a cardboard tube as 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.719
 this and we're going to cut it in half 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.440
 [Music] 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.290
 now we stick a zipper to the tube 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:01:22.360
 using hot or cold silicone 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:01:24.940
 [Music] 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.620
 on a piece of cloth we are going to trace the 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:32.440
 contour of the two ends of the tube 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:35.010
 [Music] 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.590
 now we cut them with the scissors 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.590
 leaving a margin of one centimeter 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.590
 approximately 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.119
 we are also going to make some cuts for 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.890
 all around just reaching the mark 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:02:01.680
 what we had done 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:02:03.480
 [Music] 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.300
 it has to stay like this 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:11.060
 [Music] 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.190
 in the next step we put silicone in 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.270
 the end and we stick it to the piece of cloth 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.270
 that we had cut 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.110
 then we are sticking to the tube all the 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:35.420
 edge 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:37.849
 [Music] 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.959
 we do the same thing on the other end and you 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.959
 It has to be like this 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.430
 now we will use a piece of cloth a 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.770
 slightly wider than the tube and eye 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.920
 doing the hem of the ends and 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:03:03.709
 the one on the sides 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:03:03.709
 [Music] 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:10.210
 once done the hems we stick it 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.210
 to the tube with hot or cold silicone 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:33.290
 [Music] 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.850
 to make the last hem we are going to 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.090
 measure well how far you have to go 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.290
 so that we are left to the right measure and 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:04:12.800
 we stick it 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:04:16.010
 [Music] 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.590
 we have already finished our case as 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.660
 you have seen is very easy to do and how 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.840
 We have used recycled material is 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.880
 very economical 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.400
