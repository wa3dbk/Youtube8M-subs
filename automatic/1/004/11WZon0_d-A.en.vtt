00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:08.700
 Chillingo thereby in this video 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.670
 I will send you the trusty iphone 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.610
 Today you show how your ringing tone 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.139
 can change so on the phone 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.020
 that certain one on itunes yourself 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.970
 any ringtones for 1 euro or 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.910
 it is not really possible to buy 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.580
 a big rip off since 20 or 30 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.880
 seconds clips are and today I show 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.989
 just how you do it for free 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:37.770
 your word of course itunes and any 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.129
 a file that wanted to use the here 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.540
 file that I'm going to use today 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.070
 then at it 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.260
 I believe most companies so 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.280
 Contracting aunt then bothers most 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:58.920
 you know this song and play 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:01.530
 only it's okay 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.789
 and then we'll catch it 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.789
 rather open with itunes 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.300
 and then the file to the media library 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.390
 could add here file for 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:25.520
 Add a library 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:31.830
 then we are the same as from 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.880
 Imports something like that here as well 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.400
 we have to do it now 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.119
 with information we just last 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.509
 all unnecessary data we actually 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.580
 yes with a child with breaks something like 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:47.040
 comment on the interpretation and yes panic and 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.220
 now if he does not don the file yet 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.470
 forces frankfurtern even if that 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.520
 is up to you it could be one 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:02:00.680
 we park and now is important 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:04.850
 it makes like options here 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.560
 stop at 30 seconds time 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.509
 because it just so with the ringtones 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.820
 was optimized that the total duration 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.100
 a ringing tone only 30 seconds 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.620
 may be 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:20.070
 and you can also do it if you are 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.080
 the beginning of the song did not please 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.070
 then you can also just here at 4 10 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:30.510
 seconds not pure and below 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:33.570
 40 So it's all in all 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.840
 the difference of stopping with 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.730
 died at 30 seconds result 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:42.120
 but at ganter then I find the 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.760
 other visitors come after 20 seconds 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.660
 Somehow nothing more so great it namely 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.800
 the group therefore church 21 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.700
 so now we have a kind 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.450
 Events are available on all model versions 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.890
 do not create, but create 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.500
 Somehow like mp3 version 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.670
 It's easy going there 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.340
 Click here to the left of this little click 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.950
 then on settings 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.460
 Here he comes first on general and 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.230
 there you click on the port settings 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.390
 and here you choose the ac messenger 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.260
 from somehow not something like mp3 or 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:23.840
 wma pull finished is important too 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.640
 We here at the source one 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.640
 you have hooks for sounds because you if you 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.130
 then here on the categories sounds go 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.590
 want to see may see your doors if you 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:39.310
 no hooks has the category appears 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:42.620
 so do not hook there so ok and 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:47.480
 just then only a pc 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.800
 version rtm version created here can 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.930
 you also see the duration as well as 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:59.270
 it is set 22 seconds 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:04:01.430
 now we need the version about one 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:03.910
 Just put it on the goal here 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.910
 desktop 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.480
 So I last again then 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.490
 decrease 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.459
 So here's my kind of season with me 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.650
 Becomes Her but already m4a most 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.299
 This mph is not presented there 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.610
 that I urgently needed now 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.010
 therefore region left could turn on strong 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:28.010
 on the keyboard the second button of 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:31.230
 Press down or write down on the left 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:35.310
 just here then folder options 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:38.640
 is also folder options under option 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.080
 still view then here must the hook 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.110
 removed at extensions in known 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.330
 file types that you then just this 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.390
 At the end of the day still corners so with away 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:52.080
 take over the hook 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:54.980
 so now we have the end 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.110
 change from mtm 4 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.510
 so now first, yes, the patres 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.670
 but she will not give away and sacrifice 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.070
 because it sounds like a super duper 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.870
 so just yeah and now you can go here 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:12.990
 already seen, m4e will he and his itunes 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:17.040
 itunes old has appeared now 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:19.590
 important is that we have this version 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.290
 we here put the emission something else 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.550
 the old mbh is the one we have to delete 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.460
 So just remove 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:29.820
 unresolved in the wastebasket and then you go 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:33.840
 on tones and pulls this file on 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.850
 the desktop just has over then 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.110
 already there and then appeared at the same time 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:41.010
 also how to do that with the iphone 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.570
 synchronized so you experience yours 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:46.500
 iphone mainz of course the post goes out 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:50.010
 then on tones 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.230
 we are selected for mine and here 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:53.360
 you had to hook her first 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.830
 we'll put it at all 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.220
 sync and then you can 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.410
 just tick with then and then 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:05.610
 would have to apply here click above 

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:10.530
 can you count that right there 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:11.849
 1 copy and then exactly and I ask 

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:14.250
 get on my mobile quickly 

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:17.780
 From that you see it can be 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.780
 would if someone calls 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:42.150
 Exactly I also have more rings 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:44.460
 if you like something like bmi or the or 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.650
 a modified version of the stand 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:59.250
 and the iphone is in the 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:07:01.770
