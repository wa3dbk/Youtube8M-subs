but<00:00:06.120> let's<00:00:06.390> start<00:00:06.899> by<00:00:07.380> looking<00:00:07.590> in<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:07.950> book

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
but let's start by looking in the book

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.070 
but let's start by looking in the book
that<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:08.340> gave<00:00:08.610> you<00:00:10.190> so<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.670> female<00:00:12.629> part<00:00:12.930> of

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
that I gave you so the female part of

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.320 
that I gave you so the female part of
the<00:00:13.139> plant<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.769> pistol<00:00:14.400> we're<00:00:14.879> not<00:00:15.029> used

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
the plant is the pistol we're not used

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.750 
the plant is the pistol we're not used
to<00:00:15.449> p<00:00:15.869> sounding<00:00:16.470> words<00:00:16.680> being<00:00:17.039> about<00:00:17.310> female

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
to p sounding words being about female

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.939 
to p sounding words being about female
genitals<00:00:18.330> but<00:00:18.570> here<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.840> is<00:00:18.990> I<00:00:19.230> think<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.859> her

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
genitals but here it is I think of her

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.210 
genitals but here it is I think of her
as<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.100> pistol<00:00:20.550> packin<00:00:20.910> mama<00:00:21.470> alright<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:23.040> the

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
as a pistol packin mama alright so the

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.540 
as a pistol packin mama alright so the
pistol<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.090> comprised<00:00:25.020> of<00:00:25.020> three<00:00:25.800> structures

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
pistol is comprised of three structures

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.630 
pistol is comprised of three structures
starting<00:00:26.970> from<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.270> bottom<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:28.170> ovary<00:00:28.740> which

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
starting from the bottom the ovary which

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.850 
starting from the bottom the ovary which
is<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.940> place<00:00:30.150> that<00:00:30.180> the<00:00:30.720> fertilized<00:00:31.410> seeds

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:31.860 
is the place that the fertilized seeds

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.209 
is the place that the fertilized seeds
will<00:00:32.160> be<00:00:32.600> moving<00:00:33.600> up<00:00:33.899> from<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.289> ovary<00:00:34.649> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
will be moving up from the ovary the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.010 
will be moving up from the ovary the
style<00:00:35.699> because<00:00:36.329> she's<00:00:36.510> a<00:00:36.539> pistol-packing

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
style because she's a pistol-packing

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.209 
style because she's a pistol-packing
mama<00:00:37.320> with<00:00:37.710> style<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:39.409> right<00:00:40.409> out<00:00:40.739> at<00:00:41.039> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
mama with style and right out at the

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.459 
mama with style and right out at the
very<00:00:41.519> end<00:00:41.819> is<00:00:42.449> the<00:00:43.370> stigma<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.989> you<00:00:45.989> will<00:00:46.260> have

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
very end is the stigma and you will have

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.079 
very end is the stigma and you will have
to<00:00:46.620> forgive<00:00:46.649> me<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> Catholic<00:00:48.479> a<00:00:48.769> childhood

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 
to forgive me but a Catholic a childhood

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.520 
to forgive me but a Catholic a childhood
leads<00:00:51.089> me<00:00:51.389> to<00:00:51.539> make<00:00:51.690> only<00:00:51.870> one<00:00:52.019> of<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
leads me to make only one of the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.829 
leads me to make only one of the
association<00:00:53.249> with<00:00:53.370> stigma<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:54.089> that<00:00:54.569> is<00:00:54.809> a

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
association with stigma and that is a

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:57.829 
association with stigma and that is a
bloody<00:00:55.350> hand<00:00:55.800> reaching<00:00:56.609> up<00:00:56.819> like<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.089> stigmata

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
bloody hand reaching up like a stigmata

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.529 
bloody hand reaching up like a stigmata
so<00:00:58.649> that's<00:00:58.829> how<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.039> remember<00:00:59.219> stigma<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
so that's how I remember stigma the

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.989 
so that's how I remember stigma the
stigma<00:01:01.019> is<00:01:01.229> like<00:01:01.409> the<00:01:01.559> hand<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.249> reaches<00:01:02.819> up

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:02.999 
stigma is like the hand that reaches up

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:06.469 
stigma is like the hand that reaches up
to<00:01:03.239> get<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.539> pollen<00:01:03.959> the<00:01:04.830> style<00:01:05.460> connects<00:01:06.240> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
to get the pollen the style connects the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.560 
to get the pollen the style connects the
stigma<00:01:06.960> to<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.440> ovary<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.430> style<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.970> solid

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
stigma to the ovary the style is solid

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.069 
stigma to the ovary the style is solid
it<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.810> not<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.140> tube<00:01:10.579> so<00:01:11.579> when<00:01:11.759> pollen<00:01:12.240> lands<00:01:12.899> on

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:13.079 
it is not a tube so when pollen lands on

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.490 
it is not a tube so when pollen lands on
the<00:01:13.469> stigma<00:01:14.130> it<00:01:14.340> has<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.210> make<00:01:15.420> enzymes<00:01:15.750> which

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the stigma it has to make enzymes which

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.639 
the stigma it has to make enzymes which
are<00:01:16.590> specialized<00:01:17.159> proteins<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:18.420> carve<00:01:19.320> a

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
are specialized proteins that carve a

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.539 
are specialized proteins that carve a
way<00:01:19.950> down<00:01:20.280> through<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.060> style<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:22.130> if<00:01:23.130> its

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
way down through the style and if its

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.080 
way down through the style and if its
pollen<00:01:24.210> from<00:01:24.899> a<00:01:25.189> different<00:01:26.189> plant<00:01:26.549> it's<00:01:26.880> not

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
pollen from a different plant it's not

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.870 
pollen from a different plant it's not
capable<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.750> doing<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.289> so<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.130> style<00:01:29.490> acts

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
capable of doing that so the style acts

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.870 
capable of doing that so the style acts
as<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.090> guardian<00:01:30.539> it<00:01:30.920> prevents<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.100> wrong

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
as a guardian it prevents the wrong

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.919 
as a guardian it prevents the wrong
pollen<00:01:33.630> from<00:01:34.079> getting<00:01:34.590> down<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.219> the<00:01:35.700> ovary<00:01:36.179> so

00:01:36.919 --> 00:01:36.929 
pollen from getting down to the ovary so

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.709 
pollen from getting down to the ovary so
the<00:01:37.320> male<00:01:38.219> part<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.789> the<00:01:38.880> plant<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.420> stay

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
the male part of the plant is the stay

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.789 
the male part of the plant is the stay
man<00:01:40.380> stay<00:01:41.340> men<00:01:41.969> that's<00:01:42.299> pretty<00:01:42.600> easy<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:43.530> stay

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
man stay men that's pretty easy the stay

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.590 
man stay men that's pretty easy the stay
man<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.429> male<00:01:44.609> part<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.270> has<00:01:45.420> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
man is the male part and it has the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.359 
man is the male part and it has the
filament<00:01:46.200> which<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.500> just<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.770> little<00:01:46.920> hair

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
filament which is just a little hair

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.359 
filament which is just a little hair
like<00:01:47.670> structure<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.509> topped<00:01:48.990> by<00:01:49.289> the<00:01:49.369> answer

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
like structure it topped by the answer

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.340 
like structure it topped by the answer
which<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.359> part<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:51.659> produces<00:01:52.350> the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
which is the part that produces the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.429 
which is the part that produces the
pollen<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.460> we're<00:01:53.729> talking<00:01:53.999> about<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:55.259> the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
pollen that we're talking about so the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.209 
pollen that we're talking about so the
stay<00:01:55.859> men<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:57.149> male<00:01:57.450> part<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:58.049> top<00:01:58.679> of<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
stay men the male part on top of the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.310 
stay men the male part on top of the
filament<00:01:59.729> is<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.210> anther<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.869> produces<00:02:01.320> the

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
filament is the anther that produces the

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.309 
filament is the anther that produces the
pollen<00:02:01.890> that<00:02:02.460> pollen<00:02:02.939> has<00:02:03.359> to<00:02:03.539> get<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.109> the

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
pollen that pollen has to get to the

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.069 
pollen that pollen has to get to the
stigma<00:02:04.979> when<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.090> gets<00:02:06.329> to<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.630> stigma<00:02:06.960> and

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
stigma when it gets to the stigma and

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.600 
stigma when it gets to the stigma and
it's<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.350> right<00:02:07.560> pollen<00:02:08.009> for<00:02:08.190> that<00:02:08.310> flower

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
it's the right pollen for that flower

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.180 
it's the right pollen for that flower
then<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.539> produce<00:02:09.720> enzymes<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.649> carve<00:02:11.069> a

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
then it can produce enzymes that carve a

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.520 
then it can produce enzymes that carve a
channel<00:02:11.610> through<00:02:11.850> the<00:02:12.120> style<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.690> coming<00:02:13.319> all

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
channel through the style and coming all

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.610 
channel through the style and coming all
the<00:02:13.680> way<00:02:13.710> down<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.250> ovary<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:15.030> then<00:02:15.540> as<00:02:15.780> in

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
the way down to the ovary it then as in

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.130 
the way down to the ovary it then as in
sexual<00:02:17.130> all<00:02:17.250> sexual<00:02:17.730> reproduction<00:02:18.180> fuse

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
sexual all sexual reproduction fuse

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.320 
sexual all sexual reproduction fuse
is<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.500> male<00:02:19.740> part<00:02:19.770> fuses<00:02:20.610> with<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.790> female

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
is the male part fuses with the female

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.170 
is the male part fuses with the female
part<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:21.870> thus<00:02:22.500> we<00:02:22.710> can<00:02:22.920> begin<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.880> develop

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
part and thus we can begin to develop

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.199 
part and thus we can begin to develop
the<00:02:24.360> seeds<00:02:24.870> or<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:26.010> fruit<00:02:26.340> or<00:02:26.640> whatever<00:02:27.060> that

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
the seeds or the fruit or whatever that

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.059 
the seeds or the fruit or whatever that
the<00:02:27.630> fruit<00:02:27.870> which<00:02:28.020> contains<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.830> seeds

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
the fruit which contains the seeds

the fruit which contains the seeds
whatever<00:02:29.850> that<00:02:30.120> plant<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:30.600> going<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.170> do<00:02:32.030> there

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
whatever that plant is going to do there

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.410 
whatever that plant is going to do there
are<00:02:33.270> two<00:02:33.990> primary<00:02:34.530> ways<00:02:35.100> by<00:02:35.430> which<00:02:35.459> plants<00:02:36.090> get

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
are two primary ways by which plants get

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.760 
are two primary ways by which plants get
the<00:02:37.140> pollen<00:02:37.860> from<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.610> stamen<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.170> stigma

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
the pollen from the stamen to the stigma

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.070 
the pollen from the stamen to the stigma
of<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:41.550> pistol<00:02:42.000> wind<00:02:42.690> pollination<00:02:43.440> and

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
of the pistol wind pollination and

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.150 
of the pistol wind pollination and
insect<00:02:46.080> pollination<00:02:46.530> which<00:02:46.770> includes

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
insect pollination which includes

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.440 
insect pollination which includes
anything<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.750> moves<00:02:49.080> around<00:02:49.670> alright<00:02:50.670> so

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
anything that moves around alright so

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.560 
anything that moves around alright so
when<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.140> plant<00:02:52.560> is<00:02:52.800> depending<00:02:53.190> on<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.400> wind<00:02:53.760> to

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
when a plant is depending on the wind to

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.510 
when a plant is depending on the wind to
take<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.900> pollen<00:02:55.380> from<00:02:55.620> the<00:02:55.860> answer<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.370> the

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
take the pollen from the answer to the

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.540 
take the pollen from the answer to the
stigma<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.930> then<00:02:58.350> it<00:02:58.530> usually<00:02:58.800> produces

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
stigma and then it usually produces

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.509 
stigma and then it usually produces
copious<00:03:00.450> amounts<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.080> pollen<00:03:01.320> because<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.400> can

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
copious amounts of pollen because it can

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:03.949 
copious amounts of pollen because it can
never<00:03:02.670> be<00:03:02.790> sure<00:03:02.880> which<00:03:03.239> way<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.570> wind<00:03:03.780> is

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
never be sure which way the wind is

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.220 
never be sure which way the wind is
blowing<00:03:04.019> and<00:03:05.360> these<00:03:06.360> are<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.690> plants<00:03:06.959> that

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
blowing and these are the plants that

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.720 
blowing and these are the plants that
tend<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.530> kick<00:03:07.709> up<00:03:07.860> allergies<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.489> people

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
tend to kick up allergies and people

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.340 
tend to kick up allergies and people
because<00:03:09.000> they<00:03:09.120> are<00:03:09.239> producing<00:03:09.390> huge<00:03:09.959> amounts

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
because they are producing huge amounts

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.080 
because they are producing huge amounts
of<00:03:10.470> pollen<00:03:10.620> down<00:03:11.250> in<00:03:11.430> Texas<00:03:11.820> they<00:03:11.940> have

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
of pollen down in Texas they have

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.870 
of pollen down in Texas they have
something<00:03:12.360> called<00:03:12.510> cedar<00:03:12.870> fever<00:03:13.700> all<00:03:14.700> right

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
something called cedar fever all right

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.790 
something called cedar fever all right
because<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.330> cedars<00:03:15.690> are<00:03:15.810> wind<00:03:16.110> pollinated

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
because the cedars are wind pollinated

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.770 
because the cedars are wind pollinated
right<00:03:17.190> people<00:03:17.730> get<00:03:17.880> hay<00:03:18.150> fever<00:03:18.480> because

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
right people get hay fever because

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.110 
right people get hay fever because
grasses<00:03:19.590> are<00:03:19.709> wind<00:03:20.010> pollinated<00:03:20.610> so<00:03:20.880> there's<00:03:21.060> a

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
grasses are wind pollinated so there's a

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.979 
grasses are wind pollinated so there's a
lot<00:03:21.360> of<00:03:21.390> pollen<00:03:22.100> from<00:03:23.100> them<00:03:23.660> there's<00:03:24.660> a<00:03:24.720> place

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
lot of pollen from them there's a place

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.750 
lot of pollen from them there's a place
that<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.230> teach<00:03:25.350> that<00:03:25.709> has<00:03:25.829> so<00:03:26.010> many<00:03:26.070> pine<00:03:26.430> trees

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
that I teach that has so many pine trees

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.610 
that I teach that has so many pine trees
that<00:03:27.180> you<00:03:27.209> can<00:03:27.480> sweep<00:03:27.720> up<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:27.930> pine<00:03:28.260> pollen

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
that you can sweep up the pine pollen

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.130 
that you can sweep up the pine pollen
another<00:03:29.040> wind<00:03:29.400> pollinated<00:03:30.000> plant<00:03:30.420> whereas

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
another wind pollinated plant whereas

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.880 
another wind pollinated plant whereas
plants<00:03:31.620> that<00:03:31.829> are<00:03:32.269> pollinated<00:03:33.269> by<00:03:33.530> birds<00:03:34.530> bats

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
plants that are pollinated by birds bats

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.630 
plants that are pollinated by birds bats
bees<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.850> so<00:03:36.209> on<00:03:36.420> produce<00:03:37.350> small<00:03:38.010> amounts<00:03:38.519> of

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
bees and so on produce small amounts of

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.910 
bees and so on produce small amounts of
rather<00:03:38.850> sticky<00:03:39.329> pollen<00:03:39.630> so<00:03:40.590> that<00:03:40.769> it<00:03:40.829> will

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
rather sticky pollen so that it will

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.890 
rather sticky pollen so that it will
stick<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.459> their<00:03:41.640> pollinator<00:03:42.239> and<00:03:42.510> then<00:03:42.660> be

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
stick to their pollinator and then be

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:48.170 
stick to their pollinator and then be
carried<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.410> the<00:03:43.799> next<00:03:44.160> flower<00:03:45.829> also<00:03:46.829> this<00:03:47.820> is

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
carried to the next flower also this is

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.550 
carried to the next flower also this is
a<00:03:48.799> perfect<00:03:49.799> flower<00:03:50.810> which<00:03:51.810> means<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.290> the

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
a perfect flower which means that the

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.479 
a perfect flower which means that the
stamen<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.790> the<00:03:54.510> pistol<00:03:55.140> are<00:03:55.410> together<00:03:55.920> in

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:56.489 
stamen and the pistol are together in

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.199 
stamen and the pistol are together in
the<00:03:56.880> same<00:03:57.239> flower<00:03:58.310> this<00:03:59.310> is<00:03:59.519> not<00:03:59.700> always<00:03:59.970> the

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
the same flower this is not always the

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.979 
the same flower this is not always the
case<00:04:00.769> we<00:04:01.769> believe<00:04:02.400> that<00:04:03.000> sexual<00:04:03.269> reproduction

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
case we believe that sexual reproduction

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.840 
case we believe that sexual reproduction
in<00:04:04.260> plants<00:04:04.799> began<00:04:05.310> with<00:04:06.560> female<00:04:07.579> plants<00:04:08.579> over

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
in plants began with female plants over

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.210 
in plants began with female plants over
here<00:04:09.269> and<00:04:09.420> male<00:04:10.049> plants<00:04:10.590> over<00:04:10.829> there<00:04:11.010> like

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
here and male plants over there like

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.069 
here and male plants over there like
with<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.430> cedar<00:04:11.700> trees<00:04:12.000> right<00:04:12.360> are<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.870> pine

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
with the cedar trees right are the pine

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.080 
with the cedar trees right are the pine
trees<00:04:13.380> there<00:04:13.860> are<00:04:14.010> male<00:04:14.250> pine<00:04:14.579> trees<00:04:14.850> and

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
trees there are male pine trees and

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.000 
trees there are male pine trees and
female<00:04:15.450> pine<00:04:15.690> trees<00:04:15.900> and<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.500> male<00:04:16.709> pine

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
female pine trees and the male pine

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.099 
female pine trees and the male pine
trees<00:04:17.250> make<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.579> pollen<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.570> wafts

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
trees make the pollen and it wafts

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.750 
trees make the pollen and it wafts
around<00:04:19.410> and<00:04:19.709> then<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:19.950> female<00:04:20.310> pine<00:04:20.549> trees

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
around and then the female pine trees

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:21.830 
around and then the female pine trees
get<00:04:20.910> it<00:04:21.030> and<00:04:21.180> they're<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.419> ones<00:04:21.570> that<00:04:21.660> make

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
get it and they're the ones that make

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.070 
get it and they're the ones that make
the<00:04:21.870> pine<00:04:22.109> cones<00:04:22.970> nine<00:04:23.970> so<00:04:24.360> we<00:04:24.510> think<00:04:24.720> this<00:04:24.900> is

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
the pine cones nine so we think this is

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.560 
the pine cones nine so we think this is
how<00:04:25.169> it<00:04:25.289> started<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:25.800> then<00:04:25.890> eventually<00:04:26.789> some
