ten toes today I'm going to be bringing
you<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:19.110> build<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.730> would<00:00:20.910> use<00:00:21.240> if<00:00:21.540> you

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
you the build that you would use if you

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.810 
you the build that you would use if you
were<00:00:21.869> running<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.410> sound<00:00:22.800> quick<00:00:23.070> banshee<00:00:23.550> on<00:00:23.730> a

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
were running a sound quick banshee on a

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.630 
were running a sound quick banshee on a
survival<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:25.289> many<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.369> have<00:00:26.610> seen

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
survival so many of you have seen

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.740 
survival so many of you have seen
probably<00:00:27.300> our<00:00:27.660> tower<00:00:27.930> for<00:00:28.289> survival<00:00:29.630> so<00:00:30.630> this

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
probably our tower for survival so this

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.290 
probably our tower for survival so this
is<00:00:30.779> kind<00:00:31.050> of<00:00:31.109> what<00:00:31.350> I<00:00:31.619> would<00:00:31.800> use<00:00:32.099> for<00:00:32.129> that<00:00:32.400> and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
is kind of what I would use for that and

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.180 
is kind of what I would use for that and
this<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.750> pretty<00:00:34.260> much<00:00:34.410> why<00:00:34.739> I'm<00:00:34.890> putting<00:00:35.040> this

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
this is pretty much why I'm putting this

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.420 
this is pretty much why I'm putting this
video<00:00:35.460> up<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.449> people<00:00:36.629> can<00:00:36.900> see<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.860> think

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
video up so people can see this I think

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.150 
video up so people can see this I think
all<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.730> other<00:00:38.850> frames<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.780> that<00:00:39.930> video<00:00:40.160> we

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
all the other frames in that video we

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.060 
all the other frames in that video we
already<00:00:41.370> have<00:00:41.489> videos<00:00:41.820> for<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.510> anyway<00:00:43.470> first

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
already have videos for so anyway first

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
certain range from where the banshee

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.389 
certain range from where the banshee
stands<00:01:57.569> and<00:01:57.780> where<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.929> enemies<00:01:58.229> are<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.979> if

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
stands and where the enemies are so if

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.490 
stands and where the enemies are so if
you<00:01:59.789> want<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.119> enemies<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.599> be<00:02:00.630> right<00:02:01.289> outside

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
you want the enemies to be right outside

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.100 
you want the enemies to be right outside
the<00:02:01.739> door<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.539> that's<00:02:03.539> where<00:02:03.720> you<00:02:03.750> want<00:02:04.050> them

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
the door and that's where you want them

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.010 
the door and that's where you want them
I<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:05.220> know<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.399> need<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.759> basically<00:02:06.420> theory

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
I you know you need to basically theory

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.229 
I you know you need to basically theory
craft<00:02:07.289> what<00:02:07.619> range<00:02:07.830> you<00:02:07.920> want<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.160> use<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.880> if

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
craft what range you want to use so if

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.880 
craft what range you want to use so if
you<00:02:09.390> guys<00:02:09.599> have<00:02:09.959> a<00:02:09.989> room<00:02:10.319> that<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.619> really

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
you guys have a room that you really

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.830 
you guys have a room that you really
like<00:02:11.099> what<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.790> would<00:02:11.970> do<00:02:12.120> is<00:02:12.239> I'd<00:02:12.360> go<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.660> there

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
like what I would do is I'd go in there

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.440 
like what I would do is I'd go in there
and<00:02:13.110> maybe<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.800> know<00:02:13.890> running<00:02:14.190> max<00:02:14.730> range<00:02:15.060> is

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
and maybe you know running max range is

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.209 
and maybe you know running max range is
not<00:02:15.629> working<00:02:15.930> out<00:02:16.019> because<00:02:16.379> they're<00:02:16.739> too<00:02:16.950> far

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
not working out because they're too far

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.200 
not working out because they're too far
away<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:18.150> what<00:02:18.599> I<00:02:18.629> would<00:02:18.840> suggest

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
away so what I would suggest

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.240 
away so what I would suggest
is<00:02:19.390> go<00:02:19.870> into<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.110> mission<00:02:20.500> theory<00:02:20.860> craft<00:02:21.070> what

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
is go into a mission theory craft what

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.100 
is go into a mission theory craft what
range<00:02:21.460> you<00:02:21.610> need<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:22.390> they're<00:02:22.540> right<00:02:22.810> outside

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
range you need so they're right outside

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.420 
range you need so they're right outside
the<00:02:23.440> door<00:02:23.470> but<00:02:23.800> not<00:02:23.920> opening<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.400> door

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
the door but not opening the door

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.980 
the door but not opening the door
because<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:25.090> more<00:02:25.270> you<00:02:25.300> look<00:02:25.510> out<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.780> door

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
because the more you look out the door

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.360 
because the more you look out the door
the<00:02:26.530> more<00:02:26.710> it's<00:02:26.800> going<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:27.010> mess<00:02:27.130> with<00:02:27.280> the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
the more it's going to mess with the

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.980 
the more it's going to mess with the
spawns<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:28.000> what's<00:02:28.270> nice<00:02:28.420> is<00:02:28.480> if<00:02:28.840> they're

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
spawns and what's nice is if they're

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.450 
spawns and what's nice is if they're
right<00:02:29.200> outside<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.680> door<00:02:29.740> and<00:02:30.040> it's<00:02:30.130> closed

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
right outside the door and it's closed

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.160 
right outside the door and it's closed
if<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:30.910> have<00:02:31.000> punch<00:02:31.300> through<00:02:31.600> weapons<00:02:31.930> like

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
if you have punch through weapons like

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.290 
if you have punch through weapons like
especially<00:02:32.470> like<00:02:32.680> if<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.370> put<00:02:33.610> punch<00:02:34.030> thrown

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
especially like if you put punch thrown

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.330 
especially like if you put punch thrown
a<00:02:34.360> Penta<00:02:34.780> super<00:02:35.650> good<00:02:35.800> because<00:02:36.070> it<00:02:36.160> goes

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
a Penta super good because it goes

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.290 
a Penta super good because it goes
through<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:36.580> door<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:36.970> then<00:02:37.090> you<00:02:37.180> can

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
through the door and then you can

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.030 
through the door and then you can
explode<00:02:37.690> it<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.020> you<00:02:38.410> don't<00:02:38.560> mess<00:02:38.740> up<00:02:38.770> your

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
explode it and you don't mess up your

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.080 
explode it and you don't mess up your
spawns<00:02:39.310> because<00:02:39.550> you're<00:02:39.700> not<00:02:39.820> looking

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
spawns because you're not looking

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.270 
spawns because you're not looking
outside<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.480> room<00:02:40.720> so<00:02:41.320> I<00:02:41.350> would<00:02:41.800> if<00:02:42.040> you're

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
outside the room so I would if you're

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.650 
outside the room so I would if you're
really<00:02:42.430> trying<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.790> be<00:02:43.060> serious<00:02:43.300> about<00:02:43.510> going

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
really trying to be serious about going

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.980 
really trying to be serious about going
further<00:02:43.930> I<00:02:44.200> would<00:02:44.440> theory<00:02:44.860> craft<00:02:45.160> what<00:02:45.990> range

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
further I would theory craft what range

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.440 
further I would theory craft what range
you<00:02:47.110> need<00:02:47.260> flow<00:02:48.130> is<00:02:48.250> pretty<00:02:48.460> obvious<00:02:48.610> it's

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
you need flow is pretty obvious it's

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.840 
you need flow is pretty obvious it's
kind<00:02:49.720> of<00:02:49.870> you<00:02:50.440> could<00:02:50.590> do<00:02:50.740> with<00:02:51.220> or<00:02:51.280> without<00:02:51.520> it

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
kind of you could do with or without it

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.010 
kind of you could do with or without it
because<00:02:52.210> if<00:02:52.480> you're<00:02:52.600> just<00:02:52.750> constantly

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020 
because if you're just constantly

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.250 
because if you're just constantly
dropping<00:02:53.350> plates<00:02:53.590> anyway<00:02:54.720> it's<00:02:55.720> probably

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
dropping plates anyway it's probably

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.200 
dropping plates anyway it's probably
going<00:02:56.710> to<00:02:56.770> fill<00:02:56.980> up<00:02:57.130> anyway<00:02:57.520> but<00:02:57.820> you<00:02:58.030> know<00:02:58.120> I'm

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
going to fill up anyway but you know I'm

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.310 
going to fill up anyway but you know I'm
just<00:02:58.420> going<00:02:58.570> to<00:02:58.600> run<00:02:58.750> flow<00:02:58.960> because<00:02:59.200> there's

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
just going to run flow because there's

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.680 
just going to run flow because there's
nothing<00:02:59.560> really<00:02:59.680> else<00:02:59.800> to<00:03:00.040> run<00:03:00.690> that's

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
nothing really else to run that's

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.510 
nothing really else to run that's
probably<00:03:01.960> not<00:03:02.200> a<00:03:02.260> necessary<00:03:02.800> one<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.370> other

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:03.520 
probably not a necessary one the other

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.300 
probably not a necessary one the other
necessary<00:03:04.030> ones<00:03:04.270> are<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:05.230> efficiency<00:03:06.070> months

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.510 
necessary ones are the efficiency months
I<00:03:06.460> have<00:03:07.120> forty<00:03:07.390> percent<00:03:07.920> 25%<00:03:08.920> some<00:03:09.310> of<00:03:09.430> you

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
I have forty percent 25% some of you

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.250 
I have forty percent 25% some of you
might<00:03:09.640> think<00:03:09.910> sixty-five<00:03:10.780> percent<00:03:10.900> that's

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
might think sixty-five percent that's

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.290 
might think sixty-five percent that's

seventy-five percent which is the

the<00:03:30.520> room<00:03:30.700> I<00:03:30.970> might<00:03:31.720> be<00:03:31.750> able<00:03:31.960> to<00:03:32.200> throw<00:03:32.500> it<00:03:32.650> up

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
the room I might be able to throw it up

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.550 
the room I might be able to throw it up
and<00:03:33.100> kill<00:03:33.820> them<00:03:33.970> faster<00:03:34.360> or<00:03:34.750> if<00:03:34.960> we<00:03:35.050> need<00:03:35.080> radar

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
and kill them faster or if we need radar

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.470 
and kill them faster or if we need radar
I<00:03:35.740> thought<00:03:36.370> about<00:03:36.550> running<00:03:36.700> enemy<00:03:37.180> sense

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
I thought about running enemy sense

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.870 
I thought about running enemy sense
instead<00:03:38.260> of<00:03:38.410> one<00:03:38.620> of<00:03:38.650> these<00:03:38.800> useless<00:03:39.220> ones<00:03:39.550> but

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
instead of one of these useless ones but

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.290 
instead of one of these useless ones but
you<00:03:40.890> know<00:03:41.890> it<00:03:42.250> doesn't<00:03:42.430> really<00:03:42.610> work<00:03:42.700> with<00:03:43.060> the

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
you know it doesn't really work with the

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.840 
you know it doesn't really work with the
polarities<00:03:44.110> that<00:03:44.260> are<00:03:44.350> on<00:03:44.470> them<00:03:44.650> but<00:03:44.860> that

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
polarities that are on them but that

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.000 
polarities that are on them but that
might<00:03:46.030> be<00:03:46.150> really<00:03:46.240> nice<00:03:46.510> quick<00:03:47.440> thinking<00:03:47.800> is

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
might be really nice quick thinking is

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.490 
might be really nice quick thinking is
not<00:03:48.550> needed<00:03:48.850> but<00:03:49.150> it's<00:03:49.510> nice<00:03:49.810> in<00:03:50.290> case

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
not needed but it's nice in case

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.260 
not needed but it's nice in case
something<00:03:50.920> randomly<00:03:51.700> gets<00:03:51.940> in<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.090> room

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
something randomly gets in the room

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.630 
something randomly gets in the room
takes<00:03:53.020> a<00:03:53.110> shot<00:03:53.350> at<00:03:53.380> me<00:03:53.530> maybe<00:03:53.860> I'll<00:03:54.190> be<00:03:54.370> able<00:03:54.460> to

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
takes a shot at me maybe I'll be able to

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.870 
takes a shot at me maybe I'll be able to
survive<00:03:55.090> it<00:03:55.390> with<00:03:55.690> that<00:03:55.870> chance<00:03:56.200> and<00:03:56.730> get<00:03:57.730> out

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
survive it with that chance and get out

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.430 
survive it with that chance and get out
of<00:03:58.030> it<00:03:58.120> without<00:03:58.240> messing<00:03:58.750> up<00:03:58.870> the<00:03:59.050> run<00:03:59.230> because

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
of it without messing up the run because

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.140 
of it without messing up the run because
if<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.770> sound<00:03:59.980> quick<00:04:00.130> drops<00:04:00.730> then<00:04:01.000> obviously

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
if the sound quick drops then obviously

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.290 
if the sound quick drops then obviously
you<00:04:01.600> get<00:04:01.690> overrun<00:04:02.100> con<00:04:03.100> nuit<00:04:03.310> strictly<00:04:04.090> just

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
you get overrun con nuit strictly just

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.030 
you get overrun con nuit strictly just
to<00:04:04.450> increase<00:04:04.690> so<00:04:05.110> NARS<00:04:05.290> duration<00:04:05.770> because<00:04:05.890> I

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
to increase so NARS duration because I

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.010 
to increase so NARS duration because I
noticed<00:04:06.370> that<00:04:06.430> fleeting<00:04:07.240> expertise<00:04:07.690> apps

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:08.020 
noticed that fleeting expertise apps

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.440 
noticed that fleeting expertise apps
that<00:04:08.230> pretty<00:04:08.470> low<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:09.120> it's<00:04:10.120> kind<00:04:10.180> of<00:04:10.330> nice

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
that pretty low and it's kind of nice

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.360 
that pretty low and it's kind of nice
for<00:04:10.660> it<00:04:10.750> to<00:04:10.780> stay<00:04:11.050> up<00:04:11.230> you<00:04:11.260> could<00:04:11.560> put<00:04:11.740> probably

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
for it to stay up you could put probably

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.190 
for it to stay up you could put probably
intensify<00:04:13.210> in<00:04:13.360> there<00:04:13.540> something<00:04:13.930> like<00:04:14.050> that

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
intensify in there something like that

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.960 
intensify in there something like that
if<00:04:14.380> that's<00:04:14.470> what<00:04:14.680> you're<00:04:14.800> interested<00:04:15.010> in<00:04:15.280> now

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
if that's what you're interested in now

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.880 
if that's what you're interested in now
natural<00:04:16.420> talent<00:04:16.810> is<00:04:16.960> something<00:04:17.350> that<00:04:17.530> I'm

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
natural talent is something that I'm

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.590 
natural talent is something that I'm
sure<00:04:17.920> some<00:04:18.850> of<00:04:18.940> you<00:04:18.970> might<00:04:19.180> be<00:04:19.239> wondering

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
sure some of you might be wondering

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.570 
sure some of you might be wondering
because<00:04:20.140> it's<00:04:20.410> like<00:04:20.560> okay<00:04:21.310> well<00:04:21.460> you're

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:21.580 
because it's like okay well you're

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.340 
because it's like okay well you're
sitting<00:04:21.850> in<00:04:21.910> sound<00:04:22.210> quake<00:04:22.450> the<00:04:22.690> entire<00:04:23.020> time

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
sitting in sound quake the entire time

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.110 
sitting in sound quake the entire time
you're<00:04:23.980> not<00:04:24.130> casting<00:04:24.700> why<00:04:24.820> would<00:04:24.940> you<00:04:25.030> need

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
you're not casting why would you need

you're not casting why would you need
natural<00:04:25.270> talent<00:04:26.190> this<00:04:27.190> is<00:04:27.430> strictly<00:04:27.940> if<00:04:28.360> you

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
natural talent this is strictly if you

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.940 
natural talent this is strictly if you
you<00:04:29.560> want<00:04:30.100> to<00:04:30.220> drop<00:04:30.430> your<00:04:30.640> own<00:04:30.670> plates<00:04:31.270> I<00:04:31.950> would

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:32.950 
you want to drop your own plates I would

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.700 
you want to drop your own plates I would
HIGHLY<00:04:33.520> highly<00:04:33.550> suggest<00:04:34.540> somebody<00:04:34.990> else<00:04:35.320> drop

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
HIGHLY highly suggest somebody else drop

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.080 
HIGHLY highly suggest somebody else drop
your<00:04:35.890> energy<00:04:36.160> plates<00:04:36.370> I<00:04:36.580> don't<00:04:36.880> know<00:04:36.940> if<00:04:37.000> you

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
your energy plates I don't know if you

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.390 
your energy plates I don't know if you
know<00:04:37.240> but<00:04:37.270> D<00:04:37.810> changed<00:04:38.290> it<00:04:38.410> so<00:04:38.620> you<00:04:38.680> cannot<00:04:39.160> drop

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
know but D changed it so you cannot drop

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.220 
know but D changed it so you cannot drop
energy<00:04:39.790> plates<00:04:40.090> while<00:04:40.690> you're<00:04:40.840> channeling

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
energy plates while you're channeling

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.590 
energy plates while you're channeling
anymore<00:04:41.730> when<00:04:42.730> we<00:04:42.850> made<00:04:43.000> that<00:04:43.030> tower<00:04:43.330> for

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
anymore when we made that tower for

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.050 
anymore when we made that tower for
survival<00:04:44.110> that<00:04:44.350> was<00:04:44.410> not<00:04:44.650> true<00:04:44.980> I<00:04:45.280> don't<00:04:45.940> know

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
survival that was not true I don't know

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.300 
survival that was not true I don't know
if<00:04:46.240> they<00:04:46.600> changed<00:04:46.960> it<00:04:47.050> because<00:04:47.200> of<00:04:47.620> that<00:04:47.800> I'm

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
if they changed it because of that I'm

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.820 
if they changed it because of that I'm
not<00:04:48.460> going<00:04:48.610> to<00:04:48.700> claim<00:04:48.850> that<00:04:49.090> but<00:04:49.360> basically<00:04:49.900> if

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
not going to claim that but basically if

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.090 
not going to claim that but basically if
you<00:04:51.790> want<00:04:52.030> to<00:04:52.120> drop<00:04:52.660> your<00:04:52.840> own<00:04:52.960> plates<00:04:53.260> it's

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
you want to drop your own plates it's

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.460 
you want to drop your own plates it's
going<00:04:54.400> to<00:04:54.460> be<00:04:54.850> where<00:04:55.780> you're<00:04:56.020> wanting<00:04:56.350> to

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
going to be where you're wanting to

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.470 
going to be where you're wanting to
reduce<00:04:56.800> your<00:04:56.830> time<00:04:57.310> out<00:04:57.640> of<00:04:57.880> sound<00:04:58.120> quake<00:04:58.330> as

00:04:58.470 --> 00:04:58.480 
reduce your time out of sound quake as

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.170 
reduce your time out of sound quake as
much<00:04:59.050> as<00:04:59.200> possible<00:04:59.350> so<00:04:59.950> natural<00:05:00.730> talent<00:05:01.030> just

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
much as possible so natural talent just

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.600 
much as possible so natural talent just
allows<00:05:01.420> you<00:05:01.660> that<00:05:02.260> little<00:05:02.710> bit<00:05:03.040> to<00:05:03.250> get<00:05:03.370> back

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
allows you that little bit to get back

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:04.890 
allows you that little bit to get back
into<00:05:03.790> sound<00:05:04.060> quick<00:05:04.240> faster<00:05:04.660> than<00:05:04.810> you

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
into sound quick faster than you

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.080 
into sound quick faster than you
normally<00:05:05.050> would<00:05:05.320> it's<00:05:06.070> a<00:05:06.190> small<00:05:06.460> amount<00:05:06.790> but

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
normally would it's a small amount but

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:09.510 
normally would it's a small amount but
really<00:05:07.360> that<00:05:07.600> small<00:05:07.900> margin<00:05:08.350> could<00:05:08.560> be<00:05:08.740> life

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
really that small margin could be life

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.250 
really that small margin could be life
or<00:05:09.700> death<00:05:09.730> if<00:05:10.120> they're<00:05:10.510> being<00:05:10.750> on<00:05:10.870> staggered

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
or death if they're being on staggered

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.159 
or death if they're being on staggered
so<00:05:11.470> you<00:05:11.950> know<00:05:12.040> pop<00:05:12.310> out<00:05:12.520> drop<00:05:12.760> some<00:05:12.910> plates

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
so you know pop out drop some plates

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:19.610 
so you know pop out drop some plates
some<00:05:14.169> might<00:05:14.410> be<00:05:14.590> wondering<00:05:16.260> you<00:05:17.260> know<00:05:17.290> how

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
some might be wondering you know how

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.980 
some might be wondering you know how
flights<00:05:20.620> work<00:05:20.890> and<00:05:21.100> stuff<00:05:21.280> like<00:05:21.400> that<00:05:21.460> I<00:05:22.450> would

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
flights work and stuff like that I would

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.600 
flights work and stuff like that I would
run<00:05:24.180> 200<00:05:25.180> of<00:05:25.360> the<00:05:26.020> medium<00:05:26.830> team<00:05:27.310> manager

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
run 200 of the medium team manager

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.610 
run 200 of the medium team manager
source<00:05:27.880> and<00:05:28.090> then<00:05:28.300> some<00:05:28.510> people<00:05:28.780> don't<00:05:29.440> know

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:29.620 
source and then some people don't know

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.830 
source and then some people don't know
but<00:05:29.860> you<00:05:29.890> can<00:05:30.070> actually<00:05:30.190> also<00:05:30.730> bring<00:05:31.120> regular

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
but you can actually also bring regular

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.210 
but you can actually also bring regular
team<00:05:32.080> energy<00:05:32.410> restores<00:05:32.740> so<00:05:32.980> you're<00:05:33.070> going<00:05:33.160> to

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
team energy restores so you're going to

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.740 
team energy restores so you're going to
bring<00:05:33.370> a<00:05:33.490> total<00:05:33.760> of<00:05:33.820> 400<00:05:34.030> plates<00:05:34.390> now<00:05:34.600> these

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
bring a total of 400 plates now these

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.780 
bring a total of 400 plates now these
are<00:05:35.080> half<00:05:35.470> the<00:05:35.500> effectiveness<00:05:36.070> of<00:05:36.220> the

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
are half the effectiveness of the

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:39.450 
are half the effectiveness of the
mediums<00:05:37.120> so<00:05:37.840> essentially<00:05:38.560> it's<00:05:38.919> like<00:05:39.130> having

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
mediums so essentially it's like having

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.300 
mediums so essentially it's like having
300<00:05:39.820> mediums<00:05:40.510> because<00:05:40.690> it's<00:05:40.960> half<00:05:41.169> so<00:05:41.680> half

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
300 mediums because it's half so half

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.570 
300 mediums because it's half so half
the<00:05:42.340> 200<00:05:42.940> so<00:05:43.620> basically<00:05:44.620> it's<00:05:44.919> like<00:05:45.010> 300

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
the 200 so basically it's like 300

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.400 
the 200 so basically it's like 300
mediums<00:05:45.940> in<00:05:46.120> your<00:05:46.270> inventory<00:05:46.990> he<00:05:47.140> would<00:05:47.290> just

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
mediums in your inventory he would just

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.230 
mediums in your inventory he would just
drop<00:05:47.590> two<00:05:47.860> of<00:05:47.979> the<00:05:48.070> teams<00:05:48.310> to<00:05:48.640> equal<00:05:48.880> a<00:05:48.910> medium

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
drop two of the teams to equal a medium

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.320 
drop two of the teams to equal a medium
and<00:05:50.010> if<00:05:51.010> everybody<00:05:51.370> brings<00:05:51.790> that<00:05:51.970> that's<00:05:52.240> a

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
and if everybody brings that that's a

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.050 
and if everybody brings that that's a
total<00:05:52.690> of<00:05:53.020> you<00:05:53.740> know<00:05:53.830> 1,600<00:05:54.520> plates<00:05:54.760> or

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
total of you know 1,600 plates or

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.140 
total of you know 1,600 plates or
effectively<00:05:56.020> 1,200<00:05:56.890> medium<00:05:57.610> team<00:05:57.820> energy

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
effectively 1,200 medium team energy

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.780 
effectively 1,200 medium team energy
restores<00:05:58.479> so<00:05:58.990> that's<00:05:59.500> really<00:06:00.190> a<00:06:00.220> good<00:06:00.550> way<00:06:00.760> to
