00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.300
 Volvo is a unique car manufacturer. 

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:10.000
 Everything starts with people. 

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:14.533
 Since our inception in 1927, our history, 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.267
 our Swedish culture and our focus on humanity 

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:21.533
 our philosophy formed: 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.100
 helping people, making their lives easier and more enjoyable, 

00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:29.333
 and protect them well. 

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:34.500
 Our founders said it already: "Cars are driven by people. 

00:00:34.567 --> 00:00:38.067
 "The basic philosophy behind everything we make at Volvo" 

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:40.933
 is and must always remain: safety. " 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.567
 This emphasis on safety, people and quality 

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:49.533
 has always typed our cars. 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.700
 Just like our passion for pioneering work in the field of car technology and ecology, 

00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:58.267
 and separate Swedish design. 

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:03.300
 This rich legacy lives on today 

00:01:03.367 --> 00:01:05.833
 and will do so in the future. 

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:09.567
 Volvo Cars would never have existed 

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:12.900
 if two friends didn't meet by chance 

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:18.200
 in a restaurant in Stockholm on an August evening in 1924. 

00:01:18.267 --> 00:01:21.167
 The two friends shared their passion for cars 

00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:23.900
 and also the vision to become a Swedish car manufacturer. 

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:27.933
 After this meeting our founders, Assar Gabrielsson 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.133
 - an economist and salesman - 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.867
 and Gustaf Larson - a talented engineer with a background in building engines - 

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:42.333
 plans to build the best and most beautiful Swedish car. 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.300
 Gabrielsson also worked for SKF, a Swedish manufacturer of ball bearings at that time, 

00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:51.400
 the Volvo brand name. 

00:01:51.467 --> 00:01:54.200
 Applicable for a manufacturer of steel ball bearings, 

00:01:54.267 --> 00:01:57.433
 means the name "I roll" in Latin. 

00:01:58.233 --> 00:02:00.867
 The original designs 

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:05.800
 saw the light in Gustaf Larson's apartment, in the center of Stockholm, mid 1925. 

00:02:05.867 --> 00:02:11.067
 The first ten prototypes were tested in 1926, 

00:02:11.133 --> 00:02:14.867
 personally funded by Assar Gabrielsson. 

00:02:14.933 --> 00:02:18.300
 On April 14, 1927 

00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:22.667
 rolled the first Volvo production car, the two-liter Ã–V4 - nicknamed 'Jakob' - 

00:02:22.733 --> 00:02:25.800
 from the factory in Hisingen, Gothenburg. 

00:02:25.867 --> 00:02:29.567
 He received the iconic Iron Mark logo. 

00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:33.433
 The company that we know today as Volvo was born. 

00:02:34.867 --> 00:02:39.367
 In 1927, three factors contributed to Volvo's spontaneous success. 

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:41.767
 There was the growing industry in Sweden. 

00:02:41.833 --> 00:02:45.067
 Top quality steel was available locally. 

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:48.167
 And there was a need for strong premium cars. 

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:53.000
 Because imported cars didn't last long on the Swedish roads that suffered in extreme weather conditions. 

00:02:53.067 --> 00:02:57.200
 Since then, the distinct Swedish culture, the respect for nature 

00:02:57.267 --> 00:03:00.667
 and the focus on social welfare at until 

00:03:00.733 --> 00:03:03.967
 the evolution of Volvo into a unique company where people are central. 

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:07.433
 This company could not have originated anywhere else in the world. 

00:03:08.067 --> 00:03:11.800
 Volvo has always preserved that unique Swedish approach to car design. 

00:03:11.867 --> 00:03:16.467
 It wants to optimally meet human needs and therefore also the desire to travel by car. 

00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:22.300
 That approach is essential and can already be found in our earliest luxury cars such as the PV444. 

00:03:22.367 --> 00:03:27.967
 This sporty family car was launched in 1944 and was Volvo's first major success. 

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:31.167
 It was also our first major breakthrough in the United States. 

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:34.567
 From the beautiful Amazon in the 50s and 60s, 

00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:37.200
 about the iconic P1800 

00:03:37.267 --> 00:03:41.700
 and the state-of-the-art XC90 today, among our concepts for the future: 

00:03:41.767 --> 00:03:46.833
 our goal was always to develop premium cars that improve our quality of life. 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.400
 Volvo has also always developed technical innovations. 

00:03:51.467 --> 00:03:55.333
 They made driving more pleasant and safer. 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.700
 Few people in this world have saved more lives than 

00:03:59.767 --> 00:04:02.500
 Volvo engineer Nils Bohlin. 

00:04:02.567 --> 00:04:05.967
 His revolutionary design for the three-point safety belt 

00:04:06.033 --> 00:04:11.767
 made his debut in the Volvo PV544 from 1959. 

00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:16.867
 Since then, this innovation has estimated to have saved more than 1 million lives. 

00:04:16.933 --> 00:04:20.600
 Volvo renounced the patent, 

00:04:20.667 --> 00:04:24.400
 so that this innovation would be available to everyone, regardless of which car they were driving. 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.933
 In 1964, Volvo tested the world's first 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.700
 prototype for a rear-facing child seat, in the PV544. 

00:04:33.767 --> 00:04:36.733
 It was the first of many innovations in the field of child safety. 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.600
 In 1976, Volvo launched the world's first height cushion. 

00:04:41.667 --> 00:04:47.067
 This invention is used all over the world today and saves countless young lives. 

00:04:47.133 --> 00:04:51.900
 Volvo's Lambda Sensor also saw the light in 1976. 

00:04:51.967 --> 00:04:58.133
 This probe reduces harmful exhaust gases by 90%. 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.300
 The California Air Resources Board called it 

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:04.067
 the most important breakthrough ever 

00:05:04.133 --> 00:05:07.500
 to limit harmful exhaust gases. 

00:05:07.567 --> 00:05:09.967
 Volvo once again shared this invention with the entire world 

00:05:10.033 --> 00:05:15.100
 and today almost every petrol car is equipped with a lambda sensor. 

00:05:16.767 --> 00:05:19.933
 Volvo's international reputation in complying with environmental standards 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.200
 and superior safety was confirmed in 1976 

00:05:23.267 --> 00:05:27.300
 when the US government used a Volvo 240 as a benchmark 

00:05:27.367 --> 00:05:29.767
 to set safety standards for all new cars. 

00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:34.800
 In 1978 he was named the cleanest car in the US. 

00:05:34.867 --> 00:05:38.367
 Since then, Volvo has always endeavored to reduce its impact on the environment 

00:05:38.433 --> 00:05:42.200
 through innovation in every part of the car's life cycle. 

00:05:42.267 --> 00:05:45.700
 This way all electricity comes to the Swedish Volvo factories 

00:05:45.767 --> 00:05:47.800
 of hydroelectric power. 

00:05:47.867 --> 00:05:52.533
 And fully in line with our vision to build the safest and most economical cars 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.933
 Geely, our Chinese owner, supports the development of 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.767
 a new generation of sustainable technologies. 

00:05:59.833 --> 00:06:04.200
 Volvo's mission is to make people's lives better and easier. 

00:06:04.267 --> 00:06:07.167
 With the goal for the year 2020: 

00:06:07.233 --> 00:06:11.367
 ensure that no one is killed or seriously injured in a new Volvo. 

00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:15.500
 We work hard to achieve this goal by making our cars smarter than ever. 

00:06:16.433 --> 00:06:21.933
 The Intellisafe technology can now detect pedestrians even in the dark, 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.533
 just like cyclists, animals and objects around the wagon. 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.100
 This way accidents are prevented before they can happen. 

00:06:29.167 --> 00:06:32.767
 And through our Drive Me program for autonomous driving, Volvo cars will 

00:06:32.833 --> 00:06:37.700
 will soon be able to take over some of the less exciting aspects of driving. 

00:06:37.767 --> 00:06:43.133
 Stop and start traffic for example. This allows drivers to enjoy life more. 

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.567
 Of course, our self-driving cars 

00:06:45.633 --> 00:06:49.533
 be safer, save fuel and emit less CO2. 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.700
 This way everyone's quality of life will increase. 

00:06:52.767 --> 00:06:55.967
 Our founders would be proud of us.
