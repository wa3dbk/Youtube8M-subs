going to put six and then I need the

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.949 
going to put six and then I need the
curly<00:03:21.260> brackets<00:03:21.709> so<00:03:22.660> that's<00:03:23.660> basically

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
curly brackets so that's basically

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.100

saying in this enters the frame if your
character<00:03:27.640> hits<00:03:28.640> this<00:03:29.209> make<00:03:30.110> the<00:03:30.290> characters

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
character hits this make the characters

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.610 
character hits this make the characters
X<00:03:31.010> minus<00:03:31.640> six<00:03:31.970> and<00:03:33.040> you<00:03:34.040> can<00:03:34.130> just<00:03:34.310> copy<00:03:34.550> this

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
X minus six and you can just copy this

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.810

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
paste it into the other one and just

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:45.220 
paste it into the other one and just
change<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:39.160> minus<00:03:40.540> to<00:03:41.540> a<00:03:41.810> plus<00:03:43.209> then<00:03:44.209> do<00:03:45.019> the

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
change the minus to a plus then do the

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.530 
change the minus to a plus then do the
same<00:03:45.440> thing<00:03:45.650> for<00:03:45.920> the<00:03:46.070> top<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:46.580> bottom<00:03:46.610> except

same thing for the top and bottom except
change<00:03:47.690> the<00:03:47.989> Y's<00:03:48.320> and<00:03:50.290> since<00:03:51.290> it's<00:03:51.440> going<00:03:51.560> to

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
change the Y's and since it's going to

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.590 
change the Y's and since it's going to
be<00:03:51.709> going<00:03:52.370> down<00:03:52.519> and<00:03:52.970> I<00:03:53.120> want<00:03:53.269> to<00:03:53.330> set<00:03:53.480> it<00:03:53.570> to

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
be going down and I want to set it to

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.410 
be going down and I want to set it to
plus<00:03:54.400> you<00:03:55.400> might<00:03:55.489> want<00:03:55.700> to<00:03:55.730> just<00:03:55.850> copy<00:03:56.060> that<00:03:56.180> so

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
plus you might want to just copy that so

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.630 
plus you might want to just copy that so
you'll<00:03:56.570> have<00:03:56.660> to<00:03:56.780> change<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.170> Y<00:03:57.320> again<00:03:57.640> paste

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
you'll have to change the Y again paste

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.070 
you'll have to change the Y again paste
it<00:03:58.880> and<00:03:59.269> change<00:03:59.630> this<00:03:59.900> plus<00:04:00.290> to<00:04:00.950> a<00:04:00.980> minus<00:04:02.080> okay

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
it and change this plus to a minus okay

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.840 
it and change this plus to a minus okay
so<00:04:03.170> now<00:04:03.350> that<00:04:03.380> we<00:04:03.830> have<00:04:04.010> that<00:04:04.220> done<00:04:04.280> we're<00:04:04.700> just

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
so now that we have that done we're just

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.430 
so now that we have that done we're just
going<00:04:04.970> to<00:04:05.030> go<00:04:05.120> ahead<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:05.420> make<00:04:05.570> our<00:04:05.720> Packman

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
going to go ahead and make our Packman

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.920 
going to go ahead and make our Packman
so<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:07.459> easiest<00:04:07.760> way<00:04:07.880> to<00:04:07.940> do<00:04:08.180> this<00:04:08.209> that<00:04:08.870> I

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
so the easiest way to do this that I

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.320 
so the easiest way to do this that I
find<00:04:09.290> is<00:04:10.010> to<00:04:10.070> select<00:04:10.459> the<00:04:11.680> primitive<00:04:12.680> oval

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:14.330 
find is to select the primitive oval

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.770 
find is to select the primitive oval
and<00:04:14.420> make<00:04:15.230> it<00:04:15.470> yellow<00:04:15.980> to<00:04:16.940> fill<00:04:17.120> and<00:04:17.390> the<00:04:17.540> show

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
and make it yellow to fill and the show

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.490 
and make it yellow to fill and the show
and<00:04:18.730> just<00:04:19.730> draw<00:04:20.209> a<00:04:21.400> circle<00:04:22.810> hold<00:04:23.810> shift<00:04:24.170> and

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
and just draw a circle hold shift and

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.080 
and just draw a circle hold shift and
draw<00:04:24.740> it's<00:04:24.890> will<00:04:25.040> be<00:04:25.130> a<00:04:25.190> perfect<00:04:25.400> circle<00:04:25.880> and

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
draw it's will be a perfect circle and

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:28.150 
draw it's will be a perfect circle and
yours<00:04:27.080> probably<00:04:27.410> won't<00:04:27.530> already<00:04:27.800> be<00:04:27.950> like

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
yours probably won't already be like

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.420 
yours probably won't already be like
this<00:04:28.280> it<00:04:28.430> will<00:04:28.490> probably<00:04:28.580> be<00:04:29.030> a<00:04:30.430> perfect

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
this it will probably be a perfect

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.970 
this it will probably be a perfect
circle<00:04:31.690> like<00:04:32.690> that<00:04:32.930> just<00:04:33.670> drag<00:04:34.670> this<00:04:34.910> little

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
circle like that just drag this little

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.470 
circle like that just drag this little
these<00:04:36.980> little<00:04:37.220> dots<00:04:37.430> down<00:04:37.610> to<00:04:37.970> make<00:04:38.120> it<00:04:38.150> an

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
these little dots down to make it an

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.100 
these little dots down to make it an
open-mouth<00:04:39.320> and<00:04:40.090> then<00:04:41.090> convert<00:04:41.630> this<00:04:41.840> to<00:04:42.080> a

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
open-mouth and then convert this to a

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.470 
open-mouth and then convert this to a
symbol<00:04:42.620> and<00:04:42.910> call<00:04:43.910> it<00:04:44.120> a<00:04:45.820> character<00:04:46.820> pac-man

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
symbol and call it a character pac-man

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.000 
symbol and call it a character pac-man
or<00:04:47.510> whatever<00:04:47.960> you<00:04:48.050> want<00:04:48.290> it<00:04:48.500> doesn't<00:04:48.860> matter

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
or whatever you want it doesn't matter

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.980 
or whatever you want it doesn't matter
but<00:04:49.280> make<00:04:49.460> sure<00:04:49.490> it's<00:04:49.760> a<00:04:49.790> movie<00:04:50.060> clip<00:04:50.210> inside

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
but make sure it's a movie clip inside

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.790 
but make sure it's a movie clip inside
this<00:04:51.080> instance<00:04:51.530> name<00:04:51.770> to<00:04:52.250> char<00:04:53.530> okay<00:04:54.530> so<00:04:54.590> now

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
this instance name to char okay so now

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.830 
this instance name to char okay so now
we're<00:04:54.950> going<00:04:55.040> to<00:04:55.100> go<00:04:55.250> into<00:04:55.970> our<00:04:56.210> movie<00:04:56.540> clip

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
we're going to go into our movie clip

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.970 
we're going to go into our movie clip
and<00:04:57.050> make<00:04:57.860> four<00:04:58.220> frames<00:04:58.960> and<00:04:59.960> on<00:05:00.620> the<00:05:00.740> first

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
and make four frames and on the first

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.320 
and make four frames and on the first
frame<00:05:01.190> you're<00:05:01.550> going<00:05:01.580> to<00:05:01.730> want<00:05:01.880> to<00:05:01.910> convert<00:05:02.210> it

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
frame you're going to want to convert it

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.170 
frame you're going to want to convert it
to<00:05:02.390> another<00:05:02.600> symbol<00:05:03.230> and<00:05:03.980> call<00:05:04.250> it<00:05:04.400> right<00:05:04.700> and
