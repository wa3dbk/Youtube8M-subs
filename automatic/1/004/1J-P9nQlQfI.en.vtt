he<00:02:14.560> will<00:02:14.709> win<00:02:14.860> regardless<00:02:15.099> um<00:02:15.760> now<00:02:16.720> with<00:02:17.080> the

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
he will win regardless um now with the

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.170 
he will win regardless um now with the
Spurs<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:19.090> Warriors<00:02:19.800> now<00:02:20.800> I<00:02:21.250> had<00:02:21.970> the

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
Spurs and the Warriors now I had the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:23.940 
Spurs and the Warriors now I had the
spur<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.599> still<00:02:22.840> got<00:02:23.019> the<00:02:23.140> Spurs<00:02:23.379> winning<00:02:23.860> the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
spur I still got the Spurs winning the

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.850 
spur I still got the Spurs winning the
series<00:02:24.450> but<00:02:25.450> i<00:02:25.720> think<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.410> Warriors<00:02:26.830> will

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
series but i think the Warriors will

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.040 
series but i think the Warriors will
give<00:02:27.250> them<00:02:27.459> a<00:02:27.489> run<00:02:27.849> for<00:02:27.880> their<00:02:28.120> money<00:02:28.239> just

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
give them a run for their money just

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.520 
give them a run for their money just
because<00:02:30.120> Stephan<00:02:31.120> curry<00:02:31.300> if<00:02:31.840> Stephan<00:02:32.349> curry

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
because Stephan curry if Stephan curry

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.949 
because Stephan curry if Stephan curry
is<00:02:32.769> still<00:02:33.069> hot<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.670> he<00:02:33.910> still<00:02:34.180> shoot<00:02:34.690> lights

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
is still hot and he still shoot lights

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.170 
is still hot and he still shoot lights
out<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.830> will<00:02:35.980> be<00:02:36.069> a<00:02:36.099> problem<00:02:36.400> for<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.819> Spurs

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
out it will be a problem for the Spurs

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.080 
out it will be a problem for the Spurs
but<00:02:37.569> the<00:02:37.690> Spurs<00:02:37.930> can<00:02:38.230> stick<00:02:38.530> defense<00:02:39.160> and<00:02:39.519> one

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
but the Spurs can stick defense and one

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.509 
but the Spurs can stick defense and one
thing<00:02:40.269> they<00:02:40.390> must<00:02:40.690> do<00:02:40.959> to<00:02:41.739> at<00:02:41.950> least<00:02:42.099> stop

the Spurs still when I was four when

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.870

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
they may be six games I thought I'm uh

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.789 
they may be six games I thought I'm uh
the<00:03:25.540> surgical<00:03:25.840> enter<00:03:26.049> six<00:03:26.260> games<00:03:26.440> that's

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
the surgical enter six games that's

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.120 
the surgical enter six games that's
that's<00:03:27.040> what<00:03:27.160> I<00:03:27.190> got<00:03:27.400> I<00:03:27.639> got<00:03:27.880> anything<00:03:28.299> six<00:03:29.130> now

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
that's what I got I got anything six now

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.059 
that's what I got I got anything six now
who's<00:03:30.549> the<00:03:30.700> other<00:03:30.760> team<00:03:31.090> Memphis<00:03:31.630> and<00:03:32.069> the

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
who's the other team Memphis and the

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.030 
who's the other team Memphis and the
Thunder<00:03:33.549> I<00:03:33.850> still<00:03:34.780> think<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.620> Thunder<00:03:36.010> are

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
Thunder I still think the Thunder are

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.699 
Thunder I still think the Thunder are
good<00:03:36.400> without<00:03:36.670> Westbrook<00:03:36.970> but<00:03:37.810> they<00:03:38.019> need<00:03:38.380> him

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
good without Westbrook but they need him

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.680 
good without Westbrook but they need him
so<00:03:39.340> that's<00:03:39.549> why<00:03:39.730> I'm<00:03:39.819> still<00:03:40.120> I'm<00:03:40.420> going<00:03:40.600> with

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
so that's why I'm still I'm going with

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.569 
so that's why I'm still I'm going with
Memphis<00:03:41.470> even<00:03:41.769> though<00:03:41.829> they<00:03:41.950> lost<00:03:41.980> the<00:03:42.400> game

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:42.579 
Memphis even though they lost the game

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.059 
Memphis even though they lost the game
to<00:03:43.299> me<00:03:43.480> Memphis<00:03:43.750> gave<00:03:44.200> away<00:03:44.440> that<00:03:44.470> game<00:03:44.829> ever
