00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.929
 created for Office 2010 Blog de 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.300
 Let's get the elements first 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.220
 to look at that we used 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.050
 The box 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.679
 End of two rectangles a rectangle for the 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.679
 left area and a rectangle for the front area 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.710
 our products are so big we have inserted as a graphic 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.840
 and positioned 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.260
 The pils of our product was called Cisco in shorts with new holes 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.350

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.930

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.740

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.940
 the highlight at the top of the product portfolio also with the 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.020
 Created function Edit shapes 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.730
 the shadow of the box was drawn as dragee the night before 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.050
 after drawing all the graphic elements 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.220
 we can now position these 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.980
 the two Lobos at the bottom of the picture Dr right corner 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.970
 the products starting education within the front 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.409
 the banderole we place projects samples 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.310
 and above that the highlight 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.180
 now we can get the 3 the TUI boys 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.180
 when will be 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.920
 To do this, they must seriously group the individual elements together 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.109
 we start with the left representation have groupings gorgeous and logo 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.070
 Weyland to format graphics 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.680

 turn around the eads stock by 50 degrees and whom a perspective of 100 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.659
 Content of the writing 3d-formate we choose as Matthei years 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:19.749
 were and Matt 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:21.329
 as well as the lighting 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:24.329
 cold cool 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:29.829
 Now let's go out the springboard of the foundation pillars 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.439
 also arrange groups here 

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:38.049
 Click with the right mouse button to format the graphic 

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:40.319

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.209
 Movement around the Gags axis Ben 320 Graz 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.949
 the 45 degree perspective persists 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:55.900
 3d format material 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.309
 material 

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:01.519
 warm MAZ and lighting cold cool 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.159
 now we do not have to merge these two elements 

00:03:08.119 --> 00:03:11.609
 we can do that again full throttle to the left 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.619
 and for the last steps we take the control buttons and filings boom 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:19.809
 adjust cowardly and be able to move finely 

00:03:21.679 --> 00:03:24.609
 both elements are successful 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.609
 and benefit from it 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:30.930
 the copied box 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.930
 we can now add the mirror effect 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.199
 Formally fechtel reflections 

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:41.439
 and we also get a close reflection with touch here 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:48.089
 and finally, the self-drawn shadow is added 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.589
 We simply position this on the box 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.759
 Again, Carsten control accident about a fine positioning 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:01.259
 perform 

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:04.229
 connect the whole thing together 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:07.179
 Orhan arrange groupings 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:10.579
