00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 to ask you something to start with 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.359
 that can be spicy bothered the 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.220
 statements of the Galician tolo after 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.750
 of the party with respect to the manito a 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.800
 San Lorenzo as interpreted 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.250
 you have spoken to the 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.250
 respect 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.080
 no no no no no no no we have spoken with 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.960
 the kids are outside of what 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.539
 can you say everything I a person what 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.090
 respect for what so for what 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.880
 means in the Argentine game but 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.489
 well we be quiet to think about 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.699
 us and try to make a good 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.650
 match and leave the three points at home 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.120
 because he is the date the championship 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.829
 previous when they played in avellaneda 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.690
 against independent 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.140
 Shannon that was in a situation 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.760
 really to the limit and now it 's 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.140
 independent the one that needs much more 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.660
 the points although it only holds 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.329
 always the need for points like 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.070
 they take this match that is coming for the 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.390
 Weekend considering 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.840
 independent plays with belgrano this 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.840
 Wednesday 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.120
 If we have to look at doors 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.620
 inside for us that I tell you 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.260
 because I saw it well last semester it was 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.960
 a very ugly situation very complicated and 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.420
 well today we are not telling you that we are 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.870
 saved because this is going to be a fight 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.880
 constant until the last date but 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.310
 we also look at the others 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.229
 rivals are we are realistic that what 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.690
 they are asking down with us 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.540
 it's very interesting but we only have 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.960
 to follow the same July path as 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.670
 change to show this face 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.800
 taking into account also of course 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.229
 in the results one understands 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.580
 quickly that was is the law of 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.320
 result but that changed so that 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.680
 you show this face in the field 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.680
 of game 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.530
 yes yes we know that here today they send 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.360
 the results but well we know that 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.830
 when the result is also achieved 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.040
 it works much quieter and the 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:05.060
 Trust is another but I think what 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:07.850
 that more emphasis makes peeing and is the 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.990
 delivery try to leave everything in the 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:14.680
 court can leave you a good match 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:18.460
 bad but try to always leave everything 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:21.370
 on the court also be very very 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.020
 deep to be deeply handle the 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.910
 ball I think that we are what 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.900
 we are doing well and well I think 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.470
 which is a time also against 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.770
 against 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.570
 now against Argentine juniors second 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.760
 time as we were playing but good 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.370
 how important we fight until the 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.450
 last we can get a result 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.820
 important we tell you we are 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.110
 observing just a moment ago 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.640
 had a great goal to 98 nice definition 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.130
 you mentioned the name of pits and how 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.860
 is the relationship with the technician taking 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.020
 account of that situation that he by 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.610
 moments I wanted you as lateral you 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.860
 you feel more comfortable playing in another 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.130
 position or we will accept what you 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.130
 pillan 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.870
 the relationship was always good out there 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.209
 here the whole double was powered 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.480
 quiet week and just came out that and 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:18.889
 I think they exaggerate or mother what was 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.659
 but it is all well knows and we all know 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.040
 that my usual steering wheel position 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:25.579
 by right where I can most 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.300
 the team held nothing but another 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:29.820
 world nothing of what 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.610
 to generate a controversy because because not 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.530
 it's not like that but if we do not have to play 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.260
 of 4 I have to 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.340
 be for the positive team to save 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.709
 in your welcome be 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.170
 okay well say good it's not about 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.640
 generate a controversy but pablo just 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.890
 I told you in the kingdom of 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.680
 results all seem cuter all 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.720
 they are tall elegant blondes but let's see 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.069
 there is a technical body that took a 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.470
 determined time an amount of 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.450
 matches working that is top scorer with 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.830
 a European profile there was a body 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.599
 technical with which to achieve the objective 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.700
 to stay in first with ricardo 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.860
 caruso lombardi from the point of view 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.840
 football and the experience of 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.360
 you as players and why not 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.489
 also of the planning of the week 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.750
 what difference you can have between a 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.750
 coaching staff and the other 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.479
 I do not like to make many comparisons 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:26.479
 but good every technical body has its 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:30.379
 work method his way of thinking his 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:32.750
 way of expressing thanks to god of a 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:35.599
 trial we grabbed lydia fast that's 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.090
 very important we did not have time not 

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:40.580
 we had no margin for error we could 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.550
 add the points that we proposed that 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.870
 it was 25 every one of us that we could 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.210
 get what I think is very 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.270
 important but good as I told you 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.219
 just each one has its way of 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:54.949
 work each one has its way of 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:56.300
 express yourself but good now that you are 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:58.479
 is a pizzi 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.460
 thank god we get results 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:03.319
 we are on the right track seeing the good 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.389
 football path but Pablo also 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.800
 we have reflected it in different 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:09.379
 editions of sport center to whom 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.389
 they ask for this illusion that the fan of san 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:12.770
 lorenzo has on par with the good 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:15.199
 results that is going back home 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:17.030
 go back to flight to the old gasometer 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:20.000
 of so much history that 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.670
 you have an idea of ​​something you remember something or 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.710
 someone told you some story 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:27.940
 around the old gasometer with this 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.940
 new instance that opens 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.160
 if in a little while I'm in the 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.229
 club has been much talked about the issue of 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:39.250
 back to boedo and well I think that the 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:40.690
 fans and also players us 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.580

 the courts the same fans many 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:47.620

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:50.349
 is very well and deservedly has it 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.660
 go back to the place where where it really is 

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:56.620
 deserves the club deserves so good 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:59.729
 very happy there is not much in the 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:03.300
 theme that leaves the subject of boedo why 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:05.259
 but something told me my family and I have 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.639
 my relatives who are fans to 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:08.650
 Lawrence and they told me a bit about 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:11.280
 History people but very happy too 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:13.210
 because like they told you 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.610
 Particularly there you can share 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:19.180
 with us 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:22.210
 no not nothing something more or less that is 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.800
 special for that they have done many have 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:27.219

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.840

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:31.500
 very special that's why it makes me very 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.500
