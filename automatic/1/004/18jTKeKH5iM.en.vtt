00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.550
 people I'm dying to pay 9 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.240
 video channel today for a kind review too 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.310
 rock it computer bought back then agca like 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.550
 has broken through several 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.960
 Shots and so a crane has almost none 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.050
 So no one can survive for a long time 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.930
 criticism of assad rocket computer that is 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.420
 a rocket made logical and is so 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.880
 simple variant of roccat kone cd that 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.329
 is the latest big model for almost 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.890
 90 euro has a curl bankrupt so that 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.590
 lighter so that has less 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.890
 knickknack and is nine to ten 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:51.250
 percent smaller and the use thereof 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.600
 costs about 60 euros or can 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.920
 a little more 60 to 70 euros 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.080
 about 8200 db can reach me 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.750
 But really care since I only concrete 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.320
 There are hardly any players at the age of eight 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.900
 1200 dpi plays higher dp is not 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.229
 absolutely good but let me know that 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.869
 86 grams are difficult to set in 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.350
 my szabo was 91 grams ago 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.990
 heavy 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.960
 that is getting habituation easier 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.450
 to exclude even five grams are in 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.789
 the first days totally unfamiliar and the 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.530
 rocket company has no customizable 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.829
 weights so I have to 680 grams 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.469
 opponents pay coniks cd I can stop 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.999
 do not change it but still 690 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:35.770
 gram is actually a good one 

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:37.630
 startgewicht I personally find something 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.780
 you just get used to it 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.639
 because the mouse is 7 inches wide and twelve 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.859
 centimeters long and that is 

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:46.659
 comparatively small for a mouse so 

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:48.639
 my szabo was not only small 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.149
 so it was a bit bigger 

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:51.670
 small 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.649
 So it's not a really big mouse 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.869
 for example, a relative for people 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:58.149
 Great handle for that could be it 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.859
 actually be annoying but I have the 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.029
 hand, yes, not quite on it 

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:02.469
 very dependent on the mouse 

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:04.209
 to grab one says one has the mouse 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:05.619
 the finger and bit are pointed 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.619
 the mouse picks up and then it works 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.300
 because the whole hand on the mouse on it 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.440
 So do not pretend it's one 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.780
 others do that a bit 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.720
 more complicated I was able to work well 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.540
 in the normal sized apps smaller mouse 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.040
 but everyone has their own thing there 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.920
 maybe it would have to be about the size 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.020
 try somewhere in the mediamarkt 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.150
 There is still the easy shift function 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.560
 So you can duplicate the buttons 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.450
 Rocket is a bit of a part of that 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.300
 known for their mice is one 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.710
 button one presses on the mouse and 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.870
 noble stop the shift button on the 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.040
 keyboard there you have the most buttons 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.660
 be capitalized 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.520
 But there, for example, the button presses 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.400
 can just stop all other key 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.080
 I can prove the mouse again 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.080
 so with aris other I could go there for 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.510
 for example, carlos even letters state 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.610
 can not for play out similar 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.580
 activate ingame functions for 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:59.590
 example is starcraft 2 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.780
 Insert units for those seeking education 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.060
 that you can touch the keys 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:08.920
 Double up and the mouse still has 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:11.920
 a polling rate of 1000 heart the mouse 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.770
 has except down over so a rubber 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.090
 Plating are soft touch plating is 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.350
 Of course always nice to touch it 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.360
 a little bit more noble to better 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.709
 is processed but the first time so 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.350
 I'm a bit unfamiliar with two games 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.690
 previously only 100 above left far right 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.860
 the normal plastic and that is one 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.930
 little bit strange now everything 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.610
 but a little slipperier is after 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.440
 some time you have it 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:34.120
 Of course, but accustomed to the first 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.860
 let's play the first few mouses 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.030
 Days are a bit strange though 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.300
 at some point it actually works 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.769
 then she has seven mouse buttons left 2 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.450
 of course the normal right-left 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:45.370
 mouse button on the mouse wheel and two more 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.500
 buttons with which one pays the db directly 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.790
 and can switch 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.380
 all buttons are accessible too 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.970
 the buttons left and right are now 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.590
 not too far away, the star was like 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:55.720
 example, the back was behind the left 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.180
 key to reach risk here 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.980
 but quite well under in two 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.480
 mausrad that means normal measure in 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.610
 which can move forward to the rear 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.560
 It 's actually pretty good too 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.260
 use because it is so light rubber first 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.519
 sugared and slightly harder to turn 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.780
 he is actually quite good 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.250
 that you can not just over the mouse 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.600
 about to slide ten times at a time 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.370
 then just got such a two 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.140
 sometimes a little more power is needed 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.330
 stuck is actually 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.370
 quite well 

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.540
 rocket co expedia eg and 3d mouse wheel 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.789
 then you can do it left and right 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.660
 always push extra is over 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:29.930
 not possible here because 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:31.130
 it I do not need the emotional 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:31.910
 a processing that is yes I have 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.440
 to grasp quickly 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.020
 the back right is still such a small one 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.180
 rocket logo what you also color 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.040
 can change not so important for 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.980
 eye very nice but I need 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.660
 actually to look at and it has one 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.130
 textile sheathed cable that's 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.970
 it should also be slower 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.760
 become standard 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.500
 that does not break the cable immediately 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.510
 but can not stand what 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:55.640
 poly is for example but that 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.350
 Apply the cable a bit 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.260
 luckily, but luckily not yet 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.150
 but yes it could be 17 erich from 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.520
 now actually went very well with 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:06.620
 the mouse then has each rocket mouse 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.880
 or his own drivers but there are 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.620
 only on the internet so you can mean 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.660
 get a cd and you have to do it 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.690
 download and the driver is 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.400
 actually quite in detail you can 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:18.200
 also adjust the sensitivity manually 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.970
 and i have been telling for on the mouse 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.710
 yes synonymous by clicking the db change came there 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.450
 can be the five small professional solutions 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.220
 for setting to five small setting 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.320
 as the dpi by the mouse click itself 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.060
 Generally you can change several 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.580
 Set profile what one says one 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.600
 profile is with 163 ps all with 800 that 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:34.430
 so in between and 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.200
 I know the ones you know 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.790
 keys freely on the mouse and 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.170
 extra features and easy 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.390
 Shift function always extra buttons 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.150
 can prove a sound feedback 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:46.160
 I also have to deactivate it 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.740
 for example from the polin great can 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.140
 For example, you can adjust yourself and the 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.150
 color choice of the logo at the end of the mouse goes 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.150
 of course, too, and the mouse 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.790
 Brocken so small orders where you have 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:06:01.280
 for example what creeps our rummage 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:02.660
 and none of an animal awards 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.400
 Schnickschnack like not on it 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.860
 Concentrated who likes it 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.020
 something of course have liked to use to 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.650
 end the roccat kone pur is just 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.480
 a smaller mouse has something lighter 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.669
 not quite many features like the xc 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:18.410
 de but has the function you 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.150
 actually she needs to have it 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.350
 actually quite good workmanship lies 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:23.840
 actually also a small one 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.900
 getting used very good hand and me 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:28.430
 Do you like it now so who zb xt 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.750
 wanted to have and then he notices 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.460
 does not need the knickknacks and 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.400
 I would like to save 30 euros 

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.870
 can buy the roccat kone beer but 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.430
 had to really cost already 60 to 70 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.169
 euro and that is quite a mouse for a mouse 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.160
 nice price so who says he still has 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:42.200
 never so before the mega 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.880
 from had should after a 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:46.430
 another scene of a pure roccat kone 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:49.160
 because 60 70 euro is just a lot of money and 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:50.480
 get for less money from ever 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.070
 which is just as well who now though 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:54.530
 difficult but already wobbles for mice 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.420
 he is happy to grasp 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.320
 but also with logitech or racer or 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.520
 somehow different products 

00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:00.440
 maybe something also priced 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.620
 lower or a cheaper one 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.790
 Rocket mouse back here as you can 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.370
 you also for that too 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.810
 quite satisfied and would have 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.730
 Do not pay unnecessarily much money 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.500
 oh well I hope you liked it 

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:14.830
 looks at the next video skin purely 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.830
 People
