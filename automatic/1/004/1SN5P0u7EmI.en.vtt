for<00:00:00.329> me<00:00:00.539> and<00:00:00.810> basically<00:00:01.490> photojournalism<00:00:02.490> is

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:03.170 
for me and basically photojournalism is

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.650 
for me and basically photojournalism is
documenting<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:04.440> piece<00:00:05.040> of<00:00:05.069> time<00:00:05.759> and<00:00:06.120> catching

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
documenting a piece of time and catching

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.570 
documenting a piece of time and catching
a<00:00:06.720> moment<00:00:07.020> in<00:00:07.109> history<00:00:07.319> and<00:00:07.770> there's<00:00:08.400> nothing

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
a moment in history and there's nothing

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.890 
a moment in history and there's nothing
more<00:00:08.820> satisfying<00:00:09.179> than<00:00:09.750> giving<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.920> voice<00:00:11.280> and

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
more satisfying than giving a voice and

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.660 
more satisfying than giving a voice and
giving<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:12.960> story<00:00:13.259> to<00:00:13.500> something<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.370> it's

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
giving a story to something so it's

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.720 
giving a story to something so it's
basically<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.750> most<00:00:16.170> satisfying<00:00:16.680> job<00:00:16.830> that<00:00:17.699> I

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
basically the most satisfying job that I

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.599 
basically the most satisfying job that I
could<00:00:17.910> ever<00:00:18.000> think<00:00:18.270> about<00:00:19.189> there<00:00:20.189> are<00:00:20.340> times

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
could ever think about there are times

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.810 
could ever think about there are times
out<00:00:21.240> there<00:00:21.779> when<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.769> foreign<00:00:23.130> assignment<00:00:23.699> I

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
out there when the foreign assignment I

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.939 
out there when the foreign assignment I
get<00:00:24.090> nervous<00:00:24.269> but<00:00:24.900> when<00:00:25.109> I'm<00:00:25.260> at<00:00:25.650> an

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
get nervous but when I'm at an

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.790 
get nervous but when I'm at an
assignment<00:00:26.490> all<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.789> can<00:00:27.090> think<00:00:27.119> about<00:00:27.300> is

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
assignment all I can think about is

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.370 
assignment all I can think about is
documenting<00:00:28.800> everything<00:00:29.490> around<00:00:29.939> me<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.990> you

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
documenting everything around me so you

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.049 
documenting everything around me so you
have<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.679> just<00:00:31.830> basically<00:00:32.040> tune<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.759> part

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
have to just basically tune that part

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.380 
have to just basically tune that part
out<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.230> hard<00:00:34.500> but<00:00:34.860> once<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:35.969> are<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.360> it

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
out it is hard but once you are in it

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.660 
out it is hard but once you are in it
then<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.200> have<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.530> involved<00:00:37.890> in<00:00:38.550> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
situation and you become a part of the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.090 
situation and you become a part of the
story<00:00:41.070> itself<00:00:41.660> well<00:00:42.739> when<00:00:43.739> you're<00:00:43.860> out<00:00:44.070> there
