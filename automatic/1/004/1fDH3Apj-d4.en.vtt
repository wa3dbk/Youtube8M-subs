00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello youtube friends we are truck and os 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.580
 we come to present a tutorial about 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.639
 of how to see the screen of our 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.780
 Android device in our pc without 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.780
 need root 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.930
 Thus 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.500
 and the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:23.200
 download this droid explorer program 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.180
 of the link that in this link 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.880
 this link sorry that you will have in the 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.309
 description and the other downloaded it a 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.899
 zip file nas very small so we 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:36.969
 takes a lot we're going to go to downloads for 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.899
 unzip it we are going to decompress it 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.899
 it is a file 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:48.100
 and well unzip it and I opened the 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.650
 for the folder that brings good in my 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.020
 case is 64 you also have it for 32 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.970
 I forgot to say that 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:58.410
 and good to download is to open 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:02.450
 and open the application 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:06.020
 you say yes and well we are giving next 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:09.020
 I accept we accept the terms we hope 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.650
 to install everything we accept again 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.540
 the terms 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.290
 all next 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:20.130
 install and now good is going to take a 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.579
 little so well I'll go fast 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.610
 but well not much should not be delayed 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:28.820
 much more than 23 minutes so good 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.820
 until now 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.820
 well when it's over, we're going to give 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.909
 finish 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.400
 and another bar will be loaded again and here 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:46.330
 very important this step you should give 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.630
 to your android sdk for me you should give to 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.520
 that 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.570
 you give it and as you can see it appears two bars 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:58.060
 of progress to download the 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.240
 additional sources and such this also 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:04.210
 Well, it's going to take a little while, but good 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.070
 I 'm telling you , no installation is not 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.750
 takes a long time simply because when 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.430
 you have to download several things and such 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:14.950
 but it's not too long 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:20.129
 and well I'm going to cut the video again 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.129
 so it's not too heavy until now 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.730
 well then once completed it does not 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.900
 let's give the launch we're still going to 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.230
 give it to finish 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.690
 let's close this 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.930
 and now it's time to connect 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.670
 your android device but 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.610
 you must 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.489
 to connect it always having the mode 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.520
 debug usb activated if you do not know 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.750
 how is it in the description will you have a 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.930
 link to a video for how to activate it in 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.520
 both in Android 4.2 and later as 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.830
 as previous versions 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.690
 previous good because the autonomous 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:02.350
 activated on my phone we are going to plug 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.350
 what to the computer 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.570
 as you can see there goes out 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.390
 you are going to do the rest and now yes now 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.390
 let's open droid explorer 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.710
 we already have let's give it 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.880
 as you see good this would be the 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.190
 the serial number of my terminal if not 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.630
 none come out, you wait in case 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.840
 you do not have the drivers installed 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.790
 you wait for it to be recognized by you 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.580
 computer and then you can open the 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:41.100
 program to see the screen 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.440
 you should give this button is the 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.550
 little symbol of giving and putting screencast 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.550
 we give him 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.130
 and it would have to open java 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.800
 and install this application 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.870
 we could open the application if you 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.670
 this error or a similar error of 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:03.610
 that you can not install applications 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:08.230
 auto signed something like this you should do 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:10.120
 this is going to start control panel 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.970
 let's give it here to see it better in 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.870
 category and with the small 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.870
 let's go where they put java 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.920
 at the top where he puts 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.910
 security 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.940
 and we lower this where it puts average 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.580
 we accept 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.000
 Come back and try again 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.000
 screencast 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.300
 and as you see right now if they accepted the 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.780
 terms and such but let's let's go to 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.780
 run 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.700
 right now the screen should appear 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:50.480
 there it is not going very fluid maybe it's 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.740
 because my internet is unfortunate 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.080
 pretty shabby but good either 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.810
 is that this serves a lot to do 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.940
 many tutorials and such but good 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.020
 it's always good to have support and 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.240
 good if now you want for example 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:07.620
 record the screen as you take a 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.910
 program that records that record cut 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.650
 this and it is already 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.320
 giving it here to record but I do not know how 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.360
 works very well that that record one 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.189
 you will ask 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.590
 the directory where you want them to go 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:21.690
 It is also quite simple 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.540
 and well then this has been the 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.620
 tutorial today how to see the screen of 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:30.320
 our android device in a 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.880
 in a PC without the need for root is what 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.080
 be clear enough without needing 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.819
 root 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.379
 and well so far the tutorial 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:38.900
