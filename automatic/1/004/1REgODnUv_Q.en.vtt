00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.969
 some time ago I recorded this recipe for 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.980
 antenna3 and there are many of you who have 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.779
 asked about her because she did not 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.029
 find yourself good it is because I do not 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.369
 I have on my web then I have decided 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.050
 record the of these recipes so fast 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.029
 from lists to blog so that you have it 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.699
 there because it really is a very 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.669
 good for a quick dinner a meal 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.340
 we just need some chicken breasts 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.559
 which can be either whole or in 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.720
 fillets like you want some slices of 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.080
 york ham a few slices of salt cheese 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:45.900
 and black pepper we are going to take a piece 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:49.460
 of film paper 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.460
 a generous piece 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.870
 and place chicken breasts on top 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.360
 in this case as I am using 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.910
 steaks I'm going to place two of these 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.550
 forms and overlays to get a 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.260
 pretty wide surface if you use 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.150
 a whole breast simply with a 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.030
 knife you cut it in half and the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.820
 you open like a book it's worth salpimentamos 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.619
 a little bit of salt and 8 little bit because 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.380
 in addition the york ham and the cheese already 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.710
 they have salt a little bit of pepper 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.229
 while we place on top a slice of 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.790
 folded york ham and a slice of 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.780
 cheese that we can also catch and 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.240
 split it even more so that it does not 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.340
 come out and now we're just going to 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.880
 roll with the help of the film 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.380
 we do so we help each other so that 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.380
 well inside all the filling 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.420
 with the little fingers we put it like this for 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.420
 in 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.640
 and we got to see a little roll 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.110
 we roll up tight 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.380
 catch them from the ends and they make you 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.539
 roll by the table 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.579
 and that's the way it looks like a candy 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.189
 and now what we are going to do is put it 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:16.829
 Microwave for 4 or 5 minutes at 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:18.750
 maximum power if you do not have a microwave 

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:21.750
 you can do the same by cooking it in 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.060
 water in a pot you put water you put the 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.879
 roll and when it starts to boil 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.799
 you leave the 45 minutes also good 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:32.069
 once they have come out of the microwave 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:34.610
 We cut a little film paper and the 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.560
 let's unwrap 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.690
 We left them for a little while 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.140
 temper not to burn us are still 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.940
 hot but already about 10 minutes 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.530
 that came out of the microwave and 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.530
 simply because we cut them into slices 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.129
 of course you can make other fillings 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:55.340
 not only can they be ham and 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:58.489
 You can see how you can fill them 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.749
 well with plums with mushrooms with what 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.269
 you want you can do a thousand things 

00:02:59.749 --> 00:03:04.010
 different from the film you use 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.980
 it has to be a film paper that can go 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.010
 to the microwave 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.900
 They usually put in the container most 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.180
 they can go to the microwave but there are out there 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.030
 one that can not be good, because there you see 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.010
 how is it 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.080
 and already we have just that 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.360
 present it good because we already have 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.190
 our plate of stuffed breasts 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.990
 microwave as you see has been super easy 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.310
 As I say, you can use another 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.959
 different stuffing if you do not have 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.130
 microwave you can know them with a 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.270
 little bit of water 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.489
 Well, these other recipes 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.989
 simple I hope you like that the 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.800
 try and see you in the next 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.800
