an<00:04:39.460> issue<00:04:39.610> in<00:04:39.820> a<00:04:39.880> car<00:04:40.120> like<00:04:40.270> this<00:04:40.510> if<00:04:40.900> someone's

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
an issue in a car like this if someone's

giving you a speeding ticket but I think

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:46.650 
giving you a speeding ticket but I think
ultimately<00:04:45.160> the<00:04:45.550> best<00:04:45.820> and<00:04:46.030> worst<00:04:46.270> part<00:04:46.630> about

that's<00:04:54.130> the<00:04:54.340> best<00:04:54.610> part<00:04:54.849> about<00:04:55.060> the<00:04:55.210> car

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
that's the best part about the car

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.120 
that's the best part about the car
because<00:04:55.750> well<00:04:56.110> that's<00:04:56.289> awesome<00:04:56.770> but<00:04:56.889> it's<00:04:57.010> the

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
because well that's awesome but it's the

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.950 
because well that's awesome but it's the
worst<00:04:57.340> part<00:04:57.639> about<00:04:57.760> it<00:04:57.910> because<00:04:58.599> if<00:04:58.750> there's<00:04:58.900> a

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
worst part about it because if there's a

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.719 
worst part about it because if there's a
hundred<00:04:59.260> and<00:04:59.349> twenty<00:04:59.680> kilometers<00:05:00.250> an<00:05:00.370> hour<00:05:00.460> in
