00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:17.630
 Cameron how are you welcome to a 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:19.220
 new video and this video is something 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.609
 special because we have a gameplay of 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.259
 maicao creation 0.9 point 0 finally I know 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.420
 after it was supposed to be 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:27.740
 uploaded to the other day of the last xxi but 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:30.140
 it was not like that I think because the light went out 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.609
 where worked does not do something like that but 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.290
 it matters because we already have it here and 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.420
 let's do a light review 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.590
 it is so extensive but more prominent and in 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.570
 the description I leave the gameplay 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.010
 complete so they'll see that it was not 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.930
 a lot what they showed but it's worth it 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.790
 first they started the video with the menu 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.080
 main where some bugs spoke 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.280
 that they still had to fix like 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.410
 blocks that the rest of the 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.510
 world do not charge the infinite worlds in 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.490
 I looked for it had to be fixed 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.320
 when the final version comes out they started 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.300
 to start in a survival world says that 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.100
 where the thing gets a little strange 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.410
 because the loading screen took more than 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.240
 what he expected took two minutes with 40 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.070
 seconds to start playing after 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.020
 that initiates generates the world and this is 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.140
 something weird because we do not know if he is a sorcerer 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.400
 or that if they will delay in creating worlds 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.540
 also another strange thing is that the bar 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.370
 load did not fill completely 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.960
 when the gameplay began 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.820
 but remember, it's a beta like that 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.530
 that there is not much to worry about but 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.030
 good they started to play and the place in 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.680
 where aaron exposes was the biome of the 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.540
 taiga to a cool shade with the color of 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.340
 grass and thorns nearby is what 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.260
 appreciates first the change in 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.610
 grass color and tall grass of one 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.040
 that another tree deformed to what 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.840
 we used to then found a 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.220
 cave they thought it was a don jon 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.690
 for the blocks that were there but 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.640
 these blocks are no more than blocks 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.050
 of granite arrive remember the photo that 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.479
 he sent us johan with the new blocks 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.740
 well it will be one of those picked up a little 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.420
 of wood and then opened the 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.610
 inventory and tried a new inventory 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.590
 but not as innovative as we expected 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.869
 but in reality that inventory will not be 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.280
 as in 1.0 according to tomÃ¡s but what 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.259
 first thing we notice is that it has a 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.820
 style like the creative mode that you 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.380
 groups the objects according to the type of 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.119
 object that they are in this cluster 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.190
 they have a change in the postmen they follow 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.690
 being the same way they get talking 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.280
 of some characteristics and then 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.560
 they found a field of flowers 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.030
 calls in English pawn and I do not know how it 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.770
 call in Spanish or maybe it does not exist in 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.840
 reality makes a search a cave 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.209
 it is where the supporters jacks 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.870
 build and found iron and with a little 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.459
 stone for 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.500
 to take out the iron but when I remove the 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.690
 stone the rest of the world below that 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.580
 stone you could see it was like x-rays a 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.769
 little crazy but you could see the caves 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.750
 but obviously this will fix the 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:30.129
 Thomas' words were or did not look 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.129
 the books do not look at the books xd 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.040
 and then really, that was all 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.170
 gameplay only lasted eight minutes without 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.790
 count the two minutes of charging and nothing 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.830
 more than highlighting I do not know is something 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.660
 disappointing but maybe they want us 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.490
 leave with the craving of what is most 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.960
 to come to power play 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.830
 new version for the first time we are 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.630
 so so excited 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.820
 well, nothing would be all on my part 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.670
 remember like mark it as favorites 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.980
 subscribe that we are almost 4 thousand 600 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.140
 friends of the channel and then nothing system and 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.600
 The Garcia Speck we have an excellent day 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:09.070
 and see you in an obvious see you later 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.070
