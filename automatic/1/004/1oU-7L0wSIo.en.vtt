00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.680 
but if he did that that would be my
guess<00:02:33.320> that<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.160> chrome<00:02:34.370> didn't<00:02:34.700> really<00:02:34.910> wear

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
guess that the chrome didn't really wear

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.690 
guess that the chrome didn't really wear
off<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:36.260> rims<00:02:36.470> all<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:36.830> much<00:02:37.010> but<00:02:37.280> um<00:02:37.489> I
