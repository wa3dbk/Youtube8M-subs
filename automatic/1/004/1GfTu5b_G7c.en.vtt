so<00:00:00.949> what<00:00:01.949> do<00:00:02.040> you<00:00:02.100> think<00:00:02.280> about<00:00:02.370> where

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
so what do you think about where

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.420 
so what do you think about where
biomedical<00:00:03.720> research<00:00:04.020> is<00:00:04.200> now<00:00:04.440> what<00:00:05.370> would

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
biomedical research is now what would

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.519 
biomedical research is now what would
you<00:00:05.520> like<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.819> see<00:00:05.970> and<00:00:06.120> go<00:00:06.270> it's<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.290> lot<00:00:07.500> of

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
you like to see and go it's a lot of

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.879 
you like to see and go it's a lot of
money<00:00:07.680> there's<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.099> lot<00:00:08.220> of<00:00:08.250> power<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:09.889> don't

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
money there's a lot of power I don't

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.440 
money there's a lot of power I don't
think<00:00:11.070> it's<00:00:11.190> an<00:00:11.250> appropriate<00:00:11.340> question<00:00:12.030> for

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:14.450 
think it's an appropriate question for

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.300 
think it's an appropriate question for
and<00:00:15.450> into<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.410> thing<00:00:16.619> about<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.100> full<00:00:17.279> moon

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
and into that thing about the full moon

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.010 
and into that thing about the full moon
festival<00:00:17.880> is<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.119> what<00:00:18.330> you're<00:00:18.510> saying<00:00:18.539> here

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
festival is that what you're saying here

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.660 
festival is that what you're saying here
I<00:00:19.260> didn't<00:00:19.680> know<00:00:19.740> this<00:00:19.859> we<00:00:20.039> think<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.400> here<00:00:20.580> is

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
I didn't know this we think in here is

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.450 
I didn't know this we think in here is
only<00:00:20.850> you're<00:00:21.060> asking<00:00:21.710> this<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.859> this<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.220> this

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
only you're asking this is this is this

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.939 
only you're asking this is this is this
immediate<00:00:24.060> thing<00:00:24.240> no<00:00:24.869> it's<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.230> serger<00:00:25.590> this<00:00:25.800> is

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
immediate thing no it's a serger this is

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.130 
immediate thing no it's a serger this is
for<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.130> university<00:00:26.699> so<00:00:27.510> that's<00:00:27.720> fine<00:00:27.900> yeah

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
for the university so that's fine yeah

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.589 
for the university so that's fine yeah
no<00:00:28.170> no<00:00:28.910> it's<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:29.970> good<00:00:30.090> question<00:00:30.150> but

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
no no it's a good question but

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.389 
no no it's a good question but
biomedical<00:00:31.199> research<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.800> know<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.219> is<00:00:32.250> the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
biomedical research you know this is the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.780 
biomedical research you know this is the
the<00:00:33.210> patent<00:00:33.600> consumer<00:00:34.110> medicine<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.800> that<00:00:35.579> is

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
the patent consumer medicine and that is

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.180 
the patent consumer medicine and that is
we<00:00:36.239> try<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.570> find<00:00:37.020> all<00:00:37.290> kinds<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.829> explanations

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
we try to find all kinds of explanations

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.810 
we try to find all kinds of explanations
for<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:40.110> human<00:00:40.410> condition<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.250> what

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
for the human condition and what

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.299 
for the human condition and what
illnesses<00:00:42.500> we've<00:00:43.500> done<00:00:43.680> remarkable<00:00:44.250> things

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
illnesses we've done remarkable things

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.209 
illnesses we've done remarkable things
that<00:00:45.000> were<00:00:45.149> previously<00:00:45.680> unheard<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.829> we<00:00:47.039> can

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
that were previously unheard of we can

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.520 
that were previously unheard of we can
transplant<00:00:47.670> virtually<00:00:48.210> every<00:00:48.450> organ<00:00:48.780> you<00:00:49.379> can

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
transplant virtually every organ you can

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.069 
transplant virtually every organ you can
electrically<00:00:49.980> stimulate<00:00:50.700> an<00:00:50.879> armed<00:00:51.210> with<00:00:51.840> an

especially<00:00:55.350> chronic<00:00:55.980> conditions<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.699> don't

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
especially chronic conditions that don't
