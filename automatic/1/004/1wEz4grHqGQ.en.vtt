is always engaged so you have power at a
split<00:01:46.920> second<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.670> any<00:01:47.850> wheel<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.479> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
split second going to any wheel and the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.649 
split second going to any wheel and the
benefit<00:01:49.380> of<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.340> given<00:01:51.149> even<00:01:51.570> a

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
benefit of that is that given even a

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.139 
benefit of that is that given even a
milliseconds<00:01:52.500> change<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.130> your<00:01:53.220> traction<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
milliseconds change in your traction the

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.850 
milliseconds change in your traction the
car<00:01:54.360> can<00:01:54.570> immediately<00:01:55.170> react<00:01:55.500> and

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
car can immediately react and

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.100 
car can immediately react and
accommodate<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:56.670> if<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.750> were<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.990> have

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
accommodate that so if you were to have

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.880 
accommodate that so if you were to have
something<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.619> come<00:01:58.950> in<00:01:59.159> and<00:01:59.310> out

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
something to come in and out

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.560 
something to come in and out
Oh<00:01:59.950> wheel<00:02:00.280> driver<00:02:00.610> probably<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:01.330> probably

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
Oh wheel driver probably you probably

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.149 
Oh wheel driver probably you probably
better<00:02:01.810> hear<00:02:02.020> that<00:02:02.140> switch<00:02:02.380> quick<00:02:02.680> enough<00:02:02.950> if

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
better hear that switch quick enough if

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.800 
better hear that switch quick enough if
you<00:02:03.280> had<00:02:03.430> to<00:02:03.550> respond<00:02:04.000> there's<00:02:04.240> no<00:02:04.330> way<00:02:04.600> no

little<00:03:25.090> in<00:03:25.420> terms<00:03:25.630> of<00:03:25.870> what<00:03:26.019> I'd<00:03:26.079> call<00:03:26.230> frills

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
little in terms of what I'd call frills

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.430 
little in terms of what I'd call frills
it's<00:03:27.070> a<00:03:27.220> straightforward<00:03:28.019> classic<00:03:29.019> design

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
it's a straightforward classic design

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.680 
it's a straightforward classic design
and<00:03:29.829> you<00:03:30.670> know<00:03:30.760> you<00:03:30.820> have<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.030> slight<00:03:31.299> detail

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
and you know you have a slight detail

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.750 
and you know you have a slight detail
there<00:03:31.900> through<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.230> doors<00:03:32.530> you<00:03:33.459> have<00:03:33.610> that

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
there through the doors you have that

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.130 
there through the doors you have that
detail<00:03:33.940> along<00:03:34.269> the<00:03:34.329> bottom<00:03:34.780> here<00:03:34.989> which

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
detail along the bottom here which

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.900 
detail along the bottom here which
actually<00:03:35.350> is<00:03:35.709> designed<00:03:35.890> in<00:03:36.250> profile<00:03:36.640> you<00:03:36.760> can

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
actually is designed in profile you can

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.120 
actually is designed in profile you can
see<00:03:37.150> it<00:03:37.299> comes<00:03:37.540> out<00:03:37.750> to<00:03:38.440> protect<00:03:38.829> the<00:03:38.950> door

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
see it comes out to protect the door

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.729 
see it comes out to protect the door
from<00:03:39.610> door<00:03:40.120> dings<00:03:40.329> and<00:03:40.780> looking<00:03:41.290> at<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.500> trunk

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
from door dings and looking at the trunk

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.319 
from door dings and looking at the trunk
one<00:03:42.190> of<00:03:42.280> the<00:03:42.370> things<00:03:42.549> I<00:03:42.700> really<00:03:42.910> like<00:03:43.090> is<00:03:43.120> when

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
one of the things I really like is when

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.300 
one of the things I really like is when
you<00:03:43.570> open<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:43.930> trunk<00:03:44.110> you<00:03:44.260> have<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.530> rubber

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
you open the trunk you have the rubber

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.550 
you open the trunk you have the rubber
sill<00:03:45.610> in<00:03:45.760> there<00:03:45.970> or<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.390> instead<00:03:47.079> of<00:03:47.110> having<00:03:47.410> a

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
sill in there or the instead of having a

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.500 
sill in there or the instead of having a
painted<00:03:47.950> sill<00:03:48.160> which<00:03:48.310> gets<00:03:48.549> scratched<00:03:48.880> up<00:03:49.120> you

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
painted sill which gets scratched up you

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.140 
painted sill which gets scratched up you
do<00:03:49.720> they<00:03:49.900> protect<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.470> sill<00:03:50.790> inside<00:03:51.790> there<00:03:52.030> as

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
do they protect the sill inside there as

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.789 
do they protect the sill inside there as
well<00:03:52.360> what's<00:03:52.660> carpeted<00:03:53.170> can<00:03:53.380> actually<00:03:53.650> also

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
well what's carpeted can actually also

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.430 
well what's carpeted can actually also
be<00:03:54.130> flipped<00:03:54.400> over<00:03:54.579> to<00:03:55.209> a<00:03:55.239> waterproof<00:03:55.780> side<00:03:56.079> so

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
be flipped over to a waterproof side so

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.479 
be flipped over to a waterproof side so
if<00:03:56.530> you're<00:03:56.680> throwing<00:03:56.890> in<00:03:57.040> some<00:03:57.190> things<00:03:57.370> that
