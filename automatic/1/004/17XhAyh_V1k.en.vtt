00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.650
 Hi, I 'm a teacher, Jorge de Moraes. 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.410
 professor of medicine 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:23.010
 great legal courses and the great tip of 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.910
 today we are going to talk about one of the types 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.310
 mechanisms of suffocation is that the 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.740
 staff confuses much on account of 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.230
 some sports broadcasts 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:39.600
 We are going to talk about hanging. 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.000
 choking and strangulation 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.480
 three types of suffocation are those that 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.450
 as the main mechanism there is the 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.149
 obstruction of the late air passage where 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.160
 an individual due to the obliteration of 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.190
 trachea or I'm going to make a 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.850
 pressure I will make a force on the 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.210
 the victim's neck trying to do with 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.949
 that the air no longer passes through the trachea and 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.869
 He can not breathe anymore 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.630
 It's good, the folks, we want to take the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.540
 doubt if there is help from our friend today 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.490
 Luis comes to Luiz Roque and we are going 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.530
 doubt and we will never 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.189
 more goes to the root and never goes 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.939
 forget 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:25.770
 Ok folks when I talk in strangling 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:29.880
 're the aggressor he has to use the hand 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.240
 his hands or any part of his body. 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.240
 okay to try on the victim 's neck 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.939
 in case here is the rock LuÃ­s do 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.450
 the passage of air through the 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.729
 observation of the bile obliteration of the trachea 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.560
 of the individual then what happens when 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.479
 He uses one hand and he'll do it. 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.119
 from here and will tighten 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.520
 in this type of injury here in this type of 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.250
 mechanism it leaves some lesions it 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.719
 will leave marks of the fingers okay will cause 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.479
 some that shows some abrasions 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.630
 nail mark it can use the two 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.930
 hands he is able to use 20 Luis 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.310
 forearm the famous lion kills what is this 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.560
 which confuses many people in the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.080
 sports broadcasts understood why 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.830
 This is a scam and the staff 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.560
 in the middle 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.420
 the transmission calls what of 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.300
 strangulation then every time 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.760
 use part of the victim if not 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.830
 saw use of part of the body to try 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.080
 stop the passage of air from a 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.420
 individual in the region of the neck I call 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.570
 of what the pain may be the hands 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.370
 the forearm making kills lion had 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.590
 fallen on the floor I could try to 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.620
 this interruption in this way I could 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.800
 use my leg to knee the foot and 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.740
 then I would have what would be beating him 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.150
 Okay, so this is a crackdown. 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.010
 When I talk about strangulation 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.880
 I have to use a 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:57.120
 material is a string is a string ok 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:59.670
 be a towel a tie a sheet on the 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.530
 if here we have a rope, okay I 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.380
 I have to do it now or if it goes 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.260
 to tie the victim's neck 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.709
 Okay, he'll pass and will use a 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.920
 strength that is not his weight ok then he 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.350
 You can pull yes, okay, that tip can be 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.510
 trapped in another place as on a pole and 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.580
 a tree on the other side is in making 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.250
 that the strength to try justly 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.430
 cause that pressure in the region of 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.220
 neck trying to cause what to get 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.120
 tracheal action preventing the passage of 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:36.390
 air and then I will have mechanical asphyxiation and 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.900
 third we have the personal touch is 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:43.950
 a hanging on the hanging ok 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:47.310
 What happens is that a luiz gets desperate 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.910
 no I'll have to make use of who 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.930
 of the victim's weight 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.540
 Who are you going to work to close here? 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.300
 make this obliteration of the trachea 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.280
 prevent the passage of air is the 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.870
 who is the victim's weight 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.810
 so the victim hangs her 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.330
 It's always what lasted okay 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.180
 if I pull here, I would have a point 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.880
 I agreed and I would suspend them. 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.299
 to inform when staff 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.340
 we will never again confuse these 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.660
 questions, we'll never see each other again 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:27.380
 confuse and strangle hang is 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.630
 strangle you 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:34.770
 throttling is done through a 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:37.170
 instrument may be a string a string or 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.600
 a cloth do not forget that the 

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:42.030
 strangulation it is done that way 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.680
 not the way it is placed in the 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.470
 sports broadcasts 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:48.540
 that form of sports broadcasting 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.860
 is the fighter is using a part 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:53.160
 his body 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.510
 Okay, so he's examining it and not 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.150
 strangulation in addition to having to use 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:59.610
 an object with a rope an end or cloth 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.340
 I have to use a force that is not 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.230
 the victim's weight because if I 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.600
 make a bow on his neck and 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:07.919
 used its weight to obstruct this 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.220
 air pass 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.390
 I'm going is what hanging is the tip 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.160
 to the next 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:22.220
 thanks this 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:22.220
