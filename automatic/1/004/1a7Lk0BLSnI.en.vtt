00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello this is my first video in the me 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.189
 I would like to show you another of my ways 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.260
 of fun in minecraft consists of 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.360
 build a battle coliseum like the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.219
 that I will show you next what 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.199
 I'm sorry but I can not give you the link 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.630
 but in the next videos I will upload the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.640
 way to build it in this case I would 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.500
 I have built with great detail 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.840
 but it can be done with a little 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.150
 Reston and stone in a few seconds 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.130
 I teach an example of the zombie size is 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.800
 against humans and five goals of iron 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.019
 xd good good as I hope you see 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.240
 I'm putting a few villagers by 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:39.310
 this side with the other five golems 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.440
 and now on this side of here I'll put 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.570
 the zombies which always persecute 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.210
 to humans both the villagers and 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.400
 to the main character I guess not 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.710
 It goes without saying that the game must be 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.720
 in creative when you do this or they will last 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.060
 less than pinocho with a match in the 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.890
 hand xd because with that it only remains to give 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.890
 the lever and see the result xd 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.630
 and there go those zombies do not know the 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.969
 hostility that golems will give you 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.829
 how can you see the problem of this 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:12.049
 little game is that they give a lot of side for that 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:14.149
 they should use a somewhat powerful computer 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.050
 or there will be a book of all sizes and 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.450
 colors 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.880
 the example of what I just said what 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.830
 can see in those three zombies is supposed 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.120
 that they should go for the villagers but 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.120
 they stayed there doing nothing 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.810
 the battle is very close xd 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.240
 well, this has been all in my 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.610
 First video leave comments and give 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.590
 like if you like them soon I will upload 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.860
 videos on how to build the coliseums 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.409
 make automatic doors traps videos 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.539
 funny and so can you too 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.220
 make videos of other games but that already 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.220
 I'll think about it later xd
