that<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:44.730> mean<00:00:45.059> this<00:00:45.239> game<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.899> beta<00:00:45.930> so

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
that I mean this game is in beta so

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.490 
that I mean this game is in beta so
probably<00:00:46.860> everyone's<00:00:47.219> still<00:00:47.489> learning<00:00:47.969> but

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
probably everyone's still learning but

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.020 
probably everyone's still learning but
honestly<00:00:49.500> there's<00:00:49.920> no<00:00:50.070> fighting<00:00:50.730> over

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030

minions<00:00:51.750> or<00:00:51.930> anything<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.379> because

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
minions or anything like that because

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.130 
minions or anything like that because
you<00:00:52.980> get<00:00:53.129> shared<00:00:53.489> golden<00:00:54.030> lanes<00:00:54.270> because<00:00:54.809> you

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
you get shared golden lanes because you

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.660 
you get shared golden lanes because you
know<00:00:55.260> there's<00:00:55.469> no<00:00:55.620> fighting<00:00:56.160> over<00:00:56.280> everything

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
know there's no fighting over everything

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.610 
know there's no fighting over everything
because<00:00:56.940> pretty<00:00:57.300> much<00:00:57.390> everything<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
because pretty much everything in the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.049 
because pretty much everything in the
game<00:00:58.859> is<00:00:59.039> pretty<00:00:59.190> much<00:00:59.280> shared<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.879> don't

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
game is pretty much shared you don't

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.549 
game is pretty much shared you don't
need<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.329> worry<00:01:00.510> about<00:01:00.629> people<00:01:00.840> stealing<00:01:01.020> your

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
need to worry about people stealing your

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.560 
need to worry about people stealing your
stuff<00:01:01.710> most<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> time<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.420> only

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
stuff most of the time and the only

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.010 
stuff most of the time and the only
thing<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.960> noticed<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:05.220> does<00:01:06.180> get<00:01:06.420> stolen<00:01:06.659> is

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
thing I noticed that does get stolen is

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.039 
thing I noticed that does get stolen is
when<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.350> go<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.830> neutral<00:01:08.720> camps<00:01:09.720> they

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
when you go to the neutral camps they

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.250 
when you go to the neutral camps they
you<00:01:10.650> have<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.010> last-hit<00:01:11.400> them<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.939> I<00:01:12.270> if<00:01:12.900> you

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
you have to last-hit them to I if you

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.990 
you have to last-hit them to I if you
want<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.530> get<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.740> gold<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.520> doesn't<00:01:14.880> get

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
want to get the gold it doesn't get

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.670 
want to get the gold it doesn't get
shared<00:01:15.299> but<00:01:15.659> even<00:01:15.900> then<00:01:16.080> that's<00:01:16.259> obviously

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
shared but even then that's obviously

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.649 
shared but even then that's obviously
not<00:01:16.890> too<00:01:17.040> much<00:01:17.250> for<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.520> problem<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:18.090> don't<00:01:18.479> think

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
not too much for a problem I don't think

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.130 
not too much for a problem I don't think
people<00:01:18.810> will<00:01:19.020> be<00:01:19.140> fighting<00:01:19.530> over<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.890> so

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
people will be fighting over that so

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.260 
people will be fighting over that so
first<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.320> all<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.770> game<00:01:22.920> itself<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
first of all the game itself like the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.510 
first of all the game itself like the
outside<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.049> game<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.950> client<00:01:26.369> and

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
outside of the game the client and

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.980 
outside of the game the client and
everything<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:26.909> pretty<00:01:27.030> good<00:01:27.299> everything

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
everything is pretty good everything

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.319 
everything is pretty good everything
works<00:01:28.229> well<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.979> responds<00:01:29.850> as<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.090> should

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
works well and responds as it should

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.109 
works well and responds as it should

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
like that because obviously you sell

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.970 
like that because obviously you sell
power<00:02:48.330> in<00:02:48.600> a<00:02:48.690> MOBA<00:02:48.990> game<00:02:49.170> it's<00:02:49.440> not<00:02:49.650> gonna<00:02:49.770> get

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
power in a MOBA game it's not gonna get

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.040 
power in a MOBA game it's not gonna get
popular<00:02:50.460> because<00:02:51.090> people<00:02:51.630> aren't<00:02:51.750> gonna<00:02:51.900> be

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
popular because people aren't gonna be

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.460 
popular because people aren't gonna be
happy<00:02:52.320> with<00:02:52.500> that<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.660> yeah<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:54.690> think<00:02:55.140> that

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
happy with that so yeah I think that

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.170 
happy with that so yeah I think that
outside<00:02:55.980> of<00:02:56.130> the<00:02:56.220> game<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:56.640> know<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.760> clients

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
outside of the game you know the clients

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.430 
outside of the game you know the clients
and<00:02:57.240> everything<00:02:57.540> works<00:02:57.720> pretty<00:02:57.840> well<00:02:57.960> then

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440

Legends the map and everything looks
good<00:03:14.280> I<00:03:14.550> personally<00:03:15.090> didn't<00:03:15.570> think<00:03:15.750> the

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
good I personally didn't think the

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.410 
good I personally didn't think the
character<00:03:16.890> models<00:03:17.220> were<00:03:17.400> that<00:03:17.520> great<00:03:17.730> that's

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
character models were that great that's

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.740 
character models were that great that's
just<00:03:18.570> my<00:03:18.840> opinion<00:03:19.700> they<00:03:20.700> look<00:03:20.910> just<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.660> know

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
just my opinion they look just you know

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.040 
just my opinion they look just you know
super<00:03:22.590> cartoony<00:03:23.220> and<00:03:23.360> maybe<00:03:24.360> I<00:03:24.480> didn't<00:03:24.930> have

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050

most<00:03:40.320> of<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.530> spells<00:03:40.830> were<00:03:41.100> I<00:03:41.400> played<00:03:41.850> a<00:03:41.880> as

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
pilot lady she was pretty cool she you

pilot lady she was pretty cool she you
play<00:03:47.580> her<00:03:47.790> in<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.060> tutorial<00:03:48.600> if<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:48.840> decide<00:03:49.260> to

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
play her in a tutorial if you decide to

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.570 
play her in a tutorial if you decide to
go<00:03:49.530> through<00:03:49.680> that<00:03:49.830> I<00:03:50.100> pretty<00:03:50.430> much<00:03:50.490> just

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
go through that I pretty much just

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.020 
go through that I pretty much just
skipped<00:03:51.000> it<00:03:51.150> because<00:03:51.420> it<00:03:51.540> was<00:03:51.630> boring<00:03:51.959> so<00:03:53.030> but

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
skipped it because it was boring so but

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.910 
skipped it because it was boring so but
I<00:03:54.060> mean<00:03:54.240> the<00:03:54.360> tutorial<00:03:55.080> as<00:03:55.230> well<00:03:55.410> is<00:03:55.590> actually

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
I mean the tutorial as well is actually

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.860 
I mean the tutorial as well is actually
pretty<00:03:56.160> good<00:03:56.370> like<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.910> explains<00:03:57.420> most<00:03:57.660> of<00:03:57.810> the

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
pretty good like it explains most of the

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.560 
pretty good like it explains most of the
stuff<00:03:58.140> pretty<00:03:58.470> well<00:03:58.709> but<00:03:58.980> I<00:03:59.390> figured<00:04:00.390> that<00:04:00.420> I

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
stuff pretty well but I figured that I

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.420 
stuff pretty well but I figured that I
was<00:04:00.720> confident<00:04:01.110> enough<00:04:01.260> to<00:04:01.380> just<00:04:01.650> go<00:04:01.830> straight

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
was confident enough to just go straight

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.180 
was confident enough to just go straight
into<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:02.970> matchmaking<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:04.260> another<00:04:04.950> thing

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
gold around you that's in the same plane

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:56.659 
gold around you that's in the same plane
you<00:04:55.470> know<00:04:55.500> there's<00:04:55.800> no<00:04:55.950> fighting<00:04:56.250> over

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
you know there's no fighting over

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.129 
you know there's no fighting over
minions<00:04:57.180> and<00:04:57.360> stuff<00:04:57.570> like<00:04:57.750> that

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
minions and stuff like that

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.980 
minions and stuff like that
everyone<00:04:58.680> gets<00:04:58.919> gold<00:04:59.220> which<00:05:00.210> is<00:05:00.360> great<00:05:00.600> so<00:05:00.960> I

everyone gets gold which is great so I

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.230 
everyone gets gold which is great so I
think<00:05:01.440> that<00:05:01.650> maybe<00:05:01.979> maybe<00:05:02.639> means<00:05:02.910> that

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
think that maybe maybe means that

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.170 
think that maybe maybe means that
there's<00:05:03.780> no<00:05:04.200> need<00:05:04.530> for<00:05:04.560> supports<00:05:05.430> if<00:05:05.910> that's

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
there's no need for supports if that's

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.719 
there's no need for supports if that's
the<00:05:06.330> case<00:05:06.510> I'm<00:05:06.930> not<00:05:06.990> too<00:05:07.260> sure<00:05:07.470> I<00:05:07.770> mean<00:05:08.580> there

the case I'm not too sure I mean there

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.250 
the case I'm not too sure I mean there

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:10.260 
are obviously tanks and stuff like that

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:12.740
