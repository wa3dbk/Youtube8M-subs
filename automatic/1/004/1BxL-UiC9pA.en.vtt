simple fly just take your two pieces of

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.420 
simple fly just take your two pieces of
yarn<00:00:31.380> for<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:32.009> bottom<00:00:32.279> half<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.640> egg<00:00:34.430> loop

yarn for the bottom half of the egg loop
your<00:00:35.640> thread<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.149> it's<00:00:36.420> really<00:00:36.600> important

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
your thread and it's really important

the<00:00:37.260> secret<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:37.860> fly<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.129> lots<00:00:38.579> of

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
the secret of this fly is lots of

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.190 
the secret of this fly is lots of
pressure<00:00:38.940> on<00:00:39.120> your<00:00:39.270> first<00:00:39.420> wrap<00:00:39.660> you've<00:00:39.960> got

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
pressure on your first wrap you've got

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.260 
pressure on your first wrap you've got
to<00:00:40.320> get<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.559> material<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.190> spring<00:00:41.520> out<00:00:41.700> you

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
to get that material to spring out you

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.810 
to get that material to spring out you
know<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.450> form<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.379> shape<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> egg<00:00:43.950> so

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
know to form the shape of the egg so

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.639 
know to form the shape of the egg so
lots<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.360> pressure<00:00:45.629> up<00:00:45.899> against<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.320> shank<00:00:46.530> of

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
lots of pressure up against the shank of

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.500 
lots of pressure up against the shank of
the<00:00:46.710> hook<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:49.489> three<00:00:50.489> or<00:00:50.579> four<00:00:50.760> more<00:00:50.940> wraps<00:00:51.210> to

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
the hook and three or four more wraps to

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.119 
the hook and three or four more wraps to
make<00:00:51.660> sure<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.930> doesn't<00:00:52.079> slip<00:00:54.890> secure<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.010> off

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
make sure it doesn't slip secure it off

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.760 
make sure it doesn't slip secure it off
and<00:00:57.120> repeat<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.600> process<00:00:57.809> for<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.320> up<00:00:58.530> side

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
and repeat the process for the up side

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:07.190 
and repeat the process for the up side
of<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:58.980> fly<00:01:01.370> two<00:01:02.370> more<00:01:02.579> pieces<00:01:02.789> of<00:01:03.030> yarn<00:01:06.200> first

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
of the fly two more pieces of yarn first

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:14.390 
of the fly two more pieces of yarn first
wrap<00:01:07.650> is<00:01:08.010> really<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> critical<00:01:08.700> part<00:01:13.400> it's

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
wrap is really the critical part it's

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.990 
wrap is really the critical part it's
the<00:01:14.460> pressure<00:01:16.280> then<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.520> take<00:01:17.670> some<00:01:17.850> thread

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
the pressure then just take some thread

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.730 
the pressure then just take some thread
and<00:01:18.299> finish<00:01:18.840> out<00:01:18.990> around<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.350> eye<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.619> the

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
and finish out around the eye of the

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.230 
and finish out around the eye of the
hook<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.130> know<00:01:20.280> any<00:01:20.460> rough<00:01:20.729> metal<00:01:21.030> or

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
hook you know any rough metal or

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.580 
hook you know any rough metal or
anything<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.630> don't<00:01:21.720> want<00:01:21.960> your<00:01:22.170> line<00:01:22.350> to

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
anything you don't want your line to

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.670 
anything you don't want your line to
chafe<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:23.700> smooth<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.180> up<00:01:24.330> so<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.140> get

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
chafe just smooth it up so you can get

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.969 
chafe just smooth it up so you can get
good<00:01:25.890> knot<00:01:26.130> tied<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.700> there<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:30.560> couple<00:01:31.560> half

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
good knot tied in there a couple half

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.859 
good knot tied in there a couple half
hitches<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.549> secure<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.090> I<00:01:33.210> generally<00:01:33.780> don't

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
hitches to secure it I generally don't

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.960 
hitches to secure it I generally don't
glue<00:01:34.259> egg<00:01:34.470> patterns<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.189> just<00:01:35.220> don't<00:01:35.640> seem<00:01:35.939> to

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
glue egg patterns you just don't seem to

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.780 
glue egg patterns you just don't seem to
need<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.229> just<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.890> couple<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.280> nice<00:01:38.490> half

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
need that just a couple of nice half

first<00:01:45.630> make<00:01:46.140> your<00:01:46.290> bottom<00:01:46.619> cut<00:01:46.829> I'm<00:01:47.070> just

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
first make your bottom cut I'm just

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.420 
first make your bottom cut I'm just
going<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.399> form<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.790> bottom<00:01:47.939> half<00:01:48.240> of<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.450> fly

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.120 

and<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.150> same<00:01:54.390> thing<00:01:54.660> for<00:01:54.870> the<00:01:54.990> top<00:01:55.170> cut<00:01:55.500> let's

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
and the same thing for the top cut let's

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:07.999 
and the same thing for the top cut let's
pull<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.610> material<00:01:56.760> up<00:02:06.680> and<00:02:07.680> then<00:02:07.830> a<00:02:07.860> little

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
pull the material up and then a little

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.590 
pull the material up and then a little
bit<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.220> trimming<00:02:08.520> here<00:02:08.790> and<00:02:08.940> there<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.119> mean<00:02:09.450> it

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
bit of trimming here and there I mean it

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.390 
bit of trimming here and there I mean it
doesn't<00:02:09.869> have<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.259> be<00:02:10.380> a<00:02:10.410> perfect<00:02:10.740> circle<00:02:11.370> but

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
doesn't have to be a perfect circle but
