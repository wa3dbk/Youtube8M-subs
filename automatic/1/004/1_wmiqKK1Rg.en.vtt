00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:05.709
 st efe filter is pleased in 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.540
 introduce you the range of mesh filters 

00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:11.480
 fm to 7000 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.850
 the automatic mesh filter model fm 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.510
 to 7000 combines the filtering action 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.140
 with disinfection in a single device 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.360
 decreasing the space of the 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.940
 installation and increasing simplicity 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.980
 of the system 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.720
 the team performs washing of form 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.900
 automatic without the need to interrupt 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.490
 the filtration operation of the fluid 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.470
 It is also able to disinfect the 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.170
 liquid without the need to add any 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.180
 water chemical in the search 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.329
 to minimize the impact on the environment 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.579
 ambient 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.140
 the flow that circulates through the equipment is 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.260
 submits to two processes clearly 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.409
 differentiated the filtration through 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.850
 a filter mesh first 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:53.460
 followed by disinfection through 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.890
 ultraviolet radiation 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.840
 the filtering and filtering chambers 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.090
 cleaning are related to the 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.559
 first process and the camera 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.559
 disinfection with the second 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.590
 when the water penetrates inside of 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.990
 the filtration chamber reduces its 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.760
 speed and it is producing a 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.979
 retention of all particles in 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.720
 form of filter cake on the mesh 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.720
 of the selected filtration size 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.320
 once the fluid has passed through the 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.240
 first stage this one goes towards the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.520
 top of the filter by a 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.100
 Conduit inside the cartridge 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.869
 At the end of the conduit, the fluid 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.420
 find an interlacing of lamps 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:36.969
 ultraviolet capable of acting on the 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.520
 DNA of bacteria virus and others 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.909
 biological contaminants by light 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.909
 ultraviolet 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.740
 the germicidal action begins when the 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.740
 fluid begins the journey towards 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.720
 the output of the equipment the fluid circulates to 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.910
 an adequate speed to be 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.120
 supply the recommended dose in each 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.120
 application 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:04.450
 the fm a 7000 ultraviolet team is 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.430
 fully automatic having two 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.110
 washing systems for both the mesh 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.670
 filter as for lamps 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.130
 ultraviolet 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.200
 Ultraviolet lamps have a 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.209
 automatic system for cleaning the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.310
 quartz crystal that protects the lamp 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:21.110
 in order to maintain the effectiveness of 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.490
 system during the life of the 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:27.210
 lamps 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.400
 the fm to 7000 ultraviolet has a 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.290
 temperature sensor and a sensor 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.580
 for measuring the intensity of the 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.790
 ultraviolet light 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.890
 due to its configuration the fm to 7000 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.570
 Ultraviolet is ideal for your 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.910
 installation in water treatment plants 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.820
 waste greenhouses systems 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.740
 refrigeration and industrial systems already 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.440
 that in addition to guaranteeing parameters 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.750
 of water quality decreases costs 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.180
 of both implementation and 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.580
 maintenance in addition to reduce 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.300
 considerably the necessary space 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.300
 for assembly
