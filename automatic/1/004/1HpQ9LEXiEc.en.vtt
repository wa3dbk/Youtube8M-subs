00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
video on it and I've decided to frame it

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.599 
video on it and I've decided to frame it
myself<00:00:27.390> because<00:00:27.599> it's<00:00:27.840> quite<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.140> small<00:00:28.609> design

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
myself because it's quite a small design

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.030 
myself because it's quite a small design
so<00:00:30.599> there<00:00:30.929> he<00:00:31.470> or<00:00:31.769> she<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:33.649> really<00:00:34.649> pleased

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
so there he or she is really pleased

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.580 
so there he or she is really pleased
with<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.309> i<00:00:35.550> bought<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:35.969> from<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.590> framing

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
with it i bought this from a framing

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.729 
with it i bought this from a framing
sharp<00:00:38.600> it<00:00:39.600> was<00:00:39.750> only<00:00:39.899> about<00:00:40.079> four<00:00:40.500> pounds

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
sharp it was only about four pounds

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.420 
sharp it was only about four pounds
something<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:42.739> so<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.770> thought<00:00:43.980> it<00:00:44.129> had<00:00:44.250> come

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
something and so I thought it had come

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.580 
something and so I thought it had come
in<00:00:44.579> handy<00:00:44.730> somewhere<00:00:45.300> and<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.200> happens

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
in handy somewhere and it's so happens

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.350 
in handy somewhere and it's so happens
it's<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.610> fit<00:00:48.120> back<00:00:48.360> baby<00:00:48.600> perfectly<00:00:50.360> only

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
it's a fit back baby perfectly only

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.299 
it's a fit back baby perfectly only
