00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.540
 I welcome you to 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:18.900
 an extremely rainy, very gloomy one 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:21.840
 day dear barbie martina drives us 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.560
 just through this depressive day too 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.109
 a place that will warm our hearts 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.349
 because it is a place of happiness a place 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.200
 a very long and long journey 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.000
 namely the longboards tour we started 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.980
 to ask almost concrete wave with the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.510
 background that the thieving barbie 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.160
 Of course , finally a longboard 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:46.170
 but you know how your own girlfriend 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.539
 obviously means but if you 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.280
 all those years trying to get into one 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.670
 to push direction and then just in 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.890
 quotes the fake of the 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.899
 present artists like it 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.539
 somehow I did not get it right then 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.280
 Thought this target would have exactly 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.470
 and I just uploaded video 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:10.229
 I had one video clip suffer from another 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.549
 definitely wants to give horn definitely one 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.760
 topic about me with you too 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.979
 would like to speak that the yes is good us 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.009
 human development people know 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.000
 grow up small others think and 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.670
 but so that later come too 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.650
 Now I want to have you quiet 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.650
 you're also looking for something to partner with 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.860
 master 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.070
 if you drive in there then go up 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:46.159
 he gets out and gets you say right 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:49.930
 you have pulled press of the types 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.930
 but usually I think 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.479
 we are already mentally prepared 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.590
 so that's in a relationship with it 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:09.399
 there is always a lot of talk going on there 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.399
 still done 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.190
 We did it. People look at it 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.160
 to you 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.510
 We are a meadow in Cameroon 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.350
 concrete wave in cologne are one 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.110
 not given for a long time 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.549
 I went completely out of it 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.060
 I get an introduction to that 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:39.100
 Longboard drive different boards 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:42.799
 to get out of the pink roll 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:45.540
 neon pink is just what you get 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:48.329
 can stand well because they are 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:54.450
 But that is in a fable of who is 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:55.650
 the word weird maybe yes 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.019
 I also skip from Austria 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.019
 of course that fits quite well, of course 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.299
 as if the professional somehow scrap 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:09.000
 would not sell red in this 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.010
 is running for a practical argument here 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.760
 should be the europeans bit 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.700
 support 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:24.629
 Austria has decided in the 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:27.389
 seriously now seriously i know again 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:29.609
 here third marks recorded and from the 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.989
 macher that 's real that I had 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:33.060
 your rolls found too small 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.150
 I think he is rolling for 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.980
 I put a tank around and evaluate it 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.180
 know the more that Heiko is the 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:48.650
 the one who gave us the longboard 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:48.650
 has enabled that sounds already after 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.239
 and without shy I fully me full all 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.610
 through which you can contribute today 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.610
 to go out you can just be like 23 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.930
 Always remember when I get the word here 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.930
 I never get on the board 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:23.150
 I'm sure I am you too 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.680
 tell something because I do not know 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.580
 I do not know which of a letter 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.580
 but that was it 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:57.640
 the pro was in demand for china 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.290
 what do you not say so loud china 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:13.060
 and taiwan okay it can be loud again 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:14.230
 Witnessing, I was completely growing when 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.210
 also want to have her board or 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.920
 maybe some just add 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.300
 wanted to look out for design 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.550
 then definitely come here in cologne 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.470
 passing by compuware super nice people 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.000
 are extremely helpful no matter what you are 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.110
 need immediately in place and we put 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.400
 just saw us have the 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.560
 infinite choice 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.330
 the recommendation of the century too 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.790
 since the longboards I do come 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:35.530
 very gladly again and again 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.720
 the word is put together look 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.500
 like the Barbie herself on her first 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.500
 Longbottom meters strikes 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.470
 finally done you can test yourself 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.470
 relatively straight 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.729
 So test a basement garage 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.180
 was huge 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.890
 for all those people who do not know what 

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.780
 she means she has a cool series 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:09.670
 on your channel started here emergency 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:12.110
 call people 

00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:13.490
 An animal goes bad too 

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.080
 she always finds out for one spot 

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.130
 and save the animal you have to do that 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.550
 make sure you look really cool 

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:19.520
 become 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:22.430
 I can also do well out of breath when purpose 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:24.080
 By the way, one does work the way it stays 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:27.400
 with the weight on the leg and 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.400
 it's only easy with the foot down 

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:35.750
 or you brake that way
