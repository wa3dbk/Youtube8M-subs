00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
area overlooking the natural expansion I

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.889 
area overlooking the natural expansion I
don't<00:00:52.530> think<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.770> Cannon<00:00:53.250> has<00:00:53.370> vision<00:00:53.910> over

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899

all of his units any time losing a ser
there<00:03:08.630> you<00:03:09.630> know<00:03:09.720> he's<00:03:09.900> now<00:03:10.200> managed<00:03:10.650> to

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
rebuild his probes but at the same time

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.600

he<00:03:14.850> has<00:03:14.970> no<00:03:15.480> units<00:03:15.720> really<00:03:16.230> there's<00:03:16.650> an<00:03:16.770> Archon

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
he has no units really there's an Archon

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.700 
he has no units really there's an Archon
and<00:03:17.580> that's<00:03:17.880> pretty<00:03:18.060> much<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.410> Reaver

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
and that's pretty much it and a Reaver

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.130 
and that's pretty much it and a Reaver
of<00:03:19.830> course<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.250> okay<00:03:20.790> now<00:03:20.970> speed<00:03:21.360> upgraded

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
of course and okay now speed upgraded

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.310 
of course and okay now speed upgraded
overlords<00:03:22.800> finished<00:03:23.160> and<00:03:23.810> these<00:03:24.810> dt's<00:03:25.200> are

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
overlords finished and these dt's are

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.620 
overlords finished and these dt's are
going<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.500> be<00:03:25.560> useless<00:03:25.830> now<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.610> do<00:03:27.330> expect

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
going to be useless now so I do expect

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.300 
going to be useless now so I do expect
another<00:03:27.960> frontal<00:03:28.350> attack<00:03:28.530> from<00:03:28.680> jaedong<00:03:29.040> even

there and you know the main mistake of

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.690 
there and you know the main mistake of
this<00:03:51.990> game<00:03:52.200> was<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.890> fact<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.160> any<00:03:53.340> time<00:03:53.520> had

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
this game was the fact that any time had

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.190 
this game was the fact that any time had
a<00:03:53.730> cannon<00:03:54.180> up<00:03:54.300> there<00:03:54.480> but<00:03:54.720> it<00:03:54.840> was<00:03:54.930> just<00:03:54.990> a

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
a cannon up there but it was just a

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.690 
a cannon up there but it was just a
little<00:03:55.470> bit<00:03:55.560> too<00:03:55.680> far<00:03:55.890> away<00:03:56.040> from<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.310> temples

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
little bit too far away from the temples

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.420 
little bit too far away from the temples
and<00:03:56.850> it<00:03:57.210> didn't<00:03:57.600> spot<00:03:58.050> or<00:03:58.320> stop<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.680> lurkers<00:03:59.220> I

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
and it didn't spot or stop the lurkers I

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.520 
and it didn't spot or stop the lurkers I
mean<00:04:00.030> if<00:04:00.240> it<00:04:00.480> stopped<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:00.900> lurkers<00:04:01.230> this

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
mean if it stopped the lurkers this

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:02.450 
mean if it stopped the lurkers this
whole<00:04:01.740> game<00:04:01.980> would<00:04:02.160> have<00:04:02.250> been<00:04:02.340> very

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 
whole game would have been very

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.040 
whole game would have been very
different<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:03.060> think<00:04:03.450> that<00:04:03.600> he<00:04:03.750> had<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.900> good

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
different I think that he had a good

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.900 
different I think that he had a good
opening<00:04:04.530> it<00:04:04.710> just<00:04:05.010> he<00:04:05.160> just<00:04:05.220> couldn't<00:04:05.760> follow

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
opening it just he just couldn't follow

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.180 
opening it just he just couldn't follow
it<00:04:06.060> up<00:04:06.180> with<00:04:06.210> them<00:04:06.620> you<00:04:07.620> know<00:04:07.710> that<00:04:07.920> he<00:04:08.010> just

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
it up with them you know that he just

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.949 
it up with them you know that he just
made<00:04:08.310> a<00:04:08.340> mistake<00:04:08.400> basically<00:04:08.790> now<00:04:09.600> he's<00:04:09.720> trying

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
made a mistake basically now he's trying

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.780 
made a mistake basically now he's trying
to<00:04:10.080> drop<00:04:10.350> the<00:04:10.560> Reaver<00:04:10.950> to<00:04:11.160> do<00:04:11.280> some<00:04:11.430> damage<00:04:11.610> but

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
to drop the Reaver to do some damage but

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.240 
to drop the Reaver to do some damage but
it's<00:04:12.150> probably<00:04:12.300> gets<00:04:12.630> night<00:04:12.870> pretty<00:04:13.140> soon

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
it's probably gets night pretty soon

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.550 
it's probably gets night pretty soon
