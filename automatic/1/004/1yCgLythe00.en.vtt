can help on a day to day basis the big
problem<00:01:22.020> in<00:01:22.080> Parkinson's<00:01:22.650> disease<00:01:23.040> is<00:01:23.340> that

problem in Parkinson's disease is that

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.340 
problem in Parkinson's disease is that
sooner<00:01:23.820> or<00:01:23.909> later<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:24.330> get<00:01:24.450> side<00:01:24.750> effects<00:01:25.110> of

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
sooner or later we get side effects of

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.980 
sooner or later we get side effects of
therapy<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.130> those<00:01:26.790> can<00:01:26.970> be<00:01:27.000> worse<00:01:27.330> than<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
therapy and those can be worse than the

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.030 
therapy and those can be worse than the
disease<00:01:28.290> itself

so<00:01:29.520> ultimately<00:01:29.700> these<00:01:30.540> therapies<00:01:31.350> don't

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
so ultimately these therapies don't

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.679 
so ultimately these therapies don't
really<00:01:31.950> help<00:01:32.070> patients<00:01:32.340> anymore<00:01:32.850> there's<00:01:33.600> a

before<00:02:37.060> but<00:02:38.060> I<00:02:38.090> think<00:02:38.359> even<00:02:38.510> more<00:02:38.750> importantly

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.920 
before but I think even more importantly
to<00:02:40.099> test<00:02:40.459> for<00:02:40.730> new<00:02:40.879> drugs<00:02:41.209> to<00:02:41.359> treat<00:02:41.719> the

Parkinson's disease patients and that

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.240 
Parkinson's disease patients and that
could<00:02:44.450> be<00:02:44.569> revolutionary<00:02:45.319> one<00:02:45.919> of<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.099> most

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
could be revolutionary one of the most

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.619 
could be revolutionary one of the most
important<00:02:46.669> things<00:02:46.819> in<00:02:47.000> my<00:02:47.150> opinion<00:02:47.510> in<00:02:47.599> terms

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
important things in my opinion in terms

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:49.300 
important things in my opinion in terms
of<00:02:47.989> both<00:02:48.230> medical<00:02:48.620> research<00:02:48.919> and<00:02:49.129> patient

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
of both medical research and patient

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.670 
of both medical research and patient
care<00:02:49.700> is<00:02:49.909> that<00:02:50.540> they<00:02:50.720> somehow<00:02:50.959> communicate

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
care is that they somehow communicate

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.159 
care is that they somehow communicate
with<00:02:51.859> each<00:02:52.010> other<00:02:52.280> we<00:02:52.970> can<00:02:53.239> go<00:02:53.450> from

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:54.169 
with each other we can go from

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.949 
with each other we can go from
discoveries<00:02:54.859> in<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.129> laboratory<00:02:55.760> right<00:02:56.720> up

through clinical research and clinical

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.059 
through clinical research and clinical
trials<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.120> test<00:02:59.480> new<00:02:59.629> drugs<00:02:59.989> without<00:03:00.680> ever
