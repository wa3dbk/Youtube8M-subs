could transfer that pattern to my flat

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.330 
could transfer that pattern to my flat
piece<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.430> PVC<00:01:21.380> which<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.560> nothing<00:01:22.799> more<00:01:23.189> than

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
piece of PVC which is nothing more than

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.359 
piece of PVC which is nothing more than
a<00:01:23.369> piece<00:01:23.700> cut<00:01:24.150> out<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:28.220> flattened<00:01:29.220> out

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
a piece cut out of this flattened out

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.920 
a piece cut out of this flattened out
when<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:29.790> flatten<00:01:30.150> this<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.420> we<00:01:30.479> did<00:01:30.630> not<00:01:30.750> use

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
when we flatten this and we did not use

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.140 
when we flatten this and we did not use
the<00:01:30.960> heat<00:01:31.200> gun<00:01:31.320> we<00:01:31.890> use<00:01:32.100> boiling<00:01:32.460> water<00:01:32.610> here

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
the heat gun we use boiling water here

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.170 
the heat gun we use boiling water here
brought<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.960> water<00:01:34.140> here<00:01:34.500> stuck<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.490> PVC<00:01:36.030> in

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
brought the water here stuck the PVC in

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.569 
brought the water here stuck the PVC in
it<00:01:36.329> later<00:01:37.020> Burke<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.500> top<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:37.979> got<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.280> flat

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
it later Burke on top of it got it flat

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.690 
it later Burke on top of it got it flat
so<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.659> did<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.619> same<00:01:40.829> thing<00:01:41.159> with<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.369> flat

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
so I did the same thing with a flat

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.639 
so I did the same thing with a flat
piece<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.939> wood<00:01:42.150> when<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.600> had<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.990> jig<00:01:43.229> set<00:01:43.500> up

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
piece of wood when I had the jig set up

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.120 
piece of wood when I had the jig set up
I<00:01:43.799> put<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.009> hole<00:01:44.250> then<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.060> put<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> second<00:01:45.810> hole

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
I put a hole then I put the second hole

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.030 
I put a hole then I put the second hole
that<00:01:47.130> way<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.670> could<00:01:48.180> come<00:01:48.600> here<00:01:48.960> on<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.770> flat

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
that way I could come here on the flat

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.460 
that way I could come here on the flat
piece<00:01:50.540> mark<00:01:51.540> where<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.780> holes<00:01:52.079> need<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.380> be

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
piece mark where the holes need to be

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.730 
piece mark where the holes need to be
not<00:01:53.009> drilled<00:01:53.369> them<00:01:53.520> out<00:01:54.200> then<00:01:55.200> now<00:01:55.409> what<00:01:55.590> I'm
