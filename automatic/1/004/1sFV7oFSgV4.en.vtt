crap or whatever got the ignition switch

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.790 
crap or whatever got the ignition switch
out<00:00:43.480> of<00:00:43.510> the<00:00:43.660> Z<00:00:43.899> and<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:46.480> terminals<00:00:47.079> that<00:00:47.769> I

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
out of the Z and the terminals that I

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.450 
out of the Z and the terminals that I
have<00:00:48.129> it<00:00:48.280> on<00:00:48.449> right<00:00:49.449> now<00:00:49.719> is<00:00:51.030> s<00:00:52.030> and<00:00:52.690> B<00:00:53.469> as<00:00:54.190> far

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
have it on right now is s and B as far

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.310 
have it on right now is s and B as far
as<00:00:54.579> I<00:00:54.670> understand<00:00:55.120> that<00:00:55.390> should<00:00:55.930> be<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
as I understand that should be the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.969 
as I understand that should be the
starter<00:00:59.320> and<00:00:59.530> the<00:00:59.739> battery<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:04.619> when<00:01:05.619> I<00:01:05.710> turn

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
starter and the battery so when I turn

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:14.149 
starter and the battery so when I turn
it

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.800 

other<00:01:14.820> than<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.149> little<00:01:17.450> little<00:01:18.450> catch

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
other than that little little catch

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.749 
other than that little little catch
right<00:01:19.170> there

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.609 

now<00:01:24.759> that's<00:01:25.090> back<00:01:25.450> to<00:01:25.479> what<00:01:26.110> should<00:01:26.320> be<00:01:26.470> the

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
now that's back to what should be the

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.670 
now that's back to what should be the
run<00:01:26.890> position<00:01:29.430> makes<00:01:30.430> contact<00:01:31.000> a<00:01:31.560> little<00:01:32.560> bit

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
run position makes contact a little bit

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.960 
run position makes contact a little bit
of<00:01:32.740> a<00:01:32.830> loss<00:01:33.040> there<00:01:35.130> but<00:01:36.130> you<00:01:36.700> know<00:01:38.789> other<00:01:39.789> than

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
of a loss there but you know other than

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.430 
of a loss there but you know other than
that<00:01:40.180> little<00:01:40.299> gap<00:01:40.600> seems<00:01:40.960> to<00:01:41.080> sound<00:01:41.289> pretty

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
that little gap seems to sound pretty

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.820 
that little gap seems to sound pretty
good

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
good

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:50.520 
good
well<00:01:43.110> I'm<00:01:44.110> assuming<00:01:44.920> that<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.909> my<00:01:49.689> computer

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
well I'm assuming that the my computer

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.410 
well I'm assuming that the my computer
is<00:01:51.780> connected<00:01:52.780> to<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:54.549> ignition<00:01:54.970> line

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
is connected to the ignition line

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.850 
is connected to the ignition line
because<00:01:55.840> if<00:01:55.960> I<00:01:56.020> connect<00:01:56.350> this<00:01:56.530> to<00:01:56.740> the

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
because if I connect this to the

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.120 
because if I connect this to the
accessory<00:01:57.390> see<00:01:58.390> while<00:01:58.780> it's<00:01:58.929> running<00:01:59.200> while

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
accessory see while it's running while

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:01.770 
accessory see while it's running while
it's<00:02:00.310> in<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.580> run<00:02:00.940> position<00:02:00.970> or<00:02:01.539> the<00:02:01.630> on

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
it's in the run position or the on

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.139 
it's in the run position or the on
position<00:02:02.429> you<00:02:03.429> know<00:02:03.490> it's<00:02:03.610> there<00:02:03.819> but<00:02:03.970> when

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
position you know it's there but when

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.800 
position you know it's there but when
since<00:02:04.869> it's<00:02:05.049> the<00:02:05.140> accessory<00:02:06.539> since<00:02:07.539> it's<00:02:07.720> the

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
since it's the accessory since it's the

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:15.160 
since it's the accessory since it's the
accessory<00:02:08.350> when<00:02:08.560> you<00:02:08.619> turn<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:09.039> key<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.899> stops

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.740 

which<00:02:15.440> does<00:02:16.780> doesn't<00:02:17.780> do<00:02:17.870> anybody<00:02:18.170> any<00:02:18.560> good

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
which does doesn't do anybody any good

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.030 
which does doesn't do anybody any good
because<00:02:20.750> if<00:02:20.870> I<00:02:20.960> had<00:02:21.140> my<00:02:21.350> computer<00:02:21.680> plugged

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
because if I had my computer plugged

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.940 
because if I had my computer plugged
into<00:02:22.190> that<00:02:22.310> one<00:02:22.610> it<00:02:22.850> would<00:02:22.970> mean<00:02:23.150> that<00:02:23.950> the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
into that one it would mean that the

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.650 
into that one it would mean that the
computer<00:02:25.370> shut<00:02:25.580> off<00:02:25.700> every<00:02:26.000> time<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:26.210> hit<00:02:26.600> the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
computer shut off every time I hit the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.180 
computer shut off every time I hit the
starter<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.380> well<00:02:28.280> car<00:02:28.700> wouldn't<00:02:28.910> run<00:02:29.120> so

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
starter and well car wouldn't run so

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.110 
starter and well car wouldn't run so
there's<00:02:31.190> also<00:02:31.960> resistor<00:02:32.960> but<00:02:33.200> resistor<00:02:34.120> the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
there's also resistor but resistor the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:41.730 
there's also resistor but resistor the
are<00:02:35.450> terminal<00:02:37.600> resistor<00:02:38.680> also<00:02:39.680> only<00:02:40.010> works

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
are terminal resistor also only works

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.010 
are terminal resistor also only works
when<00:02:42.740> the<00:02:42.860> key<00:02:43.010> is<00:02:43.040> turned<00:02:45.580> so<00:02:46.580> we<00:02:46.730> go<00:02:46.940> back<00:02:47.600> to

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
when the key is turned so we go back to

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.350 
when the key is turned so we go back to
the<00:02:48.530> ignition<00:02:49.180> which<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:50.300> can<00:02:50.450> hear<00:02:50.600> there

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
the ignition which you can hear there

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.990 
the ignition which you can hear there
and<00:02:53.360> see<00:02:53.870> the<00:02:54.290> key<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:55.190> now<00:02:55.459> in<00:02:55.670> the<00:02:55.790> run

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
and see the key is now in the run

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.490 
and see the key is now in the run
position<00:02:56.239> it's<00:02:56.690> not<00:02:56.780> in<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:56.989> start<00:02:57.260> but<00:02:57.410> I'm

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
position it's not in the start but I'm

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:18.730 
position it's not in the start but I'm
going<00:02:57.650> to<00:02:57.709> turn<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.520> here

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:26.360 

you<00:03:19.740> can<00:03:19.920> just<00:03:20.160> hear<00:03:20.700> how<00:03:20.970> nasty<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:25.370> whatever

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
you can just hear how nasty and whatever

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.360 
you can just hear how nasty and whatever
the<00:03:26.640> contact<00:03:27.240> in<00:03:27.510> there<00:03:28.130> is<00:03:29.130> in<00:03:29.460> there<00:03:29.700> it's

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
the contact in there is in there it's

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:38.620 
the contact in there is in there it's
completely<00:03:32.370> just<00:03:33.440> trashed<00:03:34.490> so<00:03:36.470> hopefully

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
completely just trashed so hopefully

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.660 
completely just trashed so hopefully
this<00:03:39.630> will<00:03:39.840> fix<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.470> problem<00:03:40.500> this<00:03:41.490> will

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
this will fix the problem this will

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.400 
this will fix the problem this will
hopefully<00:03:41.880> this<00:03:42.210> will<00:03:42.330> fix<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.750> problems<00:03:43.230> I'm

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
hopefully this will fix the problems I'm

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:49.520 
hopefully this will fix the problems I'm
having<00:03:43.440> with<00:03:44.930> the<00:03:45.930> starter<00:03:48.200> clicking<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.380> not

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
having with the starter clicking and not

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.020 
having with the starter clicking and not
doing<00:03:49.770> anything<00:03:51.380> even<00:03:52.380> though<00:03:52.500> it's<00:03:52.680> the
