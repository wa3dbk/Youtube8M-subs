this<00:00:09.929> week<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.440> I<00:00:10.679> just<00:00:11.010> got<00:00:11.219> back<00:00:11.250> from<00:00:11.730> the

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.610 
this week and I just got back from the
grocery<00:00:12.269> store<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.809> instead<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.469> just

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
grocery store and instead of just

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.709 
grocery store and instead of just
putting<00:00:13.980> everything<00:00:14.309> away<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:15.089> thought<00:00:15.599> it

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
putting everything away I thought it

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.630 
putting everything away I thought it
would<00:00:15.809> make<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:16.109> video<00:00:16.379> over<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.580> time

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
would make a video over it and this time

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.130

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.349 
focused on getting variety because

make<00:01:38.280> some<00:01:38.490> more<00:01:38.579> recipe<00:01:38.970> videos<00:01:39.240> with<00:01:39.750> some

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
make some more recipe videos with some

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.420 
make some more recipe videos with some
different<00:01:40.470> ingredients<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:41.100> don't<00:01:41.280> usually

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
different ingredients you don't usually

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.690 
different ingredients you don't usually
see<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.750> picked<00:01:43.079> up<00:01:43.229> some<00:01:43.439> steak<00:01:43.920> maybe<00:01:44.579> I

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
see so I picked up some steak maybe I

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.819 
see so I picked up some steak maybe I
could<00:01:44.939> do<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.329> grilling<00:01:45.899> video<00:01:46.140> with<00:01:46.649> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
could do a grilling video with the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.830 
could do a grilling video with the
weather<00:01:47.040> nicer<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.210> macros<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.720> the

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
weather nicer and the macros on the

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.319 
weather nicer and the macros on the
steak<00:01:49.049> it's<00:01:49.500> really<00:01:49.829> not<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.009> bad<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:51.090> has

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
steak it's really not that bad it has

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.810 
steak it's really not that bad it has
obviously<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.200> little<00:01:52.530> bit<00:01:52.680> more<00:01:52.950> fat<00:01:53.250> but

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
obviously a little bit more fat but

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.139 
obviously a little bit more fat but
really<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:55.170> can<00:01:55.200> fit<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.740> into<00:01:56.040> your<00:01:56.670> macros

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
really you can fit that into your macros

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.270 
really you can fit that into your macros
so<00:01:57.689> easily<00:01:58.020> like<00:01:58.439> if<00:01:58.829> you<00:01:59.009> have<00:01:59.100> two

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
so easily like if you have two

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.130 
so easily like if you have two
tablespoons<00:01:59.640> of<00:02:00.090> peanut<00:02:00.329> butter<00:02:00.540> or<00:02:00.689> almond

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
tablespoons of peanut butter or almond

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.139 
tablespoons of peanut butter or almond
butter<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.380> day<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:02.219> don't<00:02:02.430> have<00:02:02.610> those<00:02:02.880> and

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
butter a day just don't have those and

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.660 
butter a day just don't have those and
you<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.570> enjoy<00:02:04.020> like<00:02:04.649> eight<00:02:04.890> ounces<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.310> steak

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
you can enjoy like eight ounces of steak

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.910 
you can enjoy like eight ounces of steak
and<00:02:05.969> it's<00:02:06.570> going<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.899> taste<00:02:07.079> really<00:02:07.350> good<00:02:07.740> in

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
and it's going to taste really good in

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.550 
and it's going to taste really good in
here<00:02:08.369> we've<00:02:08.879> got<00:02:09.090> some<00:02:09.420> tilapia<00:02:10.020> I<00:02:10.170> bought

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560

tilapia and frozen salmon and

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.860 
tilapia and frozen salmon and
nice<00:02:13.550> thing<00:02:13.760> about<00:02:13.790> this<00:02:14.150> is<00:02:14.420> since<00:02:14.690> it's

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
nice thing about this is since it's

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.740 
nice thing about this is since it's
frozen<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.620> can<00:02:16.160> just<00:02:16.310> put<00:02:16.520> this<00:02:16.730> into<00:02:17.330> my

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
frozen I can just put this into my

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.530 
frozen I can just put this into my
freezer<00:02:18.050> and<00:02:18.500> just<00:02:19.040> pull<00:02:19.250> one<00:02:19.490> out<00:02:19.520> if<00:02:19.910> I<00:02:20.270> run

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
freezer and just pull one out if I run

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.230 
freezer and just pull one out if I run
out<00:02:20.570> of<00:02:20.800> chicken<00:02:21.800> or<00:02:22.070> anything<00:02:22.430> else<00:02:22.760> it's

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
out of chicken or anything else it's

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.030 
out of chicken or anything else it's
just<00:02:23.360> always<00:02:23.750> there<00:02:24.140> ready<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.530> go<00:02:24.650> and

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
there's no rush to eat it because it's

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.140 
there's no rush to eat it because it's
frozen<00:02:27.500> so<00:02:27.830> that's<00:02:28.010> just<00:02:28.190> another<00:02:28.460> positive

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
frozen so that's just another positive

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.210

maybe I'll make a video on those as well
and<00:02:36.350> right<00:02:36.920> in<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.070> middle<00:02:37.100> I<00:02:37.490> picked<00:02:37.940> up<00:02:38.090> some

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
and right in the middle I picked up some

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.650 
and right in the middle I picked up some
turkey<00:02:38.900> at<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:39.860> deli<00:02:40.070> and<00:02:40.460> this<00:02:40.880> one<00:02:41.060> is<00:02:41.360> the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
turkey at the deli and this one is the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.050 
turkey at the deli and this one is the
lower<00:02:41.990> sodium<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:42.890> mean<00:02:43.280> there<00:02:43.460> was<00:02:43.550> like<00:02:43.700> 40

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
lower sodium I mean there was like 40

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.300 
lower sodium I mean there was like 40
choices<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:44.810> I<00:02:44.840> just<00:02:45.050> pointed<00:02:45.440> at<00:02:45.560> one<00:02:45.740> and<00:02:46.070> it

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
choices and I just pointed at one and it

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.580 
choices and I just pointed at one and it
happened<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.730> be<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.060> lower<00:02:47.240> sodium<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.960> little

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
happened to be the lower sodium a little

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.100 
happened to be the lower sodium a little
bit<00:02:48.740> more<00:02:49.010> expensive<00:02:49.550> but<00:02:49.940> again<00:02:50.180> this<00:02:50.780> is

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
bit more expensive but again this is

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.980 
bit more expensive but again this is
such<00:02:51.710> a<00:02:51.950> convenient<00:02:52.490> source<00:02:52.940> of<00:02:53.090> protein<00:02:53.750> like

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:53.990 
such a convenient source of protein like

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.320 
such a convenient source of protein like
if<00:02:54.260> I<00:02:54.620> wanted<00:02:54.920> to<00:02:55.190> just<00:02:55.610> take<00:02:55.730> some<00:02:56.000> of<00:02:56.030> this

just like really thinly sliced turkey I

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.840 
just like really thinly sliced turkey I
don't<00:03:30.500> know<00:03:30.560> how<00:03:30.680> well<00:03:30.860> you<00:03:31.040> guys<00:03:31.160> can<00:03:31.400> see<00:03:31.670> it

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
but I like turkey a lot and the nice

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.760 
but I like turkey a lot and the nice
thing<00:03:34.910> about<00:03:35.060> these<00:03:35.450> is<00:03:35.780> that<00:03:36.110> since<00:03:36.440> they<00:03:36.650> are

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:36.770 
thing about these is that since they are

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.910 
thing about these is that since they are
so<00:03:37.100> thin<00:03:37.550> they<00:03:38.090> will<00:03:38.270> cook<00:03:38.570> really<00:03:39.200> quickly<00:03:39.710> on

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
so thin they will cook really quickly on

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.190 
so thin they will cook really quickly on
