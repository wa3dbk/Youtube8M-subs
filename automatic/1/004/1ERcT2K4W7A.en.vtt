of<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.260> external<00:02:16.530> inputs<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:17.790> it's<00:02:18.540> kind<00:02:18.870> of

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
of the external inputs so it's kind of

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.930

like<00:02:19.170> good<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:19.920> bad<00:02:20.099> it's<00:02:20.340> good<00:02:20.550> because<00:02:20.849> you

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
like good and bad it's good because you

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.509 
like good and bad it's good because you
can<00:02:21.120> use<00:02:21.150> your<00:02:21.390> effects<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.319> so<00:02:22.440> on<00:02:22.620> in<00:02:23.370> the

deck<00:02:28.319> it's<00:02:28.920> bad<00:02:29.160> because<00:02:29.340> if<00:02:29.610> your<00:02:29.760> laptop

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
deck it's bad because if your laptop

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.610 
deck it's bad because if your laptop
goes<00:02:30.300> down<00:02:30.480> everything<00:02:30.930> goes<00:02:31.080> down<00:02:31.319> so<00:02:31.530> you

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
goes down everything goes down so you

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.740 
goes down everything goes down so you
can't<00:02:31.860> use<00:02:32.040> those<00:02:32.250> as<00:02:32.700> emergency<00:02:33.180> backups<00:02:34.160> so

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
can't use those as emergency backups so

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.259 
can't use those as emergency backups so
who's<00:02:36.750> this<00:02:37.019> gonna<00:02:37.170> be<00:02:37.380> appealing<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.310> because

who's this gonna be appealing to because

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.970 
who's this gonna be appealing to because

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
if it's build quality because it is a

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.740 
if it's build quality because it is a

really it's two and a half kilos it's a

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.860 
really it's two and a half kilos it's a

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
nice solid unit because of that because

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.660 
nice solid unit because of that because
of<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.260> fact<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.590> now<00:02:46.709> is<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.860> DC<00:02:47.099> sound<00:02:47.430> card

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670

it's<00:02:49.709> flexible<00:02:50.310> I<00:02:51.180> think<00:02:51.959> it's<00:02:52.079> going<00:02:52.230> to

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
it's flexible I think it's going to

the compromises have it being small a

the compromises have it being small a

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
really most shown in these areas now

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.059 
really most shown in these areas now
these<00:03:08.940> are<00:03:09.180> velocity-sensitive<00:03:09.959> pads<00:03:10.069> these

these are velocity-sensitive pads these

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.559 
these are velocity-sensitive pads these
which<00:03:11.610> means<00:03:11.849> they're<00:03:11.940> basically<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.329> harder

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
which means they're basically the harder

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.030 
which means they're basically the harder
you<00:03:12.660> push<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.110> harder<00:03:13.380> whatever<00:03:13.680> is<00:03:13.829> set

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
you push it the harder whatever is set

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.589 
you push it the harder whatever is set
to<00:03:14.190> will<00:03:14.310> happen<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:15.000> can<00:03:15.120> obviou<00:03:15.329> so<00:03:15.450> your

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
to will happen you can obviou so your

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.449 
to will happen you can obviou so your
samples<00:03:15.989> get<00:03:16.170> louder<00:03:16.410> when<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:17.310> hit<00:03:17.430> it

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
samples get louder when you hit it

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.920 
samples get louder when you hit it
harder<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.180> they're<00:03:18.299> quite<00:03:18.480> nice<00:03:18.690> for

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
harder so they're quite nice for

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.270 
harder so they're quite nice for
drumming<00:03:19.230> away<00:03:19.440> but<00:03:19.620> look<00:03:19.829> they're<00:03:20.010> quite

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
drumming away but look they're quite

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.710 
drumming away but look they're quite
hemmed<00:03:20.700> in<00:03:20.880> by<00:03:20.910> everything<00:03:21.359> that's<00:03:21.630> around

them<00:03:22.049> and<00:03:22.440> worse<00:03:22.680> than<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.010> there's<00:03:23.760> four

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
them and worse than that there's four

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.849 
them and worse than that there's four
things<00:03:24.389> on<00:03:24.690> them<00:03:24.870> which<00:03:24.989> this<00:03:25.139> mode<00:03:25.440> button

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
things on them which this mode button

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:26.930 
things on them which this mode button
sorts<00:03:26.190> out<00:03:26.310> for<00:03:26.609> you

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
sorts out for you

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.190 
sorts out for you
there<00:03:27.239> is<00:03:27.389> the<00:03:28.350> sampler<00:03:28.799> the<00:03:29.549> effects<00:03:30.200> cues

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
there is the sampler the effects cues

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.349 
there is the sampler the effects cues
and<00:03:31.560> loops<00:03:31.859> all<00:03:32.160> on<00:03:32.430> these<00:03:32.609> so<00:03:33.060> if<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.209> want

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
and loops all on these so if you want

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:34.970 
and loops all on these so if you want
loop<00:03:33.569> you<00:03:33.780> have<00:03:33.810> to<00:03:34.019> select<00:03:34.170> loop<00:03:34.470> mode<00:03:34.709> and

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
loop you have to select loop mode and

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.349 
loop you have to select loop mode and
then<00:03:35.069> you've<00:03:35.190> got<00:03:35.310> your<00:03:35.400> loops<00:03:35.609> if<00:03:35.850> you<00:03:36.180> want<00:03:36.299> a

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
then you've got your loops if you want a

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:37.729 
then you've got your loops if you want a
sampler<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:36.810> have<00:03:37.049> to<00:03:37.139> switch<00:03:37.319> your<00:03:37.440> sample

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
sampler you have to switch your sample

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.080 
sampler you have to switch your sample
mode<00:03:37.920> now<00:03:38.160> you<00:03:38.220> want<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.489> turn<00:03:38.609> the<00:03:38.730> loop<00:03:38.880> off

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
mode now you want to turn the loop off

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.210 
mode now you want to turn the loop off
you<00:03:39.180> need<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.359> go<00:03:39.450> back<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.690> loop<00:03:40.019> mode<00:03:40.200> so<00:03:41.100> it's

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
you need to go back to loop mode so it's

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.770 
you need to go back to loop mode so it's
quite<00:03:41.370> long-winded<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:42.180> know<00:03:42.389> what<00:03:42.510> the<00:03:42.600> kind

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
quite long-winded you know what the kind

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.599 
quite long-winded you know what the kind
of<00:03:42.840> DJ<00:03:43.109> it's<00:03:43.230> always<00:03:43.650> got<00:03:43.829> loops<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.430> samples

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
of DJ it's always got loops and samples

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:46.759 
of DJ it's always got loops and samples
and<00:03:45.090> effects<00:03:45.420> going<00:03:45.690> on<00:03:45.930> you're<00:03:46.410> not<00:03:46.560> going<00:03:46.709> to

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
and effects going on you're not going to

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.470 
and effects going on you're not going to
like<00:03:46.920> this<00:03:47.130> it's<00:03:47.340> too<00:03:47.549> much<00:03:47.790> squashed<00:03:48.180> into<00:03:48.359> a

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
like this it's too much squashed into a

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.300 
like this it's too much squashed into a
few<00:03:48.720> buttons<00:03:48.930> it's<00:03:49.440> more<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:49.859> icing<00:03:50.220> on<00:03:50.250> the

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
few buttons it's more the icing on the

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.009 
few buttons it's more the icing on the
cake<00:03:50.400> kind<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:50.910> stuff<00:03:51.120> but<00:03:51.720> if<00:03:51.810> you're<00:03:51.930> the
