00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
at the second app The Princess and the

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.789 
at the second app The Princess and the
Frog<00:03:00.280> um<00:03:01.239> this<00:03:02.079> is<00:03:02.230> one<00:03:02.379> of<00:03:02.440> my<00:03:02.500> daughter's

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.059 
favorite movie
so<00:03:04.329> of<00:03:04.720> course<00:03:04.959> is<00:03:05.170> something<00:03:05.379> I<00:03:05.530> wanted<00:03:05.829> right

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
so of course is something I wanted right

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.339 
so of course is something I wanted right
now<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:06.220> think<00:03:06.370> it's<00:03:06.700> half<00:03:07.150> off<00:03:07.420> for<00:03:08.109> 399<00:03:10.349> which

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
now I think it's half off for 399 which

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.599 
now I think it's half off for 399 which
is<00:03:11.530> a<00:03:11.560> really<00:03:11.739> good<00:03:11.890> deal<00:03:12.040> but<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.280> mean<00:03:12.459> I<00:03:12.549> think

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
is a really good deal but I mean I think

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:13.949 
is a really good deal but I mean I think
that's<00:03:12.819> the<00:03:13.060> price<00:03:13.239> they<00:03:13.390> pretty<00:03:13.599> much<00:03:13.780> should

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
that's the price they pretty much should

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.160 
that's the price they pretty much should
be<00:03:14.200> anyway<00:03:15.159> she's<00:03:15.819> she's<00:03:16.299> picking<00:03:16.659> options

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
be anyway she's she's picking options

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.309 
be anyway she's she's picking options
for<00:03:17.349> us<00:03:18.090> here<00:03:19.090> we<00:03:19.120> go<00:03:19.620> once<00:03:20.620> upon<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.069> time<00:03:21.430> and
