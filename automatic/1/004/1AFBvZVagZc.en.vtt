is you fill this little little port
right<00:03:35.930> here<00:03:35.959> up<00:03:36.590> with<00:03:36.829> water<00:03:37.099> and<00:03:37.690> then<00:03:38.690> you

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
right here up with water and then you

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:46.059 
right here up with water and then you
screw<00:03:39.139> that<00:03:39.260> back<00:03:39.470> up<00:03:39.680> like<00:03:39.859> that<00:03:42.519> and<00:03:45.069> there's

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
screw that back up like that and there's

articulation<00:04:35.919> articulation<00:04:36.919> I<00:04:37.070> only<00:04:37.310> give<00:04:37.520> it

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
articulation articulation I only give it

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.040 
articulation articulation I only give it
maybe<00:04:38.840> like<00:04:39.020> a<00:04:39.050> 5<00:04:39.409> maybe<00:04:40.130> even<00:04:40.490> a<00:04:40.550> 4

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:42.050 
maybe like a 5 maybe even a 4

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.779 
maybe like a 5 maybe even a 4
it's<00:04:42.169> uh<00:04:42.289> it's<00:04:43.069> pretty<00:04:43.250> sucky<00:04:43.580> on

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
it's uh it's pretty sucky on

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.350 
it's uh it's pretty sucky on
articulation<00:04:45.669> but<00:04:46.669> then<00:04:46.789> of<00:04:46.910> course<00:04:46.940> like<00:04:47.270> I

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
articulation but then of course like I

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.559 
articulation but then of course like I
said<00:04:47.389> the<00:04:47.660> gimmick<00:04:48.160> is<00:04:49.160> why<00:04:49.490> he<00:04:50.180> doesn't<00:04:50.479> have

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:50.569 
said the gimmick is why he doesn't have

00:04:50.569 --> 00:04:53.200 
said the gimmick is why he doesn't have
any<00:04:50.720> articulation<00:04:50.990> in<00:04:51.379> the<00:04:51.470> arms<00:04:52.210> detail

any articulation in the arms detail

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.689 
any articulation in the arms detail
isn't<00:04:54.050> too<00:04:54.199> bad<00:04:54.379> he<00:04:54.650> looks<00:04:54.860> like<00:04:55.009> he<00:04:55.099> does<00:04:55.340> and

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
isn't too bad he looks like he does and

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.600
