this this base guys was on my top 5 Town

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.060 
this this base guys was on my top 5 Town
Hall<00:04:27.060> level<00:04:27.090> 8<00:04:27.419> basis<00:04:27.900> I'm<00:04:28.440> actually<00:04:28.680> found

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
Hall level 8 basis I'm actually found

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
Hall level 8 basis I'm actually found
out<00:04:29.190> while<00:04:29.310> I<00:04:29.340> was<00:04:29.490> searching<00:04:29.639> in<00:04:29.940> matchmaking

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
out while I was searching in matchmaking

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.969 
out while I was searching in matchmaking
so<00:04:30.510> I<00:04:30.540> didn't<00:04:30.840> design<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.200> space<00:04:31.260> um<00:04:31.710> it's<00:04:31.890> a

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
so I didn't design the space um it's a

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:33.860 
so I didn't design the space um it's a
pretty<00:04:32.160> good<00:04:32.370> base<00:04:32.520> but<00:04:33.330> I<00:04:33.360> think<00:04:33.570> you<00:04:33.630> have<00:04:33.750> to

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
pretty good base but I think you have to

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.750 
pretty good base but I think you have to
have<00:04:33.900> your<00:04:34.169> defenses<00:04:34.919> upgraded<00:04:35.400> a<00:04:35.430> little<00:04:35.669> bit

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
have your defenses upgraded a little bit

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.310 
have your defenses upgraded a little bit
more<00:04:35.880> because<00:04:36.060> I<00:04:36.240> just<00:04:36.300> ripped<00:04:36.600> apart<00:04:36.780> as<00:04:37.169> soon

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
more because I just ripped apart as soon

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.750 
more because I just ripped apart as soon
as<00:04:37.440> I<00:04:37.530> took<00:04:37.590> out<00:04:37.860> that<00:04:38.010> first<00:04:38.280> day<00:04:38.400> of<00:04:38.520> Defense

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
as I took out that first day of Defense

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.880 
as I took out that first day of Defense
my<00:04:39.000> healers<00:04:39.360> could<00:04:39.600> just<00:04:39.780> pretty<00:04:40.500> much<00:04:40.650> run

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
my healers could just pretty much run

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.680 
my healers could just pretty much run
three<00:04:41.130> roam<00:04:41.760> free<00:04:42.000> throughout<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.450> rest<00:04:42.600> of

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
three roam free throughout the rest of

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.680 
three roam free throughout the rest of
the<00:04:42.780> base<00:04:42.960> so<00:04:43.710> I<00:04:44.070> don't<00:04:45.060> know<00:04:45.150> if<00:04:45.300> I<00:04:45.390> like<00:04:45.539> this

Santa<00:06:27.340> strike<00:06:27.460> but<00:06:27.700> eventually<00:06:27.940> you<00:06:28.210> won't<00:06:28.360> be

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:28.570 
Santa strike but eventually you won't be

much<00:06:32.140> get<00:06:32.410> destroyed<00:06:32.680> instantly<00:06:32.950> because<00:06:33.520> all

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.050 
much get destroyed instantly because all

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.660

that<00:06:35.050> has<00:06:35.230> to<00:06:35.380> happen<00:06:35.470> is<00:06:35.770> air<00:06:35.950> troops<00:06:36.220> go<00:06:36.430> over

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:36.670 
that has to happen is air troops go over

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.520 
that has to happen is air troops go over

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
strike like way up here in these trees

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:42.270 
strike like way up here in these trees
and<00:06:40.930> try<00:06:41.020> to<00:06:41.080> hide<00:06:41.350> it<00:06:41.380> but<00:06:41.560> i'm<00:06:41.890> pretty<00:06:42.040> sure

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:42.280
