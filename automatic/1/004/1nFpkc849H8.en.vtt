I do this brave section and that

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.630 
I do this brave section and that
distortion<00:01:53.190> is<00:01:53.310> working<00:01:53.700> really<00:01:54.060> nice<00:01:55.640> coming

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
distortion is working really nice coming

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.230 
distortion is working really nice coming
down<00:01:56.850> towards<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.570> ends<00:01:58.670> but<00:01:59.670> probably<00:02:00.000> this

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
down towards the ends but probably this

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.820 
down towards the ends but probably this
still<00:02:00.570> has<00:02:00.810> something<00:02:01.230> that<00:02:01.260> sticks<00:02:01.560> out<00:02:01.800> but

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
still has something that sticks out but

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.040 
still has something that sticks out but
so<00:02:04.830> much<00:02:05.010> now<00:02:05.580> tell<00:02:06.540> them<00:02:06.630> what's<00:02:06.810> going<00:02:06.900> to

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
so much now tell them what's going to

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.750 
so much now tell them what's going to
take<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.380> as<00:02:07.620> far<00:02:07.979> down<00:02:08.009> as<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.640> can<00:02:09.619> so<00:02:10.760> we're

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
take this as far down as I can so we're

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.280 
take this as far down as I can so we're
going<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:11.970> take<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.300> as<00:02:12.420> far<00:02:12.720> down<00:02:12.750> as<00:02:12.990> you<00:02:13.140> can

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
going to take it as far down as you can

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.230 
going to take it as far down as you can
the<00:02:13.890> further<00:02:14.160> down<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.430> go<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.730> more<00:02:15.090> you're

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240 
the further down you go the more you're

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:25.610 
the further down you go the more you're
going<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.450> have<00:02:15.510> clean<00:02:16.050> poke<00:02:16.260> out<00:02:16.730> but<00:02:24.260> okay<00:02:25.260> I

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
going to have clean poke out but okay I

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.210 
going to have clean poke out but okay I
think<00:02:26.190> that's<00:02:26.459> all<00:02:26.700> we're<00:02:26.820> going<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.000> get<00:02:28.220> now

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220
