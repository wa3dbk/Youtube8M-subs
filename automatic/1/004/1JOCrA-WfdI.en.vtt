00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
this land was more valuable than the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:39.710 
this land was more valuable than the
park<00:02:32.200> as<00:02:33.190> we<00:02:33.340> can<00:02:33.490> see<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:34.620> certainly<00:02:35.620> is

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.390 

it's<00:02:40.080> got<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.350> be<00:02:40.410> some<00:02:40.560> valuable<00:02:40.950> land<00:02:41.070> here

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.360 

more<00:02:46.700> valuable<00:02:46.909> as<00:02:47.420> a<00:02:47.590> temporary<00:02:48.590> parking<00:02:49.040> lot

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
more valuable as a temporary parking lot

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.420 
more valuable as a temporary parking lot
used<00:02:49.700> three<00:02:50.599> weeks<00:02:50.780> out<00:02:50.989> of<00:02:51.019> the<00:02:51.170> year<00:02:51.499> than<00:02:52.400> a

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
used three weeks out of the year than a

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:57.240 
used three weeks out of the year than a
park

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.440 

there's<00:02:57.820> some<00:02:58.060> forward-thinking

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.880 

maximising<00:03:04.450> some<00:03:04.630> shareholder<00:03:05.290> value<00:03:05.470> there

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
maximising some shareholder value there

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.280 
maximising some shareholder value there
yeah<00:03:06.190> there<00:03:06.550> it<00:03:06.670> is

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.589 

because<00:03:12.890> we<00:03:13.159> would<00:03:13.400> be<00:03:13.430> standing<00:03:14.000> right<00:03:14.209> about

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
because we would be standing right about

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:25.910 
because we would be standing right about
in<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.049> lagoon<00:03:15.379> right<00:03:15.650> now

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.920
