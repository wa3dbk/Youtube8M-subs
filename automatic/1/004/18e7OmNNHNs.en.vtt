 It doesn't matter booboo story, but then Nou Black Wing 9 Farre Parker 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:33.790

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:38.620
 p hr h but 1 gc 3 htc 03 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:40.100
 I really like it too, but I'm really just a very person who is all-Japan five-in-one from that full position 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.210
 But 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:47.480
 Kedomo I say to you put even I'd had terminal interest with a keyboard 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:51.859
 This that I think Chimachima also heard still corner Studio Sumo In terms of the United States 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:55.390
 Or rather it is also to do it, but support for easy to use is small Luo often in the wind 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.390
 Coincidentally this cares a little 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.730
 Though it is buber 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:17.810
 Oh my God here try to support it in the next update, which does not have the grunt 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:22.670
 I think some of you have a face 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.659
 We do not support at the time of publication now but support Japanese input of Zoya 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.670
 Application technology department 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:34.259
 There are team members and I would like to introduce how to use 5 schools ime in that. 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.890
 Target to live off one side to enter home on its dedicated application 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:42.630
 It has become a kind of form or rather used to paste in you want to use the application 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.650
 But what 's easy to use, so why not buy it now ? 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.840
 If it becomes an opportunity to boost 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.670
 think 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.020
 It is good to use immediately 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.000
 It is here 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:57.340
 If this starts 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:05.430
 If you tap here in Japanese, you will go into Japanese input but this is actually the setting 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:05.430
 Since it can be set such that this will be in Japanese input mode when it starts up, conversely 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:28.730

 Search Now You Can Search Now 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:41.970
 However, there is actually a more convenient way to think about search. 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.260
 I will change 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.260
 This is not 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.599
