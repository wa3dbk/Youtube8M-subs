00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.350
 Hello, but I will show you today 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:09.540
 determine which specifies no how much 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:13.260
 RAM can be set to 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.800
 laptop first thing we need to know 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.869
 how many connectors are there in our 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.900
 laptop under RAM for 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.850
 this we need to remove the cover usually this 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.920
 is under the covers I will seem on 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:33.510
 disassembled laptops if you are afraid 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.700
 flattery laptop look on the Internet for video 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.010
 disassembly and specifically see there already 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.770
 how many memory modules are there under 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.710
 operative how much memory slot then 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.309
 there is usually the bulk of laptops 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.640
 There is such an arrangement of two 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.610
 connectors for RAM that is 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.300
 here is the first connector here is the second connector under 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.910
 in this laptop this is acer here as far as 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.340
 I remember dr2 as much as possible 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.489
 8 GB that is, he will see 2 strips on 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.499
 4 gigabytes is the first option either 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.789
 take off the cover you immediately see how much 

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:13.619
 slots first location option 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:17.670
 memory modules 2 options 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:20.189
 location is such a plan then 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.039
 there are they are not located above each 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.229
 friend and in different directions here even 

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:28.649
 whether it is written ddr3 when you 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.479
 remove the memory will see this inscription that 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.789
 he immediately tells you what memory you can 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.169
 here install this laptop this 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:42.299
 as I remember some samsung 

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:45.239
 you can probably put in it 8 for sure 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:47.390
 will he see the 8 gig plan here 

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:50.690
 already have to try 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.229
 How can I find out that is, I would take 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.630
 model 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:02:00.130
 how would I look for it I would take a model 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:02.930
 laptop so he let samsung r530 and 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.610
 would score on the internet the first moment 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.740
 would look for what maximum configuration 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.050
 with how much memory were there 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.940
 configurations with a volume above 8 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.980
 Well, the second would look for on the forums 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.610
 I would ask the owners of the people who it is 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.610
 tried to do 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:26.720
 what is it here with us written by the way 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.989
 times since this model of this 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.890
 motherboard when it seems there are 700 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.440
 537 changes memory 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.600
 see the maximum order of the model asked 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.330
 maybe people might have already tried 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:43.130
 on the Internet is often found and 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:45.350
 the third option is not 3 let's say not 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:52.970
 the last third option that is here 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:57.190
 we are here about tarau that is, we see 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:00.650
 one memory slot and also visible 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.840
 memory modules that is specifically here on 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.019
 this laptop and on the other hand such 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.690
 same 4 memory modules in this laptop already 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.690
 installed 4 gigabytes of its memory and 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.329
 we can expand it further 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.000
 setting another memory in one of the slots 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:20.090
 more precisely in this slot in one slot in this 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.430
 laptop will be at the top eight 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.860
 under the laptop must see four 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.660
 Exactly, that is, eight eight is not a fact that 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.480
 sees that old enough system 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.060
 but why did it show us because 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:36.110
 but on many new laptops specific 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:41.060
 let's say my lenovo is kind of like 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:46.340
 ultrabooks he also has steamed 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:49.130
 but is there my one, but in general only one 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.739
 connector and no steamed memory so 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.569
 Here I was looking for a long time raised eight 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.109
 why not all 8 gigovuyu 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.549
 cans see and see only ddr3 memory 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:59.719
 with prefix l 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:04.459
 this is a memory with low 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:07.069
 power consumption and I am such a module 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.840
 I have not found memory yet, that is, how to buy 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.480
 I will put it to myself because what 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.280
 I bought but did not see everything I work on 4 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.479
 well all that is the principle how much we 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.579
 principle to find out how much memory can 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.349
 put the first look how much there is 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.960
 fleets 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:26.150
 12 either one plus steamed memory and 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.330
 We are looking for the maximum number of the Internet 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.750
 as memory which can support 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:35.449
 your laptop either on on model 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.550
 notebooks either on forums 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:40.280
 ask people look maybe that 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.660
 the question has already asked everything if the video 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.880
 turned out to be helpful. Like 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.880
