00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 an exercise of 640 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.049
 it's not bad let's see now this is the 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.709
 man who defends the first position 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.709
 of barcalá or pardon of anise speak thus 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.800
 a sad 666 with that note right now 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.400
 would be the second position would unseat 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.400
 Belarussian 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.090
 my powerful entry also from Russian 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.870
 he is so young 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.920
 by finalist at the Tokyo World Cup in 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.920
 the jump 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.970
 we also come back in 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.770
 I think he has fallen out in that 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.060
 market forward in the one of the feet and 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.780
 left it has seemed to me that he has stepped 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.780
 the red zone 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.899
 and makes a half pirouette double carp do 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.560
 forward it has not yet finished last 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:25.560
 diagonal now 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.650
 today 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.979
 precipitate precipitated in that last 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.979
 movement 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.369
 and the putting in the hand 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.369
 capif 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.550
 and that lack of control in the last 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.550
 It will not cost us instantly 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.119
 possibly the bronze medal started 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.119
 with a difficult exercise and without reservation 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.260
 here it rotates according to mortal faith with 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.260
 pirouette 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:31.290
 founded 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.750
 lit flash double marta with pirouette here 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.520
 it was just how tall they have been 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.490
 of onna at the end that has ended in 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.840
 half of the practicable 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.630
 this is the one that I think he has used 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.280
 a red zone but we'll see it 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.030
 once the penalty appears 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.760
 010 is that you have stepped on if not and here in the 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.060
 last diagonal 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.060
 justi simó 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:23.780
 710 the exercise has finally not been 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.480
 removed the completion so that it does not 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.450
 has fallen out but the execution what 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.150
 we have lost 2.3 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.599
 score 14 800 what opportunity has 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.599
 lost
