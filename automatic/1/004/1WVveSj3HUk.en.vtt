00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.469 
this is gonna help with any transfer ink
from<00:01:17.440> your<00:01:17.590> excess<00:01:17.950> bleed<00:01:18.280> area<00:01:18.700> so<00:01:19.180> that<00:01:19.210> it's

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:19.479 
from your excess bleed area so that it's

not getting soaked into your foam

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.039 
not getting soaked into your foam
because<00:01:21.310> then<00:01:21.670> when<00:01:21.850> you<00:01:21.940> go<00:01:22.060> to<00:01:22.119> press<00:01:22.450> again

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
because then when you go to press again

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
to press so always make sure foam

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:37.580 
to press so always make sure foam
underneath<00:01:32.400> grab<00:01:33.400> the<00:01:33.580> side<00:01:33.790> on<00:01:33.970> my<00:01:34.000> scarf

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
that you thoroughly sticky lint roll

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.190 
that you thoroughly sticky lint roll
your<00:01:44.290> fleece<00:01:44.680> because<00:01:45.310> fleece<00:01:45.820> is<00:01:46.360> a<00:01:46.420> material

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
your fleece because fleece is a material

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.399 
your fleece because fleece is a material
that<00:01:47.409> will<00:01:47.680> hold<00:01:48.009> lint<00:01:48.400> so<00:01:49.330> it's<00:01:49.540> very<00:01:49.840> easy<00:01:50.020> to

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:50.409 
that will hold lint so it's very easy to

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
so what we're gonna do next is grab a

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.870 
so what we're gonna do next is grab a
seed<00:01:56.530> to<00:01:56.590> protect<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.189> paper<00:01:57.460> for<00:01:58.060> our<00:01:58.240> top

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
seed to protect the paper for our top

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.230 
seed to protect the paper for our top
and<00:02:00.900> one<00:02:01.900> of<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.400> primary<00:02:03.400> reasons<00:02:04.030> why<00:02:04.119> we're

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
and one of the primary reasons why we're

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.730 
and one of the primary reasons why we're
going<00:02:04.360> to<00:02:04.420> pre-press<00:02:04.869> on<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.110> fleece<00:02:05.350> too<00:02:05.619> is

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
going to pre-press on the fleece too is

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:06.780 
going to pre-press on the fleece too is
if<00:02:05.890> there's<00:02:06.040> going<00:02:06.159> to<00:02:06.220> be<00:02:06.280> any<00:02:06.490> kind<00:02:06.670> of

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
if there's going to be any kind of

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.060 
if there's going to be any kind of
shrinking<00:02:07.270> with<00:02:07.420> this<00:02:07.570> material<00:02:07.780> a<00:02:08.410> quick

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
shrinking with this material a quick

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.430 
shrinking with this material a quick
five<00:02:09.399> ten-second<00:02:10.149> pre-press<00:02:10.570> will<00:02:10.810> help<00:02:11.079> get

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
five ten-second pre-press will help get

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.110 
five ten-second pre-press will help get
it<00:02:11.560> all<00:02:11.709> to<00:02:11.860> shape<00:02:12.130> and<00:02:12.700> then<00:02:12.790> we'll<00:02:12.910> be<00:02:13.030> able

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
it all to shape and then we'll be able

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.720 
it all to shape and then we'll be able
to<00:02:13.269> actually<00:02:13.480> apply<00:02:13.750> our<00:02:14.049> image<00:02:14.380> so<00:02:15.310> 400

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
to actually apply our image so 400
