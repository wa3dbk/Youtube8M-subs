00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.359
 the rule of art welcome 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.799
 the painting by Pablo Picasso who 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.750
 conventionally it is considered the start 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.030
 of cubism and les demoiselles d'avignon 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.340
 of 1907 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.710
 in reality it is not the work begun by 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.960
 cubism but certainly the painting from 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.449
 which starts a whole series of 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.550
 stylistic and formal researches that 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.949
 will then culminate in true Cubism e 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.720
 right at the demo of the line a cost 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.960
 a picasso a large amount of 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.149
 preparatory drawings of sketches studies 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.190
 and in this work they are condensed 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.070
 disparate elements from geometrization 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.680
 primitivism in reference to 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.040
 African masks to Catalan sculpture 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.579
 of the Middle Ages in a summary of 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.750
 very strong impact that cost Picasso 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.910
 misunderstanding and even embarrassment even 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.230
 a part of those who admired him and 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.910
 they supported him 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.860
 but this work constitutes precisely 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.969
 starting for a whole series of searches 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.609
 which then in the year 1908 will touch 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.409
 various fronts and above all they will be 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:09.049
 strongly influenced by the lesson 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.479
 geometrizing by paul cÃ©zanne and picasso 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:15.420
 now associated both georges braque ago 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.130
 own with great conviction 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.259
 the collaboration between these two artists 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.799
 extremely different from each other 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.090
 the discreet and reserved breeches 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.720
 the extrovert and overwhelming picasso 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.610
 however, it will be the real spark 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:32.790
 that will give birth to the search for Cubism 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.210
 analytical in 1909 we are now in full 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.740
 the pulverization of this season 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.110
 images in a myriad of 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.909
 actually disjointed details 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.250
 It may seem like a boutade is a game 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.000
 formal but in all this there is an element 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.030
 fundamental that is the will to insert 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.430
 in painting the dimension of time is 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.159
 that typical of music not by chance 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.320
 in Cubist paintings very often there are 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.240
 musical theme still life with 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.320
 violin guitars etc. 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.570
 what do you mean 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.750
 dimension of time in the sense that the 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.630
 time required for the subject to watch 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.900
 the object in succession from several 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.360
 points of view that are added together is 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.700
 so to speak of the assumptions in the same 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.010
 representation that therefore of these 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.709
 objects of these elements offers us 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.459
 various angles in a succession 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.720
 time that is condensed 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:30.240
 in the immediacy of the image 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.840
 pictorial in this direction however 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.900
 we went towards a sort of abstraction 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.190
 since the elements so 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.350
 disarticulated so overlapping the ones 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.470
 the others would have produced almost one 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.760
 difficulty in reading the image 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.010
 picasso and braque realize it and 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.470
 therefore they insert in the work for like this 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:54.150
 say the keys to reading the 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:57.000
 written until 1912 appears 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.000
 collage technique a technique that 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.130
 picasso invents and that constitutes the 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.380
 keystone for the passage to 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.390
 synthetic cubism in the kobe ism 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.570
 synthetic picasso and braque painting 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.700
 is obviously summarized in the 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.610
 sense that the elements decrease there 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:17.790
 they are less details and there is more 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.280
 concentration on a few elements not 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.579
 the assumptions of Cubism change 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.530
 but much more is done to painting 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:28.980
 essential the themes remain those 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.890
 colors gradually clear respect 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.200
 to very dark and ocher and dense tones e 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.570
 browns of analytic cubism in 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.940
 direction of a summary from 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.890
 which then will arise further 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.299
 adventure and why the history of cubism 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.299
 it's a long story
