00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
and so we knew it was going to be

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.729 
and so we knew it was going to be
difficult<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.970> I'm<00:03:23.970> proud<00:03:24.239> of<00:03:24.300> our<00:03:24.540> team<00:03:24.739> how

that that this year entailed and and

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.150 
that that this year entailed and and
obviously<00:03:31.170> we<00:03:31.320> fell<00:03:31.530> short<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.860> winning<00:03:31.980> a

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
difficult year and it just gets even

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.880 
difficult year and it just gets even
more<00:03:51.180> difficult<00:03:51.480> when<00:03:51.870> when<00:03:52.440> you<00:03:52.530> got<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.739> play

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
crossed paths a number of different

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.660 
crossed paths a number of different
times<00:04:03.690> as<00:04:03.989> assistant<00:04:04.500> coaches<00:04:04.920> and<00:04:05.160> people

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
times as assistant coaches and people

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.520 
times as assistant coaches and people

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
coach plenty o again if cross paths a

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.340 
coach plenty o again if cross paths a
few<00:04:11.430> different<00:04:11.610> times<00:04:11.910> before<00:04:12.320> really<00:04:13.320> I

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
few different times before really I

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.969 
few different times before really I
think<00:04:13.380> LSU<00:04:13.920> game<00:04:14.540> 14<00:04:15.540> years<00:04:15.930> ago<00:04:16.140> or<00:04:16.350> five<00:04:16.590> four

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
think LSU game 14 years ago or five four

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.120 
think LSU game 14 years ago or five four
years<00:04:17.190> ago<00:04:17.340> so

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
years ago so

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.710 
years ago so
they<00:04:19.130> beat<00:04:19.310> us<00:04:19.340> down<00:04:19.459> there<00:04:19.850> in<00:04:20.090> back<00:04:20.420> roads

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.610 
they beat us down there in back roads
and<00:04:21.019> of<00:04:21.950> course<00:04:22.160> be<00:04:22.310> too<00:04:22.370> simple<00:04:22.700> in<00:04:22.730> Colombia

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
and of course be too simple in Colombia

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.480 
and of course be too simple in Colombia
but<00:04:25.060> LSU<00:04:26.110> game<00:04:27.110> was<00:04:27.410> some<00:04:28.070> of<00:04:28.130> a<00:04:28.160> rainy<00:04:28.370> day
