this<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.290> how<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.860> drive<00:00:14.190> system<00:00:14.490> works

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
this and how to the drive system works

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.500 
this and how to the drive system works
on<00:00:15.059> these<00:00:15.240> things<00:00:17.000> basically<00:00:18.000> we'll<00:00:18.180> have<00:00:18.330> to

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
on these things basically we'll have to

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.160 
on these things basically we'll have to
just<00:00:19.039> you're<00:00:20.039> gonna<00:00:20.130> come<00:00:20.369> off<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.670> motor<00:00:21.170> do

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
just you're gonna come off the motor do

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.259 
just you're gonna come off the motor do
they<00:00:22.260> call<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.500> mandrel

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
they call that mandrel

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.540 
they call that mandrel
we<00:00:24.269> got<00:00:24.449> a<00:00:24.480> mandrel<00:00:25.080> pulley<00:00:25.470> put<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.250> put<00:00:26.519> a

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
we got a mandrel pulley put a put a

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.140 
we got a mandrel pulley put a put a
pulley

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
pulley

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.429 
pulley
yeah<00:00:27.330> it's<00:00:27.570> a<00:00:27.630> triple<00:00:27.990> pulley<00:00:28.250> and<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.340> belt

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
yeah it's a triple pulley and the belt

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:52.069 
yeah it's a triple pulley and the belt
it<00:00:31.439> comes<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.800> this<00:00:31.920> big<00:00:32.189> this<00:00:32.669> big<00:00:50.870> then<00:00:51.870> when

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
it comes to this big this big then when

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.430 
it comes to this big this big then when
this<00:00:52.170> thing<00:00:52.440> turns<00:00:56.780> actually<00:00:57.780> goes<00:00:57.960> down<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.379> a

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
this thing turns actually goes down to a

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:09.710 
this thing turns actually goes down to a
shaft<00:01:00.920> shaft<00:01:05.119> down<00:01:06.119> there<00:01:07.640> there<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:08.880> see

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
shaft shaft down there there it is see

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.770 
shaft shaft down there there it is see
you<00:01:09.810> jumping<00:01:10.140> around<00:01:11.270> it<00:01:12.270> goes<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.659> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
you jumping around it goes to the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.770 
you jumping around it goes to the
sprocket<00:01:13.880> from<00:01:14.880> on<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.240> end<00:01:15.330> of<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.509> shaft

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
sprocket from on the end of the shaft

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.179 
sprocket from on the end of the shaft
and<00:01:15.960> then<00:01:16.080> to<00:01:16.229> another<00:01:16.409> sprocket<00:01:16.950> with<00:01:17.159> a

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
and then to another sprocket with a

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.609 
and then to another sprocket with a
chain<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.810> then<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.080> goes<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.650> our<00:01:21.439> who's<00:01:22.439> that

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
chain and then it goes to our who's that

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.090 
chain and then it goes to our who's that
a<00:01:22.650> Chrysler<00:01:22.979> rear<00:01:23.450> 1949<00:01:24.450> priceless<00:01:25.100> 1949

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
a Chrysler rear 1949 priceless 1949

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.880 
a Chrysler rear 1949 priceless 1949
Chrysler<00:01:26.670> we're<00:01:26.939> shortened<00:01:27.689> so<00:01:28.560> basically

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
Chrysler we're shortened so basically

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.060 
Chrysler we're shortened so basically
there's<00:01:29.189> a<00:01:29.220> there's<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:30.060> big<00:01:30.090> sprocket<00:01:30.570> on<00:01:31.140> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
there's a there's a big sprocket on the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.340 
there's a there's a big sprocket on the
front<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.810> just<00:01:33.810> goes<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.079> a<00:01:34.200> little

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
front of that just goes to a little

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:43.220 
front of that just goes to a little
sprocket

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:43.230 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.490 

to<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.860> front<00:01:44.010> of<00:01:44.130> our<00:01:44.190> engine<00:01:44.550> and<00:01:45.500> what's

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
to the front of our engine and what's

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.080 
to the front of our engine and what's
unique<00:01:46.800> about<00:01:46.920> these<00:01:47.220> is<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.820> way<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
unique about these is the way the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.820 
unique about these is the way the
reverse<00:01:48.390> works<00:01:49.100> if<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.220> see<00:01:50.400> that<00:01:50.520> big<00:01:50.760> rubber

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.300 

rubber<00:01:55.830> pulley<00:01:56.220> there<00:01:57.230> you<00:01:58.230> see<00:01:58.470> this<00:01:58.590> outside

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
rubber pulley there you see this outside

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.970 
rubber pulley there you see this outside
here<00:01:59.670> basically<00:02:00.180> all<00:02:00.390> closed<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.800> put

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
here basically all closed this you put

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.900 
here basically all closed this you put
it<00:02:02.010> reverse<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.020> touch<00:02:04.520> in<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.640> middle

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
it reverse the to touch in the middle

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:13.900 
it reverse the to touch in the middle
there<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.410> that's<00:02:07.410> how<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.620> get<00:02:07.770> reverse<00:02:12.530> so

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
there and that's how you get reverse so

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.150 
there and that's how you get reverse so
efficient<00:02:14.910> very<00:02:15.740> basically<00:02:16.740> that's<00:02:16.950> how<00:02:17.070> it

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
efficient very basically that's how it

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.710 
efficient very basically that's how it
works

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
works

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.290 
works
hope<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.870> enjoyed<00:02:19.170> it
