00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
gives us a D flat major chord we're just

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.530 
gives us a D flat major chord we're just
going<00:01:56.590> to<00:01:56.620> move<00:01:56.770> two<00:01:56.920> notes<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.340> get<00:01:57.460> to<00:01:57.580> our<00:01:57.730> G

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
going to move two notes to get to our G

okay that's really the whole
introduction<00:02:10.929> that's<00:02:11.350> that<00:02:11.710> material<00:02:12.220> right

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
introduction that's that material right

introduction that's that material right
there<00:02:12.490> is<00:02:12.610> really<00:02:12.640> just<00:02:12.850> that<00:02:13.120> motion<00:02:13.330> to

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
there is really just that motion to

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.020 
there is really just that motion to
three<00:02:14.890> one<00:02:15.490> two<00:02:16.030> three<00:02:16.390> one<00:02:16.930> two<00:02:17.650> three<00:02:18.030> you'll

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
three one two three one two three you'll

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.860 
three one two three one two three you'll
notice<00:02:19.330> each<00:02:19.740> set<00:02:20.740> of<00:02:20.950> chords<00:02:21.340> gets

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
notice each set of chords gets

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.930 
notice each set of chords gets
technically<00:02:22.870> six<00:02:23.170> counts<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:23.740> like<00:02:24.640> to<00:02:24.760> think

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
technically six counts I like to think

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.150 
technically six counts I like to think
of<00:02:25.000> it<00:02:25.120> in<00:02:25.209> two<00:02:25.360> sets<00:02:25.600> of<00:02:25.720> three<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.200> one<00:02:26.620> two

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
of it in two sets of three so one two

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.410 
of it in two sets of three so one two
three<00:02:27.700> one<00:02:28.270> two<00:02:28.510> three<00:02:29.020> one<00:02:29.680> two<00:02:29.980> three<00:02:30.490> one

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
three one two three one two three one

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.080 
three one two three one two three one
two<00:02:31.870> three<00:02:33.150> so<00:02:34.150> six<00:02:34.330> counts<00:02:34.780> for<00:02:34.930> each<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.880> D

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
two three so six counts for each the D

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.449 
two three so six counts for each the D
flat<00:02:37.390> and<00:02:37.570> the<00:02:37.690> G<00:02:37.870> flat<00:02:38.080> over<00:02:38.320> D<00:02:38.470> flat<00:02:38.709> okay

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
flat and the G flat over D flat okay

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.060 
flat and the G flat over D flat okay
that's<00:02:40.090> our<00:02:40.239> intro<00:02:40.600> our<00:02:40.780> interlude<00:02:41.530> and<00:02:41.770> our

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
the last lesson our verse starts on an E

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.860 
the last lesson our verse starts on an E
flat<00:02:50.080> minor<00:02:50.530> chord

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.530 

-<00:02:54.870> seven<00:02:55.170> I<00:02:55.260> should<00:02:55.410> say<00:02:55.970> so<00:02:56.970> a<00:02:57.000> flat<00:02:57.330> on<00:02:57.450> the

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
- seven I should say so a flat on the

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.790 
- seven I should say so a flat on the
bottom<00:02:57.660> G<00:02:58.410> flat<00:02:58.650> B<00:02:58.920> flat<00:02:58.950> D<00:02:59.430> flat<00:02:59.459> on<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.879> top

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
bottom G flat B flat D flat on the top

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.030 
bottom G flat B flat D flat on the top
to<00:03:01.800> get<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.040> our<00:03:02.129> next<00:03:02.340> chord<00:03:03.470> which<00:03:04.470> is<00:03:04.530> G<00:03:04.830> flat

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
to get to our next chord which is G flat

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.500 
to get to our next chord which is G flat
we're<00:03:05.220> just<00:03:05.370> moving<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.700> root<00:03:05.879> up<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.300> a<00:03:06.330> G

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
we're just moving the root up to a G

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.430 
we're just moving the root up to a G
flat<00:03:06.720> rest<00:03:07.560> stays<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:07.920> same<00:03:09.050> our<00:03:10.050> next<00:03:10.260> chord

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
flat rest stays the same our next chord

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.979 
flat rest stays the same our next chord
is<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.650> D<00:03:10.830> flat<00:03:11.450> we're<00:03:12.450> gonna<00:03:12.599> leave<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.810> top

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
is a D flat we're gonna leave the top

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.350 
is a D flat we're gonna leave the top
note<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.319> same<00:03:13.760> these<00:03:14.760> are<00:03:14.910> going<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.060> go<00:03:15.180> down

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
note the same these are going to go down

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.210 
note the same these are going to go down
to<00:03:15.630> F<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.050> a<00:03:16.140> flat<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.739> roots<00:03:16.920> going<00:03:17.069> to<00:03:17.160> go

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
to F and a flat the roots going to go

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.220 
to F and a flat the roots going to go
down<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.489> D<00:03:17.640> flat<00:03:18.170> so<00:03:19.170> it's<00:03:19.290> a<00:03:19.349> D<00:03:19.470> flat<00:03:19.680> major

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
down to D flat so it's a D flat major

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.990 
down to D flat so it's a D flat major
our<00:03:22.230> next<00:03:22.440> chord<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.680> a<00:03:22.769> B<00:03:22.980> flat<00:03:23.250> minor<00:03:23.459> seven

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
our next chord is a B flat minor seven

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.520 
our next chord is a B flat minor seven
so<00:03:24.450> this<00:03:24.569> will<00:03:24.750> stay<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:25.049> same

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
so this will stay the same

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.100 
so this will stay the same
the<00:03:26.489> root<00:03:26.730> changes<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.360> gives<00:03:27.540> us<00:03:27.660> a<00:03:27.780> B<00:03:27.959> flat

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
the root changes that gives us a B flat

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.920 
the root changes that gives us a B flat
minor<00:03:28.349> seven<00:03:29.630> we're<00:03:30.630> going<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.810> take

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
minor seven we're going to take

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.170 
minor seven we're going to take
everything<00:03:31.140> down<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.530> step<00:03:32.239> to<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:33.269> flat

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
everything down a step to a flat

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.229 
everything down a step to a flat
okay<00:03:36.290> that's<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.560> whole<00:03:37.680> verse<00:03:37.920> that<00:03:38.819> repeats

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
okay that's the whole verse that repeats

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.809 
okay that's the whole verse that repeats
a<00:03:39.329> number<00:03:39.569> of<00:03:39.659> times<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.200> that<00:03:40.230> gives<00:03:40.439> us<00:03:40.819> the

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
a number of times and that gives us the

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.270 
a number of times and that gives us the
entire<00:03:42.060> verse<00:03:42.299> so<00:03:42.540> let's<00:03:43.079> look<00:03:43.230> at<00:03:43.379> it<00:03:43.409> slowly

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
entire verse so let's look at it slowly

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.619 
entire verse so let's look at it slowly
and<00:03:44.459> I'll<00:03:44.549> count<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.819> rhythms<00:03:45.120> out<00:03:45.269> this<00:03:45.420> time

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
and I'll count the rhythms out this time

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.420 
and I'll count the rhythms out this time
so<00:03:45.810> you<00:03:45.840> can<00:03:46.019> understand<00:03:46.439> how<00:03:46.650> many<00:03:47.189> count

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
so you can understand how many count

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.059 
so you can understand how many count
counts<00:03:48.000> each<00:03:48.090> chord<00:03:48.359> gets<00:03:48.569> so<00:03:48.890> start<00:03:49.890> with<00:03:49.980> our

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
counts each chord gets so start with our

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:54.910 
counts each chord gets so start with our
E<00:03:50.189> flat<00:03:50.219> minor<00:03:50.549> seven<00:03:51.000> one<00:03:51.629> two<00:03:51.980> -<00:03:52.980> here<00:03:53.700> we<00:03:54.359> go

so<00:04:33.570> we're<00:04:33.750> playing

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.390 

this<00:04:37.290> set<00:04:37.560> of<00:04:37.680> chords<00:04:38.180> let's<00:04:39.180> see<00:04:39.330> 1<00:04:39.840> 2<00:04:39.870> 3<00:04:40.710> 4

this set of chords let's see 1 2 3 4

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.190 
this set of chords let's see 1 2 3 4
times<00:04:41.610> I<00:04:41.910> believe<00:04:41.970> before<00:04:42.450> we<00:04:42.720> get<00:04:42.840> to<00:04:43.050> the

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
times I believe before we get to the

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.070 
times I believe before we get to the
chorus<00:04:44.390> practice<00:04:45.390> those<00:04:45.630> chord<00:04:45.930> transitions

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
chorus practice those chord transitions

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.510 
chorus practice those chord transitions
that's<00:04:46.710> really<00:04:47.010> all<00:04:47.130> there<00:04:47.280> is<00:04:47.310> to<00:04:47.430> this<00:04:47.760> verse

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
that's really all there is to this verse

the other notable thing is that there is

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:55.430 
the other notable thing is that there is
some<00:04:52.830> filler<00:04:53.750> accompaniment<00:04:54.750> happening<00:04:55.260> in

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
some filler accompaniment happening in

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:02.420 
some filler accompaniment happening in
between<00:04:56.240> chords<00:04:57.860> specifically<00:04:58.860> 2<00:04:59.700> 2<00:05:00.360> 1<00:05:01.050> 2<00:05:01.410> 3

between chords specifically 2 2 1 2 3

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.490 
between chords specifically 2 2 1 2 3
usually<00:05:02.940> on<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.150> final<00:05:03.540> three<00:05:03.780> beats<00:05:04.020> there

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
usually on the final three beats there

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.160 
usually on the final three beats there
there<00:05:04.860> might<00:05:05.070> be<00:05:05.100> some<00:05:05.460> ad-lib<00:05:05.970> if<00:05:06.810> you<00:05:06.930> listen
