realistic<00:01:31.139> but<00:01:31.649> I<00:01:31.889> prefer<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.969> a<00:01:32.999> 14s<00:01:33.659> over

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
realistic but I prefer to a 14s over

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.109 
realistic but I prefer to a 14s over
this<00:01:33.990> but<00:01:34.289> that's<00:01:34.529> just<00:01:34.649> my<00:01:34.829> opinion<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.880> this

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
this but that's just my opinion and this

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.459 
this but that's just my opinion and this
works<00:01:36.389> with<00:01:36.539> pretty<00:01:36.689> much<00:01:36.840> everyone<00:01:37.139> like<00:01:37.380> I

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:37.469 
works with pretty much everyone like I

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:39.589 
works with pretty much everyone like I
said<00:01:37.770> also<00:01:38.399> works<00:01:38.849> with<00:01:38.969> drift<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.359> like<00:01:39.509> I

00:01:39.589 --> 00:01:39.599 
said also works with drift is like I

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.690 
said also works with drift is like I
said<00:01:39.810> -<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.289> watched<00:01:40.829> Lilly<00:01:41.130> right<00:01:41.399> here<00:01:41.549> while

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
said - I watched Lilly right here while

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.300 
said - I watched Lilly right here while
she's<00:01:41.849> right<00:01:42.029> foot<00:01:42.299> swing<00:01:42.689> forward<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:43.439> some

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
she's right foot swing forward and some

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.370 
she's right foot swing forward and some
players<00:01:44.520> have<00:01:44.849> a<00:01:45.029> slower<00:01:45.389> swing<00:01:45.779> of<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.139> feed

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
players have a slower swing of the feed

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.139 
players have a slower swing of the feed
and<00:01:46.619> some<00:01:46.889> player<00:01:47.099> have<00:01:47.249> a<00:01:47.279> faster<00:01:47.729> swing<00:01:47.969> of

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
and some player have a faster swing of

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.659 
and some player have a faster swing of
the<00:01:48.270> feed<00:01:48.560> obviously<00:01:49.560> depends<00:01:50.009> on<00:01:50.039> their<00:01:50.399> form

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:50.669 
the feed obviously depends on their form

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:52.309 
the feed obviously depends on their form
so<00:01:50.999> you<00:01:51.090> might<00:01:51.239> have<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.389> time<00:01:51.689> it<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:52.020> that

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
so you might have to time it like that

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:54.409 
so you might have to time it like that
instead<00:01:52.739> but<00:01:53.549> this<00:01:53.700> worked<00:01:53.909> pretty<00:01:53.969> well<00:01:54.299> with

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:54.419 
instead but this worked pretty well with

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:56.269 
instead but this worked pretty well with
most<00:01:54.599> players<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.380> works<00:01:55.679> well<00:01:56.009> with

00:01:56.269 --> 00:01:56.279 
most players so it works well with

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:57.529 
most players so it works well with
LeBron<00:01:56.759> Carmelo

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.539
