he's<00:01:17.130> actually<00:01:17.340> broken<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:18.900> are<00:01:19.020> the

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.510 
he's actually broken so and so are the
other<00:01:19.200> two<00:01:19.290> but<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:19.680> very<00:01:19.799> manageable<00:01:20.220> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
other two but it's very manageable the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.469 
other two but it's very manageable the
roof<00:01:21.210> just<00:01:21.540> pops<00:01:21.869> right<00:01:22.020> off<00:01:22.430> so<00:01:23.430> that's<00:01:24.299> how

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
roof just pops right off so that's how

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.399 
roof just pops right off so that's how
it's<00:01:24.630> broken<00:01:24.750> but<00:01:24.930> it's<00:01:25.080> not<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> big<00:01:25.380> deal

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
it's broken but it's not a big deal

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.760 
it's broken but it's not a big deal
because<00:01:25.710> I<00:01:25.920> could<00:01:26.070> still<00:01:26.310> enjoy<00:01:26.450> both<00:01:27.770> both

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770

the<00:03:20.740> transformation<00:03:21.340> I<00:03:21.400> think<00:03:21.580> that's<00:03:21.730> kind

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
the transformation I think that's kind

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.720 
the transformation I think that's kind
of<00:03:22.000> neat<00:03:22.150> and<00:03:22.510> he's<00:03:22.870> got<00:03:23.050> a<00:03:23.080> peg<00:03:23.380> that<00:03:24.310> goes

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
of neat and he's got a peg that goes

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.030 
of neat and he's got a peg that goes
into<00:03:24.910> that<00:03:25.000> pay<00:03:25.360> that<00:03:25.780> whole<00:03:26.440> pig<00:03:26.650> right<00:03:26.830> there

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
into that pay that whole pig right there

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.860 
into that pay that whole pig right there
and<00:03:27.310> springing<00:03:27.700> anyway<00:03:28.510> pull<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.530> arms<00:03:29.770> out

he<00:03:36.910> could<00:03:37.210> fit<00:03:37.450> his<00:03:37.480> dick<00:03:37.900> I<00:03:38.080> mean<00:03:38.230> his

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
he could fit his dick I mean his

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:41.850 
he could fit his dick I mean his
gun<00:03:39.010> and<00:03:39.340> it<00:03:39.880> goes<00:03:40.540> into<00:03:40.810> the<00:03:41.140> shoulder<00:03:41.620> peg

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
gun and it goes into the shoulder peg

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.160 
gun and it goes into the shoulder peg
right<00:03:42.130> there<00:03:42.370> so<00:03:42.550> there's<00:03:42.730> a<00:03:42.790> peg<00:03:43.120> that<00:03:43.930> sits

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
right there so there's a peg that sits

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.420 
right there so there's a peg that sits
on<00:03:44.260> top<00:03:44.320> of<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.860> shoulder<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:47.130> you<00:03:48.130> pull<00:03:48.340> that

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
on top of the shoulder and you pull that

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.330 
on top of the shoulder and you pull that
out<00:03:48.490> right<00:03:48.730> there<00:03:49.500> so<00:03:50.500> that's<00:03:50.890> kind<00:03:51.160> of<00:03:51.250> how

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
out right there so that's kind of how

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.430 
out right there so that's kind of how
they<00:03:51.490> lock<00:03:51.670> into<00:03:51.820> place<00:03:52.060> like<00:03:52.330> that<00:03:52.360> I<00:03:52.840> always

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
they lock into place like that I always

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.260 
they lock into place like that I always
thought<00:03:53.650> that<00:03:53.709> was<00:03:53.920> really<00:03:54.100> neat<00:03:54.340> and<00:03:54.550> then<00:03:54.640> it

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.270 
thought that was really neat and then it

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.480 
thought that was really neat and then it
just<00:03:55.420> flips<00:03:55.930> up<00:03:56.170> you<00:03:56.680> gotta<00:03:56.920> pull<00:03:57.190> it<00:03:57.220> out<00:03:57.459> and

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.490 
just flips up you gotta pull it out and

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.660 
just flips up you gotta pull it out and
then<00:03:57.790> flip<00:03:58.450> it<00:03:58.570> up<00:03:58.950> like<00:03:59.950> that<00:03:59.980> same<00:04:00.520> thing

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
then flip it up like that same thing

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.760 
then flip it up like that same thing
with<00:04:00.790> this<00:04:00.910> side<00:04:01.380> make<00:04:02.380> sure<00:04:02.410> it's<00:04:02.650> facing

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
with this side make sure it's facing

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.180 
with this side make sure it's facing
forward<00:04:03.340> and<00:04:03.520> flip<00:04:04.270> that<00:04:04.450> up<00:04:04.860> this<00:04:05.860> chrome

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
forward and flip that up this chrome

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.070 
forward and flip that up this chrome
piece<00:04:06.910> folds<00:04:07.630> down<00:04:07.690> and<00:04:08.490> then<00:04:10.020> these<00:04:11.020> two

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
piece folds down and then these two

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.560 
piece folds down and then these two
hinges<00:04:11.860> it<00:04:12.040> kind<00:04:12.250> of<00:04:12.340> swings<00:04:12.820> back<00:04:13.209> and<00:04:13.480> then

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:13.570 
hinges it kind of swings back and then

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:17.280 
hinges it kind of swings back and then
down<00:04:13.810> again<00:04:13.870> kind<00:04:14.410> of<00:04:14.440> like<00:04:14.590> an<00:04:14.830> S<00:04:16.020> so<00:04:17.020> that's

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.290 
down again kind of like an S so that's

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.260 
down again kind of like an S so that's
that's<00:04:18.130> basically<00:04:18.609> it<00:04:18.700> now<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:18.970> head<00:04:19.150> will

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:19.270 
that's basically it now the head will

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.750 
that's basically it now the head will
not<00:04:19.419> stand<00:04:19.840> straight<00:04:20.260> up<00:04:20.290> unless<00:04:20.590> I<00:04:20.950> have<00:04:21.310> his

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
not stand straight up unless I have his

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.640 
not stand straight up unless I have his
shoulder<00:04:22.090> cannon<00:04:22.300> locked<00:04:22.750> in<00:04:22.930> wish<00:04:23.380> I<00:04:23.500> get

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
shoulder cannon locked in wish I get

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.300 
shoulder cannon locked in wish I get
these<00:04:23.770> tires<00:04:24.100> facing<00:04:24.729> backward

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
these tires facing backward

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.310 
these tires facing backward
but<00:04:25.610> I<00:04:25.820> can't<00:04:26.090> so<00:04:26.330> that<00:04:26.419> they're<00:04:26.720> you<00:04:27.260> know

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
but I can't so that they're you know

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.840 
but I can't so that they're you know
behind<00:04:27.710> him<00:04:27.830> instead<00:04:28.070> of<00:04:28.130> laying<00:04:28.370> across<00:04:28.580> the

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
behind him instead of laying across the

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.340 
behind him instead of laying across the
top<00:04:29.060> but<00:04:29.330> oh<00:04:29.480> well<00:04:29.750> not<00:04:30.139> a<00:04:30.169> big<00:04:30.560> deal<00:04:30.970> I<00:04:32.230> got<00:04:33.230> to

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
top but oh well not a big deal I got to

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.080 
top but oh well not a big deal I got to
spin<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:33.680> wrist<00:04:33.919> around<00:04:34.370> right<00:04:34.550> here<00:04:34.580> and

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
spin the wrist around right here and

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.210 
spin the wrist around right here and
then<00:04:35.810> I<00:04:35.900> don't<00:04:36.050> like<00:04:36.200> seeing<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.620> screws<00:04:36.980> on

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
then I don't like seeing the screws on

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.970 
then I don't like seeing the screws on
the<00:04:37.300> on<00:04:38.300> the<00:04:38.360> facing<00:04:38.810> part<00:04:39.080> so<00:04:39.290> I<00:04:39.320> spin<00:04:39.770> that

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:39.980 
the on the facing part so I spin that

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.190 
the on the facing part so I spin that
all<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:40.430> way<00:04:40.520> around<00:04:40.639> then<00:04:41.630> turn<00:04:41.930> the<00:04:42.020> fist

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
all the way around then turn the fist

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.430 
all the way around then turn the fist
around<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:43.520> get<00:04:43.639> on<00:04:43.730> that<00:04:43.880> side<00:04:44.090> like<00:04:44.330> that<00:04:44.540> so

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
around and get on that side like that so

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.379 
around and get on that side like that so
that's<00:04:45.560> pretty<00:04:46.010> much<00:04:46.130> him<00:04:46.520> his<00:04:46.910> weapons<00:04:47.240> right

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
that's pretty much him his weapons right

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:51.010 
that's pretty much him his weapons right
here<00:04:47.570> is<00:04:47.690> this<00:04:47.900> shoulder<00:04:48.290> cannon<00:04:50.020> shoulder

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
here is this shoulder cannon shoulder

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.980 
here is this shoulder cannon shoulder
cans<00:04:51.260> very<00:04:51.500> cool<00:04:51.740> it's<00:04:52.370> God<00:04:52.970> I<00:04:53.330> believe<00:04:53.870> he's

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
cans very cool it's God I believe he's

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.450 
cans very cool it's God I believe he's
supposed<00:04:54.230> to<00:04:54.290> come<00:04:54.440> with<00:04:54.590> three<00:04:54.830> missiles<00:04:55.190> I

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
supposed to come with three missiles I

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.990 
supposed to come with three missiles I
only<00:04:56.120> have<00:04:56.300> one<00:04:56.540> missile<00:04:56.870> and<00:04:57.860> it<00:04:58.070> you<00:04:58.880> know

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
only have one missile and it you know

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.370 
only have one missile and it you know
it's<00:04:59.120> spring-loaded<00:04:59.419> but<00:04:59.780> mine's<00:04:59.960> broken

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
it's spring-loaded but mine's broken

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.290 
it's spring-loaded but mine's broken
doesn't<00:05:01.070> really<00:05:01.130> work<00:05:01.250> even<00:05:01.820> though<00:05:01.910> I<00:05:01.940> pull

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
doesn't really work even though I pull

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.760 
doesn't really work even though I pull
this<00:05:02.419> and<00:05:02.600> it<00:05:02.660> does<00:05:02.870> come<00:05:03.080> out<00:05:03.110> but<00:05:03.380> it<00:05:03.530> kind<00:05:03.710> of

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
this and it does come out but it kind of

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.500 
this and it does come out but it kind of
you<00:05:04.010> could<00:05:04.130> see<00:05:04.310> how<00:05:04.430> you<00:05:04.940> know<00:05:05.030> how<00:05:05.180> far<00:05:05.419> it

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
you could see how you know how far it

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.480 
you could see how you know how far it
goes<00:05:05.660> it<00:05:05.840> just<00:05:05.870> kind<00:05:06.169> of<00:05:06.200> falls<00:05:06.380> outward<00:05:07.220> and

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
goes it just kind of falls outward and

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.430 
goes it just kind of falls outward and
it<00:05:07.940> won't<00:05:08.090> lock<00:05:08.330> in<00:05:08.630> which<00:05:09.080> is<00:05:09.200> disappointing

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
it won't lock in which is disappointing

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.800 
it won't lock in which is disappointing
but<00:05:10.010> not<00:05:10.520> a<00:05:10.550> big<00:05:10.760> deal<00:05:10.910> I<00:05:11.150> guess<00:05:11.360> if<00:05:11.479> I<00:05:11.600> wanted

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
but not a big deal I guess if I wanted

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.180 
but not a big deal I guess if I wanted
to<00:05:11.870> superglue<00:05:12.290> it<00:05:12.470> but<00:05:12.650> like<00:05:12.770> I<00:05:12.889> said<00:05:12.979> I<00:05:13.100> don't

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
to superglue it but like I said I don't

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:14.530 
to superglue it but like I said I don't
like<00:05:13.340> putting<00:05:13.490> super<00:05:13.880> glue<00:05:14.000> to<00:05:14.120> the<00:05:14.180> g1

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
like putting super glue to the g1

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.390 
like putting super glue to the g1
figures<00:05:14.900> so<00:05:15.139> it<00:05:15.710> sticks<00:05:15.919> out<00:05:16.040> a<00:05:16.100> little<00:05:16.160> bit

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
figures so it sticks out a little bit

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.409 
figures so it sticks out a little bit
like<00:05:16.550> that<00:05:16.700> not<00:05:17.060> too<00:05:17.210> bad<00:05:17.419> and<00:05:17.690> these<00:05:18.169> um<00:05:18.560> and

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
like that not too bad and these um and

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.390 
like that not too bad and these um and
it's<00:05:20.419> got<00:05:20.570> nice<00:05:20.990> chrome<00:05:21.560> on<00:05:21.800> the<00:05:21.889> back<00:05:22.070> looks

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
it's got nice chrome on the back looks
