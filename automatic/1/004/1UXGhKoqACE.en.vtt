pretty<00:00:50.250> simple<00:00:50.700> with<00:00:50.789> this<00:00:50.879> then<00:00:51.090> definitely

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
pretty simple with this then definitely

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.209 
pretty simple with this then definitely
has<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> nice<00:00:51.660> packaging<00:00:52.140> it's<00:00:52.649> going<00:00:52.860> with<00:00:53.039> a

the<00:00:55.500> colors<00:00:55.829> with<00:00:55.980> this<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.879> first<00:00:57.090> thing<00:00:57.239> we

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
the colors with this the first thing we

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.299 
the colors with this the first thing we
have<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.780> controller<00:00:58.140> itself<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.800> then

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
have is the controller itself and then

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.889 
have is the controller itself and then
all<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.699> accessories<00:01:00.090> will<00:01:00.329> be<00:01:00.420> underneath

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
all the accessories will be underneath

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.450 
all the accessories will be underneath
so<00:01:01.079> I'll<00:01:01.170> go<00:01:01.260> ahead<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.710> cut<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.949> plastic<00:01:02.340> for

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
so I'll go ahead and cut the plastic for

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.280 
so I'll go ahead and cut the plastic for
that<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.879> then<00:01:03.210> see<00:01:03.449> what<00:01:03.600> else<00:01:03.780> is<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
that and then see what else is in the

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.260 
that and then see what else is in the
packaging<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> first<00:01:05.820> thing<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.150> we

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
packaging so the first thing that we

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.090 
packaging so the first thing that we
have<00:01:06.479> inside<00:01:06.990> would<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.500> be<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.710> little<00:01:07.979> bit

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
have inside would just be a little bit

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.160 
have inside would just be a little bit
of<00:01:08.280> instructions<00:01:09.060> we<00:01:09.570> have<00:01:09.689> an<00:01:09.780> exception
