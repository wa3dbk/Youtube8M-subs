this is where Lion would ward right here
and<00:01:18.740> this<00:01:18.830> would<00:01:19.010> allow<00:01:19.250> him<00:01:19.280> to<00:01:19.490> counter<00:01:20.090> word

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
and this would allow him to counter word

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.080 
and this would allow him to counter word
without<00:01:20.390> blocking<00:01:20.750> his<00:01:21.020> own<00:01:21.110> creep<00:01:21.409> camp

in the third way in this area is to
simply<00:01:37.549> put<00:01:37.729> it<00:01:37.850> inside<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.270> tree<00:01:38.540> line<00:01:38.570> and

simply put it inside the tree line and

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.800 
simply put it inside the tree line and
there<00:01:40.430> really<00:01:40.549> is<00:01:40.820> no<00:01:41.030> advantage<00:01:41.210> to<00:01:41.540> this

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810

look<00:01:43.520> you<00:01:44.240> know<00:01:44.360> a<00:01:44.570> little<00:01:44.810> bit<00:01:44.960> harder<00:01:45.409> for<00:01:45.650> it

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
look you know a little bit harder for it

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.280 
look you know a little bit harder for it
additionally<00:01:47.000> since<00:01:47.420> you<00:01:47.630> can't<00:01:47.869> actually

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
additionally since you can't actually

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.649 
additionally since you can't actually
hide<00:01:48.710> it<00:01:48.920> with<00:01:49.040> in<00:01:49.190> the<00:01:49.310> trees<00:01:49.549> very<00:01:49.820> well<00:01:50.060> you

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
hide it with in the trees very well you

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.240 
hide it with in the trees very well you
can<00:01:50.869> just<00:01:50.900> kind<00:01:51.290> of<00:01:51.380> hide<00:01:51.590> it<00:01:51.770> against<00:01:52.159> the
