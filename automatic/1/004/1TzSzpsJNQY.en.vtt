also bought the super saturated lip
gloss<00:04:08.709> which<00:04:09.010> is<00:04:09.250> like<00:04:09.459> the<00:04:09.489> same<00:04:09.880> format<00:04:10.390> as

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
gloss which is like the same format as

the<00:04:11.910> concealer<00:04:12.910> is<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.390> same<00:04:13.630> concept<00:04:14.290> so<00:04:14.950> i

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 
the concealer is the same concept so i

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.330 
the concealer is the same concept so i
think<00:04:15.849> that<00:04:16.510> i<00:04:16.690> will<00:04:16.750> be<00:04:16.959> purchasing<00:04:17.500> more<00:04:18.010> of

place is when I applied it and that's

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.670 
place is when I applied it and that's

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
what I want the color didn't turn to

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.510 
what I want the color didn't turn to
dock<00:05:18.919> it<00:05:19.220> turned<00:05:19.669> to<00:05:20.090> as<00:05:20.419> I<00:05:20.960> be<00:05:21.229> the<00:05:21.379> same<00:05:21.620> skin

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 
dock it turned to as I be the same skin

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.350 
dock it turned to as I be the same skin
color<00:05:22.550> is<00:05:26.050> foundation<00:05:27.050> in<00:05:27.919> conclusion<00:05:28.789> I

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 
color is foundation in conclusion I

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.740 
color is foundation in conclusion I
picked<00:05:30.289> twenty-eight<00:05:31.190> dollars<00:05:31.430> for<00:05:31.940> this<00:05:32.120> una

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.230 
picked twenty-eight dollars for this una
I<00:05:33.080> think<00:05:33.710> that<00:05:33.949> it<00:05:34.159> will<00:05:34.310> last<00:05:34.580> really<00:05:35.060> long

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
I think that it will last really long

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.520 
I think that it will last really long
because<00:05:36.229> the<00:05:36.440> product<00:05:37.030> goes<00:05:38.030> all<00:05:38.690> the<00:05:38.750> way<00:05:39.229> up

here I would give this 3.8 starts over 5

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.469 
here I would give this 3.8 starts over 5
