00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
at how to lab effectively on defense as

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.749 
at how to lab effectively on defense as
you<00:00:24.349> know<00:00:24.470> defense<00:00:24.949> is<00:00:25.130> a<00:00:25.159> little<00:00:25.519> bit<00:00:25.640> tougher

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:25.759 
you know defense is a little bit tougher

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.800 
you know defense is a little bit tougher
this<00:00:26.060> year<00:00:26.119> to<00:00:26.480> generate<00:00:27.019> a<00:00:27.199> good<00:00:27.560> pass<00:00:27.919> rush

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
this year to generate a good pass rush

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.300 
this year to generate a good pass rush
mainly<00:00:29.810> that<00:00:29.839> many<00:00:30.589> of<00:00:30.710> the<00:00:30.769> blitzes<00:00:31.159> that

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
mainly that many of the blitzes that

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.400 
mainly that many of the blitzes that
worked<00:00:31.519> in<00:00:31.669> years<00:00:31.819> passes<00:00:32.360> passed<00:00:32.780> just<00:00:33.230> do

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
worked in years passes passed just do

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.590 
worked in years passes passed just do
not<00:00:33.530> work<00:00:33.770> the<00:00:33.949> same<00:00:34.129> this<00:00:34.309> year<00:00:34.449> there<00:00:35.449> is<00:00:35.570> a

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
not work the same this year there is a

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.720 
not work the same this year there is a
workaround<00:00:35.960> but<00:00:36.410> it<00:00:36.949> involves<00:00:37.280> a<00:00:37.340> little<00:00:37.489> bit

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
workaround but it involves a little bit

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.400 
workaround but it involves a little bit
more<00:00:37.879> work<00:00:38.090> than<00:00:38.329> simply<00:00:38.629> just<00:00:38.809> rebooting<00:00:39.320> a

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
more work than simply just rebooting a

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.139 
more work than simply just rebooting a
guy<00:00:39.559> here<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:40.280> placing<00:00:40.670> them<00:00:40.699> in<00:00:40.879> a<00:00:40.910> gap

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
guy here and placing them in a gap

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.380

go into the replays on plays that do not
work<00:01:25.700> that<00:01:25.970> are<00:01:26.240> specific<00:01:26.659> blitzes<00:01:27.020> with<00:01:27.170> the

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
work that are specific blitzes with the

he<00:02:54.840> doesn't<00:02:54.989> come<00:02:55.290> through<00:02:55.970> so<00:02:56.970> let's<00:02:57.750> try

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
he doesn't come through so let's try

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.130 
he doesn't come through so let's try
something<00:02:58.200> else<00:02:59.060> we<00:03:00.060> r<00:03:00.300> e<00:03:00.510> blitz<00:03:00.750> these<00:03:00.959> guys

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
something else we r e blitz these guys

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.810 
something else we r e blitz these guys
last<00:03:01.470> time<00:03:01.650> how<00:03:01.920> about<00:03:02.070> we<00:03:02.100> add<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.370> blitz<00:03:02.700> are

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
last time how about we add a blitz are

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.759 
last time how about we add a blitz are
in<00:03:02.940> right<00:03:03.570> here<00:03:05.000> when<00:03:06.000> we<00:03:06.090> run<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.360> play<00:03:06.769> we

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
in right here when we run the play we

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.590 
in right here when we run the play we
see<00:03:07.920> some<00:03:08.100> potential<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:09.360> middle

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
see some potential that middle

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.490 
see some potential that middle
linebacker<00:03:10.019> comes<00:03:10.650> through<00:03:11.040> but<00:03:12.500> alignment

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
linebacker comes through but alignment

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.500 
linebacker comes through but alignment
is<00:03:13.590> still<00:03:13.890> able<00:03:14.070> to<00:03:14.340> slide<00:03:14.640> over<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.209> pick<00:03:15.360> him

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
is still able to slide over and pick him

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.960 
is still able to slide over and pick him
up<00:03:15.630> so<00:03:16.110> we<00:03:16.530> need<00:03:16.709> to<00:03:16.860> watch<00:03:17.070> and<00:03:17.310> see<00:03:17.430> who<00:03:17.730> it<00:03:17.880> is

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
up so we need to watch and see who it is

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.449 
up so we need to watch and see who it is
that<00:03:18.180> is<00:03:18.209> able<00:03:18.450> to<00:03:18.600> do<00:03:18.720> that<00:03:18.870> as<00:03:19.160> we<00:03:20.160> can<00:03:20.310> see

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
that is able to do that as we can see

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.420 
that is able to do that as we can see
it's<00:03:20.910> a<00:03:21.030> left<00:03:21.239> guard<00:03:21.450> this<00:03:21.690> time<00:03:22.010> so<00:03:23.010> what<00:03:23.310> can

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
it's a left guard this time so what can

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.220 
it's a left guard this time so what can
we<00:03:23.489> do<00:03:23.760> we<00:03:24.030> need<00:03:24.150> to<00:03:24.209> do<00:03:24.420> something<00:03:24.450> on<00:03:25.049> that

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
we do we need to do something on that

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.560 
we do we need to do something on that
side<00:03:25.560> of<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.709> line<00:03:26.010> to<00:03:26.430> deter<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.390> player

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
side of the line to deter that player

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.080 
side of the line to deter that player
from<00:03:27.810> sliding<00:03:28.019> over<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.850> answer<00:03:29.850> is<00:03:30.030> very

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
from sliding over the answer is very

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.270 
from sliding over the answer is very
simple<00:03:30.299> you<00:03:30.750> have<00:03:31.380> him<00:03:31.680> dropping<00:03:31.950> into<00:03:32.190> the

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
simple you have him dropping into the

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.870 
simple you have him dropping into the
middle<00:03:32.519> of<00:03:32.580> the<00:03:32.640> field<00:03:32.790> on<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.209> on<00:03:33.390> a<00:03:34.610> hook<00:03:35.610> zone

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
middle of the field on it on a hook zone

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.120 
middle of the field on it on a hook zone
assignment<00:03:36.570> maybe<00:03:37.560> we<00:03:37.680> can<00:03:37.799> haven't<00:03:38.040> dropped

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
assignment maybe we can haven't dropped

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.130 
assignment maybe we can haven't dropped
to<00:03:38.280> the<00:03:38.370> middle<00:03:38.580> of<00:03:38.670> field<00:03:38.790> on<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.000> spy<00:03:39.299> spies

occupy the defensive or offensive line

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.050 
occupy the defensive or offensive line
rather<00:03:42.360> and<00:03:42.690> allow<00:03:43.680> guys<00:03:43.920> to<00:03:43.950> come<00:03:44.640> free<00:03:44.940> in

rather and allow guys to come free in

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.490 
rather and allow guys to come free in
other<00:03:45.209> areas<00:03:45.510> of<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.720> field<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:46.140> let's<00:03:46.350> see<00:03:46.440> if

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:46.500 
other areas of the field so let's see if

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.170 
other areas of the field so let's see if
we<00:03:46.620> can<00:03:46.739> occupy<00:03:46.980> that<00:03:47.130> left<00:03:47.519> side<00:03:47.760> of<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.000> line

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
we can occupy that left side of the line

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.940 
we can occupy that left side of the line
now<00:03:48.420> allowing<00:03:48.840> pause<00:03:49.200> less<00:03:49.470> need<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.769> come

now allowing pause less need to come

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.699 
now allowing pause less need to come
through<00:03:50.190> and<00:03:50.810> what<00:03:51.810> do<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:51.930> know<00:03:52.049> it<00:03:52.320> does

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
through and what do you know it does

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.130 
through and what do you know it does
come<00:03:52.980> through<00:03:54.260> so<00:03:55.260> we<00:03:55.470> went<00:03:55.620> from<00:03:55.709> this<00:03:56.459> play

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
come through so we went from this play

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.860 
come through so we went from this play
to<00:03:58.140> basically<00:04:00.110> this<00:04:01.110> play<00:04:01.440> and<00:04:02.510> we<00:04:03.510> were<00:04:03.690> able

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
to basically this play and we were able

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.930 
to basically this play and we were able
to<00:04:04.049> generate<00:04:04.890> puzzle<00:04:05.370> as<00:04:05.459> need<00:04:05.670> to<00:04:05.760> come

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
to generate puzzle as need to come

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.509 
to generate puzzle as need to come
through<00:04:06.180> this<00:04:06.330> right<00:04:06.600> B<00:04:06.810> gap<00:04:07.049> untouched<00:04:07.860> for<00:04:08.489> a

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
through this right B gap untouched for a

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:09.620 
through this right B gap untouched for a
sack

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
sack

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.780 
sack
now<00:04:10.730> what<00:04:11.870> we<00:04:12.870> can<00:04:13.380> also<00:04:13.590> do<00:04:13.980> if<00:04:14.250> we<00:04:14.610> want<00:04:14.760> to

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
now what we can also do if we want to

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.310 
now what we can also do if we want to
get<00:04:14.880> a<00:04:14.940> little<00:04:15.180> bit<00:04:15.300> more<00:04:15.540> advanced<00:04:15.990> with<00:04:16.230> the

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
get a little bit more advanced with the

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.790 
get a little bit more advanced with the
play<00:04:16.530> is<00:04:16.830> to<00:04:17.870> take<00:04:18.870> a<00:04:18.930> look<00:04:19.200> and<00:04:19.440> see<00:04:19.500> where

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:19.800 
play is to take a look and see where

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.850 
play is to take a look and see where
this<00:04:19.890> defense<00:04:20.310> has<00:04:20.489> weaknesses<00:04:21.650> we<00:04:22.650> see<00:04:22.830> that

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
this defense has weaknesses we see that

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.440 
this defense has weaknesses we see that
the<00:04:23.100> centre<00:04:23.430> wants<00:04:23.460> to<00:04:23.820> really<00:04:24.000> pick<00:04:24.150> up<00:04:24.300> that

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
the centre wants to really pick up that

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.470 
the centre wants to really pick up that
will<00:04:24.780> linebacker<00:04:25.550> left<00:04:26.550> tackle<00:04:26.820> can't<00:04:27.270> slide

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
will linebacker left tackle can't slide

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.820 
will linebacker left tackle can't slide
over<00:04:27.660> because<00:04:27.840> he's<00:04:27.990> staring<00:04:28.350> at<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.590> spies

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
over because he's staring at the spies

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.980 
over because he's staring at the spies
is<00:04:29.310> the<00:04:29.790> Mike<00:04:29.970> linebacker<00:04:30.000> comes<00:04:30.690> through<00:04:30.900> the

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
is the Mike linebacker comes through the

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.710 
is the Mike linebacker comes through the
right<00:04:31.140> B<00:04:31.320> gap<00:04:31.700> but<00:04:32.700> you<00:04:32.970> can<00:04:33.120> see<00:04:33.330> that<00:04:33.360> this

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
right B gap but you can see that this

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.180 
right B gap but you can see that this
area<00:04:33.960> of<00:04:34.080> the<00:04:34.110> field<00:04:34.320> where<00:04:34.590> the<00:04:34.650> tight<00:04:34.860> end<00:04:35.040> is

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
area of the field where the tight end is

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.220 
area of the field where the tight end is
playing<00:04:35.460> is<00:04:35.790> is<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.090> little<00:04:36.600> bit<00:04:36.720> more<00:04:36.870> open

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
playing is is a little bit more open

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:39.740 
playing is is a little bit more open
than<00:04:37.320> you'd<00:04:37.500> like<00:04:37.790> sure<00:04:38.790> that<00:04:39.000> spy<00:04:39.210> drops<00:04:39.570> into

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
than you'd like sure that spy drops into

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.640 
than you'd like sure that spy drops into
the<00:04:39.870> area<00:04:40.080> where<00:04:40.230> the<00:04:40.320> drag<00:04:40.560> is<00:04:40.770> coming<00:04:41.130> but

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
the area where the drag is coming but

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.050 
the area where the drag is coming but
you<00:04:43.650> need<00:04:43.830> someone<00:04:44.190> in<00:04:44.280> that<00:04:44.430> that<00:04:44.820> right

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
you need someone in that that right

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.220 
you need someone in that that right
seemed<00:04:45.390> so<00:04:45.690> what<00:04:46.170> we<00:04:46.290> can<00:04:46.470> do<00:04:46.650> is<00:04:47.930> set<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:48.960> play

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
seemed so what we can do is set the play

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:53.600 
seemed so what we can do is set the play
the<00:04:49.440> same<00:04:49.680> way<00:04:49.920> and<00:04:51.890> control<00:04:52.890> Clint<00:04:53.250> session

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
the same way and control Clint session

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.510 
the same way and control Clint session
the<00:04:54.150> weak<00:04:54.870> side<00:04:55.020> linebacker<00:04:55.080> and<00:04:55.770> all<00:04:56.400> we're

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520 
the weak side linebacker and all we're

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.770 
the weak side linebacker and all we're
going<00:04:56.610> to<00:04:56.670> do<00:04:56.820> is<00:04:56.940> let<00:04:57.090> him<00:04:57.270> take<00:04:57.480> a<00:04:57.510> couple

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
going to do is let him take a couple

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.660 
going to do is let him take a couple
steps<00:04:57.960> towards<00:04:58.440> that<00:04:58.590> Center<00:04:58.860> and<00:04:59.040> then<00:04:59.340> just

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
steps towards that Center and then just

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:01.400 
steps towards that Center and then just
carry<00:04:59.970> him<00:05:00.150> on<00:05:00.300> over<00:05:00.630> to<00:05:00.720> the<00:05:00.810> right<00:05:00.990> side<00:05:01.260> of

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
carry him on over to the right side of

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.800 
carry him on over to the right side of
the<00:05:01.500> screen<00:05:01.890> and<00:05:02.250> hopefully<00:05:02.910> we'll<00:05:03.150> able<00:05:03.690> to

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
the screen and hopefully we'll able to

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.920 
the screen and hopefully we'll able to
add<00:05:04.080> to<00:05:04.920> the<00:05:05.010> coverage<00:05:05.310> in<00:05:05.370> this<00:05:05.490> play<00:05:05.930> so

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
add to the coverage in this play so

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.350

exactly as I said we drop him over to
the<00:05:09.450> right<00:05:09.600> seemed<00:05:10.220> his<00:05:11.220> blitz<00:05:11.550> assignment

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
the right seemed his blitz assignment

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.330 
the right seemed his blitz assignment
occupies<00:05:12.480> the<00:05:12.660> center<00:05:12.930> like<00:05:13.920> I<00:05:14.010> said<00:05:14.070> this<00:05:14.280> is

and we're able to get the heat on the
quarterback<00:05:25.610> so<00:05:26.610> something<00:05:27.030> as<00:05:27.150> simple<00:05:27.360> as

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
quarterback so something as simple as

the original apply to this and then

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:35.840 
the original apply to this and then
simply<00:05:34.650> spine<00:05:34.950> this<00:05:35.220> player<00:05:35.460> on<00:05:35.610> the<00:05:35.730> field

simply spine this player on the field

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.090 
simply spine this player on the field
can<00:05:36.300> make<00:05:36.690> a<00:05:36.720> play<00:05:36.960> that<00:05:37.110> doesn't<00:05:37.530> look<00:05:37.920> like

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
can make a play that doesn't look like

can make a play that doesn't look like
it<00:05:38.250> works<00:05:38.400> to<00:05:38.550> the<00:05:38.640> naked<00:05:38.790> eye<00:05:39.000> something<00:05:39.330> that

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
it works to the naked eye something that

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.820 
it works to the naked eye something that
you<00:05:40.710> would<00:05:40.860> deem<00:05:41.480> unusable<00:05:42.530> into<00:05:43.530> something

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
you would deem unusable into something

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.670 
you would deem unusable into something
that<00:05:43.980> you<00:05:44.070> can<00:05:44.280> actually<00:05:44.520> use
