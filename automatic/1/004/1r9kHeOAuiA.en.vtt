your<00:02:26.270> skidding<00:02:27.020> go<00:02:27.200> kind<00:02:27.680> of<00:02:27.709> a<00:02:27.800> plane<00:02:28.010> as<00:02:28.160> it

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
your skidding go kind of a plane as it

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
nice very cool I like it I like it I

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.030 
nice very cool I like it I like it I
think<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:44.600> should<00:02:44.780> make<00:02:44.930> it<00:02:44.959> a<00:02:45.170> warm<00:02:45.620> motor

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
think you should make it a warm motor

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.350 
think you should make it a warm motor
two<00:02:46.519> on<00:02:46.670> each<00:02:46.819> wings

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
two on each wings

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.090 
two on each wings
oh<00:02:47.390> yeah<00:02:47.870> that<00:02:48.739> would<00:02:49.069> be<00:02:49.220> four<00:02:49.880> motors<00:02:51.100> yeah

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
oh yeah that would be four motors yeah

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.160 
oh yeah that would be four motors yeah
one<00:02:52.430> underneath<00:02:52.819> and<00:02:53.180> then<00:02:53.300> a<00:02:53.330> gas<00:02:53.630> motor<00:02:53.989> in

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
one underneath and then a gas motor in

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:02.590 
one underneath and then a gas motor in
the<00:02:54.230> back<00:03:00.940> controllers<00:03:01.940> are<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.150> little<00:03:02.330> worn

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
the back controllers are a little worn

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.410 
the back controllers are a little worn
and<00:03:03.430> I<00:03:04.430> think<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:04.700> might<00:03:04.880> like<00:03:04.910> motors<00:03:05.330> are

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
and I think you might like motors are
