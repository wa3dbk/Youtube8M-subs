00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.080
 so everyone and welcome to one 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.030
 small episode about europe's shoulder 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.260
 was desired 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:14.490
 That's why I'm doing this now 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.100
 we have a little velvet frighten soy 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.670
 not so small anymore 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.020
 probably still a little before the 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.080
 decision so before they grow up 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.080
 is 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.070
 then we really want here times 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.140
 something about attitudes nationally so 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.670
 I would recommend a terrarium about 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.739
 so 30 30 30 in the minimum is better about 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.100
 40 in height 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:48.450
 I use 1 45 cube so 45 of the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.890
 46 yes, as a ground can be great 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.250
 use this coco substrate 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.430
 I want to still use this 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.219
 Moisture-retaining granules here and 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:05.220
 then that just will not stay that way 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.930
 could buy in bricks or insects 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.270
 you do not care what you want 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.110
 but you can also use walter or 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:19.320
 potting whether patience is doing now 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:21.890
 no big difference yes then than 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.259
 I always use that feed here 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.590
 you can also try lilac or 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.329
 liguster use 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.909
 i'm preparing for winter now like that 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.920
 I tried the set in 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.710
 water that gets the roots and then 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.689
 into some earth that I'm about to embed 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.320
 a small plant in the room in the winter 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:48.060
 we have nothing on the scale 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.750
 to the leaves you can see the game but 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.750
 you can see that well 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.580
 yes, that's pretty good then that 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.260
 raising the eggs 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:05.070
 You can either do that here on the 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.729
 Simply leave the substrate in the terrarium 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:13.710
 or you can take her out too and 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:17.700
 then in a box with 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.820
 kitchen paper or klopapier ich 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.930
 I do not care 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:27.720
 should just stay moist then 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:31.340
 spray it twice in the 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.790
 week I should say rich enough 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.530
 i'm doing this in my curator 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.650
 Incubator at the moment I'm still with 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.580
 the hot water bottle already you can do that 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.160
 also easy at room temperature 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.840
 leave 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.050
 room temperature is actually suitable 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.270
 all right takes a bit longer so 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:56.640
 Six months around with the heat bottle 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:03:00.570
 then at 25 degrees it goes 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.440
 only about four months yes that is 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.690
 actually so good 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.709
 they take the food I've tried 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.750
 already said and yes the eggs let them 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.690
 So just drop the can on her 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:21.959
 collect 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:24.510
 they are black and about 6 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:27.470
 millimeters long and about three millimeters 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.470
 thick 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.959
 I do not have any infants yet 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.660
 had 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:38.150
 I have only one modul the female and 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.140
 this animal here 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.380
 whether that's a male or a female 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.580
 I do not know exactly now but me 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.580
 would rather say a female 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.170
 he does not necessarily need male for 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.120
 addiction should not be longer than three 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.860
 generations partners in chinese 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.450
 so breed young generation 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.890
 Otherwise it comes to malformations so 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.640
 At some point you should already get one 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:07.580
 Nevertheless, male get out of the 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:11.840
 pathogenesis then only females come 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:14.090
 out there that the wikipedia describes 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.799
 as well as a clown so they believe each other 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.810
 then yourself and that's why there is 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:23.030
 even females from fertilized eggs 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.040
 comes a male or female house 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:30.410
 but there is a new breed so one 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.810
 new bloodline otherwise what we have 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.460
 still above 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.710
 on this topic so the bottom 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.330
 if we have the animal we have fodder 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:45.710
 have the lighting yes lighting is on 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:50.600
 not absolutely necessary looks easy 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.770
 more beautiful but what you have given something 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.760
 at least that should be 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.800
 room temperature and I would too 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:03.020
 you also recommend a back wall that 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:04.729
 she prefers something harder says so 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.669
 not run are like glass is 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:12.590
 not so fond of glass that's why I would 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:16.639
 you as here with me behind at max 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:20.830
 eet is already inside an a 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:25.160
 styrofoam backboard works quite well 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:31.370
 yes yes i would recommend styrofoam 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:33.710
 back wall is not bad if the 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.849
 humidity the circulation too 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:42.919
 fast you can here with me 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:45.349
 any reinsetzen a glass and then with 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:47.780
 How should I say this to this glass ? 

00:05:45.349 --> 00:05:54.620
 yes the water evaporates and increases the 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:56.979
 Humidity so as ground 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:02.599
 I said that I do not know as I said 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:07.159
 coconut earth potting soil or sand with 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:07.840
 mixed with coco or potting village 

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:10.250
 going 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.900
 or finally you can too 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:17.720
 simply insert kitchen paper 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:22.390
 yes that would be so many greetings 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.390
 is almost with steam and goodbye
