 who never tired even in less successful times Rauchs painting became art 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.100
 to explain the epoch

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:44.680
 is in the apocalyptic tradition of European art 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.080
 whose theme was always the downfall of the godless world 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.360

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.360
 to want 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:03.319
 Neo Rauch's visions 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.599

 bred the secret laboratories to master the world 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.819
 shake one last awake 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:15.819
