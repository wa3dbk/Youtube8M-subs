and<00:04:48.710> damage<00:04:49.040> it<00:04:49.160> very<00:04:49.520> rapidly<00:04:49.730> is<00:04:50.180> lack<00:04:50.390> of

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
and damage it very rapidly is lack of

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.090 
and damage it very rapidly is lack of
water<00:04:50.690> so<00:04:51.050> you<00:04:51.080> need<00:04:51.440> to<00:04:51.530> make<00:04:51.680> sure<00:04:51.710> when<00:04:52.010> you

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:52.100 
water so you need to make sure when you

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.990 
water so you need to make sure when you
flush<00:04:52.310> in<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.520> engine

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000

rotation problem on right-hand rotation

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.120 
rotation problem on right-hand rotation
which<00:06:02.390> would<00:06:02.510> make<00:06:02.660> the<00:06:02.810> boat<00:06:02.960> track<00:06:03.320> very

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
which would make the boat track very

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.830 
which would make the boat track very
well<00:06:04.190> in<00:06:04.490> the<00:06:04.580> sea

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
well in the sea

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.930 
well in the sea
the<00:06:06.350> other<00:06:06.500> main<00:06:06.740> benefit<00:06:07.160> with<00:06:07.430> the<00:06:07.670> bigger

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
the other main benefit with the bigger

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.400 
the other main benefit with the bigger
ones<00:06:08.180> is<00:06:08.420> you<00:06:08.450> can<00:06:08.690> actually<00:06:08.840> get<00:06:09.110> a<00:06:09.170> lot<00:06:09.320> of

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
ones is you can actually get a lot of

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.840 
ones is you can actually get a lot of
horsepower<00:06:09.650> on<00:06:09.860> the<00:06:09.950> back<00:06:10.070> of<00:06:10.190> boats<00:06:10.340> now<00:06:10.580> so

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
horsepower on the back of boats now so

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.400 
horsepower on the back of boats now so
where<00:06:11.090> boats<00:06:11.450> previously<00:06:12.080> would<00:06:12.200> have<00:06:12.230> been

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
where boats previously would have been

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.700 
where boats previously would have been
powered<00:06:12.740> by<00:06:12.920> inboard<00:06:13.990> you<00:06:14.990> can<00:06:15.140> now<00:06:15.320> see<00:06:15.680> that

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
powered by inboard you can now see that

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.920 
powered by inboard you can now see that
guys<00:06:16.130> are<00:06:16.310> starting<00:06:16.430> to<00:06:16.670> use<00:06:16.790> the<00:06:17.060> 200<00:06:17.810> and

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
are easy to get out of the water if you

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.890 
are easy to get out of the water if you
go<00:06:33.110> to<00:06:33.170> more<00:06:33.410> them<00:06:33.650> and<00:06:34.660> just<00:06:35.660> all<00:06:35.810> around
