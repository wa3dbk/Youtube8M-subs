all around the world and that people

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.959 
all around the world and that people
must<00:00:55.620> have<00:00:55.800> good<00:00:55.980> reasons<00:00:56.430> for<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.879> it

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
must have good reasons for it and it

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.310 
must have good reasons for it and it
couldn't<00:00:57.210> always<00:00:57.390> be<00:00:57.690> because<00:00:57.960> people<00:00:58.199> were
