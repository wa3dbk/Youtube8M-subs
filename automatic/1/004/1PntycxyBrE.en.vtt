00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.110
 Skull tattoos have many 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.330
 meanings most of them 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.210
 Spirituals in the Catholic Religion 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.640
 Christian is a symbol of the redemption of 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.950
 forgiveness of sins things that have been 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.859
 reflected in several paintings where the 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.679
 show for this purpose to forgive and 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.810
 mark the eternal life that according to faith 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.000
 it awaits the souls that deserve the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.129
 reincarnation in paradise these 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.800
 representations are to remind the 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.260
 faithful that life should be carried by 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.420
 a straight path and good on the other hand 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.520
 and the most common is the representation of 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.190
 death is very usual that this 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.100
 meaning is the one that predominates the most 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.250
 that a skull or skull is only 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.230
 visible after death the same 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.780
 staging of death is a 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.180
 corpse wrapped in a black robe that 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.680
 usually this is only reflected in the 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.379
 face the skull 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.350
 death is a companion for whom 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.530
 You are sometimes a tribute 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.810
 sometimes as a challenge motorcyclists 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.060
 they have this last option almost as law 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.120
 the tattooed skull usually 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.970
 in the arm remembers a confrontation 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.590
 to death every time they get on their 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.049
 motorcycles 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.030
 this same principle is taken into account 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.649
 who practice risky sports or 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.670
 who simply live life 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:35.229
 waiting for death almost with pleasure 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.149
 we found skulls in many places of 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.549
 which are taken from inspiration 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:43.329
 for tattoos as in the flags 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:46.060
 pirates or jolly roger this is a design 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:48.250
 characteristic a skull with two bones 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.130
 crossed and although there are variations 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.079
 This is the most recognized objective 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.750
 principal of the jolie roger was 

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:59.049
 intimidate and not just among the pirates is 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.420
 I was looking for this but burying armies 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.880
 they used this same principle using in 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.270
 your flags a skull an example is the 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.060
 totenkopf used in Germany- mostly 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.610
 recognized by its use by the ss 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.459
 the elite police during the second 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.500
 world war by the Nazi party in 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.129
 this time who was possessor of a 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.750
 ring with skulls was very distinguished 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.760
 but on the one hand more cheerful but without 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.160
 leaving aside the symbolism attached to the 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.010
 death the skulls are also used 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.799
 on the part of the Mexican tradition 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.959
 of the dead this style is very 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.750
 colorful and plays with the thought of 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.500
 death as a feast without fears is 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.320
 more a celebration and even a mockery 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.930
 I hope you liked it if it was like that
