one<00:00:03.409> of<00:00:03.560> the<00:00:03.650> sources<00:00:03.889> of<00:00:04.220> my<00:00:04.370> inspiration<00:00:05.120> for

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:05.390 
one of the sources of my inspiration for

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.970 
one of the sources of my inspiration for
growing<00:00:05.540> flowers<00:00:05.779> and<00:00:06.170> vegetables<00:00:06.290> together

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:06.980 
growing flowers and vegetables together

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.249 
growing flowers and vegetables together
is<00:00:07.280> permaculture<00:00:08.090> this<00:00:08.599> simply<00:00:09.080> means

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:09.259 
is permaculture this simply means

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:12.070 
is permaculture this simply means
observing<00:00:10.190> how<00:00:10.460> nature<00:00:10.790> works<00:00:11.240> and<00:00:11.690> then

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:12.080 
observing how nature works and then

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.140 
observing how nature works and then
trying<00:00:12.410> to<00:00:12.530> do<00:00:12.740> the<00:00:12.890> same<00:00:13.099> thing<00:00:13.490> in<00:00:13.790> your<00:00:14.030> own

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
trying to do the same thing in your own

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.589 
trying to do the same thing in your own
garden<00:00:17.949> living<00:00:18.949> proof<00:00:19.310> of<00:00:19.550> its<00:00:19.849> success<00:00:20.300> is

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:20.599 
garden living proof of its success is

the Harlan family who have been
gardening<00:00:23.210> this<00:00:23.359> way<00:00:23.599> for<00:00:23.869> over<00:00:24.140> 20<00:00:24.560> years<00:00:24.589> you

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
gardening this way for over 20 years you

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.719 
gardening this way for over 20 years you
could<00:00:25.849> say<00:00:26.119> this<00:00:26.329> whole<00:00:27.050> landscape<00:00:27.859> is<00:00:28.099> quite

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:28.729 
could say this whole landscape is quite

00:00:28.729 --> 00:00:31.089 
could say this whole landscape is quite
wild<00:00:29.300> but<00:00:29.569> actually<00:00:29.960> we<00:00:30.199> see<00:00:30.439> it<00:00:30.499> as<00:00:30.769> a<00:00:30.800> nature

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
wild but actually we see it as a nature

reserve that grows food for us as a

reserve that grows food for us as a
family<00:00:34.210> their<00:00:35.210> daughters<00:00:35.600> Haley<00:00:35.900> and<00:00:36.200> Gail

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470

have grown up with mum and dad's passion

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:49.360 
have grown up with mum and dad's passion
for<00:00:39.050> permaculture<00:00:46.990> when<00:00:47.990> they<00:00:48.200> started<00:00:48.680> many

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
for permaculture when they started many

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.250 
for permaculture when they started many
people<00:00:49.850> thought<00:00:50.060> it<00:00:50.240> a<00:00:50.330> hippie<00:00:50.720> approach<00:00:51.050> to

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
people thought it a hippie approach to

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.570 
people thought it a hippie approach to
gardening<00:00:51.440> and<00:00:51.920> that<00:00:52.040> it<00:00:52.130> wouldn't<00:00:52.370> really

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
gardening and that it wouldn't really

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.150 
gardening and that it wouldn't really
work<00:00:54.460> the<00:00:55.460> way<00:00:55.490> we<00:00:55.670> garden<00:00:56.240> is<00:00:56.570> using

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
work the way we garden is using

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.800 
work the way we garden is using
permaculture<00:00:58.160> principles<00:00:58.420> we<00:00:59.420> create<00:00:59.780> a

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
permaculture principles we create a

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.060 
permaculture principles we create a
garden<00:01:00.470> that<00:01:01.270> invites<00:01:02.320> lots<00:01:03.320> of<00:01:03.500> wildlife

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
garden that invites lots of wildlife

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.090 
garden that invites lots of wildlife
into<00:01:04.369> invites<00:01:05.119> lots<00:01:05.600> of<00:01:05.750> predators<00:01:06.289> for<00:01:06.530> pests

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
into invites lots of predators for pests

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.429 
into invites lots of predators for pests
so<00:01:07.670> that<00:01:07.850> all<00:01:08.030> that<00:01:08.569> you<00:01:08.719> see<00:01:08.960> is<00:01:09.200> completely

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
so that all that you see is completely

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.130 
so that all that you see is completely
unsprayed<00:01:10.429> it's<00:01:11.090> a<00:01:11.210> completely<00:01:11.689> organic

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
unsprayed it's a completely organic

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:19.179 
unsprayed it's a completely organic
system<00:01:14.859> we<00:01:15.859> designed<00:01:16.399> it<00:01:16.700> with<00:01:17.420> zoning<00:01:18.189> zoning

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
system we designed it with zoning zoning

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.690 
system we designed it with zoning zoning
is<00:01:19.369> a<00:01:19.569> permaculture<00:01:20.569> design<00:01:21.109> idea<00:01:21.700> whereby

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
is a permaculture design idea whereby

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.800 
is a permaculture design idea whereby
you<00:01:22.759> put<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.509> things<00:01:23.810> closest<00:01:24.560> to<00:01:24.859> the<00:01:25.159> house

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
you put the things closest to the house

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.709 
you put the things closest to the house
that<00:01:26.810> needs<00:01:27.139> the<00:01:27.679> most<00:01:27.710> attention<00:01:28.539> so<00:01:29.539> you'd

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:29.719 
that needs the most attention so you'd

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:32.109 
that needs the most attention so you'd
have<00:01:29.749> your<00:01:30.200> most<00:01:30.439> delicate<00:01:30.709> salad<00:01:31.520> plants

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
have your most delicate salad plants

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.590 
have your most delicate salad plants
your<00:01:32.499> tender<00:01:33.499> flowers<00:01:34.069> and<00:01:34.340> as<00:01:35.090> you<00:01:35.329> move

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
your tender flowers and as you move

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.889 
your tender flowers and as you move
outward<00:01:36.530> away<00:01:36.709> from<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.759> home<00:01:37.999> you<00:01:38.539> then

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
outward away from the home you then

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.739 
outward away from the home you then
sight<00:01:39.439> the<00:01:39.950> fruit<00:01:40.219> trees<00:01:40.549> and<00:01:40.939> then<00:01:41.329> the

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:41.749 
sight the fruit trees and then the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:44.080 
sight the fruit trees and then the
larger<00:01:42.229> nut<00:01:42.439> trees<00:01:42.829> the<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:43.639> Wilder

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
larger nut trees the the Wilder

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.090 
larger nut trees the the Wilder
hedgerows<00:01:44.600> that<00:01:44.959> need<00:01:45.229> very<00:01:45.560> very<00:01:45.889> little

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
hedgerows that need very very little

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.910 
hedgerows that need very very little
attention

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
attention

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.149 
attention
and<00:01:48.550> it's<00:01:48.790> a<00:01:49.300> nice<00:01:49.600> way<00:01:50.080> to<00:01:50.110> make<00:01:50.380> a<00:01:50.440> garden

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
and it's a nice way to make a garden

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.640 
and it's a nice way to make a garden
we<00:01:51.400> don't<00:01:51.880> fuss<00:01:52.210> around<00:01:52.240> the<00:01:52.870> edges<00:01:53.229> so<00:01:53.440> I

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 
we don't fuss around the edges so I

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.649 
we don't fuss around the edges so I
think<00:01:53.890> you<00:01:53.950> can<00:01:54.100> possibly<00:01:54.520> see<00:01:54.880> but<00:01:55.330> the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
think you can possibly see but the

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.219 
think you can possibly see but the
food's<00:01:55.900> there<00:01:56.200> that's<00:01:57.040> what<00:01:57.250> matters<00:01:57.750> but<00:01:58.750> the

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
food's there that's what matters but the

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:01.620 
food's there that's what matters but the
principles<00:01:59.890> behind<00:02:00.100> it<00:02:00.490> can<00:02:00.729> be<00:02:00.850> taken<00:02:01.420> and

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
principles behind it can be taken and

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.200 
principles behind it can be taken and
shrunken<00:02:02.470> down<00:02:02.650> to<00:02:02.920> any<00:02:03.100> scale<00:02:03.520> even<00:02:04.119> if

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
shrunken down to any scale even if

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.730 
shrunken down to any scale even if
you've<00:02:04.330> got<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.509> patio<00:02:04.960> you<00:02:05.229> can<00:02:05.380> apply<00:02:05.680> the

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
you've got a patio you can apply the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:16.490 
you've got a patio you can apply the
