00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.600
 t cent ap 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.560
 Why 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.670
 do you see m yesterday if we can say windows r 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.370

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.220
 without appeal 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.660
 without anything 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.660
 so to go from one point eh well see m 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.490
 you right click in clear with windchill deposits says 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.290
 here is a small price 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.290
 if not that with a rain 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.430
 so you go into restraint 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.430
 and you see m assaulted the workshop 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.410
 so you delete them both 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.390
 we will replace it with the top of the displayed for the church in front 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.769
 So that's selling 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.939
 we admitted to France replaced by the French state 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:19.029
 this is rare if they wanted to change for example the team of France 

00:02:19.029 --> 00:02:20.979
 we did not know what it's worth 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:22.519

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:30.649
 sune 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:32.689
 it was in France and I think 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:35.589
 it's the same 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:37.219
