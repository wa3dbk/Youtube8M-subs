00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:13.529
 There are two types of Grefrath painted and not wrong 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.529
 These goals are covered with a crunch market 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:21.759
 lay protects the wood very well from pollution and from the fluctuations 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.140
 the humidity 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.169
 lacquered fretboard will fulfill this but not at play 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.509
 everyone's thing 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.410
 here an undated could 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.390
 This can be found in almost all short guitars and most electric guitars 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.929
 it is currently missing in Germany 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:45.859
 usually Alexander or Ebony this is Paris 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.510
 an undated grip also keeps a bit of care 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.870
 especially on the moisture balance you should pay attention that is similar 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.620
 behind with our skin in winter 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.810
 Picture Reuters too much moisture sprint-ass surcharge and that was it then 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:05.700
 with guitar playing 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.700
 but with little effort you can be happy 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.510
 you need a few curls 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.140
 and the fingerboard oil. "That's what's in every well-stocked music business 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.070
 a first for one we hold everything 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.200
 from 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.340
 Now we know that larger facilities 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.040
 But bet to what extent judges and formed 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.780
 Ben 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.210
 b 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.210
 is the first clarify very heavily polluted 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.160
 If you take quite a fall steel has become popular too market 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.330
 and 3 with it 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.800
 the fingerboard off 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.890
 and association in Marseille direction 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.980
 until de dirt 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.980
 and watch TV 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.810
 Now comes my favorite part 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.789
 we apply the picture SAB and distribute it with a small shop 

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:21.019
 St 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.519
 on 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.519
 b 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:48.519
 t 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.689
 There should be a few of the stitches 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.209
 so the TuS time for a coffee break of 30 minutes 

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:12.600
 is that a complete confiscated 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.530
 Polina the fretboard Inmarsat direction with a clean cloth 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.959
 so, and now 

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:29.829
 Unna 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:30.379
