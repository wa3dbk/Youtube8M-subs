year breaking down into the first
chicane<00:00:38.140> which<00:00:38.380> is<00:00:38.560> crucial<00:00:38.800> especially

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
chicane which is crucial especially

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.880 
chicane which is crucial especially
after<00:00:39.640> the<00:00:39.850> start<00:00:40.559> unfortunately<00:00:41.559> we<00:00:41.710> see

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
after the start unfortunately we see

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.400 
after the start unfortunately we see
some<00:00:42.100> crashes<00:00:42.400> at<00:00:42.700> each<00:00:42.850> year<00:00:43.120> the<00:00:43.840> only<00:00:44.080> exit

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410

some crashes at each year the only exit
you<00:00:44.620> need<00:00:44.800> to<00:00:45.040> take<00:00:45.730> care<00:00:45.910> of<00:00:45.970> yogya<00:00:46.420> tired

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
especially for the way smoking destroy

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.540 
especially for the way smoking destroy
them<00:00:49.660> too<00:00:49.840> early<00:00:50.170> then<00:00:50.739> here<00:00:50.949> one<00:00:51.100> of<00:00:51.250> the<00:00:51.370> most

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
them too early then here one of the most

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.180 
them too early then here one of the most
difficult<00:00:51.730> parts<00:00:52.390> because<00:00:52.900> you<00:00:53.110> have<00:00:53.800> a<00:00:53.830> very

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
difficult parts because you have a very

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.780 
difficult parts because you have a very
low<00:00:54.550> down<00:00:54.790> for<00:00:55.060> setup<00:00:55.410> but<00:00:56.410> a<00:00:56.440> few<00:00:56.829> tricky<00:00:57.610> she

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
low down for setup but a few tricky she

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.490 
low down for setup but a few tricky she
gains<00:00:58.030> where<00:00:58.360> you<00:00:58.480> need<00:00:58.870> to<00:00:59.020> use<00:00:59.200> a<00:00:59.230> lot<00:00:59.470> of

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
gains where you need to use a lot of

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.340 
gains where you need to use a lot of
curve<00:00:59.829> this<00:01:00.489> right-hander<00:01:01.059> was<00:01:01.210> flat<00:01:01.450> again

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
curve this right-hander was flat again

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.070 
curve this right-hander was flat again
down<00:01:02.590> into<00:01:02.920> second<00:01:03.309> gear<00:01:03.489> so<00:01:04.449> she<00:01:04.509> came<00:01:04.809> here

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
down into second gear so she came here

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.230 
down into second gear so she came here
where<00:01:05.290> unfortunately<00:01:05.500> my<00:01:06.190> team<00:01:06.430> colleague

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
where unfortunately my team colleague

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.090 
where unfortunately my team colleague
enough<00:01:07.869> last<00:01:08.110> year<00:01:08.229> crashed<00:01:08.590> into<00:01:08.800> the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
enough last year crashed into the

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.350 
enough last year crashed into the
barriers<00:01:09.460> because<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:11.500> tarmac<00:01:12.250> didn't<00:01:13.210> work

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
barriers because the tarmac didn't work

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.660 
barriers because the tarmac didn't work
last<00:01:13.600> year<00:01:13.780> got<00:01:14.110> so<00:01:14.170> hot<00:01:14.560> that<00:01:14.800> it<00:01:14.860> fell<00:01:15.190> fell

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
last year got so hot that it fell fell

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.240 
last year got so hot that it fell fell
to<00:01:15.820> pieces<00:01:16.050> yeah<00:01:17.050> tricky<00:01:17.619> on<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.860> breaking

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
to pieces yeah tricky on the breaking

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.280 
to pieces yeah tricky on the breaking
again<00:01:18.580> because<00:01:18.940> it's<00:01:19.119> a<00:01:19.210> bit<00:01:19.360> bumpy<00:01:19.750> another

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
again because it's a bit bumpy another

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.210 
again because it's a bit bumpy another
she<00:01:20.530> came<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:21.210> now<00:01:22.210> towards<00:01:22.660> happen<00:01:23.470> which<00:01:24.190> is

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
she came and now towards happen which is

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.420 
she came and now towards happen which is
done<00:01:24.550> in<00:01:24.580> first<00:01:25.060> year<00:01:25.360> and<00:01:25.600> it's<00:01:25.990> a<00:01:26.190> good<00:01:27.190> place

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
done in first year and it's a good place

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.550 
done in first year and it's a good place
for<00:01:27.670> overtaking<00:01:28.000> and<00:01:28.420> where<00:01:29.080> it's<00:01:29.170> crucial<00:01:29.530> to

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
for overtaking and where it's crucial to

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.130 
for overtaking and where it's crucial to
have<00:01:29.680> a<00:01:29.770> good<00:01:30.040> exit<00:01:30.970> because<00:01:31.210> afterwards<00:01:32.049> we

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
have a good exit because afterwards we

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.039 
have a good exit because afterwards we
have<00:01:32.260> a<00:01:32.430> extremely<00:01:33.430> long<00:01:33.760> straight<00:01:34.119> exiting

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
have a extremely long straight exiting

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.370 
have a extremely long straight exiting
this<00:01:35.200> corner<00:01:35.590> here<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:36.869> actually<00:01:37.869> here<00:01:38.260> you

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
this corner here and actually here you

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.830 
this corner here and actually here you
can<00:01:38.590> try<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.010> slipstream<00:01:39.610> get<00:01:40.270> close<00:01:40.540> to<00:01:40.720> the
