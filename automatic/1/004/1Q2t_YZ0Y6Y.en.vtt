something that I want now however we

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.369 
something that I want now however we
know<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.579> God<00:00:42.239> feels<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.750> way<00:00:42.930> but<00:00:43.140> there

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
know that God feels that way but there

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.540 
know that God feels that way but there
is<00:00:43.559> still<00:00:43.760> divorced<00:00:44.760> in<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.180> church<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:47.010> when

things<00:00:56.399> well<00:00:56.670> like<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.539> could<00:00:57.750> be<00:00:57.870> different

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140

you<00:00:58.530> know<00:00:58.710> a<00:00:58.789> viewpoint<00:00:59.789> for<00:01:00.030> different

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
you know a viewpoint for different

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.270 
you know a viewpoint for different
people<00:01:00.750> based<00:01:01.020> upon<00:01:01.350> how<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.590> interpret

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
people based upon how you interpret

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.969 
people based upon how you interpret
Scripture<00:01:02.730> but<00:01:03.690> as<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.019> read<00:01:04.199> my<00:01:04.409> Bible<00:01:04.439> I

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
Scripture but as I read my Bible I

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.789 
Scripture but as I read my Bible I
believe<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.519> very<00:01:05.880> clear<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.750> God<00:01:07.140> simply

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
believe is very clear that God simply

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.070 
believe is very clear that God simply
says<00:01:08.220> when<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.490> woman<00:01:08.880> divorces<00:01:09.450> her<00:01:09.600> husband

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
says when a woman divorces her husband

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.590 
says when a woman divorces her husband
and<00:01:10.260> she<00:01:10.350> marry<00:01:11.010> meri's<00:01:11.430> again<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.360> if<00:01:12.450> her

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
husband is yet still alive then that

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.090
