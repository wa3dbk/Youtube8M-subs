00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.430
 very good to all subscribers is today 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:29.590
 closed the villager and today I bring you a 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.739
 video where are we going to go talking about how 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:36.540
 make a chroma in minecraft and this time 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.540
 it is a chroma to live 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.320
 I do not know maybe the intro appeared this chroma 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.450
 for video as well you know what 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.110
 you have to do with him what can you do 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.180
 better said with the textures pack 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.850
 what I did with colors with colors 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.840
 planes so that it modifies some 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.300
 textures of the minecraft is paid I'll leave 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.620
 in the description of the video and good what 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.020
 first thing we have to do is train 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.449
 our chroma 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.950
 I recommend you choose and for example 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.950
 even if they put the same color 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.750
 you see 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.190
 this and this color is going to appear more and 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.880
 however the side walls are going 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.550
 appear less this is because of 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.130
 Minecraft lighting and what I 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.150
 I recommend that you record well and well what 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.530
 first you have to do as I have 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.880
 said to make your chroma and what 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.259
 next put the actors in 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.000
 this case is going to be a villager over here 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.580
 circling 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.760
 as you have seen before the introduction 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.190
 from the video to the villagers I know why it 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.210
 it starts to walk around here I do not know if it is that 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.790
 they want to leave or something I'm going to put in 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.280
 peaceful good as I am already recording 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:56.250
 so we stay like that for example f1 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.830
 we look at the villagers what they do 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.479
 for this he took a picture but good to see 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.479
 this one that moves like this 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.759
 a short thing is not necessary 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.900
 a lot and the program we are going to use 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.970
 now for this is the after effects and 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.770
 well now see those three ex good 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.240
 dietary effects now the only thing that 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.940
 we have to do is catch our 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.450
 recording that is this and we have to 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.200
 pass it to the program to know how to treat for a while 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.450
 why 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.780
 also left talking so there are two 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.330
 minutes more or less we spent here to the 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.470
 zone of 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.470
 here, better said 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.540
 and there we have it if now we cut good 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.000
 because it will be our recording and 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.170
 we would give in a fund 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.720
 I'm going to use another wall for example 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.810
 open the wall as I said before that 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:59.010
 is here just downloaded 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:02.370
 it gets here as you see 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.650
 we would put it in the background although 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.760
 if you do not want to put is to put a 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:12.090
 a picture you can simply put 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.950
 to see cardinals match this 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.010
 although he sees that the quality of the 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.849
 recording is very different we are going to 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.849
 increase a little 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:28.690
 here and now we will have to get 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:31.660
 in the effect section 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.310
 and the one I wanted was inlaid and 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.940
 I saw that several tools I'm going to make 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.380
 with linear chroma and as sailing though 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.660
 I what to do with him and I like 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.130
 more select the color chroma 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.260
 this case is green and as you can see 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.150
 chroma is done now I'm going to give play 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.870
 so you can see a little 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.870
 what is it 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.780
 and good up to here this little tutorial 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.940
 how to make a chroma for video of 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.700
 minecraft and good if you liked the 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.230
