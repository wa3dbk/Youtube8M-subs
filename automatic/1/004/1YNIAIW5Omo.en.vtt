00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
halos that automatically means it's a

failure which i think is kind of

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.310 
failure which i think is kind of
ridiculous<00:03:20.180> considering<00:03:20.900> the<00:03:21.080> only

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320

that<00:04:37.910> this<00:04:38.030> other<00:04:38.240> competition<00:04:38.810> in<00:04:38.870> the

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
that this other competition in the

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.570 
that this other competition in the
market<00:04:39.290> and<00:04:39.440> I<00:04:39.830> feel<00:04:40.010> like<00:04:40.100> the<00:04:40.220> other<00:04:40.370> thing

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
market and I feel like the other thing

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.100 
market and I feel like the other thing
is<00:04:40.700> people<00:04:40.850> don't<00:04:41.000> understand<00:04:41.540> like<00:04:41.780> because

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
is people don't understand like because

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.260 
is people don't understand like because
halos<00:04:42.440> not<00:04:42.590> an<00:04:42.710> MLG<00:04:42.980> any<00:04:43.280> more<00:04:43.490> like<00:04:43.730> that

halos not an MLG any more like that

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.610 
halos not an MLG any more like that
doesn't<00:04:44.420> necessarily<00:04:44.570> mean<00:04:45.080> the<00:04:45.260> game<00:04:45.410> isn't

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
doesn't necessarily mean the game isn't

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.800 
doesn't necessarily mean the game isn't
competitive<00:04:46.010> like<00:04:46.430> there<00:04:46.640> are<00:04:46.850> there's<00:04:47.570> call

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
people kind of don't grasp that so they

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.000 
people kind of don't grasp that so they
automatically<00:05:00.200> assume<00:05:00.320> it's<00:05:00.770> a<00:05:00.830> failure
