00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:12.590
 welcome to a new video of dante 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:15.019
 frame called ex skate blog and we're going to 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:19.310
 start putting new normal game 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:21.990
 well this is the demo but almost the same 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:24.420
 that the version 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.570
 complete because the only thing you can 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.400
 do in the full version is some 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.300
 different things like flying and having all 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.820
 the good stuff here we started what 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.480
 only I tell you that the world always 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.480
 It will be the same 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:46.900
 it is not random 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:49.860
 from going to be equal the world 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.860
 in that book 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:01:03.359
 if you can see this game has a few 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.359
 horrible graphics the very bad BÃ©ticos 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.900
 has this game 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.890
 but this mountain the good thing that 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.259
 you can do more ways than minecraft 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.259
 much more than cure 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.430
 I'm putting pastor 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.570
 about 2000 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.170
 this game is in its beta version 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.170
 common 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.720
 in its beta version 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.990
 and it offers a lot very very bad graphics 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.990
 just in case 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:58.230
 and have some book and shit look at others 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.230
 book that minecraft 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.320
 and especially when you get down was 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:12.400
 a cave let's go in later before 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:14.770
 we will be calling good have I 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.270
 called 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:21.160
 x 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:24.360
 if you wonder why something is good 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.360
 good water 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.849
 the new ones will be true already 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.290
 let's try to look down at the water 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.780
 also the most fake this game is that 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.250
 can you give 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.250
 you can go full circle 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.450
 let's go to a new fund 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:54.610
 let's give them how the water looks 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:59.450
 down the water is more is also that the 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:04.780
 listen walking walking on land 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.780
 but over 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.510
 what a horrible evil it is that the sky 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.400
 see white and when we get out of the water it 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.400
 will see if it is like this 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.920
 the caves here we're going to see you put 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.350
 our of these squares 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.050
 here you put in this yellow in this 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.610
 yellow room 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:34.610
 and here we have 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.180
 many figures believe that seeing with sun and 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.890
 with the numbers from one to 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.890
 6 and remember the 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.629
 and this was deepened 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.480
 A) Yes 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:57.050
 so I do not want more material so 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.100
 let's do 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.100
 use another 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.260
 I think it's a pastor but good 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.640
 plus 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.320
 and 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:28.750
 let's go recharge we have a 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.750
 square shape 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.419
 good wanted promised 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.860
 ah 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.860
 or not 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:59.129
 they do not find any cave 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.129
 do not 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.150
 if you go very down in this game 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.280
 and we come to a cave 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:41.480
 they wonder that white person who is there 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.600
 it is not a book 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.860
 is a material like this is called a 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.860
 gold material 

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:54.250
 with the golden day this is a material 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.250
 that we have just taken 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.690
 this time incomplete 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.650
 as I told them 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.440
 and 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:16.570
 I recommend this game 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:20.380
 I think it's good but I think 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:22.980
 in a year in a many more months is going to 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:22.980
 be prepared 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.590
 be playable 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:32.590
 here I have refined ways once more 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:32.590
 little girl 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:48.270
