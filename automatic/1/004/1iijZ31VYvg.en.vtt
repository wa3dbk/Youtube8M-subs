 which is on the server 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.349
 look for your site in the tree on the left that are on your 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.959
 computer personally i have no examples of simon citroÃ«n 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.039
 I find the index page for che tml 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:27.039
 or php exploits and that must be the homepage 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:33.509
 and I decide 2 drag it drop in the right window 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.359
 a warning message tell me that a page an html text already exist on 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.419
 the server comes alive is the default index 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:47.259
 selected in the action to replace say 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:50.259
 at the feet 

00:02:51.029 --> 00:02:54.029
 and check on the internet that your site is displayed properly 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.840
 if it is not the case if you come across a page of the type construction isis 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.479
 giga 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:03.549
 at that time to pay check the following points 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.310
 have you reserved your domain for just under 24 hours in this case 

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:10.549
 maybe the dns are not yet completely configured 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.090
 if you bought a domain other than at isis giga please check 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.090
 that the tms score is correct 

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:22.749
 please also check that you have correctly named your page 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:25.749
 index for html or dotted index buy 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.279
 and finally little paid check that the page is correctly put in the 

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:33.529
