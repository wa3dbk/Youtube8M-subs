00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
it looks a little bit nicer but the best

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.670 
it looks a little bit nicer but the best
thing<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.459> you<00:03:23.700> can<00:03:23.730> customize<00:03:24.269> it<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.079> you

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
thing is you can customize it and you

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.039 
thing is you can customize it and you
can<00:03:25.890> choose<00:03:26.310> what<00:03:26.609> does<00:03:26.850> what<00:03:27.120> if<00:03:27.329> anything

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
can choose what does what if anything

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.789 
can choose what does what if anything
and<00:03:28.230> as<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.130> see<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.549> can<00:03:29.730> have<00:03:29.850> full<00:03:30.150> glass

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:30.799 
and as you see you can have full glass

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:34.610 
and as you see you can have full glass
if<00:03:31.799> we<00:03:32.010> go<00:03:32.130> ahead<00:03:32.220> and<00:03:32.340> do<00:03:32.549> that<00:03:32.959> it's<00:03:33.959> nice<00:03:34.230> I

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
if we go ahead and do that it's nice I

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.620 
if we go ahead and do that it's nice I
guess<00:03:35.450> it's<00:03:36.450> not<00:03:37.019> too<00:03:37.260> clean<00:03:37.790> but<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:39.209> is<00:03:39.359> nice

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
guess it's not too clean but it is nice

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.330 
guess it's not too clean but it is nice
and<00:03:40.040> it<00:03:41.630> you<00:03:42.630> know<00:03:42.660> it<00:03:43.350> depends<00:03:43.950> who<00:03:44.040> you<00:03:44.190> are

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
and it you know it depends who you are

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.319 
and it you know it depends who you are

right so here's Metro right that's a
supposed<00:03:48.840> to<00:03:48.900> be<00:03:49.019> Metro<00:03:50.660> but<00:03:51.660> again<00:03:51.959> we<00:03:52.590> could

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
supposed to be Metro but again we could

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:57.740 
supposed to be Metro but again we could
go<00:03:52.890> to<00:03:52.950> different<00:03:53.910> things<00:03:54.120> here<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:56.750> looks
