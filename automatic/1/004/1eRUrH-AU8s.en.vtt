00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
you don't need to be accurate in the

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.270 
you don't need to be accurate in the
size<00:01:17.660> of<00:01:18.080> each<00:01:18.560> petal<00:01:19.040> just<00:01:20.320> randomly<00:01:21.320> draw

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
size of each petal just randomly draw

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:44.200

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.430 
look and now I will simply draw two to
three<00:01:59.510> lines<00:01:59.870> inside<00:02:00.560> each<00:02:00.830> petal<00:02:02.440> depending

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
three lines inside each petal depending

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.300 
three lines inside each petal depending
upon<00:02:03.650> the<00:02:04.040> size<00:02:04.250> of<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:04.760> petal<00:02:05.210> I<00:02:05.979> can<00:02:06.979> draw

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
upon the size of the petal I can draw

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:24.630 
upon the size of the petal I can draw
here<00:02:08.320> two<00:02:09.320> lines<00:02:09.700> so<00:02:10.700> I<00:02:11.000> will<00:02:11.180> draw<00:02:11.450> two<00:02:11.690> lines
