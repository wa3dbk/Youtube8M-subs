well<00:00:09.000> LPN<00:00:09.480> school<00:00:09.750> might<00:00:09.900> be<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.080> little<00:00:10.380> easier

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
well LPN school might be a little easier

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.799 
well LPN school might be a little easier
to<00:00:10.889> get<00:00:11.010> into<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.519> less<00:00:11.670> expensive<00:00:12.300> but<00:00:12.690> if

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
to get into and less expensive but if

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.480 
to get into and less expensive but if
you<00:00:12.929> want<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.200> work<00:00:13.320> in<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.500> hospital<00:00:13.710> being<00:00:14.400> an

you want to work in a hospital being an

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.630 
you want to work in a hospital being an
RN<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:14.969> probably<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.450> better<00:00:15.630> option<00:00:16.369> LPN<00:00:17.369> scope

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
RN is probably a better option LPN scope

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.279 
RN is probably a better option LPN scope
of<00:00:17.789> practice<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.300> little<00:00:18.660> more<00:00:18.779> limited

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
of practice is a little more limited

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.410 
of practice is a little more limited
than<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.710> an<00:00:19.830> RN<00:00:20.189> for<00:00:20.640> one<00:00:20.850> they<00:00:21.210> can't

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
than that of an RN for one they can't

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.050 
than that of an RN for one they can't
administer<00:00:21.900> IV<00:00:22.050> medications<00:00:22.890> so<00:00:23.519> they're

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
administer IV medications so they're

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.400 
administer IV medications so they're
probably<00:00:24.180> not<00:00:24.570> going<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.750> be<00:00:24.930> hired<00:00:25.199> on<00:00:25.350> a

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
probably not going to be hired on a

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.339 
probably not going to be hired on a
floor<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.859> uses<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> lot<00:00:26.369> of<00:00:26.460> IV<00:00:26.760> drugs<00:00:27.349> so

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
floor that uses a lot of IV drugs so

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.890 
floor that uses a lot of IV drugs so
they're<00:00:28.500> usually<00:00:28.619> hired<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.250> places<00:00:29.699> like

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900

they're usually hired in places like
nursing<00:00:30.900> homes<00:00:31.140> or<00:00:31.800> maybe<00:00:32.250> home<00:00:32.430> health<00:00:32.669> care

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850

to be not for me because after doing all
my<00:01:11.400> assessments<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.090> felt<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.450> I<00:01:12.510> was<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:12.840> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
my assessments I felt that I was in the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.719 
my assessments I felt that I was in the
back<00:01:13.200> room<00:01:13.229> charting<00:01:14.010> like<00:01:14.159> all<00:01:14.369> afternoon

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
and the LVN was doing all the work and

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.020 
and the LVN was doing all the work and
knew<00:01:16.680> what<00:01:16.770> was<00:01:16.920> going<00:01:17.189> on<00:01:17.280> with<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.549> patients

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
knew what was going on with the patients

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.780 
knew what was going on with the patients
and<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.360> was<00:01:18.750> like<00:01:18.930> clueless<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.830> being<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
and I was like clueless and being the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.120 
and I was like clueless and being the
one<00:01:20.970> ultimately<00:01:21.530> responsible<00:01:22.530> for<00:01:22.860> all<00:01:22.950> those

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
one ultimately responsible for all those

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.070 
one ultimately responsible for all those
patients<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.970> not<00:01:24.420> really<00:01:24.630> knowing<00:01:24.780> what<00:01:24.990> was

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
patients and not really knowing what was

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.780 
patients and not really knowing what was
going<00:01:25.290> on<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.740> didn't<00:01:26.130> feel<00:01:26.250> comfortable<00:01:26.430> with

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
going on I didn't feel comfortable with

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.510 
going on I didn't feel comfortable with
that<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.600> I<00:01:28.170> seriously<00:01:28.530> don't<00:01:28.979> understand

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
that and I seriously don't understand

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.609 
that and I seriously don't understand
how<00:01:29.670> LPNs<00:01:30.210> work<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.630> nursing<00:01:31.049> homes<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.409> take

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
how LPNs work in nursing homes and take

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.710 
how LPNs work in nursing homes and take
