00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.970 

the<00:00:47.690> idea<00:00:48.020> is<00:00:48.200> to<00:00:49.240> to<00:00:50.240> see<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:50.980> strengths

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 
the idea is to to see the strengths

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.750 
the idea is to to see the strengths
points<00:00:52.460> and<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:53.480> weak<00:00:53.660> point<00:00:54.020> and<00:00:54.230> then<00:00:55.070> when

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
points and the weak point and then when

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.780 
points and the weak point and then when
you<00:00:55.960> when<00:00:56.960> you<00:00:57.080> see<00:00:57.260> all<00:00:57.500> this<00:00:57.650> at<00:00:58.280> this<00:00:58.490> point

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
you when you see all this at this point

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.360 
you when you see all this at this point
you<00:00:59.720> put<00:00:59.930> it<00:01:00.080> together<00:01:00.230> and<00:01:00.620> then<00:01:00.770> you<00:01:01.190> can

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
you put it together and then you can

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.060 
you put it together and then you can
choose<00:01:01.610> the<00:01:01.790> exercises<00:01:02.540> which<00:01:03.200> are<00:01:03.440> specially

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
choose the exercises which are specially

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.590 
choose the exercises which are specially
are<00:01:04.280> helpful<00:01:05.270> for<00:01:05.570> her<00:01:05.720> or<00:01:06.200> for<00:01:06.229> the<00:01:06.530> athlete

training I learned a lot actually today
especially<00:01:13.670> about<00:01:14.440> some<00:01:15.440> of<00:01:15.590> my<00:01:15.770> weak<00:01:16.280> points

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
especially about some of my weak points

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.710 
especially about some of my weak points
which<00:01:17.840> I'm<00:01:18.610> looking<00:01:19.610> forward<00:01:19.940> to<00:01:20.090> improve<00:01:20.420> and

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
which I'm looking forward to improve and

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.340 
which I'm looking forward to improve and
then<00:01:21.880> also<00:01:22.880> some<00:01:23.710> important<00:01:24.710> aspects<00:01:25.400> of

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350 
then also some important aspects of

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.109 
then also some important aspects of
strength<00:01:27.350> training<00:01:27.590> and<00:01:28.190> also<00:01:28.490> for<00:01:28.700> climbing

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
strength training and also for climbing

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.190 
strength training and also for climbing
technique<00:01:29.590> by<00:01:30.590> being<00:01:30.920> precise<00:01:31.400> and<00:01:31.670> fast

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
technique by being precise and fast

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.050 
technique by being precise and fast
which<00:01:33.200> I<00:01:33.320> think<00:01:33.560> is<00:01:33.650> really<00:01:33.830> important<00:01:34.340> sure

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.240 
likely stay in a place where there's so
much<00:01:40.220> climbing<00:01:40.640> history<00:01:41.300> and<00:01:41.920> also<00:01:42.920> to<00:01:43.070> be
