00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.260 
that's basically what it does now your
location<00:03:01.600> services<00:03:02.080> has<00:03:02.350> to<00:03:02.590> be<00:03:02.710> enabled

location services has to be enabled

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.210

either it's not going to work so yeah

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.520 
either it's not going to work so yeah
keep<00:03:06.640> that<00:03:06.790> in<00:03:07.000> mind<00:03:07.210> and<00:03:07.420> it<00:03:07.570> has<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.840> little

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
keep that in mind and it has a little

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.320 
keep that in mind and it has a little
effect<00:03:09.160> on<00:03:09.280> your<00:03:09.460> battery<00:03:09.820> that's<00:03:10.030> what<00:03:10.240> the

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
effect on your battery that's what the

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.090 
effect on your battery that's what the
description<00:03:10.900> says<00:03:11.080> I<00:03:11.110> guess<00:03:11.380> because<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.980> the

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
description says I guess because of the

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.370 
description says I guess because of the
location<00:03:12.280> services<00:03:13.180> yeah<00:03:13.990> so<00:03:14.170> that's

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
location services yeah so that's

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.350 
location services yeah so that's
basically<00:03:14.560> that's<00:03:15.220> what<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.520> tweak<00:03:15.790> does<00:03:16.060> it

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
basically that's what the tweak does it

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.320 
basically that's what the tweak does it
it<00:03:16.710> changes<00:03:17.710> your<00:03:17.950> screen<00:03:18.490> to<00:03:18.730> look<00:03:18.970> a<00:03:19.120> little

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
it changes your screen to look a little

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.150 
it changes your screen to look a little
bit<00:03:19.510> demo<00:03:19.780> so<00:03:20.020> it<00:03:20.110> doesn't<00:03:20.470> have<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.770> be<00:03:20.800> always

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
bit demo so it doesn't have to be always

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.640 
bit demo so it doesn't have to be always
bright<00:03:22.000> like<00:03:22.330> this<00:03:22.600> especially<00:03:22.840> when<00:03:23.380> late
