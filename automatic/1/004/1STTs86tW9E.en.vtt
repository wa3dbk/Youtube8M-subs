 and 90 and today we are going to show you how 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:35.040
 a place in any game vehicle 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.410
 Geez, I'm really overjoyed. 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.100
 once here and we'll start here by 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.620
 tank 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.469
 I brought some vehicles in this video. 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.969
 so let's get here in some 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.920
 first vehicle would be the tank 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.910
 remembering that you can not have a little 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.390
 money in hand 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.640
 penny and we're there ask the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.249
 Bruce is for those who do not know I put 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.350
 up here on the phone were in 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:00.749
 beauty contacts 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.539
 Let's go here until Bruce arrives at 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:08.210
 blow the flight if you call the right blue 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.210
 I'm waiting to call aquino bruce 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.409
 ready when this menu appeared you 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.430
 Can I bring the vehicle there? 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.860
 When will we get in the vehicle? 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.200
 you press the x to request the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.240
 testosterone and ball to go back 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.969
 simply it will fetch exactly 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.430
 so it will be inside the tank right? 

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:29.310
 kind of buggy with you are seeing 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.500
 that the smell of being outside is 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.420
 remembering that to ask me shows 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.689
 that the dictator from outside but the sheik 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.880
 I was also bugged in this beauty video 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.700
 It is very crazy just to get you one 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.920
 cheap ale plus a nice glitch of 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.930
 how to explore within certain 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.880
 vehicles actually guys give it to you 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.850
 do with any vehicle you 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.280
 Can you get into beauty so we did 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.390
 now with a tank someone was piloted 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.500
 to see it happen simply 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.719
 ran over 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.179
 Let's go to the next vehicle so let's go. 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.490
 do with the bus guys now 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:06.679
 we ask the vehicle here to use more 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.729
 Easy yet again're called bruce 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.550
 same procedure 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.400
 Let's call Bruce and ask him later. 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.050
 those that appeared least double if 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.720
 you simply tighten the workout to 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.030
 get inside the bus or go outside 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.400
 of the bus that did not give obviously we will 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.760
 wait which is calling for you and 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.110
 triangle to enter 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.400
 this will push the triangle to 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.480
 enter x to confirm that the ball to 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.860
 come back 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.410
 remembering that now it seems that 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.850
 message right there because you have no 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.740
 a little money in the hand she can 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.810
 play the playstation store 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.180
 Finally but as you have no money in 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.940
 hand you 're going to push the ball to confirm 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.070
 even because you will not want to own it 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.520
 beauty story to add the 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:56.340
 money to the gta game with you guys are 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.800
 seeing there even a wheelchair symbol 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.480
 inside the bus a good pace 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.520
 cool for you to explore some vehicles 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.490
 Then get some doubts. 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.740
 some curiosities, that's a lot of show 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.120
 provided that such local plans 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.740
 exploitable right 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.770
 Remembering guys, we're here now. 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.600
 I do not work there, I do not work 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.510
 it's not really in the bob job in taiwan 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.910
 and the same procedure called bruce ne 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.410
 told that is to appear that boy you 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.490
 Calm down to get on the plane. 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.920
 then the sky near x to confirm the 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.990
 bruce's service and ball to get him back 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.300
 will announce arrived in that part that 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.970
 person is caught but not you go 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.830
 hit the square is in that game 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.230
 You tighten the square he's going to give 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:43.050
 a leap will go up the step the law that neither 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.630
 the smell of it did indeed I'm square 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.580
 you are walking around the team're very 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:48.660
 show the ball the smell of car is over 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.690
 Let's talk, let's see if we can 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.630
 flying like that he ended up killing himself there 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.600
 No, he committed suicide to see. 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.740
 I taught some of this, we did some tests 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.140
 Aline 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.030
 remembering that when you enter the 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.480
 time, then you get totally stuck 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.490
 for you to leave only by committing suicide 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.860
 like I said it's blitz that will not 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:13.880
 change nothing in the game just not be the fun 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.390
 You're exploring places there. 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.980
 different ne 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.410
 I do not know suddenly has an easter egg 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.980
 inside a car that of a vehicle 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.980
 This is no trouble, always try. 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:29.820
 explore non- exploitable sites and gta5 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.480
 even because the gta5 bug has to spare in the 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.010
 guys 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.990
 You 're watching the whole thing taking a 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.810
 Little here that the full has run out 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:40.020
 committing suicide and was trying to see if it was to 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:43.840
 people go do something different there 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.910
 even because I was stuck in Tahiti but 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.520
 It's very cool, the guys, a lot of ball show. 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.770
 the team though had already had 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.280
 exploited tyton in other opportunities 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:56.860
 in other updates but this one I think 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.140
 that the easiest way is not this form of 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.650
 bruce is the easiest way and is 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.540
 exploring places there differently I do not know 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.960
 suddenly we try in the future 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:10.270
 to enter houses in some places there 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:12.940
 through the square 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:15.190
 even because you know if you push the 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.200
 square for it to rise somewhere and 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.240
 service request 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.370
 It's kind of complicated, I think I can 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.320
 you do something different because 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.200
 it gives a medium like bulgaria on the wall 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.210
 So explore and your friends we have 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.160
 comments get something 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.170
 different have had for sure 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.510
 bringing you as you saw me 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:37.150
 I started to fall out of nowhere at this time 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.980
 I arrived I was already flying with the plane and 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.320
 ended up dying out of nowhere 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.690
 Lawyer monstra and now I'll show you 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.700
 you the last vehicle that is a chartered 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.680
 I found it out of nowhere the same. 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.260
 I thought it was nice too. 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.060
 explore it and bring it to you and this 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:53.890
