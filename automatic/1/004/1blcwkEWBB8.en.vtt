00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hi my name is gabriel de java 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.460
 technologies in this video I'm going to 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.340
 explain how to do to install a 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.280
 solid state hard drive in a 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:15.750
 notebook in this example we have once 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.310
 the model is 15 25 what happens 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.140
 normally for example with this 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.420
 notebook with the hp with which I am 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.160
 currently closing 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.500
 is that the hard disk is installed in the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.260
 bottom part or here as we can 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.050
 see if we remove the cap obviously here already 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.480
 to gain time I have removed the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.730
 screws and I left things pretty 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.530
 by hand as we can see the hard drive 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.120
 highlighted on this side then what 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.220
 what we have to do in this case is 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.220
 push forward 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.450
 we look up 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.920
 and the hard drive comes out as we can see 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.990
 here and contacted me here 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.690
 obviously it would be the disk and the disk 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.180
 rigid connects on this side here 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.850
 then it is very easy to be able 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.550
 connect it since the hard disk one what 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.620
 You can connect to the connector without any 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.770
 kind of problem and one can verify 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.930
 that the connector is properly connected and in 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.300
 change with his we have the following 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.640
 inconvenient now I'll show you the 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.610
 hard disk goes from this side or is not 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.619
 you can remove the back cover as 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.320
 we have the other notebook, but here 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.880
 we can see that it is here the lid but here 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.430
 gives we can only access the 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.380
 memory and the processor and that is not 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.020
 our case now let's concentrate 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.880
 on the hard disk in this case the disk 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.119
 rigid can only be removed from the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.410
 cost then what we do is 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.619
 remove the screws that we have here 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:46.780
 obviously and we take out the hard disk and 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.700
 there we can connect it in this case 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.500
 we are installing a hard disk of 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:55.620
 solid state brand kingston 120 gb 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.990
 As we can see we have in the box the 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.020
 problem is the following normally 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.390
 this type of hard drive that carries the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.580
 machine is and is a metal hard disk 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.179
 things from the commons and it's usually a 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:11.039
 little bigger than normal or in 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.220
 solid hard drives 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.430
 although the size is almost exactly what 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.740
 same but it has a few millimeters of 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.420
 difference then what happens that 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.690
 when we replace in this case already 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:29.090
 we took out the hard drive and put it on 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.769
 the support that we see here 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.569
 so that you can see I'm going to 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:36.430
 remove the screw side was 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.430
 subject then 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.910
 to this we remove the screw of both 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.390
 sides and as we can see 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.040
 the hard drives are practically 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:54.300
 same but as I told you out there for 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:56.580
 a few millimeters of difference can 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.470
 be that he does not make good contact in the 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.320
 notebook as it is in this case then 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.250
 as we can see almost the height is the 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.250
 same if we put it 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.440
 next to 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.269
 basically it has the same height but 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.849
 a few millimeters of difference 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.620
 then in this case the difficulty that 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.680
 there with this model is the following if 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.920
 one puts it without disassembling the machine to 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.290
 hard drive and we try to fit well 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.000
 we're going to have problems that we're going to 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.040
 make good contact with the connector 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.189
 would be the attack the serial connector ata 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:35.579
 is here in the case as we could 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:37.650
 see in the first case in the hp notebook 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.389
 we have the acanthosis connector when one 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.250
 puts the hard disk there is no problem one 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.349
 you can see it but here in this case 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.959
 do not know what's happening inside with the connector 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.269
 then the easiest solution and 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.879
 practice is to remove the screws to all 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.819
 the lid and try to lift it up a bit 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:54.329
 here to see the connector that is 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.370
 in 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:58.829
 in this case I will put again the 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.569
 hard disk like it was before so 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.730
 I can show how this works 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:06.349
 then we can 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.349
 of family on this side 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.640
 we put there is we put the screws 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.489
 on both sides it only takes them 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.829
 here on the plastic side where does the 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:20.540
 stand and the other side is grabbed 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.850
 with the metal bit of it 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:26.419
 support this as we can see we have 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:29.330
 could some millimeters up the 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:32.000
 metal support thing that you can with the 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.290
 another does not happen that everything is directly 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.330
 at the same height 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:38.389
 then to solve the problem this one 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.360
 what we are going to do is we are going to lift 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.789
 a little the lid 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.340
 from above obviously and what are we going to 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:47.199
 place is the hard disk so the only one 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.020
 way to verify that in contact with 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:52.240
 serenade could have entered the disk 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.400
 rigid without any inconvenience 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.849
 without more like putting a flashlight 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.750
 verify that everything is correct and that 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:05.319
 it would be all once we did that 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:07.210
 we can verify of igniting the norm and 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:08.910
 see that the windows start once 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.340
 windows plugin 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.050
 that means that that means that 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.800
 respect the hard drive and how can we 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:20.440
 see here I boot perfectly 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.889
 and basically that would be all for this 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.419
 nature team this is one of the most 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.370
 complicated to put this kind of 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:30.129
 hard drive because you have to make a 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.229
 a little more work and normal but 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:35.050
 that would be everything and I hope that I have 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:37.750
 liked this video any doubt that 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.300
