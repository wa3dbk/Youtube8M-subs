that<00:00:44.489> first<00:00:44.700> bounce<00:00:45.000> you're<00:00:45.210> not<00:00:45.329> getting<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
that first bounce you're not getting the

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.819 
that first bounce you're not getting the
 you<00:00:45.930> can't<00:00:46.140> grab<00:00:46.289> with<00:00:46.530> your<00:00:46.559> hand

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
 you can't grab with your hand

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.130 
 you can't grab with your hand
nothing<00:00:47.219> it's<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:47.780> it's<00:00:48.780> going<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.960> bounce

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
nothing it's just it's going to bounce

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.660 
nothing it's just it's going to bounce
and<00:00:49.530> you're<00:00:49.829> gonna<00:00:49.950> wait<00:00:50.160> until<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.460> settles

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
and you're gonna wait until it settles

way if somebody's playing the trap you

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.660 
way if somebody's playing the trap you
can<00:01:33.570> be<00:01:33.659> like<00:01:33.840> our<00:01:34.079> eight<00:01:34.290> boys<00:01:34.470> go<00:01:34.890> go<00:01:35.430> right

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
can be like our eight boys go go right

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.719 
can be like our eight boys go go right
now<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.119> then<00:01:36.740> flick<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.430> can<00:01:38.549> be<00:01:38.640> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
now and then flick it in you can be the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.980 
now and then flick it in you can be the
first<00:01:38.939> ones<00:01:39.150> there<00:01:39.210> right<00:01:39.570> cuz<00:01:39.750> they're<00:01:39.900> all

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
first ones there right cuz they're all

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.780 
first ones there right cuz they're all
standing<00:01:40.259> at<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.560> blue<00:01:40.710> line<00:01:40.740> anyway<00:01:41.520> that's

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
standing at the blue line anyway that's

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.490 
standing at the blue line anyway that's
my<00:01:41.909> idea<00:01:42.450> that's<00:01:42.750> what<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:42.960> think<00:01:43.170> they<00:01:43.290> should

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
my idea that's what I think they should

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.740 
my idea that's what I think they should
do<00:01:43.619> fix<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.100> animation<00:01:44.640> bouncy<00:01:45.360> it's

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
do fix the animation bouncy it's

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.380

screw<00:01:46.110> sky<00:01:46.380> play<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.649> normal<00:01:46.890> defense<00:01:47.520> but<00:01:48.270> it

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
screw sky play a normal defense but it

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.639 
screw sky play a normal defense but it
does<00:01:48.570> help<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.930> against<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.259> guy<00:01:49.409> playing

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649

cheap<00:01:49.950> defense<00:01:50.460> but<00:01:51.119> i<00:01:51.420> think<00:01:52.049> i<00:01:52.350> think<00:01:52.710> my

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
cheap defense but i think i think my

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.010 
cheap defense but i think i think my
idea<00:01:53.520> would<00:01:53.700> fix<00:01:53.970> both<00:01:54.210> sides<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.689> thing<00:01:54.840> I

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020
