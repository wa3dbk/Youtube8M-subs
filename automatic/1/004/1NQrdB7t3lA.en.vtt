now<00:00:24.990> for<00:00:25.289> about<00:00:26.090> I've<00:00:27.090> been<00:00:27.300> about<00:00:27.480> three

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
now for about I've been about three

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.530 
now for about I've been about three
tests<00:00:28.260> since<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.710> started<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:30.119> de<00:00:32.540> Fonteyn

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
tests since I started it is de Fonteyn

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.190 
tests since I started it is de Fonteyn
late<00:00:33.930> teens<00:00:34.290> Tamar<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.200> the

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
late teens Tamar on that and so the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.970 
late teens Tamar on that and so the
ammonia<00:00:38.100> has<00:00:38.250> been<00:00:38.600> zilch<00:00:39.710> basically<00:00:40.710> for<00:00:40.890> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
ammonia has been zilch basically for the

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.889 
ammonia has been zilch basically for the
entire<00:00:41.309> time<00:00:41.579> like<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.329> tank<00:00:42.540> buddy<00:00:42.719> I'm

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
entire time like the tank buddy I'm

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.660 
never seen the loneliest bike may be
done<00:00:45.120> because<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.510> used<00:00:46.160> fully<00:00:47.160> cured<00:00:47.460> live

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
done because I used fully cured live

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.270

rock<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.090> have<00:00:48.210> some<00:00:48.450> book<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> tiny<00:00:49.829> bit<00:00:50.190> of

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
rock and have some book so a tiny bit of

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.569 
rock and have some book so a tiny bit of
nitrates<00:00:50.730> of<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.910> star<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:51.420> they<00:00:51.570> went<00:00:52.579> and

nitrates of the star but they went and

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.660 
nitrates of the star but they went and
so<00:00:54.449> nitrites<00:00:55.020> rather<00:00:55.469> they<00:00:55.890> went<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.460> then

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
so nitrites rather they went and then

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.170 
so nitrites rather they went and then
nitrates<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:58.309> highest<00:00:59.309> I've<00:00:59.489> ever<00:00:59.579> seen<00:00:59.940> them

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
nitrates and highest I've ever seen them

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.920 
nitrates and highest I've ever seen them
go<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:01.399> 22.5<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:03.329> now<00:01:03.449> they're<00:01:03.719> just

holding<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:05.150> 1122<00:01:06.500> so<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.530> thought<00:01:07.799> yeah<00:01:08.130> why

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
holding that 1122 so I thought yeah why

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.399 
holding that 1122 so I thought yeah why
not<00:01:08.729> let's<00:01:09.060> go<00:01:09.450> pop<00:01:09.750> some<00:01:09.780> stuff<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:11.840> and<00:01:12.840> then

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
not let's go pop some stuff in and then

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.010 
not let's go pop some stuff in and then
