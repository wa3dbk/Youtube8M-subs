 ABC and its external design is like 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.150
 on previously published by the same publisher 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:34.380
 comics 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:37.290
 keepers that is comics we also have 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:41.160
 dust jacket and sealed in film 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.940
 let's take it off and look at the comics 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.940
 more 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:57.600
 we have 10 original comics 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:03.379
 Releases from May you are waiting 8 2 y 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.379
 till march 1800 1989 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:12.360
 in 2006 a film was released on this 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:16.939
 a comic that I only looked at 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.939
 the beginning of 2014 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.680
 here is this movie let's say he 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:31.850
 left me indifferent since i 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:35.220
 I did not understand this very idea of ​​the film 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:38.909
 in spite of the fact that I like it 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:43.320
 film movies and computer games 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:48.090
 in the genre of dystopia that is it such 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:53.040
 films like hummingbirds mind matrix judge dread 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:55.710
 both old and new throne heritage 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.009
 well, you can continue to play for a long time 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.130
 such as mirrors edge too 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:04.770
 series of games bioshock series of games dsx 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.259
 they all differ as a movie so a game 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:13.580
 in terms of their level of development 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:18.420
 elaborate setting leave so 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:23.010
 Well, the film was shot in general, not bad 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.380
 the fighting scenes there were good let's say so 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.560
 but as I said the idea of the film 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.100
 it turned out for me not understood maybe 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.100
 read the comic i will change my mind 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:42.570
 in relation to the movie yes and the comics i 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:46.020
 I think I like it here comics mean 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.510
 In intent, it was previously released in Russia 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.450
 amphora publishing house 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.570
 but there were no additional materials 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.550
 and there was a slightly different format 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:03:02.280
 here we have 416 pages 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:05.720
 also added various 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:10.050
 Additional materials 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:19.950
 here's a comic book we have a dust jacket here on 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:21.980
 valves we also have some opinions here 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:28.110
 people given comic 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:33.570
 here is the abstract comics itself without 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:36.510
 dust jacket comic looks quite 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:41.700
 succinctly here such here 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:44.700
 mask image here we have nothing 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:50.239
 and at the end of here is the actual name 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.239
 comics authors logo publishing 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.760
 circulation of this comic 10,000 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.760
 copies 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.280
 but I think as well as with the custodians 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.070
 there will be an additional reprint 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:17.040
 circulation therefore it will always be possible 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:24.050
 purchase the present edition in it 416 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:32.700
 pages of paper like march war 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:35.690
 so rougher well here here as well 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:42.860
 many different sketches of some 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:42.860
 notes I think it will be all interesting 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.370
 interesting to read 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.220
 so well actually all comics are all 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.550
 Of course they will not show as 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:11.660
 there are many pages of their own some opinion 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:17.020
 I expressed here actually on this video 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:20.140
 I think you can finish before the new meetings 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.140
 bye everyone
