00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.439 

so<00:00:01.380> I<00:00:01.410> continued<00:00:01.770> with<00:00:01.890> harmonics<00:00:02.399> so<00:00:02.730> we've

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
so I continued with harmonics so we've

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.210 
so I continued with harmonics so we've
got<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.659> basic<00:00:03.959> building<00:00:04.110> block<00:00:04.470> so<00:00:04.710> we<00:00:04.859> now

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
got the basic building block so we now

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.039 
got the basic building block so we now
know<00:00:05.400> that<00:00:05.430> we<00:00:05.609> can<00:00:05.759> sort<00:00:06.120> of<00:00:06.180> go<00:00:06.359> up<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.960> the

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
know that we can sort of go up to the

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.330 
know that we can sort of go up to the
octave<00:00:07.319> up<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.680> fifth<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.010> out<00:00:08.099> of<00:00:08.250> the

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
octave up to the fifth and out of the

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.330 
octave up to the fifth and out of the
doctors<00:00:08.910> above<00:00:09.150> that<00:00:09.360> and<00:00:09.860> then<00:00:10.860> you<00:00:11.010> what<00:00:11.250> you

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
doctors above that and then you what you

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.919 
doctors above that and then you what you
do<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.550> you<00:00:11.700> work<00:00:11.880> up<00:00:12.090> chromatically<00:00:12.389> so<00:00:12.840> you

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
do is you work up chromatically so you

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:27.710 
do is you work up chromatically so you
start<00:00:13.200> with<00:00:13.230> your<00:00:13.349> bean<00:00:13.530> frap<00:00:25.970> and<00:00:26.970> just<00:00:27.539> eat

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
start with your bean frap and just eat

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.419 
start with your bean frap and just eat
as<00:00:27.930> i<00:00:27.960> say<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:28.230> can<00:00:28.470> create<00:00:28.740> your<00:00:28.830> own<00:00:28.980> kind<00:00:29.310> of

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
as i say you can create your own kind of

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:40.540 
as i say you can create your own kind of
little<00:00:29.670> pattern<00:00:29.939> whether<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.179> want<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.359> go

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.720 

all<00:00:40.899> etc<00:00:41.899> and<00:00:42.110> as<00:00:42.469> you<00:00:42.680> go<00:00:42.860> you'll<00:00:43.340> get<00:00:43.579> more

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
all etc and as you go you'll get more

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.220 
all etc and as you go you'll get more
tense<00:00:44.030> so<00:00:44.480> you're<00:00:44.600> trying<00:00:44.720> to<00:00:44.809> counteract

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
tense so you're trying to counteract

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.350 
tense so you're trying to counteract
that<00:00:45.320> by<00:00:45.559> being<00:00:45.739> more<00:00:45.890> relaxed<00:00:46.340> and<00:00:46.489> then<00:00:47.180> what

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
that by being more relaxed and then what

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.720 
that by being more relaxed and then what
you<00:00:47.480> got<00:00:47.629> is<00:00:47.809> your<00:00:48.140> ability<00:00:48.320> to<00:00:48.590> go<00:00:49.280> further<00:00:49.550> up

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
you got is your ability to go further up

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.250 
you got is your ability to go further up
the<00:00:49.879> instrument<00:00:50.329> and<00:00:50.510> then<00:00:50.780> once<00:00:50.930> you've<00:00:51.079> got

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
the instrument and then once you've got

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.139 
the instrument and then once you've got
that<00:00:51.290> you've<00:00:51.769> done<00:00:51.949> your<00:00:52.070> harmonics<00:00:52.519> then<00:00:53.000> you

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
that you've done your harmonics then you

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.330 
that you've done your harmonics then you
can<00:00:53.329> you<00:00:53.989> can<00:00:54.140> look<00:00:54.320> for<00:00:54.350> your<00:00:54.590> finger<00:00:54.949> out<00:00:55.160> of

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
can you can look for your finger out of

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.000 
can you can look for your finger out of
my<00:00:55.670> register<00:00:56.149> and<00:00:56.390> what<00:00:56.510> you<00:00:56.600> find<00:00:56.750> is<00:00:56.930> that

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
my register and what you find is that

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.410 
my register and what you find is that
any<00:00:58.010> your<00:00:58.489> for<00:00:58.699> the<00:00:58.760> first<00:00:58.970> time<00:00:59.120> be<00:00:59.239> able<00:00:59.360> to

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
any your for the first time be able to

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.090 
any your for the first time be able to
play<00:00:59.510> them<00:00:59.780> or<00:01:00.019> when<00:01:00.230> you<00:01:00.320> play<00:01:00.500> them<00:01:00.710> the

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
play them or when you play them the

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.799 
play them or when you play them the
slightly<00:01:01.400> fatter<00:01:01.730> a<00:01:02.059> bit<00:01:02.480> more<00:01:02.570> substantial

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
slightly fatter a bit more substantial

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:14.340 
slightly fatter a bit more substantial
so<00:01:03.500> the<00:01:04.309> last<00:01:04.790> finger<00:01:05.119> that<00:01:05.239> know<00:01:05.930> is<00:01:06.110> kind<00:01:06.320> of

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:25.899 

f30<00:01:15.350> Delta<00:01:15.649> G

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.340 

then<00:01:26.909> you<00:01:27.030> can<00:01:27.180> once<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.930> got<00:01:28.079> to<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.289> stage

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
then you can once you got to that stage

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.870 
then you can once you got to that stage
and<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:29.009> quite<00:01:29.159> happily<00:01:29.189> we<00:01:29.610> get<00:01:29.759> all

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
and you can quite happily we get all

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.219 
and you can quite happily we get all
those<00:01:29.969> notes<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:30.509> you<00:01:30.600> can<00:01:30.719> start<00:01:30.899> having<00:01:31.110> a

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
those notes then you can start having a

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.350 
those notes then you can start having a
bit<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.469> play<00:01:31.649> around<00:01:31.820> with<00:01:32.820> your<00:01:32.909> harmonics

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
bit of a play around with your harmonics

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.510 
bit of a play around with your harmonics
or<00:01:33.539> what<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.409> if<00:01:34.890> i'm<00:01:35.130> doing<00:01:35.310> my

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
or what have you so if i'm doing my

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.700 
or what have you so if i'm doing my
harmonics<00:01:35.939> i<00:01:36.030> tend<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.299> go<00:01:36.509> right<00:01:37.200> up<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.469> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
harmonics i tend to go right up to the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:02:03.080 
harmonics i tend to go right up to the
top<00:01:59.959> yeah<00:02:00.959> did<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.709> bit<00:02:01.950> although<00:02:02.130> my<00:02:02.429> ears<00:02:02.610> all

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
top yeah did a bit although my ears all

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.850 
top yeah did a bit although my ears all
right<00:02:03.209> so<00:02:03.420> that's<00:02:03.929> all<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.229> harmonics<00:02:04.709> and

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
right so that's all you harmonics and

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.620 
right so that's all you harmonics and
once<00:02:05.009> you've<00:02:05.159> got<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.369> then<00:02:06.209> you<00:02:06.329> can<00:02:06.479> start

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
once you've got that then you can start

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:14.240 
once you've got that then you can start
to<00:02:06.780> play<00:02:06.959> around<00:02:07.079> with<00:02:07.380> me<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:12.720> I'll<00:02:13.560> go<00:02:13.860> on<00:02:14.069> to

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
to play around with me and I'll go on to

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.150 
to play around with me and I'll go on to
my<00:02:14.340> next<00:02:14.370> sort<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.849> topic
