00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:15.949
 well I'm back with you so a few days good afternoon good evening 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:17.360
 I do not know when 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.230
 you are going to use this video 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.900
 for the correction of the exercise 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.800
 we are going to cycle the sadam down to the fade 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.080
 ribó furanos a 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.630
 and we will also see 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.039
 the afternoon 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.580
 ribó furanos 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.410
 It is a 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.410
 aldo 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.130
 sucker 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.340
 and as we study in class the windy palms 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.840
 they are going to give 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.430
 furans as 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.410
 when they are assigned 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.730
 that is to say 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:54.780
 rings 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.780
 five sides 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.290
 hexagonal 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.550
 the link in me makes such that it is going to form 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.270
 it will be 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.520
 between 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.060
 the carbon 1 that is the one that has the functional group 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.090
 I was here 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.260
 and the asymmetric carbon furthest from that functional group 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.620
 the asymmetric carbons of the arrival sa are those that I have just painted 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.140
 with a red dot 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.320
 Thus 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.570
 the carbon 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.570
 will be this one 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.350
 the link in my accepted as I said is formed between carbon one and the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.450
 carbon 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.130
 4 in this case this would be carbon 4 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.600
 so let's approximate the ones we're going to be forming 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.470
 the figure 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.480
 from the pentagon 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.370
 One Two Three Four Five 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.370
 here we put the group to the finger 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.139
 here the oaks 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.729
 this will be coal or two 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.989
 this will be the coal or three and this the fourth carbon 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.729
 we mark here also 

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:21.959
 we see 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.909
 what is going to be coal or two 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.429
 is directed towards 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:29.529
 right in this image 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:32.089
 therefore in clear training 

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:34.689
 will be down since we usually 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.169
 turn the molecule 90 degrees to know what will be 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:40.919
 the final provision 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:44.019
 of the bear hs in the molecule yes clear 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.089
 casique 

00:02:45.089 --> 00:02:46.629
 will be down 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:51.339
 the carbon 3 will also be forgiveness the wache of carbon 3 

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:54.769
 it will also be down 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:00.209
 this pocho of carbon 4 we put it as we want because it will not be there 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.239
 definitely 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.999
 fill the hydrogens 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:07.759
 and now remember 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:10.229
 when the link is formed, it affects me 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:11.779
 this oasis 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:14.399
 is going to come to carbon one 

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:16.180
 and this fox and geno 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.180
 will do 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:22.849
 so 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:24.299
 what 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.619
 we will stay 

00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:29.619
 the next molecule 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.329
 He also remembered that we used to swell this a little 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.869
 why 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:44.509
 the projections of jaguars 

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:48.479
 they tell us that these carbon stagnates forward in this case 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:51.479
 up in the plane of the paper 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:54.989
 we can 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.999
 the corresponding records the hoaxes is 

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:00.439
 that were going down 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:02.889
 two hydrogens up 

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.299
 here the gh 2 80 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:06.939
 here the hydrogen 

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:09.939
 and now like what we're going to 

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:13.629
 hugo have is the alpha form 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:15.969
 we put this oh 

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:19.429
 that has gone to carbon one we propose in the opposite direction 

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:22.249
 this one is h 2 oh 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:24.879
 and so we have the homeroom bread 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.259
 remember 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:29.259
 arno mere 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.669
 the healthy ones were the alpha and beta forms 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.379
 and here the hydrogen 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:41.879
 imagine we would have loved 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.340
 formulate 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.729
 of afternoon ribó furanos ap 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.960
 is the one that I think I've sent in class 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.789
 we would put the oh up 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.789
 and he h 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:04:58.379
 in green we would have 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:01.379
 of the number 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.219
 good that you thought interesting 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:10.949
 at least instructive 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.960
 Well, here's the example, I blew an example about 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.930
 as I know, of course 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:17.580
 sucker
