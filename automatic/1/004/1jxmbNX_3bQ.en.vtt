00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:37.280
 tweet is the subject and very very simple 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.379
 the truth really simple but it's from 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.600
 those that most people ask to give it a 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:45.229

 team that have to be patient and 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.100

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.450
 we are going let's block our 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.890
 screen and once we unlock it 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.900
 how can you tell where it says 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.760
 where it says to unlock the 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.830

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.830
 corp in this part here down there 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:53.040
 You do not see much because it's the same 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:56.040
 this shading I will try to change 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.750
 with another one because the background is black 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.090
 that's why you can hardly see it but that's where it says news 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.220
 corp 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.950

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.750
