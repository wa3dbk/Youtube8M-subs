00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 what technology you should take to the 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.420
 your living room plasma arrived more 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.120
 time 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.099
 after it came lcd and an lcd 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.980
 backlit by leds 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.830
 here comes the oled soon see 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.920
 the screens on your TV today and the 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.920
 future 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.769
 one of the main questions at the time of 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.109
 to choose a thin-screen TV is to know 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.189
 which technology best matches your 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.189
 need 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.309
 today there are three that dominate the market 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:39.690
 lcd and led plasma but there is already something 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.270
 new coming around in this world of 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.129
 thin TVs and high resolution the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.420
 plasma televisions were the first to 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.460
 appear on the market 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.590
 usually only available in 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.550
 larger sizes from 50 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.860
 inches 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.180
 plasma tvs are indicated 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.120
 for environments where you can 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.399
 control the light intensity and this 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.710
 will favor all the color fidelity 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.840
 and high contrast of plasma already in a 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.119
 light spot the reflections on the screen 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.979
 can be very disruptive and 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.740
 main quality of the appliance 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.380
 but do not be fooled by plasma tvs 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.049
 offers difficult picture quality 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.350
 to be overcome in general the image of 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.350
 Plasmas is higher than lcds and leds 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.680
 see the main advantages and 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.460
 disadvantages of choosing a TV from 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.680
 plasma 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.140
 thanks to the emission of light by the 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.259
 screen provides better brightness 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.900
 contrast and great resolution in the 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.850
 black plasma is really black and 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.100
 end you have a better viewing angle 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.759
 pleasing all viewers of the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.460
 living room 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.049
 the main disadvantage of plasma is that 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.640
 it has a shorter service life 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.829
 in addition the plasma devices 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.720
 usually a little thicker 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.720
 heavier and heavier 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.079
 lcd eventually became more popular 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.060
 than plasma because they are less bright 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.429
 lcd tvs do better in 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.770
 clearer environments or even that 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.899
 there is a window on your tv you 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.880
 you see - reflection in the image when 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.280
 compared to what happens with plasmas 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.530
 the lcd tvs and practically do not have 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.500
 limitations on screen size 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.950
 so the flexibility of choice is very 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.950
 bigger 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.650
 one of the biggest advantages of lcd is 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.879
 the appliance is suitable for 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.459
 any environment 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.469
 energy consumption is low wear 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.260
 of the screen is smaller than in the 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:35.489
 plasma and lcd allows enough screens 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.650
 thin and light 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.989
 On the other hand the lcd offers smaller 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.939
 lower angle of view 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.349
 perceived mainly in the parts 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.750
 black image 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.669
 and depending on the model the lack of 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.969
 uniformity of back light to light 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:52.980
 can deform the image a little 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:55.049
 as black and an lcd is not so black 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.579
 so all other colors too 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.579
 lose some strength 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.670
 currently the most modern televisions in 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.480
 Brazilian market are led models 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:09.670
 in practice a led tv is an lcd tv 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.890
 only the rear illumination of the screen is 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.050
 made by LEDs and not by 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.190
 blooming type used in the tvs cells 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.170
 conventional 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.420
 this substitution makes it possible 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.630
 manufacture much more children 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.840
 for models up to 55 inches to the TVs 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.250
 only three centimeters thick 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.170
 just like the lcd tvs 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.180
 the LED devices adapt to 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.360
 environment and conditions of 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.360
 luminosity 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.799
 LED TVs have a low consumption 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.049
 power 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.319
 but the main advantages lie in the 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:46.900
 uniformity of the rear light with LEDs 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:49.060
 better resolution and lower thickness 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.170
 the LEDs occupy less space than the 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.239
 that the lamps 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.180
 maybe the negative point of led tvs 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.849
 still be the price because it is a 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.900
 relatively new technology the cost 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.900
 It's still taller 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:08.299
 now the great novelty the oled screens of 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:11.030
 English the acronym stands for organic light 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:13.640
 emitting diode or organic diode of 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.980
 light emission oled is already present 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.870
 on smartphone screens and from the beginning 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.209
 of the year began to appear the first 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.360
 monitors and large televisions 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:26.389
 with new technology other than lcd and 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.060
 oled tvs do not need to 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.220
 any back lighting the pixels 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.020
 lights individually when a 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.080
 electric current passes through them 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:39.110
 ie the led has its own light emission 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.030
 do not need primitive bulbs 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.550
 the big obstacle for oled tvs 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.160
 It's still the price for you to have an idea. 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:49.160
 these 55-inch models from samsung 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.139
 and the lg we showed here at the beginning 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.870
 of the year are expected to reach US stores 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:57.830
 in the second half and should cost close 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:00.139
 of seven thousand dollars or 14 thousand reais 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.190
 you can imagine how much they would cost 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:03.190
 in the shops around here 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:08.610
 the advantages of oled screens are many 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.100
 but among the main ones we can highlight 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.500
 the brightness better the contrast and 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:15.930
 fidelity of color reproduction by 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.940
 do not require back lighting. 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.889
 oled tvs are super thin 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.630
 some models have less than two 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.630
 centimeters thick 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:28.710
 but there are prototypes of up to half a centimeter 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.720
 the viewing angle is total 180 degrees 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:32.900
 Another feature is that the panels 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.139
 can be flexible and even 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.870
 transparent 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.669
 counter attack is really the price per 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.190
 this led is still something for the future 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.260
 we even have a model being sold 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.020
 here in Brazil later this year but should 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:51.300
 arrive costing close to 20 thousand reais 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:53.430
 It's soft now that you already know everything. 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.979
 about tv technologies 

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:58.560
 thin on your device 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:00.930
 Do you think you made the right choice? 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.010
 digital look dot com due to its 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.020
 experience with us 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.400
 take the opportunity to check out the lab 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.350
 digital with the main tvs 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:11.330
 of the Brazilian market 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.330
 we did the test confirm
