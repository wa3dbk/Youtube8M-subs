attack<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.819> when<00:01:24.330> you're<00:01:24.509> here<00:01:24.659> but<00:01:24.929> you<00:01:25.799> know

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
attack you when you're here but you know

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.559 
attack you when you're here but you know
it's<00:01:26.250> good<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:26.520> play<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.940> friends<00:01:27.209> and<00:01:27.299> stuff

00:01:27.559 --> 00:01:27.569

it's good to play the friends and stuff
so<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.709> think<00:01:29.039> you<00:01:29.159> can<00:01:29.190> hold<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.789> off<00:01:29.880> but<00:01:30.810> it

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
so you think you can hold it off but it

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.109 
so you think you can hold it off but it
really<00:01:31.319> is<00:01:31.530> up<00:01:31.649> to<00:01:31.709> you<00:01:32.009> I'll<00:01:32.549> just<00:01:32.880> place<00:01:33.090> that

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
really is up to you I'll just place that

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.230 
really is up to you I'll just place that
there<00:01:33.539> and<00:01:33.780> for<00:01:34.649> now<00:01:34.740> run<00:01:35.039> around<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.399> bit<00:01:35.549> but<00:01:35.850> I

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
there and for now run around a bit but I

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.719 
there and for now run around a bit but I
mean<00:01:36.810> cuz<00:01:37.349> the<00:01:37.530> trick<00:01:37.739> is<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.099> my<00:01:38.190> opinion<00:01:38.310> just

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
mean cuz the trick is in my opinion just

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.309 
mean cuz the trick is in my opinion just
get<00:01:39.119> as<00:01:39.209> many<00:01:39.360> colors<00:01:39.569> as<00:01:39.690> you<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:40.019> with<00:01:40.200> is

00:01:40.309 --> 00:01:40.319 
get as many colors as you can with is

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:42.919 
get as many colors as you can with is
hardly<00:01:40.649> an<00:01:40.800> uninfected<00:01:41.360> that<00:01:42.360> ways<00:01:42.599> easier

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
hardly an uninfected that ways easier

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:44.570 
hardly an uninfected that ways easier
when<00:01:43.349> there's<00:01:43.500> more<00:01:43.649> people<00:01:43.920> infected<00:01:44.190> for

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
when there's more people infected for

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.880 
when there's more people infected for
you<00:01:44.789> to<00:01:45.149> get<00:01:45.330> the<00:01:45.959> DNA<00:01:46.259> bomb<00:01:46.590> because

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
you to get the DNA bomb because

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.290 
you to get the DNA bomb because
obviously<00:01:47.280> there's<00:01:47.759> less<00:01:48.450> kills<00:01:48.720> TV<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:50.300> what

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
obviously there's less kills TV and what

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.330 
obviously there's less kills TV and what
is<00:01:51.450> he<00:01:51.599> trying<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.929> do<00:01:52.110> s<00:01:52.410> estimation<00:01:53.099> I<00:01:53.160> don't

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
is he trying to do s estimation I don't

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.850 
is he trying to do s estimation I don't
think<00:01:53.550> so<00:01:53.729> mate<00:01:53.940> you<00:01:54.119> don't<00:01:54.269> work<00:01:54.450> like<00:01:54.479> that
