00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.900
 hello friends today we want you 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.000
 introduce our new heading in 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.470
 spotlight which we will 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.419
 talk about that game 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.550
 which is in alpha or 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.760
 beta and which produced more 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.760
 impressions we will begin today 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.860
 let's talk about next car game heritage 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.559
 flatout felt not so much from the garage as 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.379
 already loading screen before your eyes 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.820
 cling pictures clash of two 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:52.280
 dilapidated cars from which 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.720
 different sides fly around parts 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.000
 body warm wave 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.220
 anticipation but main menu quickly 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.710
 sober developers really hurry 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.780
 flaunt your creation therefore 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.440
 the features of such an early version are strongly 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.810
 are limited 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.970
 we only have two cars to choose from 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.890
 heavy clumsy muscle car 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.229
 caught times and richard nixon and 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.390
 Mr. Bean's little bright car 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.500
 you can try them out on three maps 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.000
 george arena 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.580
 rough terrain and over 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.680
 asphalt road meaning ride 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.660
 what's in flatout what's next car game 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.819
 on small cars that fly away 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.069
 ditch from the slightest breeze I 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:30.229
 never understood yet here 

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:30.950
 stimulator formula 1 where every second 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.470
 on account 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.750
 any mistake with full pay off nitrogen 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.060
 who generously issued for collisions with 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.910
 opponents and who have not yet delivered in 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.520
 on x car game so much as safer 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.530
 ride a powerful narrow ukkari given 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.660
 numerous herd of horses under the hood and 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.990
 rear wheel drive car and incredible traction 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:53.179
 and endless drift but what are these 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.330
 the most by the nose and I would even say 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.550
 big drifts because it's 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.950
 the first game in our memory where they 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.140
 fully controlled and reaching the sides 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.300
 the machine does not cause the desire to scream not 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.490
 believe 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.679
 usually drift in racing whether it be arcade 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.440
 pampering or serious car simulators 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.390
 presented pretty comical car 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.849
 either rush by god like on rails 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.290
 overtaking a lot by opponents either when 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.840
 the slightest touch of handbrake 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.060
 completely loses speed and sometimes 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.030
 rye bodie management managed to build 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.200
 skid to the rank of art machine obeys 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.599
 and dutifully execute any command 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.120
 to such obedience the first time is difficult 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.940
 get used to but get used to 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.739
 incredible pleasure from passing 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.690
 every sharp turn is understandable 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.430
 focus on the future 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.010
 the game and made just on the physical 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.300
 component but in general with her so far 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.670
 not so smooth 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.310
 level made up by a huge amount 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.209
 trash from old painted tires to 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.370
 billboards 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.959
 it all breaks perfectly and 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.819
 gradually littering the tracks 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.530
 to all of the above are added 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.299
 scattering in all directions during 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.519
 crash car parts 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:04.380
 and they fly from every car to 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.750
 so much good 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.090
 gouged one of her details could 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.980
 would collect at least three problems in 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.079
 that all this trash interacts with 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.640
 cars only once and then 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.910
 only visually at the level 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.560
 losing all of their physical properties is not 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.540
 usually respond to collision and 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.069
 fencing 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.709
 for example a concrete fence can be easily 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.390
 break but only half enough 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.459
 sturdy stuff is not just a little 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.579
 showered as it is in most games 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.819
 namely why it falls apart 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.079
 it does not develop through incomprehensibly 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.220
 metal bumpers and not at all 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.799
 react to cars 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.290
 apparently made from google adamanty 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.329
 help car damage model 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.760
 I want to scold praise at the same time 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.769
 on the one hand the car is very beautiful and 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.750
 realistically crumple but on the other 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.019
 continues to ride in the same condition 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.209
 which is not physically possible 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.609
 This is especially noticeable in the coat of arms and arena 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.560
 cars going on and quite well 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.120
 managed even when left only 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.010
 one rear end 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.650
 that is , there is no longer an engine 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.420
 the front chassis is not the driver himself on and 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.819
 the same arena fails artificial 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.459
 intelligence opponents love to ride 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.690
 reversing but it was removed one of 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.150
 most annoying 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.880
 features of the race for survival namely 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.019
 en masse attack on a player 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.760
 finally can normally knock 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:26.010
 in the arena don't feel helpless 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.450
 victim provided that 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.820
 maximum on the track can now 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:32.550
 be twenty four cars this 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:34.440
 Looks particularly relevant for early 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.630
 alpha versions difficult to do any 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.340
 conclusions too little material 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.020
 provided by developers 

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:41.940
 of course by the time of the official release 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.470
 over the game will try to technological 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.240
 plan 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.100
 vague backdrops will become beautiful 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.699
 cars will strictly follow the laws 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.100
 physicists 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.260
 much more important is another point which is in 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.090
 the game will have an atmosphere for the time being 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.080
 too serious and more like 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.360
 original snapped up 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.000
 while in the second part reigned 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.220
 fun hope that developers will take into account 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.650
 positive experience flatout 2 and I will not 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.199
 do high tech but at the same time 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.389
 boring car simulator and on this for sure 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.370
 all with you was the editorial jack heavy 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.169
 thanks for providing the material 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.680

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:20.120
 link in the description and now everything is exactly 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.120
 subscribe to the channel and all bye bye
