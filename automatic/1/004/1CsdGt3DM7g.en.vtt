00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.840 
Michael here at drawing teachers calm
let's<00:00:03.480> draw<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.720> name<00:00:03.929> Rebecca<00:00:04.400> Rebecca<00:00:05.400> has

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
let's draw the name Rebecca Rebecca has

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.610 
let's draw the name Rebecca Rebecca has
seven<00:00:06.180> letters<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.839> the<00:00:07.140> center<00:00:07.410> of<00:00:07.440> that

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
seven letters and the center of that

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.370 
seven letters and the center of that
mean<00:00:07.830> right<00:00:08.220> through<00:00:08.429> the<00:00:08.519> e<00:00:08.570> but<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.780> R<00:00:10.019> and

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
mean right through the e but the R and

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.080 
mean right through the e but the R and
the<00:00:10.469> B<00:00:10.710> they<00:00:11.370> tend<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.639> take<00:00:11.759> up<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.940> lot<00:00:12.059> of

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
the B they tend to take up a lot of

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.410 
the B they tend to take up a lot of
space<00:00:12.389> so<00:00:12.840> I'm<00:00:13.200> actually<00:00:13.380> going<00:00:13.740> to<00:00:14.240> start<00:00:15.240> the

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
space so I'm actually going to start the

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.550 
space so I'm actually going to start the
e<00:00:15.800> slightly<00:00:16.800> off-center<00:00:18.380> because<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.500> know

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
e slightly off-center because I know

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.070 
e slightly off-center because I know
that<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.039> C's<00:00:20.400> will<00:00:20.970> not<00:00:21.150> take<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> lot<00:00:21.869> of

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
that the C's will not take a lot of

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:31.730 
that the C's will not take a lot of
space<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:28.340> there<00:00:29.340> we<00:00:29.460> have<00:00:29.869> et<00:00:30.869> CA<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.619> I'm

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
space so there we have et CA and I'm

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:39.790 
space so there we have et CA and I'm
going<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.980> go<00:00:32.610> backwards<00:00:37.190> and<00:00:38.190> get<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.579> be

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
going to go backwards and get the be

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:47.770 
going to go backwards and get the be
another<00:00:40.800> e

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:57.130 

and<00:00:48.530> see<00:00:49.370> our

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.250 

alright<00:00:58.040> I'm<00:00:58.670> gonna<00:00:58.850> go<00:00:58.970> ahead<00:00:59.180> and<00:00:59.270> block

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
alright I'm gonna go ahead and block

00:01:00.260 --> 00:02:04.950 
alright I'm gonna go ahead and block
that<00:01:00.530> in

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.620 

so<00:02:05.960> here<00:02:06.530> we<00:02:06.650> have<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.890> our<00:02:07.010> and<00:02:07.940> we're<00:02:08.450> trying

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
so here we have the our and we're trying

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.480 
so here we have the our and we're trying
to<00:02:08.690> make<00:02:08.780> each<00:02:08.930> of<00:02:08.960> these<00:02:09.200> sweeping<00:02:09.860> parts<00:02:10.310> the

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
to make each of these sweeping parts the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.020 
to make each of these sweeping parts the
letters<00:02:12.070> have<00:02:13.070> things<00:02:13.310> in<00:02:13.460> common<00:02:13.820> with<00:02:13.850> the

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
letters have things in common with the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.210 
letters have things in common with the
other<00:02:14.150> so<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.660> bottoms<00:02:15.020> of<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.410> seeds<00:02:15.740> and

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
other so the bottoms of the seeds and

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.740 
other so the bottoms of the seeds and
the<00:02:16.430> tops<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.940> arse

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
the tops the arse

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.390 
the tops the arse
this<00:02:18.380> B<00:02:18.770> is<00:02:19.130> sort<00:02:19.940> of<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.060> reflection<00:02:20.240> of<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.350> e

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
this B is sort of a reflection of the e

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
this B is sort of a reflection of the e
da<00:02:22.400> has<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:22.910> thin<00:02:23.420> and<00:02:23.660> a<00:02:23.750> thick<00:02:24.970> that's<00:02:25.970> part<00:02:26.330> of

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
da has a thin and a thick that's part of

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.790 
da has a thin and a thick that's part of
what<00:02:26.630> you<00:02:26.750> try<00:02:26.960> to<00:02:26.990> do<00:02:27.260> is<00:02:27.500> you're<00:02:27.650> putting

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
what you try to do is you're putting

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.400 
what you try to do is you're putting
your<00:02:27.980> letters<00:02:28.250> together<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:30.050> give<00:02:30.200> them

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
your letters together to give them

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.860 
your letters together to give them
common<00:02:30.980> elements<00:02:31.550> so<00:02:32.210> they<00:02:32.360> look<00:02:32.540> like<00:02:32.570> they

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
common elements so they look like they

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.010 
common elements so they look like they
all<00:02:32.990> belong<00:02:33.290> together<00:02:34.510> so<00:02:35.510> now<00:02:35.630> I'll<00:02:35.780> take<00:02:35.960> a

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
all belong together so now I'll take a

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:50.700 
all belong together so now I'll take a
sharpie<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:40.870> zoom<00:02:41.870> in<00:02:42.080> a<00:02:42.140> little<00:02:42.260> bit<00:02:42.410> here

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:54.190 

all<00:02:51.710> right<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.360> we'll<00:02:53.360> go<00:02:53.480> ahead<00:02:53.570> and<00:02:53.720> outline

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
all right and we'll go ahead and outline

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.740 
all right and we'll go ahead and outline
on<00:02:54.440> this<00:02:54.710> sharpie<00:02:55.130> looks<00:02:55.400> still<00:02:56.270> pretty<00:02:56.510> sharp

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
on this sharpie looks still pretty sharp

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.910 
on this sharpie looks still pretty sharp
but<00:02:57.140> just<00:02:57.350> a<00:02:57.440> little<00:02:57.770> dull<00:02:59.440> so<00:03:00.440> I've<00:03:00.710> got<00:03:00.890> a
