know if you've used motoblur before it's

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.960 
know if you've used motoblur before it's
it's<00:02:22.350> interesting<00:02:22.770> it's<00:02:23.160> not<00:02:23.220> bad<00:02:23.550> on<00:02:23.820> this

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
it's interesting it's not bad on this

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.860 
it's interesting it's not bad on this
screen<00:02:24.270> that's<00:02:24.480> really<00:02:25.020> hard<00:02:25.470> to<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.920> think<00:02:26.880> be

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
screen that's really hard to I think be

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
screen that's really hard to I think be
worthwhile<00:02:29.180> I'm<00:02:30.180> not<00:02:30.450> crazy<00:02:30.720> about<00:02:30.870> it<00:02:31.290> but<00:02:31.560> I

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
worthwhile I'm not crazy about it but I

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.770 
worthwhile I'm not crazy about it but I
think<00:02:32.100> there's<00:02:32.850> lots<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.240> people<00:02:33.390> that<00:02:33.600> do

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
think there's lots of people that do

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.170 
think there's lots of people that do
like<00:02:33.990> it<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:34.830> you've<00:02:35.100> got<00:02:35.250> seven<00:02:35.670> screens<00:02:35.970> that

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
like it so you've got seven screens that

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.990 
like it so you've got seven screens that
you<00:02:36.300> can<00:02:36.480> customize<00:02:36.980> oh<00:02:37.980> by<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.580> way<00:02:38.670> didn't

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
you can customize oh by the way didn't

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.390 
you can customize oh by the way didn't
mention<00:02:39.300> on<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.570> hardware<00:02:39.930> on<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.740> back<00:02:40.950> this

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
mention on the hardware on the back this

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.080 
mention on the hardware on the back this
is<00:02:41.580> actually<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.560> trackpad<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.400> can<00:02:44.670> scroll

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
is actually a trackpad so you can scroll

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.670 
is actually a trackpad so you can scroll
across<00:02:45.450> your<00:02:45.660> screens<00:02:45.960> up<00:02:46.170> and<00:02:46.320> down<00:02:46.440> in<00:02:46.590> the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
across your screens up and down in the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.500 
across your screens up and down in the
browser<00:02:46.920> there's<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.700> couple<00:02:48.000> apps<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.270> notice

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
browser there's a couple apps I notice

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.730 
browser there's a couple apps I notice
that<00:02:48.600> it<00:02:48.720> doesn't<00:02:48.870> work<00:02:49.110> in<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:49.410> I'll<00:02:49.500> have<00:02:49.620> to

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
that it doesn't work in so I'll have to

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.490 
that it doesn't work in so I'll have to
dig<00:02:49.890> into<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.310> little<00:02:50.400> further<00:02:50.670> but<00:02:51.500> the

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
dig into that a little further but the

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.810 
dig into that a little further but the
other<00:02:52.620> weird<00:02:52.920> thing<00:02:52.980> was<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.400> this<00:02:53.580> wasn't

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
other weird thing was that this wasn't

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.810 
other weird thing was that this wasn't
actually<00:02:54.450> enabled<00:02:55.260> by<00:02:55.530> default<00:02:55.710> so<00:02:56.580> it's<00:02:56.730> a

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
actually enabled by default so it's a

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.790 
actually enabled by default so it's a
kind<00:02:56.940> of<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.120> big<00:02:57.300> selling<00:02:58.080> feature<00:02:58.290> for<00:02:58.410> it

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
kind of a big selling feature for it

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.120 
kind of a big selling feature for it
they<00:02:58.920> mentioned<00:02:59.580> this<00:02:59.700> trackpad<00:03:00.600> and<00:03:01.130> when

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
they mentioned this trackpad and when

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.920 
they mentioned this trackpad and when
you<00:03:02.220> actually<00:03:02.340> start<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.820> phone<00:03:03.000> up<00:03:03.180> and<00:03:03.390> try

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
you actually start the phone up and try

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.560 
you actually start the phone up and try
to<00:03:03.990> use<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.500> doesn't<00:03:04.530> work<00:03:05.010> if<00:03:05.570> somebody

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
to use it it doesn't work if somebody

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:07.910 
to use it it doesn't work if somebody
knows<00:03:06.720> Android<00:03:07.110> no<00:03:07.380> big<00:03:07.560> deal

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
knows Android no big deal

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.440 
knows Android no big deal
to<00:03:08.040> go<00:03:08.160> into<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.400> settings<00:03:08.850> but<00:03:09.030> if<00:03:09.120> you<00:03:09.210> don't

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
to go into the settings but if you don't

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.750 
to go into the settings but if you don't
know<00:03:09.570> Android<00:03:09.990> you<00:03:10.890> might<00:03:11.130> have<00:03:11.310> a<00:03:11.340> hard<00:03:11.550> time

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
know Android you might have a hard time

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.630 
know Android you might have a hard time
finding<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.390> you've<00:03:12.570> got<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.840> go<00:03:12.930> in<00:03:13.080> and<00:03:13.320> and

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
finding it you've got to go in and and

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.550 
finding it you've got to go in and and
backtrack<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:14.970> think<00:03:15.660> is<00:03:15.750> what<00:03:15.900> it's<00:03:16.020> called<00:03:16.290> is

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
backtrack I think is what it's called is

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.620 
backtrack I think is what it's called is
one<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.010> settings<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.610> in<00:03:18.210> there<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.570> you

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
one of the settings and in there and you

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.150 
one of the settings and in there and you
have<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.930> actually<00:03:19.080> turn<00:03:19.470> it<00:03:19.650> on<00:03:19.770> and<00:03:20.040> then

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
have to actually turn it on and then

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.600 
have to actually turn it on and then
there's<00:03:20.340> another<00:03:20.580> option<00:03:21.980> camera<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.130> a<00:03:23.160> 3

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
there's another option camera is a 3

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.340 
there's another option camera is a 3
megapixel<00:03:24.180> camera<00:03:24.540> I<00:03:24.690> haven't<00:03:24.960> really<00:03:25.230> used

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
megapixel camera I haven't really used

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.320 
megapixel camera I haven't really used
it<00:03:25.530> much<00:03:25.800> couple<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.310> shots<00:03:26.550> they<00:03:26.820> look<00:03:27.030> fine

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
it much couple of shots they look fine

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.360 
it much couple of shots they look fine
but<00:03:27.540> that<00:03:28.230> was<00:03:28.350> just<00:03:28.380> looking<00:03:28.860> at<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.100> on<00:03:29.220> this

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
but that was just looking at it on this

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.790 
but that was just looking at it on this
screen<00:03:29.640> so<00:03:29.850> I'll<00:03:29.940> have<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.180> try<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:30.420> some<00:03:30.630> more

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
screen so I'll have to try it some more

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.830 
screen so I'll have to try it some more
other<00:03:31.800> than<00:03:31.980> that<00:03:32.160> there's<00:03:32.430> not<00:03:32.520> much<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.970> it

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
other than that there's not much to it

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.510 
other than that there's not much to it
you've<00:03:34.320> got<00:03:34.470> your<00:03:34.590> like<00:03:34.800> I<00:03:34.890> say<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.160> seven

customized screens you can turn motoblur
off<00:03:38.310> which<00:03:38.580> I<00:03:38.700> probably<00:03:39.030> will<00:03:39.570> do<00:03:39.900> but<00:03:40.740> if

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860

get this up above so you can really see
this<00:04:40.020> hero's<00:04:41.020> quite<00:04:41.290> a<00:04:41.320> bit<00:04:41.530> longer<00:04:41.770> and<00:04:42.610> but

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
this hero's quite a bit longer and but

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.580 
this hero's quite a bit longer and but
obviously<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.720> screen<00:04:43.990> is<00:04:44.140> quite<00:04:44.380> a<00:04:44.410> bit

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
obviously the screen is quite a bit

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.710 
obviously the screen is quite a bit
larger<00:04:44.980> as<00:04:45.130> well<00:04:45.370> on<00:04:46.000> the<00:04:46.180> hero<00:04:46.360> so<00:04:46.570> that

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
larger as well on the hero so that

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.450 
larger as well on the hero so that
doesn't<00:04:46.990> count<00:04:47.080> but<00:04:47.350> that's<00:04:47.920> just<00:04:48.190> because<00:04:48.310> of

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
doesn't count but that's just because of

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.170 
doesn't count but that's just because of
the<00:04:48.820> front-facing<00:04:49.830> QWERTY<00:04:50.830> of<00:04:50.920> course<00:04:51.220> on<00:04:51.910> the

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
the front-facing QWERTY of course on the

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.450 
the front-facing QWERTY of course on the
motorola<00:04:52.450> charm<00:04:53.020> but<00:04:53.650> it<00:04:53.710> ends<00:04:54.010> up<00:04:54.070> making<00:04:54.130> the

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
motorola charm but it ends up making the

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.670 
motorola charm but it ends up making the
whole<00:04:54.640> thing<00:04:54.880> quite<00:04:55.150> pocketable<00:04:55.750> and<00:04:56.080> it<00:04:56.560> is

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
whole thing quite pocketable and it is

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.800 
whole thing quite pocketable and it is
Android<00:04:57.160> I<00:04:57.370> believe<00:04:57.640> it's<00:04:57.790> 2.1<00:04:58.390> if<00:04:58.570> I'm<00:04:58.690> not

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
Android I believe it's 2.1 if I'm not

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.970 
Android I believe it's 2.1 if I'm not
mistaken<00:05:00.900> the<00:05:01.900> monster<00:05:02.410> I've<00:05:02.590> been<00:05:02.770> using

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
mistaken the monster I've been using

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.690 
mistaken the monster I've been using
lately<00:05:03.960> is<00:05:04.960> the<00:05:05.200> Samsung<00:05:05.770> Vibrant<00:05:06.010> and

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:06.700 
lately is the Samsung Vibrant and

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.000 
lately is the Samsung Vibrant and
obviously<00:05:07.210> if<00:05:07.630> we<00:05:07.810> can<00:05:07.930> sort<00:05:08.620> of<00:05:08.680> compare<00:05:08.950> the

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
obviously if we can sort of compare the

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:10.380 
obviously if we can sort of compare the
screens<00:05:09.370> there's<00:05:09.610> a<00:05:09.670> massive<00:05:10.210> difference

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
screens there's a massive difference

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.810 
screens there's a massive difference
there<00:05:10.810> and<00:05:10.840> screen<00:05:11.680> size<00:05:11.950> but<00:05:12.460> that's<00:05:12.640> not

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
there and screen size but that's not

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.280 
there and screen size but that's not
really<00:05:13.090> the<00:05:13.240> point<00:05:13.390> of<00:05:13.570> the<00:05:13.690> charm<00:05:13.930> it's<00:05:14.140> got

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
really the point of the charm it's got

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.200 
really the point of the charm it's got
the<00:05:14.410> keyboard<00:05:14.830> on<00:05:14.980> it<00:05:15.870> thickness<00:05:18.210> they

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
the keyboard on it thickness they

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.730 
the keyboard on it thickness they
actually<00:05:19.660> aren't<00:05:19.900> too<00:05:20.050> far<00:05:20.260> off<00:05:20.410> but<00:05:20.620> of

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
actually aren't too far off but of

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.440 
actually aren't too far off but of
course<00:05:20.890> Motorola<00:05:21.430> is<00:05:21.550> a<00:05:21.580> little<00:05:21.970> bit<00:05:22.120> thicker

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.450 
course Motorola is a little bit thicker

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.380 
course Motorola is a little bit thicker
I<00:05:23.260> see<00:05:23.830> of<00:05:23.950> course<00:05:23.980> but<00:05:24.430> I<00:05:24.610> don't<00:05:24.910> know<00:05:25.000> why<00:05:25.180> of

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
I see of course but I don't know why of

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.630 
I see of course but I don't know why of
course<00:05:25.420> I<00:05:25.950> guess<00:05:26.950> maybe<00:05:27.160> because<00:05:27.370> it's<00:05:27.520> got

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
course I guess maybe because it's got

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.220 
course I guess maybe because it's got
the<00:05:27.730> keyboard<00:05:27.880> on<00:05:28.120> there<00:05:28.330> but<00:05:28.510> also<00:05:28.780> it's<00:05:29.080> a

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.250 
the keyboard on there but also it's a
smaller<00:05:29.530> form<00:05:29.860> factor<00:05:30.340> no<00:05:31.030> idea<00:05:31.360> so<00:05:31.870> far<00:05:32.110> in

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
smaller form factor no idea so far in

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:33.900
