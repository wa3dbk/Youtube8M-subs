00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:10.200
 Know-how palm wave Today is already the sixth time 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.309
 As you all know, 9 back pain 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:18.210
 What a relief 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:22.470
 Let's make a notebook like this to sort out the know-how of luck from today. 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:27.320
 I look forward to seeing the book disappear, and I'm excited . 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.320
 So now let's start with the earnest 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.660
 5 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.140
 I show this bastard. 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:54.309
 Oh this is also the ddc key all 5 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:54.309
 This also compares the keyboard over the hood of the guard 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:02.900
 Today I want to find out what you said about the free bulletin board 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.140
 You asked me to compare meats with mechanical Kiboyama. 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:11.899
 Let's start with a mechanical keyboard. 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:14.720
 5 Each time you type, a clickable mechanical keyboard is played for each team 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:20.110
 I have a switch. 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.110
 When the key is pressed, the switch enters multi-letter into the contact 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:29.630
 Because the switches are mounted separately, it is possible to enter infinite concurrently, but the cost 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.630
 There is a disadvantage that it grows in size. 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:41.710
 But instead of pressing the keys pressed until the contact area to the sea ah in 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:45.670
 Because the spring pushes it , it does not go hand in hand for a long time. 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:50.500
 Durability, can you also use one tank and a long slope 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:53.470
 First of all, because of the sound of the switch, 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.860
 We are forming an enthusiast. 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.400
 Mechanical keyboards like anything any drunks should land 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:06.610
 Click non-breaking linearly 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:11.080
 This way each color due to the difference I'd also known as cheongchuk galchuk heukchuk jeokchuk that 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:15.790
 Depending on the type of key, the sound of the front key is different. 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:19.180
 First of all, let's look at the creek method called the castle axis. 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:26.070
 It's a typical mechanical keyboard. 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:26.070
 Business is weak and light, and it feels sharp again, but hands are big 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.670
 5 I think it's a little hard to kill in public . 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:39.440
 5 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:42.790
 In the clip method, the noise introduced by the clip method introduced earlier 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.790
 The part is removed 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:51.550
 p in front is exactly that part yet, right-click and rims after soft to medium 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:56.780
 Provide a feeling 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:03:01.040
 5 The linear method is divided into a black-and-white axis. 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:06.260
 The black mugwort is characterized by the elimination of pitfalls and elevation of p 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:11.050
 You can also press the keys to enter letters and barely sticking out is also very high speed keys 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.050
 It is suitable for typing and the answer is possible purely 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:19.280
 5 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:21.970
 Contact method is linear type like firecracker, but it can be lightly typed by lowering inclusion. 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.970
 I made it. 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.750
 Noise tries to be a little more than the rear side 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:40.969
 5 In summary, in the table to be typed, the crown is the largest, 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:43.219
 The smallest enemy is firecrackers. 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:48.109
 The black bell is the largest 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:52.640
 Jeokchuk galchuk 2 cheongchuk then the best medicine 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:53.720
 It is difficult to say which is good because the feeling is different for each stroke 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.299
 The same 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:03.769
 Because it takes a lot of subjective part , 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:06.170
 After you have typed p board that you know , 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:10.879
 I think it's best to do it. 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:13.040
 Among the clips , Spy Digital Keyboard is very popular with mechanical keyboards . 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:17.720
 We are in stock 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:21.940
 Fame, space-saving design and culture Steps bit mode Auto keycaps 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.940
 We are proud to feature a low price 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.910
 Among the Nungkrak products, we can choose m7 led brown as Sam's Passo 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:36.550
 There is 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:36.550
 Blue led and usb headphone microphone jacks do not enhance convenience to the country 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:43.639
 Empty ear system Chinese axis 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:48.139
 Leopold Phaeton can be called fc200r 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:52.240
 I put on a blue led and I lasered the car plate. 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:52.240
 The cable was made to glide. 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:05:04.870
 In comparison , I'll be ahead of the 6.25 , and it's getting a lot of popularity. 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.870
 The low prices are the world's eyes were weighed the usb port 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:13.800
 I've looked at the types of mechanical keyboards and the three popular products. 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:18.030
 Maybe you should decide by yourself. 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:18.960
 I want to convey the sound and feeling through this know-how. 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.960
 I did 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:26.340
 If you go to the electronic shop for reference, you will get all kinds of products. 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.520
 There are also 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.580
 It seems to be good haebosineun building 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:38.390
 I found out about a mechanical keyboard today. 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.390
 Today's know-how is also included in this book, and I will say hello to you. 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:49.819
 we note 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:49.819
 Ah
