thanks man
we'll<00:00:33.850> put<00:00:34.030> these<00:00:34.149> headphones<00:00:34.390> on

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.290 

here<00:00:45.019> you<00:00:45.140> can<00:00:45.289> see<00:00:45.469> that<00:00:45.710> the<00:00:46.570> signal<00:00:47.570> is

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
here you can see that the signal is

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.180 
here you can see that the signal is
substantially<00:00:50.300> different<00:00:50.480> than<00:00:50.780> the<00:00:51.620> LCD<00:00:52.039> -

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
substantially different than the LCD -

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.079 
substantially different than the LCD -
and<00:00:52.550> the<00:00:53.000> AKG<00:00:53.559> these<00:00:54.559> are<00:00:54.769> ear<00:00:55.070> pad<00:00:55.430> headphones

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
and the AKG these are ear pad headphones

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.689 
and the AKG these are ear pad headphones
as<00:00:56.390> opposed<00:00:56.690> to<00:00:57.339> circumaural<00:00:58.339> they're

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
as opposed to circumaural they're

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:05.139 
as opposed to circumaural they're
supra-aural<00:00:59.539> headphones<00:01:00.079> so<00:01:03.549> very<00:01:04.549> typically

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:05.149 
supra-aural headphones so very typically

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:06.880 
supra-aural headphones so very typically
they<00:01:05.330> will<00:01:05.479> have<00:01:05.659> a<00:01:05.770> substantially<00:01:06.770> different

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
they will have a substantially different

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.810 
they will have a substantially different
frequency<00:01:07.520> response<00:01:07.909> we're<00:01:08.630> way<00:01:08.780> of<00:01:08.899> response

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
frequency response we're way of response

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.060 
frequency response we're way of response
you<00:01:10.820> can<00:01:10.909> see<00:01:11.149> the<00:01:12.970> signal<00:01:13.970> going<00:01:14.649> below<00:01:15.649> zero

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
you can see the signal going below zero

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.899 
you can see the signal going below zero
here<00:01:16.460> quite<00:01:16.759> strongly<00:01:18.039> that's<00:01:19.039> typical<00:01:19.640> it's

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
here quite strongly that's typical it's

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:22.779 
here quite strongly that's typical it's
indicating<00:01:20.630> that<00:01:20.659> the<00:01:21.229> low<00:01:22.009> frequencies<00:01:22.580> have

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
indicating that the low frequencies have

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:31.149 
indicating that the low frequencies have
shifted<00:01:23.030> in<00:01:23.360> phase<00:01:24.759> substantially<00:01:30.159> again

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
shifted in phase substantially again

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.639 
shifted in phase substantially again
with<00:01:31.340> position<00:01:31.850> I<00:01:32.090> can

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.120 

will<00:01:37.159> not<00:01:37.280> really<00:01:37.430> change<00:01:37.700> it<00:01:37.820> very<00:01:37.909> much<00:01:38.149> but

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
will not really change it very much but

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.880 
will not really change it very much but
we<00:01:40.130> look<00:01:40.700> at<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.060> fine<00:01:41.840> structure<00:01:42.259> at<00:01:42.710> the

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
we look at the fine structure at the

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.310 
we look at the fine structure at the
front<00:01:43.369> end<00:01:43.610> of<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.180> step<00:01:46.780> you<00:01:47.780> can<00:01:47.990> see<00:01:48.200> it

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
front end of the step you can see it

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
front end of the step you can see it
change

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.950 

as<00:01:55.429> I<00:01:56.030> change<00:01:56.060> the<00:01:56.420> position<00:01:56.780> of<00:01:56.869> the

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
as I change the position of the

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.649 
as I change the position of the
headphones

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.929 

so<00:02:04.200> I'm<00:02:04.290> going<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.470> go<00:02:04.560> back<00:02:04.740> put<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.549> head<00:02:05.790> in

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
so I'm going to go back put the head in

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.080 
so I'm going to go back put the head in
the<00:02:06.060> chamber<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:07.429> reposition<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.640> Quincy

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
the chamber and reposition the Quincy

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.750 
the chamber and reposition the Quincy
Jones<00:02:09.330> headphones<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:11.370> run<00:02:11.520> the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
Jones headphones for the to run the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.870 
Jones headphones for the to run the
frequency<00:02:12.450> response<00:02:12.540> test<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.760> we'll<00:02:14.760> look

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
frequency response test and we'll look

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.280 
frequency response test and we'll look
at<00:02:15.000> that<00:02:17.090> alright<00:02:18.090> now<00:02:18.600> that<00:02:18.660> we've<00:02:18.959> got<00:02:18.989> the

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
at that alright now that we've got the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.110 
at that alright now that we've got the
headphones<00:02:19.620> position<00:02:20.160> we're<00:02:20.430> ready<00:02:20.730> to<00:02:20.940> start

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
headphones position we're ready to start

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.000 
headphones position we're ready to start
the<00:02:21.300> test<00:02:21.330> I've<00:02:22.020> changed<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.530> layout<00:02:22.680> on<00:02:22.890> the

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
the test I've changed the layout on the

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.350 
the test I've changed the layout on the
screen<00:02:23.280> here<00:02:23.550> so<00:02:23.580> we<00:02:23.819> get<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:24.000> little<00:02:24.239> bit

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
screen here so we get a little bit

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.460 
screen here so we get a little bit
bigger<00:02:24.590> graph<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:26.959> I'll<00:02:27.959> start<00:02:28.319> the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
bigger graph and I'll start the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.760 
bigger graph and I'll start the
frequency<00:02:28.950> response<00:02:29.069> test<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:30.390> begins<00:02:30.810> at<00:02:31.170> 10

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
frequency response test it begins at 10

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.220 
frequency response test it begins at 10
Hertz<00:02:32.310> down<00:02:32.700> here<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:33.660> can<00:02:33.690> see<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:36.230> the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
Hertz down here and you can see the the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.840 
Hertz down here and you can see the the
left<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.739> right<00:02:37.890> channels<00:02:38.310> come<00:02:38.519> up<00:02:38.640> let<00:02:38.819> me

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
left and right channels come up let me

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.020 
left and right channels come up let me
thicken<00:02:39.269> this<00:02:39.390> line<00:02:39.690> up<00:02:39.900> here<00:02:40.140> for<00:02:40.440> ya<00:02:44.030> okay

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
thicken this line up here for ya okay

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.530 
thicken this line up here for ya okay
and<00:02:45.300> it's<00:02:45.900> moving<00:02:46.260> rather<00:02:46.800> slowly<00:02:47.540> initially

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
and it's moving rather slowly initially

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.759 
and it's moving rather slowly initially
and<00:02:48.750> that's<00:02:48.900> because<00:02:49.170> it's<00:02:49.350> such<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.530> low

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
and that's because it's such a low

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.000 
and that's because it's such a low
frequency<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.489> it<00:02:50.610> takes<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.910> while<00:02:50.940> for<00:02:51.180> the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
frequency that it takes a while for the

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.449 
frequency that it takes a while for the
analyzer<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.360> settle<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.680> be<00:02:55.680> able<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:55.980> take<00:02:56.430> a

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
analyzer to settle and be able to take a

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.420 
analyzer to settle and be able to take a
reading<00:02:56.819> it<00:02:57.239> does<00:02:57.480> do<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.709> automatically

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
reading it does do that automatically

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.430 
reading it does do that automatically
and<00:02:59.670> I<00:02:59.730> have<00:02:59.910> settings<00:03:00.360> that<00:03:00.630> allow<00:03:00.780> me<00:03:01.140> to

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
and I have settings that allow me to

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.979 
and I have settings that allow me to
ensure<00:03:02.100> that<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.580> data<00:03:02.790> point<00:03:03.120> is<00:03:03.330> settled<00:03:03.750> as

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
ensure that the data point is settled as

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:07.390 
ensure that the data point is settled as
it<00:03:04.739> goes<00:03:04.860> up<00:03:05.010> here<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.280> will<00:03:05.400> soon<00:03:05.610> reach<00:03:05.970> the

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
it goes up here it will soon reach the

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.590 
it goes up here it will soon reach the

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
driver and start wiggling around right

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.650 
driver and start wiggling around right
there<00:03:16.459> so<00:03:17.459> that's<00:03:17.730> where<00:03:17.970> we<00:03:18.060> know<00:03:18.180> that<00:03:18.450> the

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
there so that's where we know that the

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.990 
there so that's where we know that the
we've<00:03:19.170> gotten<00:03:19.470> to<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.680> primary<00:03:20.340> resonance<00:03:20.730> of

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
we've gotten to the primary resonance of

we've gotten to the primary resonance of
the<00:03:21.120> driver<00:03:21.390> now<00:03:22.109> it<00:03:22.290> should<00:03:22.530> remain<00:03:22.890> fairly

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
the driver now it should remain fairly

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.770 
the driver now it should remain fairly
uh<00:03:24.440> even<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.709> flat<00:03:26.190> up<00:03:27.030> to<00:03:27.269> about<00:03:27.480> two

Ridge<00:03:31.170> of<00:03:31.440> your<00:03:31.680> ear<00:03:31.950> will<00:03:32.250> start<00:03:32.579> or<00:03:33.450> the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
Ridge of your ear will start or the

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.750 
Ridge of your ear will start or the
heads<00:03:34.109> here<00:03:34.440> will<00:03:34.650> start<00:03:34.829> amplifying<00:03:35.519> the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
heads here will start amplifying the

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:42.560 
heads here will start amplifying the
signal<00:03:38.570> here<00:03:39.570> we<00:03:39.690> go<00:03:40.790> so<00:03:41.790> that's<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.150> Contra

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
signal here we go so that's the Contra

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.599 
signal here we go so that's the Contra
Ridge<00:03:42.750> amplifying<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.890> then<00:03:44.100> soon<00:03:44.400> we'll

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609 
Ridge amplifying and then soon we'll

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.640 
Ridge amplifying and then soon we'll
start<00:03:44.850> running<00:03:45.000> into<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:46.430> modal<00:03:48.440> peaks<00:03:49.440> and

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
start running into the modal peaks and

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.920 
start running into the modal peaks and
valleys<00:03:49.709> from<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.640> resonances<00:03:51.239> of<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.660> ear

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
valleys from the resonances of the ear

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:58.729 
valleys from the resonances of the ear
canal<00:03:52.109> here's<00:03:53.100> one<00:03:56.930> there's<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:58.019> valley<00:03:58.350> and

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
canal here's one there's a valley and

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.740 
canal here's one there's a valley and
then<00:03:58.890> more<00:03:59.160> Peaks<00:03:59.430> will<00:04:00.299> go<00:04:00.420> up<00:04:00.569> and<00:04:00.690> down

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
then more Peaks will go up and down

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.259 
then more Peaks will go up and down
quite<00:04:01.109> a<00:04:01.140> bit<00:04:01.230> now<00:04:02.600> these<00:04:03.600> are<00:04:03.989> the<00:04:05.269> changes

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
quite a bit now these are the changes

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.440 
quite a bit now these are the changes
and<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.780> peaks<00:04:07.079> and<00:04:07.290> valleys<00:04:07.380> that<00:04:08.450> changing

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
and the peaks and valleys that changing

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.180 
and the peaks and valleys that changing
the<00:04:09.540> position<00:04:09.959> on<00:04:10.109> the<00:04:10.200> headphones<00:04:10.650> back<00:04:10.950> and

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
the position on the headphones back and

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.939 
the position on the headphones back and
forth<00:04:11.780> slightly<00:04:12.780> moves<00:04:13.260> those<00:04:13.500> peaks<00:04:13.739> and

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
forth slightly moves those peaks and

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:15.150 
forth slightly moves those peaks and
valleys<00:04:14.010> around

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
valleys around

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.920 
valleys around
and<00:04:15.310> then<00:04:15.880> when<00:04:16.090> we<00:04:16.209> average<00:04:16.720> the

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
and then when we average the

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.360 
and then when we average the
measurements<00:04:17.410> it'll<00:04:17.590> get<00:04:17.709> smoother<00:04:18.130> Bolla

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
measurements it'll get smoother Bolla

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.600 
measurements it'll get smoother Bolla
show<00:04:18.940> that<00:04:19.209> shortly<00:04:20.140> so<00:04:20.650> we<00:04:20.980> finished<00:04:21.430> the

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:21.610 
show that shortly so we finished the

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.600 
show that shortly so we finished the
first<00:04:21.790> frequency<00:04:22.360> response<00:04:22.900> test<00:04:23.260> and<00:04:23.610> now

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
first frequency response test and now

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.790 
first frequency response test and now
it's<00:04:24.850> time<00:04:25.060> to<00:04:25.120> move<00:04:25.840> the<00:04:26.080> headphones<00:04:26.470> into

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
it's time to move the headphones into

00:04:26.800 --> 00:05:00.480 
it's time to move the headphones into
four<00:04:27.430> other<00:04:27.700> positions<00:04:28.270> carefully<00:04:59.490> okay

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
four other positions carefully okay

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.120 
four other positions carefully okay
we've<00:05:00.700> finished<00:05:00.940> our<00:05:01.420> fifth<00:05:02.260> frequency

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
we've finished our fifth frequency

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.270 
we've finished our fifth frequency
response<00:05:03.520> test<00:05:03.880> and<00:05:04.740> we'll<00:05:05.740> have<00:05:05.860> a<00:05:05.890> look<00:05:06.070> what

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
response test and we'll have a look what

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.300 
response test and we'll have a look what
happens<00:05:06.310> to<00:05:06.760> the<00:05:06.910> data<00:05:07.120> at<00:05:07.360> that<00:05:07.390> point<00:05:08.310> once

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
happens to the data at that point once

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.280 
happens to the data at that point once
the<00:05:09.600> system<00:05:10.600> is<00:05:10.690> finished<00:05:10.870> with<00:05:11.200> the

this<00:05:37.510> these<00:05:38.230> two<00:05:38.970> columns<00:05:39.970> will<00:05:40.360> have<00:05:40.690> the<00:05:41.700> the

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:42.700 
this these two columns will have the the

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.860 
this these two columns will have the the
some<00:05:43.600> of<00:05:43.990> the<00:05:44.590> five<00:05:44.950> data<00:05:45.340> points<00:05:45.460> in<00:05:46.000> the<00:05:46.419> that

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
some of the five data points in the that

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.010 
some of the five data points in the that
were<00:05:47.020> measured<00:05:47.550> and<00:05:48.550> then<00:05:48.970> divided<00:05:49.540> by<00:05:49.570> five

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
were measured and then divided by five

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.400 
were measured and then divided by five
and<00:05:50.050> that's<00:05:50.560> how<00:05:50.710> we<00:05:50.770> get<00:05:51.010> the<00:05:51.160> averaging<00:05:51.730> and

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
and that's how we get the averaging and

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.710 
and that's how we get the averaging and
then<00:05:53.410> the<00:05:53.919> next<00:05:54.340> column<00:05:54.490> over<00:05:54.880> will<00:05:55.510> apply<00:05:56.470> the

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
then the next column over will apply the

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.730 
then the next column over will apply the
compensation<00:05:58.720> for<00:05:59.110> the<00:05:59.290> head<00:05:59.500> related

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
compensation for the head related

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.000 
compensation for the head related
transfer<00:05:59.919> function<00:06:00.820> to<00:06:01.690> the<00:06:02.080> averaged

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
transfer function to the averaged

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:05.960 
transfer function to the averaged
columns<00:06:03.669> and<00:06:03.940> now<00:06:04.660> we<00:06:04.720> can<00:06:04.960> switch<00:06:05.230> to<00:06:05.260> the
