00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.130 
pilot one of war in the world now and I
work<00:00:16.620> for<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:16.950> 3<00:00:17.460> corporation<00:00:18.000> in<00:00:18.240> flight<00:00:18.990> for

work for I 3 corporation in flight for
NASA

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:38.290 

wäôre<00:00:25.990> need<00:00:26.200> a<00:00:26.230> great<00:00:26.530> idea

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.720 

the<00:00:38.810> er-2<00:00:39.110> is<00:00:39.530> gets<00:00:40.190> off<00:00:40.310> the<00:00:40.400> ground<00:00:40.430> pretty

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
the er-2 is gets off the ground pretty

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.490 
the er-2 is gets off the ground pretty
quick<00:00:41.000> and<00:00:41.300> it<00:00:41.540> gets<00:00:41.690> off<00:00:41.840> God<00:00:42.050> so<00:00:42.200> quickly

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
quick and it gets off God so quickly

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.560 
quick and it gets off God so quickly
because<00:00:42.650> it<00:00:42.710> has<00:00:42.830> huge<00:00:43.550> wing<00:00:43.940> high<00:00:44.210> aspect

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
because it has huge wing high aspect

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:56.590 
because it has huge wing high aspect
ratio<00:00:44.690> like<00:00:45.320> in<00:00:45.740> a<00:00:45.830> very<00:00:46.100> powerful<00:00:46.310> motor

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.170 

NASA<00:00:57.260> er<00:00:57.650> -<00:00:57.860> it's<00:00:58.130> capable<00:00:58.760> of<00:00:58.820> flying<00:00:59.000> at

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
NASA er - it's capable of flying at

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.240 
NASA er - it's capable of flying at
altitudes<00:00:59.660> above<00:00:59.750> 70,000<00:01:00.710> feet<00:01:00.829> and<00:01:01.040> we<00:01:01.100> can

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
altitudes above 70,000 feet and we can

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.950 
altitudes above 70,000 feet and we can
do<00:01:01.340> science<00:01:01.700> missions<00:01:02.090> anywhere<00:01:02.690> from<00:01:02.870> the

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
do science missions anywhere from the

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:12.370 
do science missions anywhere from the
surface<00:01:03.350> to<00:01:03.860> the<00:01:03.890> max<00:01:04.190> altitude

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.380 

the<00:01:12.860> suit<00:01:13.070> is<00:01:13.189> to<00:01:13.340> keep<00:01:13.850> pressure<00:01:14.060> on<00:01:14.270> our

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
the suit is to keep pressure on our

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.090 
the suit is to keep pressure on our
bodies<00:01:14.900> you<00:01:15.020> can't<00:01:15.229> live<00:01:15.409> that<00:01:15.560> with<00:01:15.950> that

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
bodies you can't live that with that

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.469 
bodies you can't live that with that
because<00:01:16.280> your<00:01:16.400> blood<00:01:16.580> boils<00:01:16.909> anything<00:01:17.270> above

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
because your blood boils anything above

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.840 
because your blood boils anything above
sixty<00:01:17.840> four<00:01:18.020> thousand<00:01:18.439> feet<00:01:18.560> put<00:01:19.159> water<00:01:19.430> boils

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
sixty four thousand feet put water boils

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.550 
sixty four thousand feet put water boils
and<00:01:20.000> blood<00:01:20.240> boils<00:01:20.630> and<00:01:20.780> if<00:01:20.990> you<00:01:21.080> die<00:01:21.259> if<00:01:21.440> you're

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
and blood boils and if you die if you're

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.460 
and blood boils and if you die if you're
exposed<00:01:21.830> to<00:01:21.979> that<00:01:22.159> for<00:01:22.340> too<00:01:22.460> long<00:01:22.490> so

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.590 

we<00:01:29.040> can<00:01:29.130> carry<00:01:29.370> up<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.550> more<00:01:30.150> than<00:01:30.300> six

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
we can carry up to more than six

we can carry up to more than six

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.490 

it's<00:01:36.270> very<00:01:36.660> different<00:01:36.870> from<00:01:37.050> playing<00:01:37.350> any

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
it's very different from playing any

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.690 
it's very different from playing any
other<00:01:37.650> play<00:01:37.980> in<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.220> world
