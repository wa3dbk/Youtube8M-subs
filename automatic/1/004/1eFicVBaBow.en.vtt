00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.750
 so we have a lot of luck 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.400
 Moreover, there is only because 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.809
 is not just a garden there are 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.449
 buildings that are very beautiful that are 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.859
 ancient seventeenth and eighteenth centuries are all 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.869
 a story with the buildings this is 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.369
 not a garden alone yade to merignac 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.230
 because there are beautiful buildings and 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.689
 because we live in my wife and my 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.039
 children 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:31.260
 the creation of these gardens was killed at 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.510
 eighteenth century by one of my ancestors and 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.899
 it's my father who did it again and there's 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.000
 about 50 years old with my help 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.260
 it was never done at all 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.629
 to be open to the public it's a garden 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.000
 secret for my peace for his family 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.160
 so we did this garden together 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.789
 it was the ideas and I was the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.559
 maneuver they were transformed to 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.050
 nineteenth an English garden that he presents 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.520
 a mode at that time and not in 38 of the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.620
 at the beginning of the 20th century 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.629
 they did not see me restore them there 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.480
 realized that may not deliver a 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.180
 garden in state when he was abandoned 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.340
 for 50 years so he had the courage and 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.890
 the madness of everything shaved by bulldozing and 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.689
 start all over again his az garden well 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.549
 my father thought of this garden during 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.180
 20 years before doing it he started to 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.270
 make a sketch 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.380
 then he made plans all summer 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.540
 planted at 20 cm high it was not a 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.100
 flower garden and it was not a 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.170
 English garden if they wanted to make a 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.939
 French garden that is to say very 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.549
 ordered very structured as site is 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.299
 done by an architect 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:39.450
 my dad started walking along the alley of 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.130
 vases a dif perspective and the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.450
 add vases after vases 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.329
 Italian prosecution and the facts 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.619
 French garden is behind me and the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.430
 third thing he's making the go of 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.619
 charms in which we are 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.570
 currently the charms of this 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.000
 champs-elysÃ©es desjardins there is no 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.729
 place we have never seen gardens like 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.960
 and it's unique 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.780
 I am not at this dispute every day 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.979
 I stop dear I admire them 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.869
 when he made the go of charms 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.490
 he saw two or three years 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.110
 after it takes time for agent he 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.580
 must never be in a hurry he was missing 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.210
 something he put yew into 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.780
 cylinder and its spirals of charm 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:17.480
 koppu Cecile adif it's unheard of 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.090
 success and after not to give a 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.920
 side too severe he wanted to make a 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.720
 orchard on each side one of the charms 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.110
 of an apple orchard actually 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.550
 red 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.020
 that's what my father prefers you 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.730
 the aesthetic that pop is not 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.620
 the time the interested so much it's the 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.180
 colors possibly red guys who 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.860
 he was interested in the form of help 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.760
 trees whose which formed them into a ball 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.900
 with the santoline at the foot I find that 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.490
 it's very nice to hear 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.040
 actually water chicken in them 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.540
 gardens especially when it's hot there 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.310
 there are big basins and skis basin 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.180
 there are fountains there are washhouses and I 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.100
 believe it is the lack of water is 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.640
 capital in a garden we have this 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.490
 source 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.160
 and we capture the turn of the aude is cooked 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.480
 through the roofs so we recover 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.240
 water we need a lot 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.680
 of water, especially lawns, there is nothing but 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.040
 the only garden to my knowledge in 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.630
 la France 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:07.550
 open to the public where all the helpers 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:09.350
 are in turf for when I am 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.410
 arrived at hull lignac I found they 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.910
 did not have to this flower outside the 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.090
 white garden where actually it's a 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.420
 gorgeous rose garden of stubborn even 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.849
 yade 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.380
 gora for me what was important 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.380
 it's not a museum garden 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.819
 so my idea was to say I 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.739
 would like to have a vegetable garden I 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.780
 would like to take care of it so we have 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.030
 created a vegetable garden first for us 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.890
 and then this vegetable garden has become 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.900
 very pretty who we agreed to 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.569
 open it to the public and I created it next 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.640
 from this vegetable garden a flower garden where 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.220
 I go once or twice 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.140
 week not only bloom the house 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.030
 but also the chapel is also 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.769
 a little bit of welcome and that's 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.550
 important to me that all this together 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.730
 be family living and accessible 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.930
 finally to everyone 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.819
 for me a garden must be above all 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.440
 well kept and it's very difficult that a 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:04.769
 garden changes all the time he had 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.630
 a little wind and then it pushes it 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.160
 grows so it takes every day every 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.160
 the days that an interview there are six 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:14.010
 gardeners throughout the year anyway 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.930
 including that on January 7 at 10 11 am about 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.079
 calais is almost it's a way that 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.079
 my 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.900
 we have everything to be happy 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.900
