00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.600 
not as a simple install as Sharky's is
so<00:02:04.520> that's<00:02:04.700> why<00:02:04.970> I<00:02:05.000> don't<00:02:05.569> really<00:02:05.810> use<00:02:06.229> it<00:02:06.610> this

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
so that's why I don't really use it this

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.550 
so that's why I don't really use it this
is<00:02:07.850> you<00:02:08.479> could<00:02:08.569> choose<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.929> defaults<00:02:09.440> on

is you could choose the defaults on

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.410 
is you could choose the defaults on
every<00:02:09.979> single<00:02:10.310> page<00:02:10.519> but<00:02:10.550> it's<00:02:11.000> just<00:02:11.090> more<00:02:11.300> of

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
every single page but it's just more of

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.170 
every single page but it's just more of
a<00:02:11.480> hassle<00:02:12.100> but<00:02:13.100> I'll<00:02:13.220> also<00:02:13.430> post<00:02:13.730> this<00:02:13.940> link

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
a hassle but I'll also post this link
