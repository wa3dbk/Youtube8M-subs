00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
that somewhere I must have screwed up

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.410 
that somewhere I must have screwed up
the<00:01:22.830> numbers<00:01:23.220> because<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:23.729> should<00:01:23.909> be<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.150> fact

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420

the numbers because we should be in fact
number<00:01:24.720> six<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.200> we're<00:01:25.470> on<00:01:25.590> fact<00:01:25.860> number<00:01:26.189> five

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
number six and we're on fact number five

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.740 
number six and we're on fact number five
and<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.670> don't<00:01:26.880> know<00:01:26.939> how<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.180> happened<00:01:27.689> but

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
and I don't know how that happened but

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.899 
and I don't know how that happened but
yeah<00:01:28.290> I'm<00:01:28.350> tired<00:01:28.590> see<00:01:29.040> fact<00:01:29.250> number<00:01:29.400> one<00:01:29.640> fact

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
yeah I'm tired see fact number one fact

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.760 
yeah I'm tired see fact number one fact
number<00:01:30.060> six<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.509> built<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:30.930> computer<00:01:31.079> out<00:01:31.500> of

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
number six I built a computer out of

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.560 
number six I built a computer out of
other<00:01:31.950> computers<00:01:32.610> as<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.850> kid<00:01:33.150> with<00:01:33.329> pretty

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
other computers as a kid with pretty

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.480 
other computers as a kid with pretty
much<00:01:33.840> no<00:01:34.049> experience<00:01:34.530> my<00:01:34.740> parents<00:01:35.040> decided<00:01:35.340> it

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
much no experience my parents decided it

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.100 
much no experience my parents decided it
was<00:01:35.610> probably<00:01:35.880> not<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.090> best<00:01:36.360> idea<00:01:36.509> for<00:01:36.810> me<00:01:37.049> to

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
was probably not the best idea for me to

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.749 
was probably not the best idea for me to
be<00:01:37.290> on<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.650> internet<00:01:37.950> all<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.070> time<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.700> they

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
be on the internet all the time so they

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.280 
be on the internet all the time so they
installed<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.240> whole<00:01:39.390> bunch<00:01:39.600> of<00:01:39.720> software<00:01:40.079> to

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
installed a whole bunch of software to

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.870 
installed a whole bunch of software to
kind<00:01:40.500> of<00:01:40.560> prevent<00:01:40.770> me<00:01:40.979> from<00:01:41.009> doing<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.850> I

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
kind of prevent me from doing that so I

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.490 
kind of prevent me from doing that so I
know<00:01:42.150> okay<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.659> went<00:01:42.840> into<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.259> spare

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
know okay and I went into the spare

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.590 
know okay and I went into the spare
parts<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.950> old<00:01:44.070> computers<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.790> stuff<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.210> I

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
parts of old computers and stuff and I

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.690

kind<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.140> gutted<00:01:46.619> them<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.040> put<00:01:47.579> them

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
kind of just gutted them and put them

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.609 
kind of just gutted them and put them
all<00:01:47.850> together<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.720> probably<00:01:49.110> should<00:01:49.530> have

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
all together and I probably should have

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.170 
all together and I probably should have
been<00:01:49.770> electrocuted<00:01:50.189> several<00:01:50.729> times<00:01:50.939> but

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
been electrocuted several times but

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.719 
been electrocuted several times but
somehow<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.810> got<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.409> internet<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.100> thanks
