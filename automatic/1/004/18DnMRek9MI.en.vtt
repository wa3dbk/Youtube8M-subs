00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:01.939
 I sold sprays 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.590
 a goalkeeper who for absolutely everything even if they throw a balonazo to 300 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.559
 kilometers per hour from 5 kilometers away 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.949
 no matter what the effect of the ball and the material it is made of 

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:18.010
 one of its superpowers is to be able to stop the already named shots with sum 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:19.029
 ease 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.079
 the balls go through the walls but not to Benghazi 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:25.230
 You can also stop a shot with your super cap 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.380
 only takes it by the visor and makes the ball in kg on the cap 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.650
 this cap automatically stops the ball no matter at what speed it comes 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.780
 must be made of some alloy with which UFOs do 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.440
 a prophecy of lota kiss does not say that on the day of final judgment the duck 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:41.910
 donald 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.060
 owner of mc donald will launch a nuclear missile towards the land but sell the 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.860
 stop with your cap 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.670
 mark lenders 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.560
 has his famous tiger shot 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.710
 and the dragon's shot 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.820
 the one that bursts the walls 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.190
 this is why the producers of the movie the tiger and the dragon have it 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.270
 defendant not by bursting walls but by the names of the shots 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.120
 when he retires from football and in san set up a demolition company in 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.430
 the one that lowers the buildings aims of pelotazos 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.300
 but in a row it is rumored that this tala tátara tátara tátara tátara tátara 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.940
 tátara tátara 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.760
 tátara tátara tátara tátara grandson of goliat 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.840
 It measures how about 14 meters 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.280
 and it's almost impossible to make a goal 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.080
 Your team is made up of 10 gigabit cocks that sit on top 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.440
 from the court just to see 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.720
 because with the measures of such a goalkeeper 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.480
 it is impossible to make a goal or 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.020
 oliver aton did it once because chuck norris was in the stands 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.400
 very boring of not seeing goals 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.100
 and threw him a whirling kick that made him fly to fall 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.750
 in Russia 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.270
 and oliver took the opportunity to make the goal 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.260
 the brothers derrick 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.760
 they were able to jump through the verticals of the goal and shoot 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.100
 both at the time 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.270
 some gymnasts have tried 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.860
 with disastrous consequences 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.300
 eduar ner 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.030
 to what ura was detested 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.080
 he started from a young age as a circus juggler 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.510
 that's why you can jump from one stick to the other with ease 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.360
 and saves penalties even if he makes a mistake when jumping because with a single 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.339
 impulse jumps to the other stick and you're 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.319
 secondary 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.509
 friend of oliver and steering wheel by right 

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:22.989
 it was rumored that nobody saw them in the showers after the game ended 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:27.069
 but only the teletubbies can tell if it was just a friendship 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.129
 edited to avoid censorship 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:30.299
 Saint Felix 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:31.239
 others 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.909
 curiosities 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.799
 in international tournaments 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.459
 the Japanese players talked and argued and even made jokes 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:42.449
 with players from all over the world 

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:46.009
 it must be that soccer schools include philology and languages 

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:47.819
 foreigners in training 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.749
 or that Japanese has a structure that makes it understandable to any being 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:54.359
 human not 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:57.359
 how to oliver aton to play with an injured leg 

00:02:59.399 --> 00:03:03.689
 when a player fired a lot of force his leg came up to the 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:04.359
 face 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.179
 it will be that they also teach yoga 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:10.739
 my physical education and sports teacher would have wanted me to be 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:11.930
 capable of the same 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.590
 it will be that oliver is a zombie of resident evil capable of resisting such 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.659
 pain 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.859
 oliver is gay well it seems 

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:24.719
 Oliver's sneakers got them in a contest of sexual favors to the 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:26.079
 rebounded to gaza 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.099
 with anegó gaua was a finalist 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.109
 it is not worth mentioning who won 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:32.239
 6 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.059
 according to the physical theory of instinct and reinforced by his wine riis 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:39.809
 oliver shoots so hard that the ball travels through time and from 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:41.219
 universes 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:42.279
 7 

00:03:42.279 --> 00:03:45.279
 oliver is a fan of freddie mercury 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:50.089
 oliver has the cen cai pauer following the guidelines of the boli dragon syndrome 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:53.539
 every time the next chute is injured is twice as fast and powerful 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.269
 Oliver and the Corioto brothers have a role that can support the 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:01.069
 tornadoes of the twister movie 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.469
 without the prisoner suffering any damage 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:08.439
 it should be clear that oliver is one of those people who literally touch 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.370
 quite the balls and which is not worth approaching a lot because you can 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:16.500
 finish like them in japan even though I think oliver that would send up the 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.400
 moon because to kick a ball that reaches the other side of like 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.549
 court 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:23.710
 oliver and benji syndrome 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.710
 name because you know a set of symptoms that many series suffer from 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.240
 of manga 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.740
 symptom 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.580
 time is relative 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.120
 a fight lasts for weeks 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.069
 but in reality only a few hours have passed 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:40.530
 This is because at critical moments 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:41.990
 as a shot with effect 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.990
 the time passes more slowly 

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:49.489
 the team more patán team just giving a beating to the whole world 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.430
 the laws of physics that normally govern the deformation of bodies do not 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.190
 do they work 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.360
 since a ball can have a shape similar to that of a UFO 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.650
 they withdraw l'iran 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.689
 the playing field is of quasi-deformed proportions 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:06.330
 because it has such an extension 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.080
 that when a team starts the counterattack you can not see the goal 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.080
 until the area is not reached at least 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:18.159
 also has a very graceful curvature that prevents seeing the defenders and that in 

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:21.879
 any time you can be surprised with those kicks at the height of the 

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.689
 front to remove the ball from your feet 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:25.830
 6 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.530
 his muscular abilities do not correspond with the game 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.729
 they run without rest jump and 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:35.300
 the more you push your head and chillán higher up 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.960
 this was the fault of the bald headed eagles becoming extinct 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.960
 because of so many collisions with the players 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.449
 amazingly in each team there are one or two supernovas that could really 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:50.990
 play alone because the rest of the team are just for the fact of making bulk 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:55.000
 by the way any bulge of those 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.730
 does not have any illusions or happiness, it is more proven that not even 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.080
 they have families or problems when they finish a game they hide in jail 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.080
 ascón paniagua until the next game 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:12.110
 the ball is played with different physical capacity since said ball 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:15.919
 technologically modified can break networks and even make 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:17.340
 holes in the concrete 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.620
 despite this the ball is still intact 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.319
 except if he hits the stick 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:25.389
 that causes the ball to be punctured without the pole shaking but when it hits 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:29.369
 to a player the laws of collisions and forces ensure that if a ball can 

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:33.110
 do that with a concrete a player would not go through goku style 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.599
 instead drag him eye not bounce 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:39.410
 that is not the same until the goal does not matter how many are placed in the middle and in 

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:41.419
 that moment two things can happen 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:45.810
 If it is a lump, it will logically be held to the post with all its forces together with 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.900
 those that were put in the middle but inevitably entrance 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.710
 if it's a supernova it will stop him at the height of the goal line and if 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.650
 They swelled the balls 

00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:59.020
 with such force that you will directly travel the field kilometers so 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.620
 Quick 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.380
 that the goalkeeper will not give him time to react and over will make a cut 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.749
 I move hair 

00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:09.389
 The most curious thing is that all this was done by the swarms 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:13.080
 we have discovered that adults in the first division more than a match of 

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.430
 football is like a dragon battle goal 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.419
 there are me 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:17.550
 pelé transports 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.550
 phase changes and suicides just for winning a match 

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:25.499
 If a statistical study is done, we can verify that there is more 

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:29.189
 probability of hitting the ball on the stick that getting the goalkeeper father 

00:07:29.189 --> 00:07:31.419
 a crash 

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:35.120
 never appear any referee except to whistle outside of game 

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.580
 throw-ins and goals the players can already impart their legs based on 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:43.570
 make mistakes that the referee will not say anything is more sweat what they 

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:46.569
 happen to the players 

00:07:46.569 --> 00:07:49.509
 the number of players on the court is relative 

00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:52.169
 since it does not matter how many players are walking 

00:07:52.169 --> 00:07:54.939
 there are always more players ahead 

00:07:54.939 --> 00:07:56.059
 14 

00:07:56.059 --> 00:08:00.169
 the secondary characters are passed screaming the name of the protagonist each 

00:08:00.169 --> 00:08:00.909
 five seconds
