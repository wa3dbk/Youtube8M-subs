00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello everyone i am poor and go today 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.919
 I show you how to get into TNT 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.759
 to make so I can see it is very 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.620
 small and but that doesn't mean it 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.900
 can shoot less far look I already have 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.630
 shot three times can that three 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.640
 pretty far and no it's not one 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.470
 shot order of why my two or 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.160
 three shots 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.949
 but yes he sees two 10 10 at the same time 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.380
 yes that is quite possible 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.969
 so he can have the keys there and yes 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.700
 He's even farther here if you need one 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.200
 mountain is something or something in the sky then he sees 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.640
 even finer mine should not be too high 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:51.930
 fat because otherwise 1010 the air exploded 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:59.640
 yes i will just show that was 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:02.129
 and so so yes think about it here 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.510
 a gas problem that you have so much 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:09.030
 from 1060 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.380
 yes ok he does it because first me 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.630
 this does not sit here 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.010
 well i mean that's not at all 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.040
 required 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.570
 as well think about us all care 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.549
 powerd 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.960
 only one way or another we look 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.960
 but now 60 tnt you 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.620
 does this not now it does not shoot 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.310
 ten tons off 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:42.310
 I have no idea why I have yes first 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:46.400
 agree with that there so it works and 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.080
 I think it's a stoop or something 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.580
 I'm sure it doesn't belong because 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.070
 this torch that peacock is real 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:59.570
 Dispencer so it's a little weird 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:02:01.310
 but no yes the book but so this place 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.990
 just celebrate and then you do it 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.930
 just when you play a future 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.119
 i jumped into mydrive cp jazz band 2 like 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.910
 you played a point evo I can at 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.590
 his title is fixed and then you need this 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.780
 not to have talked yet let's 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.700
 continue with the tutorial 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.950
 for the tutorial you have the following 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.100
 items needed 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.700
 7 dispensers 8 building blocks 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:31.490
 7 fred stone 2 redstone torch 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.400
 infant and pressure plate may i like too 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.170
 are in water or lava buckets 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.630
 and in wooden button this must be made of wood 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.630
 and of course a lot of tnti 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.450
 grab someone later 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.630
 so i didn't always yes then i thought ok 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.740
 to start with a picture 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:59.080
 your fans with the press play trop let you 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.920
 two book up 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:07.030
 dispenser here so people place you here 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:12.730
 here a dispenser here block here block 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:14.530
 your dispenser here dispenser here and here 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.390
 and the only thing you have to do is yes 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.100
 just put on a lot more all this 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.310
 Francis to the middle show allocate 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:25.720
 and i don't know it 's hard to get that 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:29.520
 to do basically that of still basel 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.520
 against but so it seems 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:38.200
 oh okay then you place your redstone 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:41.140
 here here here and therefore for this 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:46.440
 times here and here 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.440
 I hope it gets fixed really and then 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:55.150
 here a block here emissions 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:57.570
 here and here recently being serious 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.570
 just as clean 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:08.770
 yes then you place a red button here and 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:11.440
 here you water it or lover grab it and 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:14.610
 then you must of course not forget 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.610
 ten 10s to stop 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.280
 yes so so 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:31.199
 so it is superfluous so superfluous 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.550
 so superfluous this superfluous this i would 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.370
 you love it 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.410
 bronze casting tenner maybe so out 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.250
 also make sure you don't block it here 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.259
 does then still goes and then yes then goes 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.919
 it there it goes very quickly 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:50.130
 is just going to miss don't do oh and 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:52.889
 the whole this type the 10 10 cannon is 4 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.889
 long 3 wide and 4 high 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:58.190
 where do I think it is always possible 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.190
 show it 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.789
 perfect thing 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:14.490
 oh no oh look I already get it 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:18.840
 yes it is just something with that about this 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:20.580
 side it with yes I don't understand 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.919
 but just to be sure here and here one 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:29.520
 zipper and dust 

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:31.340
 so it was safe that that was before 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:35.210
 the tutorial 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.160
 ok now I'm going to explain how this tnt crooked 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.900
 works 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.930
 well start at the beginning when you are on the 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:44.210
 click button and power team at the reds then 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.360
 all dispencers except this one 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:51.160
 Phone piece called a UFO 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.270
 and yes, it all shoots off TNT 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.030
 it ends up in the water 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:06:01.550
 if tnt ends up in the water then 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:03.530
 makes a third no nothing broken so 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.990
 it explodes and to still them something 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.310
 only you but not blocks 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.690
 Broken 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.970
 it is exactly what the want want 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:17.540
 not that our entire entire team two 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:21.440
 come on blows and then yes then the reds goes 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:22.760
 doing goes on it so also on is directly on 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.200
 the button clicks 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:29.870
 we have these torches that go out and like the 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.370
 button then goes out again say then go 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.530
 these torches on again and that ensures 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.520
 that it also becomes 10 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:40.700
 closed so that actually ensures 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:42.830
 that this 10 10 what was shot later 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:46.940
 then this is why you also have a wooden 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:50.270
 button needed if you take a stone then 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:52.430
 there is too short a time 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:55.280
 and then the teams that are still exploding in the 

00:06:52.430 --> 00:07:00.650
 air or 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:07.340
 yes still in the air or almost exploded 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:09.919
 1010 just too early about this 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:11.360
 you heat those two what i need 

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:16.490
 just meant each a bit bad 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:20.960
 explained on this side I do not like this 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:23.840
 this dispencer not and on that side 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.250
 this dispencer didn't work very much 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:27.800
 it's probably that all 

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:30.320
 dispensers that 

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:34.400
 so more are on the right 

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:35.630
 more on the northern side that do 

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.800
 so it doesn't 

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:38.300
 well i don't know if you care about that 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.510
 but for the sake of certainty 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:45.700
 here and here redstone with a block 

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.700
 just to be sure 

00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.240
 and yes that was just about this one 

00:07:48.919 --> 00:07:52.909
 tutorial 

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:57.650
 I hope you found it interesting the 

00:07:52.909 --> 00:08:00.430
 learned that you liked it and see you 

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.430
 the next time
