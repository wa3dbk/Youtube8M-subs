00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.440 

and<00:00:10.830> so<00:00:11.219> here<00:00:11.519> bringing<00:00:11.849> you<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.420> little

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
and so here bringing you a little

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.010 
and so here bringing you a little
tutorial<00:00:12.960> on<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.670> algorithm<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.570> worked<00:00:15.839> out

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
tutorial on the algorithm I worked out

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.930 
tutorial on the algorithm I worked out
to<00:00:16.260> get<00:00:16.410> the<00:00:16.529> cool<00:00:16.740> of<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:16.980> Dead<00:00:17.340> lighthouse

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
to get the cool of the Dead lighthouse

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.920 
to get the cool of the Dead lighthouse
tiles<00:00:18.539> correct<00:00:19.050> first<00:00:19.410> time<00:00:19.770> every<00:00:20.520> time<00:00:20.930> so

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
tiles correct first time every time so

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.500 
tiles correct first time every time so
there's<00:00:22.109> five<00:00:22.410> steps<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.279> just<00:00:24.240> write

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
there's five steps to this just write

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.140 
there's five steps to this just write
this<00:00:24.689> down<00:00:24.990> or<00:00:25.410> pause<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.980> video<00:00:26.130> take<00:00:27.119> a

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
this down or pause the video take a

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.050 
this down or pause the video take a
picture<00:00:27.859> whatever<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.039> want<00:00:29.070> just<00:00:29.550> makes<00:00:29.939> it

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
picture whatever you want just makes it

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.790 
picture whatever you want just makes it
a<00:00:30.179> bit<00:00:30.330> easier<00:00:30.560> while<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.070> game<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.640> do<00:00:32.820> it

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
a bit easier while in the game to do it

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.430 
a bit easier while in the game to do it
note<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.070> bottom<00:00:35.579> dial<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.780> purple<00:00:37.200> doll

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
note the bottom dial is the purple doll

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.000 
note the bottom dial is the purple doll
and<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.280> cannot<00:00:38.700> move<00:00:39.690> any<00:00:39.930> dials<00:00:40.500> before<00:00:40.920> you

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
and you cannot move any dials before you

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.000 
and you cannot move any dials before you
start<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.489> method<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:43.230> turn<00:00:43.469> yellow<00:00:43.829> tutu

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
start this method so we turn yellow tutu

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.400 
start this method so we turn yellow tutu
it's<00:00:44.700> already<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.270> because<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.809> needed<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
it's already on it because I needed the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.270 
it's already on it because I needed the
power<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.280> turn<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:48.480> butt<00:00:48.750> dial<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:49.620> I<00:00:50.010> just

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
power on to turn the butt dial so I just

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.720 
power on to turn the butt dial so I just
checked<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:50.910> we<00:00:51.690> need<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.899> make<00:00:52.110> sure<00:00:52.730> what

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
checked it and we need to make sure what

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.779 
checked it and we need to make sure what
orange<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.360> on<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:55.020> we<00:00:55.230> can<00:00:55.260> turn<00:00:55.649> blue<00:00:56.129> until

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
orange is on so we can turn blue until

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:04.490 
orange is on so we can turn blue until
orange<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.629> seven

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.830 

so<00:01:05.500> there<00:01:05.830> we<00:01:05.920> go<00:01:06.000> we'll<00:01:07.000> just<00:01:07.180> double<00:01:07.570> check

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
so there we go we'll just double check

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.510 
so there we go we'll just double check
that<00:01:08.080> that<00:01:08.290> worked<00:01:08.590> and<00:01:08.980> it<00:01:09.130> all<00:01:09.280> went

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
that that worked and it all went

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.690 
that that worked and it all went
clockwise<00:01:10.030> they<00:01:10.750> always<00:01:11.170> move<00:01:11.470> clockwise

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.810 

beautiful<00:01:15.700> so<00:01:16.540> that's<00:01:16.750> step<00:01:17.020> two<00:01:17.790> step<00:01:18.790> three

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
beautiful so that's step two step three

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.800 
beautiful so that's step two step three
is<00:01:19.480> we<00:01:20.230> go<00:01:20.620> to<00:01:20.680> the<00:01:21.010> bottom<00:01:21.220> floor<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:22.030> purple

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
is we go to the bottom floor the purple

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.560 
is we go to the bottom floor the purple
dial<00:01:23.200> or<00:01:23.710> some<00:01:24.160> people<00:01:24.310> call<00:01:24.550> it<00:01:24.850> the<00:01:24.880> violet

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
dial or some people call it the violet

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.900 
dial or some people call it the violet
dial<00:01:27.150> yeah<00:01:28.150> so<00:01:28.570> find<00:01:29.229> this<00:01:29.500> one<00:01:29.800> and<00:01:30.190> all<00:01:30.700> we

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
dial yeah so find this one and all we

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:40.690 
dial yeah so find this one and all we
have<00:01:31.030> to<00:01:31.150> do<00:01:31.300> is<00:01:31.450> turn<00:01:31.780> purple<00:01:32.400> 26

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.600 

Oh

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.490 

now<00:01:47.300> we<00:01:47.360> come<00:01:47.900> up<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.770> step<00:01:49.100> 4<00:01:49.520> and<00:01:49.940> we're<00:01:50.690> just

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
now we come up the step 4 and we're just

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.750 
now we come up the step 4 and we're just
going<00:01:51.620> to<00:01:51.830> see<00:01:52.460> what<00:01:52.490> blue<00:01:53.000> is<00:01:53.210> on<00:01:53.840> seven<00:01:54.670> so<00:01:55.670> we

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
going to see what blue is on seven so we

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:05.660 
going to see what blue is on seven so we
need<00:01:55.940> to<00:01:56.060> turn<00:01:56.300> orange<00:01:56.750> until<00:01:57.560> blue<00:01:57.890> is<00:01:58.250> for

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.240 

alright<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.869> they're<00:02:07.049> on<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.290> same<00:02:07.470> number<00:02:07.770> so

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
alright so they're on the same number so

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.609 
alright so they're on the same number so
it<00:02:08.310> was<00:02:08.580> pretty<00:02:09.360> basic<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:10.110> just<00:02:10.319> wanted<00:02:10.590> to

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
it was pretty basic I just wanted to

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.470 
it was pretty basic I just wanted to
double<00:02:11.039> check<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.610> they<00:02:11.849> are<00:02:12.420> going

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
double check that they are going

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.610 
double check that they are going
clockwise<00:02:13.170> because<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.280> was<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.610> one<00:02:14.790> below<00:02:15.209> I

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
clockwise because it was the one below I

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.070 
clockwise because it was the one below I
wasn't<00:02:16.620> 100%<00:02:16.860> sure<00:02:17.370> but<00:02:18.000> luckily<00:02:18.569> it<00:02:18.870> was

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
wasn't 100% sure but luckily it was

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.530 
wasn't 100% sure but luckily it was
otherwise<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.830> would<00:02:19.980> have<00:02:20.010> stuck<00:02:20.640> stuffed<00:02:21.330> up

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
otherwise it would have stuck stuffed up

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.590 
otherwise it would have stuck stuffed up
my<00:02:21.720> whole<00:02:21.900> algorithm<00:02:26.090> so<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.150> thought<00:02:27.390> those

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
my whole algorithm so I thought those

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.900 
my whole algorithm so I thought those
two<00:02:27.959> might<00:02:28.170> have<00:02:28.350> taken<00:02:28.560> me<00:02:28.860> down<00:02:29.100> during

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
two might have taken me down during

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.970 
two might have taken me down during
doing<00:02:30.300> this<00:02:30.480> but<00:02:30.810> likely<00:02:31.050> they<00:02:31.410> didn't<00:02:33.980> okay

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
doing this but likely they didn't okay

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.820 
doing this but likely they didn't okay
so<00:02:35.040> we'll<00:02:35.340> just<00:02:35.489> continue<00:02:35.730> turning<00:02:36.269> orange

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
so we'll just continue turning orange

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.530 
so we'll just continue turning orange
until<00:02:37.830> blue<00:02:38.069> is<00:02:38.280> full<00:02:38.610> it's<00:02:38.970> quite<00:02:39.209> simple

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
until blue is full it's quite simple

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.440 
until blue is full it's quite simple
because<00:02:39.870> they're<00:02:40.080> on<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.350> same<00:02:40.560> number<00:02:44.450> okay

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
because they're on the same number okay

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.250 
because they're on the same number okay
so<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.959> was<00:02:46.140> step<00:02:46.260> 4<00:02:46.850> final<00:02:47.850> step<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:48.510> we<00:02:48.780> come

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
so that was step 4 final step is we come

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.559 
so that was step 4 final step is we come
to<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:49.530> top<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:49.980> turn<00:02:50.720> the<00:02:51.720> yellow<00:02:52.049> dal<00:02:52.500> 22

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
to the top and turn the yellow dal 22

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.580 
to the top and turn the yellow dal 22
and<00:02:55.459> that's<00:02:56.459> it<00:02:56.760> I'll<00:02:57.299> just<00:02:57.840> show<00:02:58.110> you<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:58.440> it

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
and that's it I'll just show you that it

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.009 
and that's it I'll just show you that it
goes<00:02:58.799> to<00:02:59.190> 746<00:03:00.319> we<00:03:01.319> have<00:03:01.440> yellow<00:03:01.920> on<00:03:02.250> too<00:03:03.030> we

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
goes to 746 we have yellow on too we

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.920
