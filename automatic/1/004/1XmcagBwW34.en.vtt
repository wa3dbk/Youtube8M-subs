floor<00:04:07.230> yeah<00:04:08.230> another<00:04:08.410> exit<00:04:08.769> over<00:04:08.859> there<00:04:08.980> by

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
floor yeah another exit over there by

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.759 
floor yeah another exit over there by
the<00:04:09.250> way<00:04:09.400> and<00:04:09.720> if<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:10.810> can<00:04:10.989> just<00:04:11.169> find<00:04:11.349> a<00:04:11.530> button

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
the way and if I can just find a button

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.490 
the way and if I can just find a button
here<00:04:12.400> we<00:04:12.489> go<00:04:12.639> let's<00:04:13.449> try<00:04:13.599> that<00:04:13.780> yes

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
here we go let's try that yes

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.979 
here we go let's try that yes
first<00:04:15.099> first<00:04:15.519> go<00:04:15.760> did<00:04:15.970> you<00:04:16.000> see<00:04:16.090> that<00:04:16.389> did<00:04:16.840> you

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
first first go did you see that did you

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.310 
first first go did you see that did you
see<00:04:17.019> that<00:04:17.500> up<00:04:18.340> these<00:04:18.669> stairs<00:04:19.000> you'll<00:04:19.959> find

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
see that up these stairs you'll find

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.260 
see that up these stairs you'll find
some<00:04:20.859> more<00:04:21.070> stairs<00:04:21.340> but<00:04:21.609> there's<00:04:21.789> actually<00:04:21.970> an

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
some more stairs but there's actually an

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.689 
some more stairs but there's actually an
entrance<00:04:22.510> over<00:04:22.990> here<00:04:23.260> which<00:04:23.770> leads<00:04:23.979> to<00:04:24.220> the

00:04:24.689 --> 00:04:24.699 
entrance over here which leads to the

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.589 
entrance over here which leads to the
library<00:04:25.330> right<00:04:26.190> guys<00:04:27.190> so<00:04:27.430> this<00:04:27.580> is<00:04:27.639> one<00:04:27.970> of<00:04:28.150> two

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
library right guys so this is one of two

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:30.870 
library right guys so this is one of two
entrances<00:04:29.260> into<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.800> library<00:04:30.190> this<00:04:30.610> is<00:04:30.849> a

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
entrances into the library this is a

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.969 
entrances into the library this is a
very<00:04:31.150> small<00:04:31.660> room<00:04:31.720> but<00:04:32.289> this<00:04:32.590> is<00:04:32.740> actually

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
very small room but this is actually

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.890 
very small room but this is actually
pretty<00:04:33.460> random<00:04:33.940> I<00:04:34.000> don't<00:04:34.180> actually<00:04:34.360> like<00:04:34.690> this

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
pretty random I don't actually like this

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.990 
pretty random I don't actually like this
there's<00:04:35.530> a<00:04:35.620> door<00:04:35.979> that<00:04:36.280> leads<00:04:36.430> to<00:04:36.639> a<00:04:36.669> balcony

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
there's a door that leads to a balcony

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.200 
there's a door that leads to a balcony
then<00:04:37.840> there's<00:04:38.020> another<00:04:38.139> door<00:04:38.650> which

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
then there's another door which

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.189 
then there's another door which
continues<00:04:40.210> with<00:04:40.449> the<00:04:40.599> library<00:04:40.930> so<00:04:41.080> it's

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
continues with the library so it's

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.570 
continues with the library so it's
really<00:04:41.500> random<00:04:41.650> I<00:04:41.889> should<00:04:42.099> have<00:04:42.190> put<00:04:42.310> a<00:04:42.340> door

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:42.580 
really random I should have put a door

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.070 
really random I should have put a door
somewhere<00:04:42.849> there<00:04:43.150> to<00:04:43.660> kind<00:04:43.840> of<00:04:43.900> follow

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
somewhere there to kind of follow

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.310 
somewhere there to kind of follow
through<00:04:44.440> but<00:04:44.710> heck<00:04:45.039> who<00:04:45.400> cares<00:04:45.729> this<00:04:46.360> is<00:04:46.599> huge

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
through but heck who cares this is huge

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.340 
through but heck who cares this is huge
lots<00:04:47.919> of<00:04:48.039> passageways

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
lots of passageways

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.290 
lots of passageways
passageway<00:04:51.220> not<00:04:51.520> much<00:04:51.670> of<00:04:51.760> a<00:04:51.880> passageway

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
passageway not much of a passageway

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.740 
passageway not much of a passageway
there<00:04:52.630> but<00:04:52.810> heck<00:04:53.020> this<00:04:53.380> is<00:04:53.560> all<00:04:53.920> really<00:04:54.280> random

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
there but heck this is all really random

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.940 
there but heck this is all really random
scattered<00:04:55.750> everywhere<00:04:56.020> I<00:04:56.140> kind<00:04:56.470> of<00:04:56.560> like<00:04:56.770> how

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
scattered everywhere I kind of like how

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:59.010 
scattered everywhere I kind of like how
this<00:04:57.070> turned<00:04:57.250> out<00:04:57.610> pretty<00:04:58.120> pleased<00:04:58.570> there's

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
this turned out pretty pleased there's

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.990 
this turned out pretty pleased there's
also<00:04:59.320> a<00:04:59.500> staircase<00:04:59.860> up<00:05:00.190> here<00:05:00.430> which<00:05:00.580> leads<00:05:00.880> to

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
also a staircase up here which leads to

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.570 
also a staircase up here which leads to
a<00:05:01.120> smaller<00:05:01.600> section<00:05:02.260> of<00:05:02.410> the<00:05:02.950> library<00:05:03.130> we<00:05:03.430> got

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
a smaller section of the library we got

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.490 
a smaller section of the library we got
this<00:05:03.700> guy<00:05:04.060> over<00:05:04.090> here<00:05:04.360> he's<00:05:04.750> dead

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
this guy over here he's dead

really know why there's beds in a
library<00:05:17.650> maybe<00:05:18.340> people<00:05:18.640> just<00:05:18.790> got<00:05:19.090> tired<00:05:19.420> of

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
library maybe people just got tired of

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.010 
library maybe people just got tired of
reading<00:05:20.680> too<00:05:21.130> many<00:05:21.250> books<00:05:21.510> heck<00:05:22.510> I've<00:05:22.780> never

this tour up to this next room this is

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:40.650 
this tour up to this next room this is
basically<00:05:38.350> the<00:05:38.800> main<00:05:39.220> hole<00:05:39.850> this<00:05:40.210> is<00:05:40.270> where

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
basically the main hole this is where
