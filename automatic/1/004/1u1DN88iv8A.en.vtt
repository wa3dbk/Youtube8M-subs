rough on it but I think it just kind of
looks<00:00:43.079> like<00:00:43.230> Darth<00:00:43.469> Vader's<00:00:43.860> like<00:00:44.040> chess<00:00:44.280> box

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
so on a crave blog there's this clothing

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.840 
so on a crave blog there's this clothing
with<00:01:25.259> LED<00:01:25.650> lights<00:01:25.680> basically<00:01:26.130> it's<00:01:26.580> for

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
with LED lights basically it's for

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.539 
with LED lights basically it's for
bicyclists<00:01:27.630> at<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.020> moment<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:29.220> has<00:01:29.430> an

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
bicyclists at the moment and it has an

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.370 
bicyclists at the moment and it has an
accelerometer<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.659> in<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.960> clothing

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
accelerometer in the in the clothing

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.260 
accelerometer in the in the clothing
that<00:01:31.530> talks<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.040> these<00:01:32.250> LEDs<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.210> if

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
that talks to these LEDs and so if

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.730 
that talks to these LEDs and so if
you're<00:01:33.390> going<00:01:33.509> really<00:01:33.630> fast<00:01:33.869> it's<00:01:34.200> green<00:01:34.470> as

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
you're going really fast it's green as

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.289 
you're going really fast it's green as
you're<00:01:35.310> slowing<00:01:35.579> down<00:01:35.610> these<00:01:35.880> three<00:01:36.119> lights

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
you're slowing down these three lights

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.390 
you're slowing down these three lights
like<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.689> cuff<00:01:36.900> turn<00:01:37.439> yellow<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.040> then

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
like on the cuff turn yellow and then

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.819 
like on the cuff turn yellow and then
