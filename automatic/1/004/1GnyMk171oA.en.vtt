00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
almost any tripod out there and I think

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.830 
almost any tripod out there and I think
the<00:00:52.050> great<00:00:52.320> thing<00:00:52.350> about<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.100> it's

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
the great thing about it is that it's

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.520 
the great thing about it is that it's
can<00:00:54.840> really<00:00:55.050> viewed<00:00:55.289> used<00:00:55.739> for<00:00:56.039> almost<00:00:56.399> any

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
can really viewed used for almost any

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.250 
can really viewed used for almost any
smartphone<00:00:58.530> because<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.930> extends<00:01:00.930> all<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
smartphone because it extends all the

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.910 
smartphone because it extends all the
way<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.949> grab<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.730> you<00:01:02.789> can<00:01:02.910> also<00:01:03.030> yeah<00:01:03.510> I

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
way and grab so you can also yeah I

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.039 
way and grab so you can also yeah I
showed<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.659> centum<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:07.020> also

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
showed you the centum but it can also

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.420 
showed you the centum but it can also
yeah<00:01:07.380> hold<00:01:07.770> no<00:01:08.010> iPhone<00:01:08.610> or<00:01:09.920> pretty<00:01:10.920> much<00:01:10.979> any

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
yeah hold no iPhone or pretty much any

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.810 
yeah hold no iPhone or pretty much any
phone<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.750> within<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.740> range<00:01:14.340> of

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
phone that is within this range of

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.670 
phone that is within this range of
extent<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.570> don't<00:01:15.810> think<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.140> can<00:01:16.970> grab<00:01:17.970> hold<00:01:18.270> of

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
extent I don't think it can grab hold of

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.910 
extent I don't think it can grab hold of
the<00:01:19.680> galaxy<00:01:20.130> note<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:21.409> but<00:01:22.409> other<00:01:22.590> than<00:01:22.740> that

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
the galaxy note but but other than that

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.140 
the galaxy note but but other than that
I<00:01:23.130> think<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.490> should<00:01:23.670> pick<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:24.020> and<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:27.030> only

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
I think you should pick it and the only

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.730 
I think you should pick it and the only
thing<00:01:27.270> that<00:01:27.600> really<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.080> little<00:01:28.650> bit

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
thing that really is a little bit

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.960 
thing that really is a little bit
annoying<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.310> that<00:01:29.340> or<00:01:30.320> the<00:01:31.320> design<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:32.070> that

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
annoying is that or the design is that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.200 
annoying is that or the design is that
you're<00:01:33.210> supposed<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.780> pull<00:01:34.710> up<00:01:34.890> in<00:01:35.100> this<00:01:35.369> bar

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
you're supposed to pull up in this bar

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.330 
you're supposed to pull up in this bar
but<00:01:36.509> when<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.900> pull<00:01:37.530> all<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> way<00:01:37.979> up<00:01:38.159> it

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
but when you pull all the way up it

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.020 
but when you pull all the way up it
sometimes<00:01:39.000> snap<00:01:39.540> out<00:01:39.720> out<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.229> place<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:41.030> it's

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
sometimes snap out out of place but it's

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.730 
sometimes snap out out of place but it's
really<00:01:42.450> not<00:01:42.600> an<00:01:42.720> issue<00:01:42.810> because<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.500> just

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
really not an issue because you just

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.940 
really not an issue because you just
yeah<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.670> can<00:01:44.850> just<00:01:44.880> extend<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.540> like<00:01:45.689> this

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
yeah you can just extend it like this

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.179 
yeah you can just extend it like this
get<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.189> there<00:01:47.689> like<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.530> don't

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
get it in there like that so I don't

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.810 
get it in there like that so I don't
find<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.579> problem<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:51.119> it's<00:01:52.399> it's<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.579> great

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
find it a problem and it's it's a great

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.350 
find it a problem and it's it's a great
way<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.890> capturing<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.340> bit<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.610> video<00:01:56.850> with

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
way of capturing a bit of video with

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.920 
way of capturing a bit of video with
your<00:01:57.659> smartphone<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.439> think<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.369> yeah<00:02:00.270> thumbs

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930

up<00:02:01.079> for<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.469> think<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:01.890> i<00:02:02.189> bought<00:02:02.790> it<00:02:02.939> for

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
up for that I think it's i bought it for

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.149 
up for that I think it's i bought it for
around<00:02:03.420> seven<00:02:03.990> dollars<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.560> i<00:02:04.710> think<00:02:04.920> it's

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
around seven dollars so i think it's

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.920 
around seven dollars so i think it's
very<00:02:05.430> good<00:02:05.549> value<00:02:06.920> thanks
