00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 I know there are some online games 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.600
 that turns you 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.019
 the real robot teacher here this 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.059
 is the newest proposal of citizen science 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.500
 proposed at a university called high 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.120
 tech in the united states 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.430
 when you have fun and play games 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.830
 free jorge by internet you 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.170
 was serving information is 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.420
 feeding a database of 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.269
 scientists who want to realize a little 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.460
 with exam robots for example a 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.990
 doctor if he has a crowd of 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.050
 thousands and thousands of robots 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.170
 microscopes each carries a small 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.120
 of anticancer drugs and will 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.780
 all of them converge for one 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.210
 tumor 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.129
 using magnetic signals from a device 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.570
 magnetic resonance imaging 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.160
 I figured this out then the idea is 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.620
 exactly this one you have several 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.780
 Robots that move in a unique way 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.969
 with only one electromagnetic pulse 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.980
 that can within the human being do 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.489
 many beneficial things 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.520
 they want to know using yourself 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.589
 how the command of these 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.380
 Electromagnetic Robots can 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.409
 push the other service on the other 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.060
 matter within the human body 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.799
 interesting in the game even through 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.780
 of some simple pulses and command 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.540
 simple you will have to take the mold 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.880
 robozinho to do some lessons 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.790
 during the phase however from its 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.770
 uncompromisingly the site takes these 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.680
 best players best info 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.200
 and analyzes with algorithms how it should 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.140
 that mission should be done as it should be 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.310
 commanded robots with pulses 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.710
 electromagnetic 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.210
 if you want to play or participate play 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.490
 and participate in the projects we will enter 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.100
 in ww points user found the point 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.130
 net and dude speaking true you now 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.140
 between you and me you do not know 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:53.670
 always wanted to be a face pokémon master 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.950
 yes there training the pokémons since only 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.130
 it is possible for now at least now 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.820
 You and I can be the master of 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.070
 robots 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.409
 cool, it's good, we tried entering 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.540
 website and tested a little and how 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.380
 the training system of the 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.700
 robot 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.280
 so this site is here you can 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.300
 choose one of these modalities 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.700
 I'll choose here if the beauty then 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.620
 just play the regional you go 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.920
 control all robots at the same time 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.880
 time the city ​​is easy, it's easy, nothing expensive 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.349
 the woman 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.720
 I'll try to play it fast here. 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:30.940
 I already played a little this sale goes 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.310
 control up now a lot of the 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.120
 balls is up there but beauty gave 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.760
 right 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.989
 rap on the left the government that 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.510
 conducted before 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.940
 Let's try again and there I go. 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.600
 I have to take this is to explain myself and 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.230
 it rains 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:51.130
 you have to take this hexagon and 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:55.930
 that you know if you want to take the 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:03:00.340
 kicked back on the hit and that is 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:04.269
 difficult to control at the same time you 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:08.830
 You think you're going to win here then I tried 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:10.299
 the new site will so that part 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.640
 already have to throw some balls for the 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:16.269
 right 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.549
 This is working out now, standing up. 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.650
 Left then I 'm losing to 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:22.840
 always the right parts to us to do in this 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.690
 beauty movement left now 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.209
 washington left I have to think 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:34.660
 that when those who know have to 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:36.519
 left out even 123456 is longer have to 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.200
 do something down there to have 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.280
 more balls that can lower 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.660
 business up 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:50.260
 Let's see if I can go back. 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:50.980
 a little bit now passes by 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.730
 passed on 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:04:03.549
 Look, it's going to work now I'm pushing everything. 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:06.130
 for the right quality you will either 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.660
 103 to 82 seconds or less 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.569
 doing today 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.120
 only got two stars is great 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.250
 he does something here I do not know 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.579
 exactly what you want 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.289
 so I guess it was not the best 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.479
 I think I have to do five stars. 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.430
 for data to be used by 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:28.979
 scientists but I can fight again 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.979
 you can also try on this site
