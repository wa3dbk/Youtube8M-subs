so<00:00:01.410> today<00:00:02.159> we're<00:00:02.310> going<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.490> talk<00:00:02.610> about<00:00:02.760> the

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
so today we're going to talk about the

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.200 
so today we're going to talk about the
Lightyear<00:00:03.510> duet<00:00:03.899> which<00:00:04.259> is<00:00:04.470> a<00:00:04.759> new<00:00:05.759> hair

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
Lightyear duet which is a new hair

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.020 
Lightyear duet which is a new hair
removal<00:00:06.630> system<00:00:06.660> from<00:00:07.259> luminous<00:00:07.740> it<00:00:08.429> combines

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
removal system from luminous it combines

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.069 
removal system from luminous it combines
the<00:00:09.480> original<00:00:10.110> Lightyear<00:00:10.650> ET<00:00:11.629> along<00:00:12.629> with<00:00:12.839> now

00:00:13.069 --> 00:00:13.079 
the original Lightyear ET along with now

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:14.890 
the original Lightyear ET along with now
the<00:00:13.139> new

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
the new

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.240 
the new
like<00:00:15.470> G<00:00:15.890> R<00:00:15.970> HS<00:00:16.970> handpiece<00:00:17.720> and<00:00:18.050> it's<00:00:18.890> really<00:00:19.220> a

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
like G R HS handpiece and it's really a

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.300 
like G R HS handpiece and it's really a
unique<00:00:19.760> handpiece<00:00:20.360> in<00:00:20.600> that<00:00:20.840> a<00:00:21.530> it's<00:00:22.100> the

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
unique handpiece in that a it's the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.609 
unique handpiece in that a it's the
largest<00:00:22.720> handpiece<00:00:23.720> on<00:00:23.930> the<00:00:24.050> market<00:00:24.439> as<00:00:24.590> far

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
largest handpiece on the market as far

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:26.980 
largest handpiece on the market as far
as<00:00:24.830> treating<00:00:25.279> here<00:00:25.520> so<00:00:26.180> we're<00:00:26.689> treating

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
as treating here so we're treating

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.990 
as treating here so we're treating
somebody's<00:00:27.320> back<00:00:27.529> and<00:00:27.890> normally<00:00:28.520> might<00:00:28.790> take

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
somebody's back and normally might take

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.589 
somebody's back and normally might take
3,000<00:00:29.900> pulses<00:00:30.349> we<00:00:31.250> can<00:00:31.430> do<00:00:31.520> it<00:00:31.640> in<00:00:31.730> about<00:00:31.880> 150

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
3,000 pulses we can do it in about 150

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.340 
3,000 pulses we can do it in about 150
now<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:33.800> time<00:00:34.400> of<00:00:34.970> treatments<00:00:35.690> have<00:00:35.840> gone<00:00:36.020> from

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
now so time of treatments have gone from

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.010 
now so time of treatments have gone from
treating<00:00:37.010> backs<00:00:37.250> of<00:00:37.489> an<00:00:37.610> hour<00:00:37.760> to<00:00:38.300> 10<00:00:38.510> to<00:00:38.660> 15

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
treating backs of an hour to 10 to 15

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.310 
treating backs of an hour to 10 to 15
minutes<00:00:39.379> so<00:00:39.559> it's<00:00:39.710> really<00:00:39.890> unique<00:00:40.190> technology

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320 
minutes so it's really unique technology

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.290 
minutes so it's really unique technology
what<00:00:42.320> it<00:00:42.470> does<00:00:42.680> is<00:00:42.949> that<00:00:42.980> it<00:00:43.370> uses<00:00:43.580> a<00:00:43.820> vacuum

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
what it does is that it uses a vacuum

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.880 
what it does is that it uses a vacuum
the<00:00:45.110> vacuum<00:00:45.140> brings<00:00:46.100> the<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:47.390> skin<00:00:47.870> into<00:00:48.770> the

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
the vacuum brings the the skin into the

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.510 
the vacuum brings the the skin into the
closer<00:00:49.850> to<00:00:50.149> the<00:00:50.239> light<00:00:50.920> this<00:00:51.920> means<00:00:52.250> we<00:00:52.489> can

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
closer to the light this means we can

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.209 
closer to the light this means we can
use<00:00:52.850> less<00:00:53.090> joules<00:00:53.480> of<00:00:53.809> energy<00:00:54.020> which<00:00:54.620> is<00:00:54.800> safer

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
use less joules of energy which is safer

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.110 
use less joules of energy which is safer
and<00:00:55.460> less<00:00:55.790> side<00:00:56.390> effects<00:00:56.750> less<00:00:57.620> pain<00:00:58.120> it's

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
and less side effects less pain it's

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.270 
and less side effects less pain it's
also<00:00:59.329> associated<00:01:00.050> that<00:01:00.350> when<00:01:00.649> we<00:01:00.770> bring<00:01:01.070> the

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
also associated that when we bring the

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.160 
also associated that when we bring the
vacuum<00:01:01.460> let's<00:01:02.210> get<00:01:02.390> into<00:01:02.629> the<00:01:02.719> vacuum

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
vacuum let's get into the vacuum

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.950 
vacuum let's get into the vacuum
we<00:01:03.770> actually<00:01:04.040> are<00:01:04.460> taking<00:01:04.910> away<00:01:05.210> some<00:01:05.750> of<00:01:05.780> the

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
we actually are taking away some of the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:09.609 
we actually are taking away some of the
nerve<00:01:06.640> fibers<00:01:07.899> actual<00:01:08.899> pain<00:01:09.140> perception

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:09.619 
nerve fibers actual pain perception

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:11.670 
nerve fibers actual pain perception
because<00:01:10.220> we're<00:01:10.399> stretching<00:01:10.729> those<00:01:11.090> nerves

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
because we're stretching those nerves

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.219 
because we're stretching those nerves
into<00:01:12.680> the<00:01:12.800> on<00:01:12.979> skin<00:01:13.460> in<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.850> vacuum<00:01:14.300> so<00:01:14.930> pain

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
into the on skin in the vacuum so pain

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.010 
into the on skin in the vacuum so pain
is<00:01:15.440> virtually<00:01:16.009> non-existent<00:01:16.850> when<00:01:17.539> we<00:01:17.690> do<00:01:17.840> the

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
is virtually non-existent when we do the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.930 
is virtually non-existent when we do the
light<00:01:18.200> shear<00:01:18.500> H<00:01:18.710> s<00:01:18.979> so<00:01:19.789> we<00:01:20.420> have<00:01:20.600> very<00:01:21.140> fast

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
light shear H s so we have very fast

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.650 
light shear H s so we have very fast
pain-free<00:01:22.959> hair<00:01:23.959> removal<00:01:24.880> in<00:01:25.880> areas<00:01:26.360> such<00:01:26.630> as

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
pain-free hair removal in areas such as

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.980 
pain-free hair removal in areas such as
the<00:01:27.020> axilla<00:01:27.709> the<00:01:28.220> back<00:01:28.429> the<00:01:28.940> legs<00:01:29.209> the<00:01:29.720> chest

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
the axilla the back the legs the chest

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.310 
the axilla the back the legs the chest
arms<00:01:30.830> and<00:01:31.429> then<00:01:31.640> we

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
arms and then we

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.620 
arms and then we
for<00:01:32.620> upper<00:01:32.890> lips<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.400> other<00:01:33.580> areas<00:01:34.060> we<00:01:34.390> need

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
for upper lips and other areas we need

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.130 
for upper lips and other areas we need
the<00:01:34.840> original<00:01:35.350> lightyear<00:01:35.890> we<00:01:36.400> can<00:01:36.610> do<00:01:36.760> that<00:01:37.140> so

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
the original lightyear we can do that so

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.600 
the original lightyear we can do that so
again<00:01:38.350> we're<00:01:38.560> going<00:01:38.650> to<00:01:38.740> treat<00:01:38.980> here<00:01:39.280> and<00:01:39.490> view

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
again we're going to treat here and view

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.340 
again we're going to treat here and view
under<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.060> arms<00:01:42.120> the<00:01:43.120> Machine<00:01:43.870> is<00:01:44.020> cleared

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
under the arms the Machine is cleared

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.170 
under the arms the Machine is cleared
for<00:01:44.590> all<00:01:45.160> skin<00:01:45.580> types

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
for all skin types

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.160 
for all skin types
she's<00:01:47.080> type<00:01:47.350> 3<00:01:47.950> type<00:01:47.980> 4<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.600> you<00:01:49.750> can<00:01:49.780> see

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
she's type 3 type 4 and you can see

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.070 
she's type 3 type 4 and you can see
Sheri<00:01:50.680> exacting<00:01:51.310> here<00:01:51.700> basically<00:01:52.510> it's<00:01:52.960> going

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
Sheri exacting here basically it's going

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.140 
Sheri exacting here basically it's going
to<00:01:53.170> take<00:01:53.380> about<00:01:53.530> four<00:01:53.979> five<00:01:54.220> pulses<00:01:54.760> and<00:01:54.940> she's

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
to take about four five pulses and she's

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.530 
to take about four five pulses and she's
going<00:01:55.330> to<00:01:55.390> have<00:01:55.540> the<00:01:55.600> whole<00:01:55.810> axilla<00:01:56.290> done<00:01:57.540> this

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
going to have the whole axilla done this

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.080 
going to have the whole axilla done this
would<00:01:58.750> have<00:01:58.870> taken<00:01:58.990> about<00:01:59.290> ten<00:01:59.910> minutes<00:02:00.910> in

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
would have taken about ten minutes in

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.900 
would have taken about ten minutes in
the<00:02:01.120> old<00:02:01.360> with<00:02:01.570> the<00:02:01.720> older<00:02:02.020> systems<00:02:02.760> but<00:02:03.760> you

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
the old with the older systems but you

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.670 
the old with the older systems but you
can<00:02:04.090> see<00:02:04.330> here<00:02:04.630> now<00:02:05.020> one<00:02:05.200> of<00:02:05.229> the<00:02:05.350> things<00:02:05.560> that

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
can see here now one of the things that

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.650 
can see here now one of the things that
I<00:02:05.740> want<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.009> point<00:02:06.190> out<00:02:06.400> is<00:02:06.640> that<00:02:07.150> in<00:02:07.300> the<00:02:07.420> old

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
I want to point out is that in the old

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.210 
I want to point out is that in the old
days<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:08.380> hair<00:02:08.560> removal

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
days of hair removal

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.970 
days of hair removal
we<00:02:09.820> got<00:02:10.090> what's<00:02:10.869> called<00:02:11.080> peri<00:02:11.380> follicular

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
we got what's called peri follicular

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.850 
we got what's called peri follicular
erythema<00:02:12.490> and<00:02:12.760> edema<00:02:13.170> we<00:02:14.170> don't<00:02:14.350> see<00:02:14.620> that

a minute
so<00:04:04.740> we<00:04:05.040> like<00:04:05.580> this<00:04:05.970> for<00:04:06.270> the<00:04:06.390> speed<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:06.750> we

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
so we like this for the speed and we

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.880 
so we like this for the speed and we
like<00:04:07.380> this<00:04:07.620> for<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:09.750> fact<00:04:10.020> that<00:04:10.140> light

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
like this for the the fact that light

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.470 
like this for the the fact that light
sheer<00:04:11.190> HS<00:04:11.940> is<00:04:12.680> virtually<00:04:13.680> pain-free<00:04:14.040> as<00:04:14.850> well

as<00:04:15.690> being<00:04:15.960> super<00:04:16.410> quick<00:04:16.680> so<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.880> skin<00:04:18.150> is

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.290 
there with the light your HS the pain
part<00:04:42.270> is<00:04:42.480> virtually<00:04:43.440> eliminated<00:04:44.300> because

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
part is virtually eliminated because

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.240 
part is virtually eliminated because
we're<00:04:45.540> using<00:04:45.720> less<00:04:46.080> joules<00:04:46.440> and<00:04:46.710> because<00:04:47.010> the

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
we're using less joules and because the

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.760 
we're using less joules and because the
skin<00:04:47.430> is<00:04:47.730> stretched<00:04:48.000> the<00:04:48.780> nerve<00:04:49.020> fibers<00:04:49.560> get

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
skin is stretched the nerve fibers get

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.670 
skin is stretched the nerve fibers get
compressed<00:04:50.160> as<00:04:50.610> well<00:04:50.910> so<00:04:51.900> again<00:04:51.990> you<00:04:52.290> can<00:04:52.440> see

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
here she's going back and forth and

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.310 
here she's going back and forth and
almost<00:04:56.040> finished<00:04:56.460> with<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.510> whole<00:04:57.690> lower<00:04:57.960> leg

almost finished with the whole lower leg

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.020 
almost finished with the whole lower leg
