for Samak hotel trying to take him out

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.100 
for Samak hotel trying to take him out
as<00:04:27.400> they<00:04:27.550> took<00:04:27.700> Collingwood<00:04:28.240> out<00:04:28.390> plenty<00:04:28.990> to

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
as they took Collingwood out plenty to

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.510 
as they took Collingwood out plenty to
think<00:04:29.140> about<00:04:29.440> for<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:29.920> captain

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.190 

I<00:04:34.550> don't<00:04:35.150> think<00:04:35.330> he<00:04:35.390> quite<00:04:35.540> connected<00:04:36.080> this

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
I don't think he quite connected this

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.960 
I don't think he quite connected this
shop<00:04:36.800> and<00:04:36.980> good<00:04:37.100> for<00:04:37.280> him<00:04:37.400> because<00:04:37.580> if<00:04:37.820> you<00:04:37.880> had

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
shop and good for him because if you had

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.310 
shop and good for him because if you had
connected<00:04:38.360> it<00:04:38.480> maybe<00:04:38.690> it<00:04:38.870> would<00:04:38.990> have<00:04:39.080> gone<00:04:39.260> to

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
connected it maybe it would have gone to

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:40.750 
connected it maybe it would have gone to
the<00:04:39.500> feeling<00:04:39.770> erected<00:04:40.130> on<00:04:40.250> I<00:04:40.280> think<00:04:40.430> it<00:04:40.730> was

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
the feeling erected on I think it was

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.400 
the feeling erected on I think it was
probably<00:04:41.060> more<00:04:41.480> of<00:04:41.660> the<00:04:41.750> inside<00:04:41.870> edge<00:04:42.230> of<00:04:42.350> the

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
probably more of the inside edge of the

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.980 
probably more of the inside edge of the
bat<00:04:42.820> and<00:04:43.820> that's<00:04:43.970> why<00:04:44.120> it<00:04:44.180> went<00:04:44.330> wide<00:04:44.600> or<00:04:44.840> that

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
bat and that's why it went wide or that

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.910 
bat and that's why it went wide or that
fielder<00:04:45.350> there<00:04:46.660> but<00:04:47.660> it<00:04:47.780> will<00:04:47.900> not<00:04:48.170> stop<00:04:48.560> going

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
fielder there but it will not stop going

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.550 
fielder there but it will not stop going
to<00:04:49.040> say<00:04:49.250> wag<00:04:49.490> from<00:04:50.300> continuing<00:04:51.020> to<00:04:51.080> take<00:04:51.320> on

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
to say wag from continuing to take on

00:04:51.560 --> 00:05:01.470

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
just into international cricket and that

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.460 
just into international cricket and that
circle<00:05:19.090> well<00:05:20.090> that<00:05:20.390> is<00:05:20.570> a<00:05:20.780> quite<00:05:21.080> brilliant

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
circle well that is a quite brilliant

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.850 
circle well that is a quite brilliant
catch<00:05:22.300> he<00:05:23.300> in<00:05:23.480> Bell<00:05:23.720> at<00:05:23.930> mid<00:05:24.080> wiki<00:05:24.290> and<00:05:24.530> I<00:05:24.560> think

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860 
catch he in Bell at mid wiki and I think

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.560 
catch he in Bell at mid wiki and I think
it<00:05:25.040> took<00:05:25.190> he<00:05:25.400> took<00:05:25.580> it<00:05:25.730> on<00:05:25.850> the<00:05:25.970> second<00:05:26.330> chance

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
it took he took it on the second chance

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.210 
it took he took it on the second chance
I<00:05:26.720> think<00:05:26.750> it<00:05:27.140> bounced<00:05:27.350> out<00:05:27.560> of<00:05:27.620> the<00:05:27.740> hand<00:05:28.010> but

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
I think it bounced out of the hand but

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.740 
I think it bounced out of the hand but
all<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.520> same<00:05:28.700> England<00:05:29.090> needed<00:05:29.420> something
