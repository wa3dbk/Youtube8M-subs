00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.720
 Hello, I 'm alan brito in this video I'm going 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.000
 show you how it 's possible 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.850
 work with character animation 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.040
 with the after effects 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.570
 if you do not know many of the 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.090
 animations you watch that we 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.310
 we watch on TV or in the movies are made 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.590
 using the after effects including 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.970
 character animation have the 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.859
 here after effects tools that 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.120
 are very useful for doing this kind of 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:36.920
 and one of them is the petit pinto and 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.630
 I 'll show in this video how it works 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.970
 this paper chick and for that we 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.570
 we need a victim and our victim 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.700
 will be the hollow so I have here a 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.260
 Goal image I know you almost 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.000
 nobody knows the goku in the house almost 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.469
 nobody knows who this is 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.180
 character 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.680
 if you do not know for the love of god 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.289
 then know we have the 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.940
 goku and what plays the chick before 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.309
 start showing here the 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.289
 pt work 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.340
 way is a tool that allows you to 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:12.920
 you can that it allows you to create 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.360
 distortions in an image and these 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.600
 clear deformations will not solve all 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.399
 the aspects related to its animation 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.770
 but they will help create small 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.300
 animations that would be very difficult to 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.759
 created for example mainly 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.280
 in material based on beach max as is 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.280
 the case of this image which is not a vector 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.140
 then you would not need it for example 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.569
 to draw all the frames of an animation 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.849
 you could use the chest chick that he 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.580
 would help in this regard 

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:42.649
 so let's use the chick paper for 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.660
 using the tool is super simple you 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.580
 simply click here 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.190
 painting paper background 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.500
 it will open a panel with some 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.520
 options and you will mark here with this 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.679
 option for pinto where do you want to 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.770
 form which are training points 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:04.369
 here in this image so I have here 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.099
 for example in the goal I will score some 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.899
 Points here I was kind of crazy 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:10.489
 here with the zoom 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:17.420
 So I 'm going to book one here. 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:19.720
 on the foot I will score here on the other foot I will 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.050
 check one here at the waist 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.860
 and another hakim just below the 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.930
 chin 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.730
 so I made these markings of these 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.320
 I will not score any for the 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.510
 because in this particular image 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.550
 arms are attached to the body then 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.330
 this would end up creating information 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.130
 very weird but in practice the 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.720
 that I did here with this pinto purpose 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.390
 What I marked 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.700
 I scored training points if you 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.040
 I want now with the pin 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.710
 even if I hover over a 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.640
 these click-and-drag looks 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.050
 what happens 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:03:01.600
 the after effects will form the image 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:03.700
 based on that mark including you 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.470
 can stretch you can make effects 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:10.780
 of this that pulls with with the character and 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.480
 It is clear here if you are to form much 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.370
 image will not get very good then 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.060
 you can for example make animations 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.590
 super fast here with the after effects 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.560
 using simply the paper of chick 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.850
 then how her as I would for example 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.860
 an animation like this that using the hollow 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.420
 would simply come here on the team in 2007 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.940
 which is super simple almost has no 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.680
 information here then we have the 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:39.070
 our hunches 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:43.420
 the roles tim pn participations we have 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:46.739
 here the positions of the pi pi serve in this 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:49.989
 Tell us on this list here natalini 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.549
 and you will notice that the clock here 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.560
 to animate our intellect already 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:58.989
 is connected in all of them then by 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.430
 example could only in a second 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.430
 here a little bit just forward in this 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:07.299
 position I could have formed this 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:13.810
 this is the one and this is the point for this 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:15.940
 this place here and could do with 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.950
 he gives form if you see you 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.540
 notice when a hover here 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:22.000
 position here 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.310
 it shows the original position of the 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.090
 character and note that it should he 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.680
 He laid the body of the hollow for what he did 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.530
 That's because with after effects 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.760
 Tracing the body because of the gulf that 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.880
 type of situation 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.950
 he has here is he tracked I used one 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.170
 png image with transparent background then 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:43.150
 he just crawled the pixels they had 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.150
 color information which was transparent 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:51.480
 He ignored it so I can make it 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.480
 Come back here and come back. 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:58.420
 so we'll have the following animation 

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.180
 see I did not have to draw any 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:05.640
 kind of extra information I did not do 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.640
 absolutely nothing related here 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:15.370
 Of course he's slow down here but I 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.950
 I can create a deformation using the 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:26.920
 Just cucumber if you want you can 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:28.900
 read here evidently I can just pick up 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.900
 these iframes here and let's try to leave 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.900
 this is a little more movement 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.900
 frantic 

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:50.910
 so look there we created an animation 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.250
 with the goal without having to do any type 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:56.670
 extra drawing or do absolutely 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:58.710
 nothing related to redesigning this for 

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:01.500
 make the animation with the frames the 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:04.500
 after effects pitching already solve 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.240
 much in this kind of situation and he 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:09.150
 can form the image here as everything 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:11.610
 see this kind of movement here with 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.590
 this tool greatly accelerates any 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.590
 type of production related to the 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:19.350
 then you already know how to use the 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.930
 pet pinto at least the basics of pt 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.150
 pinto no after effects 

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:27.690
 If you liked this video, please

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:53.480
 you have understood how it works 

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:53.480
 the chick itself and until the next
