 mac online 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.140
 that's why it was all kinda 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.400
 weird and when I first 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:41.310
 I saw press photos 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:43.549
 because of its packaging free that 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.750
 you can show yourself a little closer 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.149
 when I saw the press photos 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:54.450
 I like to do a collection like that again 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:56.939
 blablabla and so he looks out details in 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.090
 Frost finish was a bit because of me 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.799
 the press photos watch totally league 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.299
 It looks like that, so that's just a stop 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.340
 really nice to do over there 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.320
 Unfortunately, I can not help you with that 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.080
 heard talk and I do not want that 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.770

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.190

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.200

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.450

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.720
 I bought , so to speak 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:32.120
 become weak and have three 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.080
 On one hand, the kurt pesl bought things 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.000
 maybe some of you are giving 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.100
 already in many of them is almost 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:47.610

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:49.110
 this black very soft well and that 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.980
 There were two others right now 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:55.230
 colors and then I just have to 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.209
 slam on the reason me 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.550

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.110
 I also want to make you a video 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.120
 but now that's all going so fast 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.239
 had to 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.340
 I have the last two weeks 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.470
 An everyday make up just evolves 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:15.720
 lime donate and I have the from 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.430
 ok and i also have a very good one 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.920
 from essence so there I will you 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.630
 again my top 5 kohl blablabla 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.230
 So, I already do what I do 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.850
 want 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.620
 I have to make new videos 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.840
 and so for me a channel is totally 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.880
 good or is it important to me 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.560
 caravan is rather soft and creamy and 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.360
 I can handle it well and that is 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.070
 definitely the case here 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.140
 So I bought two colors 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:42.140
 that's the sense of style 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.000
 I wish you a lot 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:04:00.019
 interesting a navy blue with black 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:02.160
 Subtone very black 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.340
 It could be a bit better 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.470
 That's what I see now 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.170
 [Music] 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.120
 at the make-up on it together with the 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.070
 black from it now but as I said 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.750
 how I did something I show 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.209
 So, that's the sense of being 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:25.210
 really chic jeans jeans blue 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:27.550
 black and then the rebell so one 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:32.350
 I have a very nice one again 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:40.510
 description bordeaux was threatening with 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:42.490
 black and just what the super super 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.140
 pleasant is that the equally beautiful 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.010
 you can be creamy 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.920
 to process 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.590
 that's why the page has become and then 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.600
 I had the marie on the block 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.970
 a spot seen from this nail oh 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.740
 where she said we have to do it ourselves 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.950
 decide the shimmer has somewhere 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.850
 between gray beige songs pink and have 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.060
 I mean for a stupid one 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.680
 color so what gives and then I have me 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.120
 the looked at and magic what should I 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.070
 say hest he wrote it perfectly 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.080
 looks white in the camera now but 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.210
 I tell you in real it is somehow 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.280
 totally different depending on the light looks yes 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.710
 really more lilac more gray sea 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.750
 blue and then I have everyone 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.669
 of headset have as bought the 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.910
 and they all have something for this 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:38.350
 nail polish why are all so wild on it 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:40.690
 Let's go for it again or something like that 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.570
 that applied to me now 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:48.280
 a little too decent with this total 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:49.300
 judt the hand well so is totally and nude 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.660
 the hand that is somehow 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.530
 exciting but I'm still there in the same 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:56.710
 I will take you connection 

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:59.740
 nail design on what especially me from 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:02.300
 inspired the name of the collection 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:05.000
 So that will follow soon 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.360
 yes and that's why it's still the 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.759
 become nail polish 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.460
 So for me the three things for the 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:14.870
 I know that many of them talk 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.310
 now again tell you your I realized 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.409
 talking afford me said that to it 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.180
 this nail polish probably a similar im 

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:21.289
 Unfortunately I have p2 assortment 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.000
 forget his name 

00:06:21.289 --> 00:06:25.639
 Windows is easy please 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.129
 underneath and as I said we strive 

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:30.650
 yes you always really qualitative 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:32.479
 to recommend things when it is at 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:38.180
 kajalstift I find that very much 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:41.569
 difficult but that's more in the video 

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:46.240
 I would say yes in this sense 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:50.620
 that was still a hall for you and 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.620
 your coco until the next video
