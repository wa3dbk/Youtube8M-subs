 pair of f 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.190
 of 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.190
 Crawling 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.099
 Hmm 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.829
 Thank you Hello Reimu 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.630
 It's Marisa 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:48.560
 I will do a baby transmission this time 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.690
 At that time agw rpg continued to pick the piston 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.040
 t 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.730
 Sniper down 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.900
 Cut toward the left delta 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:01.610
 Wait 0 There is a reaction of the enemy behind 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.610
 Is that position too far? 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.180
 Kana aim at Anne pg 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.510
 It looks like I'm going to occupy Charlie 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.690
 It seems that the squad members are in war, let's go for support 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:19.050
 I live person's friends says to the squad this time Speaking 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:23.060
 I went see, if if good because we put a link in the description 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.060
 However, the military personnel did a lot of people 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.440
 I would like to attack with , but if you take it here there will be no base in the base 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.440
 I want to protect 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.870
 It may not be able to cooperate very much with the present situation squads whether Kagoshima's enemy reinforcements are also coming in earnest 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.990
 I'm worried 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:46.570
 That's anti-aircraft fire quite prefecture of enemy 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:52.409
 You're not going to fight with the launcher, but it's safe because you're fighting with an ally armored car 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:59.149
 I wonder because the squad's Do began to reduce the gauge of the base to gulp have me pretty hard 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.149
 It to the next will be to attack the delta in When you have finished Mochotto ammunition Naa 9 recapture's anxiety 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.600
 I want to have a stomachache because of the early consumption of this medium ammunition 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.590
 Please give me a little 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.569
 Hey 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.569
 Give me some ammunition from one company 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.170
 I wonder if I'm here I'm here 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:23.870
 Oh, I've been waiting for a while and I 'm a girl who played the role of Kyun 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.870
 I just wanted ammunition 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.360
 Caught was yes l 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:33.400
 Illustration of a heli pie that missed the helicopter 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.400
 Could it over there because not finished president of design 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.460
 Because this gun is close to me, I want to approach and fight 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.060
 Do you go with grenades 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.060
 Good afternoon 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.319
 There is still a reaction in the back if you are alone in the ward 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.760
 This clears eyes 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:59.520
 There is still a reaction behind me 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:03.790
 Asuka who can see the spot mark but can not see the contents 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.260
 Please recover using a little pillar around here 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.239
 Have ammunition bear taken by the 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.239
 Hey hey, please give me ammunition 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:19.300
 Ass to whistle Sanger by the friendship of the people of stray discretionary here now 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.300
 I wonder if good story 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.710
 Oh I was saying Tsu people of Mara the only If you think it's a good story was a man of this Graphics and friends 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.830
 It was a scam 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:34.080
 But I wonder are very much Charlie is blame 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.080
 I do not have an east match, so maybe I have 1 rpg . 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.819
 One person exclusion 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.700
 It seems to be safe or it seems to be in the picture 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.840
 Ayappari stature is unreasonable or 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.840
 Ammunition box falls 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.209
 Charlie was casually recaptured 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.209
 I wonder if I can't spot it 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.170
 Allies have spotted 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.970
 Oh I wonder if ally san had cleared up 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.430
 Don't let allies head to Charlie one after another 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.690
 Yes present 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:18.280
 There was a hit mark but I can not kill it 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.280
 I'm still hiding in that area 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:25.030
 It's not a hit 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.030
 Charlie recaptured and cut 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:32.460
 Charlie and the Delta are being taken, so I came to take the back to the back intention 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.420
 Do not feel like teaching rather than infiltrating 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:39.800
 To'd been completely unaware this 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:41.490
 It would be better to refrain from firing at such times if possible , but I selected some enemy soldiers around me. 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.090
 It looks like 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:48.710
 It looks like the enemy is approaching from the other side of the same building 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.710
 I'll set up from here 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.000
 Hard work 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.330
 Mr. squad boiled 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.620
 I want to secure this at once 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:07.949
 It seems that the enemy is on a fixed missile. It is a prey of rpg. 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.280
 Next medium distance goal 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.690
 Goda 

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:24.270
 I've been idle to Charlie 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:28.930
 You can catch up if the base is not advantageous because there are 23 spots behind the ticket. 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:32.260
 It seems that there is an enemy tank very much, so it is not possible to overdo it, but from the top dedicated zoo 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:37.440
 There are many enemies in the mountain in front of the grabber 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.440
 It's time for rpg's long distance not beam rpg 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.409
 Ada was 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.610
 eh 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:43.610
 I wonder if I could hit another one 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:48.710
 You have escaped 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:51.920
 But unexpected's roughly 200m well against 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:57.080
 I wonder because the mother I am the current rpg 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:06:01.540
 I'm not good at the anti-aircraft target I've removed to the transport helicopter so the picture is too easy 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:04.570
 Do not you relatively easy to aim to buy at the target hit start I transport helicopter 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:07.080
 Not too high I'm too hard to be an amateur who struggles I apologize 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:08.590
 Yes this matter 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.550
 Hiro five years 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.850
 Hated following is from gold 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.850
 Ne 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:23.780
 A charity I've been taken 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:29.020
 To choose whether or not escape under the floor and the 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:32.610
 Naa's how to hold from No dogs and I think we are targeted to the edge 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.610
 There is reaction of the valley enemy soldiers relieved 

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.020
 It was built in an instant 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.180
 I'm going to Charlie Yosemite 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.620
 I have a squad too 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:47.440
 I 've been attacked by some sort of arrangement, but I guess I 'll hear it and drop it off 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:51.840
 Hit but I will not fall 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.840
 That is where the hunt went down 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.740
 And 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:02.550
 And 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:06.740
 End 

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.740
 The 83rd ticket was pretty good fight 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:17.830

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:17.830
