00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
angle there we go now at this point in

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.060 
angle there we go now at this point in
time<00:02:01.640> don't<00:02:02.640> wanna<00:02:02.760> lose<00:02:02.880> their<00:02:03.030> keys<00:02:03.450> there

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:14.670 

all<00:02:11.890> right<00:02:12.189> now<00:02:13.120> there<00:02:13.719> is<00:02:13.870> a<00:02:13.900> small<00:02:14.379> latch

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
all right now there is a small latch

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.920 
all right now there is a small latch
right<00:02:15.310> here<00:02:15.670> when<00:02:16.239> I'm<00:02:16.389> going<00:02:16.510> to<00:02:16.569> push<00:02:16.810> the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
right here when I'm going to push the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.449 
right here when I'm going to push the
motherboard<00:02:17.319> right<00:02:17.680> underneath<00:02:17.950> that<00:02:18.249> it<00:02:18.430> a

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
motherboard right underneath that it a

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.580 
motherboard right underneath that it a
lot<00:02:18.670> latch<00:02:19.209> it<00:02:19.389> into<00:02:19.569> place<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.049> I<00:02:20.379> believe

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
lot latch it into place and I believe

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.780 
lot latch it into place and I believe
there's<00:02:20.769> another<00:02:20.950> one<00:02:21.159> up<00:02:21.280> here<00:02:21.459> you'll<00:02:21.639> feel
