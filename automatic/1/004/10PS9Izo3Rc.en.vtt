00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:09.969
 hello everybody my name is thiago and this is 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:12.339
 3d neo is a pretty smartphone 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.650
 dedicated to the world of games was 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:17.470
 presented in January between gate 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.030
 much attention and during the mobile world 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.190
 congress in barcelona 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.280
 Let's take a look at these more 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.100
 a game 3ds sky a very design 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.740
 identical to the country's sony tape level 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.499
 analogue button layout is 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.109
 too high when used with the 

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:37.809
 vertical smartphone we like to 

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:41.710
 wake up with is how console was ago 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:44.230
 of 5.5 connected with full HD sound is 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:47.649
 surrounded by buttons dedicated to games 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.379
 with two analog one on each side a 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:52.059
 on the left side and the 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.899
 traditional four buttons on the side 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.550
 right 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.129
 in the upper frame is still 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.800
 four triggers and control buttons 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.409
 of the volume for the unblocking of the neu 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.370
 3d and as you would expect the screen and 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:05.619
 tadeu 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.110
 however the 3d neuro has a 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.840
 built-in software capable of converting 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.659
 the tactile controls of the games to 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.810
 control using the 3d douro buttons 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.310
 that is what it is missing and many who 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.820
 asks me for smartphones and tablets 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.820
 android not only looking at the sky or 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.100
 3d as a smartphone and as european for 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.140
 be the ad MartÃ­ was confused or even 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.859
 Because it's not easy, it's pretty easy. 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.619
 Asian and as we said 3d model 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:36.789
 based high to be used as a 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.350
 smartphone 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.750
 however for those looking for a 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.149
 gaming platform with android in 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.899
 portable so far we have not seen better 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.990
 option 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.570
 not even the xperia play in the past 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.420
 showed so much sun while this branch 3g 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.969
 that has not even been released in the market and 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.670
 already has more games designed for me 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:58.870
 xperia play which has climbed in the last 34 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.090
 years 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.120
 Who are we going before we move forward? 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.600
 for the justifications he still wants to speak 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:11.260
 of the extra is a 3d with a hat trick 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.600
 that is, follow your look by adapting 3d to 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.570
 position of your eyes and works 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.720
 caving bath ie we have a 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.600
 smartphone with android 4.4 kitkat com 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.700
 an event design with playstation vita 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:27.580
 as a 3d screen is better than the one 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.910
 nintendo 3ds and with enough games 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.890
 free to play is something very sunny 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.550
 internally and with the chipset 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:40.540
 mediatek more specifically the model is 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:43.630
 6592 with the optical processor 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.870
 now two southern giants will be 2 gb 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.330
 16 GB RAM memory space 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.260
 supports micro sd cards up to 64 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:56.320
 gigabytes mobility 4 jelta and with dual 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.450
 yes and wifi and bluetooth connectivity 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.930
 is not a smartphone with 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.360
 we have an actor who can keep 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.940
 good performance and fluency on android 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.860
 depending on clear account interface 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.920
 still with a 3 megapixel camera 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.650
 behind and another 5 megapixel the front is 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.260
 important to further say that the neo 3d goes 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.290
 has three story game stores 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.940
 android store 3d czech manufacturer 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.100
 and the chanel store 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.530
 this is an already common mark is considerable 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.640
 of the games and what you are seeing is the 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:33.220
 famous tashi panda was the game that served 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.410
 presentation of this console either in SS 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.239
 either at mobile congress 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.640
 we know neither launch date in 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.890
 Portugal neither in Brazil nor us 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.459
 We know the price but we like what 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.290
 saw 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.090
 I hope this smartphone for games 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.400
 we got banners for the markets 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.380
 come to me, I also hope that 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.030
 liked this videos so click 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.860
 I like the button and it helps us a lot 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.050
 so I am not angry because 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.330
 comments and if you have any questions 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:59.739
 there is no comment that on youtube or 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.990
 uses social networks like twitter 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.480
 facebook google to talk to 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.840
 fluent for them are in the description of the 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.840
 trio
