so<00:02:57.820> it's<00:02:58.060> not<00:02:58.240> really<00:02:58.540> any<00:02:58.660> different<00:02:59.080> to<00:02:59.230> be

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
so it's not really any different to be

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:09.120 
so it's not really any different to be
honest<00:02:59.620> or<00:03:00.100> multi-hit<00:03:07.440> mixing<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.530> Flint<00:03:08.800> steel

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
honest or multi-hit mixing a Flint steel

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.920 
honest or multi-hit mixing a Flint steel
homies<00:03:09.520> now<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:12.330> guess<00:03:13.330> it's<00:03:13.510> because<00:03:13.780> they

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
homies now I guess it's because they

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.630 
homies now I guess it's because they
couldn't<00:03:14.170> get<00:03:14.440> the<00:03:14.650> UM<00:03:16.830> hits<00:03:17.830> on<00:03:18.040> story<00:03:18.370> again

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
couldn't get the UM hits on story again

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:41.820 
couldn't get the UM hits on story again
I<00:03:18.670> should<00:03:18.970> just<00:03:19.090> make<00:03:19.330> it<00:03:19.480> oh<00:03:40.200> it<00:03:41.200> does<00:03:41.380> three

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
I should just make it oh it does three

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:55.100 
I should just make it oh it does three
now<00:03:42.330> there's<00:03:43.330> a<00:03:43.450> balance<00:03:48.870> oh<00:03:52.950> that's<00:03:53.950> cool

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
now there's a balance oh that's cool

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.780 
now there's a balance oh that's cool
yeah<00:03:56.110> it<00:03:56.230> does<00:03:56.440> it's<00:03:56.710> not<00:03:56.770> quite<00:03:57.160> a<00:03:57.190> spamming

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
yeah it does it's not quite a spamming

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.940 
yeah it does it's not quite a spamming
it<00:03:57.910> doesn't<00:03:58.210> last<00:03:58.390> quite<00:03:58.600> as<00:03:58.750> long<00:03:58.780> so<00:03:59.440> even<00:03:59.470> if

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
it doesn't last quite as long so even if

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.550 
it doesn't last quite as long so even if
you've<00:04:00.070> accidentally<00:04:00.810> cast<00:04:01.810> it<00:04:02.050> it's<00:04:02.170> not

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.170 

I'm<00:04:06.580> liking<00:04:07.580> this<00:04:07.670> beat<00:04:08.000> though<00:04:09.940> it's<00:04:10.940> cool

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
I'm liking this beat though it's cool

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.930 
I'm liking this beat though it's cool
but<00:04:11.450> snazzy
