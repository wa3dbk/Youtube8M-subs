00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
back and forth and he eventually went so

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.930 
back and forth and he eventually went so
it<00:00:40.070> was<00:00:40.159> like<00:00:40.250> okay<00:00:40.580> and<00:00:40.760> um<00:00:42.100> game<00:00:43.100> 2<00:00:43.400> we<00:00:43.699> sign

it was like okay and um game 2 we sign

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.410 
it was like okay and um game 2 we sign
deck<00:00:44.120> and<00:00:44.680> I<00:00:45.680> guess<00:00:46.190> he<00:00:46.339> cited<00:00:46.729> in<00:00:46.850> mine<00:00:47.120> crash

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
deck and I guess he cited in mine crash

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.399 
deck and I guess he cited in mine crash
and<00:00:47.739> his<00:00:48.739> eventual<00:00:49.610> I<00:00:50.360> find<00:00:50.629> out<00:00:50.750> that<00:00:51.019> his

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:51.409 
and his eventual I find out that his

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:54.460 
and his eventual I find out that his
open<00:00:51.799> hand<00:00:52.040> was<00:00:52.400> triple<00:00:53.330> Technos<00:00:53.720> I<00:00:54.049> think<00:00:54.320> he

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
open hand was triple Technos I think he

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.590 
open hand was triple Technos I think he
said<00:00:54.680> double<00:00:55.070> tanky<00:00:55.489> and<00:00:55.670> triple<00:00:56.120> mine<00:00:56.269> crash

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
said double tanky and triple mine crash

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.670 
said double tanky and triple mine crash
so<00:00:57.290> I<00:00:57.650> start<00:00:58.070> because<00:00:58.760> um<00:00:59.059> he<00:00:59.780> won<00:01:00.350> the<00:01:00.500> first

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
so I start because um he won the first

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.680 
so I start because um he won the first
one<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:01.159> I<00:01:01.940> activate<00:01:02.720> tanky<00:01:03.199> and<00:01:03.489> I<00:01:04.600> think<00:01:05.600> I

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690
