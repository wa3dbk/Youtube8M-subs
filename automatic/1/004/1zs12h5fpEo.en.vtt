00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
fantastic and actually we just had to

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.450 
fantastic and actually we just had to
read<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.870> bitch<00:04:22.080> for<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.800> further<00:04:23.250> thing

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
read the the bitch for the further thing

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.520 
read the the bitch for the further thing
not<00:04:23.669> even<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.030> script<00:04:24.210> and<00:04:24.419> they<00:04:25.050> jumped<00:04:25.470> on

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
not even the script and they jumped on

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.740 
not even the script and they jumped on
board<00:04:25.740> I<00:04:25.980> think<00:04:26.340> they<00:04:26.430> realized<00:04:26.790> that<00:04:26.970> you

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
board I think they realized that you

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.680 
board I think they realized that you
know<00:04:27.780> to<00:04:28.220> to<00:04:29.220> convey<00:04:29.760> rise<00:04:30.030> as<00:04:30.210> a<00:04:30.240> concept<00:04:30.540> they

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
know to to convey rise as a concept they

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.120 
know to to convey rise as a concept they
really<00:04:30.990> need<00:04:31.230> to<00:04:31.380> show<00:04:31.530> expressions<00:04:32.010> and

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
really need to show expressions and

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.940 
really need to show expressions and
emotions<00:04:32.250> and<00:04:33.210> I<00:04:33.270> think<00:04:33.510> that<00:04:33.660> you<00:04:34.050> know<00:04:34.140> for

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
emotions and I think that you know for

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.470 
emotions and I think that you know for
again<00:04:35.130> like<00:04:35.220> a<00:04:35.280> sense<00:04:35.520> it's<00:04:35.640> free<00:04:35.760> three<00:04:36.000> it's

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
again like a sense it's free three it's

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.000 
again like a sense it's free three it's
really<00:04:36.960> important<00:04:37.410> to<00:04:37.440> connect<00:04:37.800> emotionally

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
really important to connect emotionally
