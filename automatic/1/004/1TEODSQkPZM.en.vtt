00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.650
 hello guys to me nobody had the head 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.650
 and here 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.660
 the textures pack 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.970
 for 128 that 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.300
 he operated me 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.010
 so that it stays more less quality 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:40.250
 less quality and better quality etc 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.250
 It is recommended a good 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.020
 the 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.990
 I had a ladder 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.990
 Torch looks better 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.560
 of good grass 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.600
 then no longer the iron bars 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:53.070
 the carbon and gold iron diamond 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.070
 this is a video that is 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.659
 the wood of the pine wood 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.950
 the normal bad 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.950
 this would be still 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.070
 with a wool 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.070
 and so the sword would look 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.120
 of the shovel 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.890
 also quite actually 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.239
 Over there 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.570
 water changes a lot 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.750
 and what also changes the boy in the 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.750
 bed 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.170
 a lot of the sand 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.599
 the guys in what you can see 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.140
 you can continue to investigate how 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.140
 are things 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.349
 s 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.349
 it's ice 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.630
 but it comes as a whole world 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.630
 the desert of 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.030
 hear 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.260
 demands and unequal then 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.490
 here is the emerald in the dyes 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.569
 the parrot and good 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.569
 is 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.950
 this father is very good by the way this 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.050
 well there is something else 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.240
 the skiing I do not know here is lined irons 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.960
 of gold 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.960
 it's like a coronary 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.780
 that would look like the sexy corner 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:33.680
 and the world 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:35.860
 that my body a good patio boy is 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.789
 good kids this 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.789
 is the object of the meeting 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.650
 and let's go through the installation 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.400
 this guy what they have to do here 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.470
 we have to get into 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.240
 internet and while the link is 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.600
 here it is down the description 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.110
 when entering this page 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:08.000
 from kraft point d 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:09.980
 the detector and guys here is this that 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.980
 I have a super good computer a 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.020
 very good processor like this one and 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.840
 is recommended that I think it's the 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.120
 acetate and here then and going down less the 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.000
 video quality 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:25.040
 the quality of the graphics but so 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.810
 would run better the community would receive 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:28.370
 a slow one but I recommend that 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:29.940
 download the recommended starts 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.170
 here 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:33.170
 and after 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.420
 download 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.920
 the discharge 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.820
 and you start it on the desk 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:47.340
 I have a folder that 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.340
 and this will come out good 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.689
 you will get one like that or the one of 128 that's why 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.409
 what I wanted to explain in the quality 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:02.599
 how graphic this will come out 

00:06:00.409 --> 00:06:05.749
 and not to install it the only thing they have 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:07.320
 what to do is say to app percentage 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:09.849
 data 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.399
 percentage 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:15.659
 I think the Windows XP comes out good 

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:15.659
 here to run 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:23.919
 they have to be here I already have the passes 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:25.120
 on the 28th and I have others that are of quality 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.470
 what we do 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.240
 what they have to do is drag 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.240
 this folder and it will already be installed 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:34.429
 I'm going to take out the one I was wearing 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:44.610
 good is very easy 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:52.110
 because you got resources and the 64 did not come out 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:00.890
 I am 

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:07.310
 it's getting is about being a 

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.310
 little bit more 

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:15.089
 I know that everything was installed 

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:15.089
 super simple because you can do it 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:25.140
 all the video is very easy like and 

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.140
 subscribe I know 

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.960
 hear 

00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:49.899
 it burns it burns it burns 

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.720
 that is burning 

00:07:54.470 --> 00:08:00.800
 because I walk because I'm walking 

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.800
 walk alone
