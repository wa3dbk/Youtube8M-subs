00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.840 
starts obviously we doesn't count
against<00:01:48.509> our<00:01:48.659> sub<00:01:49.250> our<00:01:50.250> subs<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.670> are<00:01:50.759> in

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
against our sub our subs that are in

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.370 
against our sub our subs that are in
here<00:01:51.090> so<00:01:51.299> again<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.570> lineup<00:01:51.899> button<00:01:52.170> allows

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
here so again the lineup button allows

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.630 
here so again the lineup button allows
us<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.680> actually<00:01:52.770> put<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.159> lineup<00:01:53.430> spring

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
us to actually put in lineup spring

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.060 
us to actually put in lineup spring
jersey<00:01:53.939> number<00:01:54.240> we<00:01:54.899> can<00:01:55.049> spin<00:01:55.350> our<00:01:55.500> rotation

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
jersey number we can spin our rotation

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.889 
jersey number we can spin our rotation
if<00:01:56.460> we're<00:01:56.640> gonna<00:01:56.729> rotate<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.270> one<00:01:57.450> forward

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
if we're gonna rotate it one forward

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.690 
if we're gonna rotate it one forward
kind<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.200> thing<00:01:58.380> every<00:01:59.009> time<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.280> click<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.670> it

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
kind of thing every time I click it it

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.639 
kind of thing every time I click it it
moves<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.119> forward

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
moves it forward

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.950 
moves it forward
pretty<00:02:01.649> obvious<00:02:01.950> okay<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:02.610> now<00:02:02.909> our<00:02:03.119> in-game

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
pretty obvious okay so now our in-game

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.899 
pretty obvious okay so now our in-game
stats<00:02:04.380> here<00:02:04.799> as<00:02:04.950> we're<00:02:05.130> going<00:02:05.280> through<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.670> game

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
stats here as we're going through a game

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.089 
stats here as we're going through a game
let's<00:02:06.149> say<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:07.200> know<00:02:07.320> our<00:02:07.409> first<00:02:07.680> server<00:02:07.950> goes

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
let's say you know our first server goes

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.589 
let's say you know our first server goes
back<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.489> we<00:02:08.550> get<00:02:08.700> an<00:02:08.759> ace<00:02:08.940> right<00:02:09.209> off<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.450> bat

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
back and we get an ace right off the bat

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.170 
back and we get an ace right off the bat
you<00:02:10.080> can<00:02:10.110> see<00:02:10.259> down<00:02:10.619> here<00:02:10.679> in<00:02:11.129> this<00:02:11.700> area<00:02:12.030> we're

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
you can see down here in this area we're

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.460 
you can see down here in this area we're
actually<00:02:12.330> indicating

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
actually indicating

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.800 
actually indicating
the<00:02:14.130> last<00:02:14.430> couple<00:02:15.060> of<00:02:15.090> actions<00:02:15.600> that<00:02:15.660> have

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
the last couple of actions that have

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.840 
the last couple of actions that have
happened<00:02:15.960> so<00:02:16.320> number<00:02:16.650> 20<00:02:17.010> here<00:02:17.160> served<00:02:17.520> at<00:02:17.700> a

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
happened so number 20 here served at a

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.770 
happened so number 20 here served at a
so<00:02:17.910> even<00:02:18.690> though<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:18.900> had<00:02:19.110> 15<00:02:19.620> selected

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
so even though I had 15 selected

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.760 
so even though I had 15 selected
obviously<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.900> knows<00:02:22.110> that<00:02:22.140> our<00:02:22.380> current
