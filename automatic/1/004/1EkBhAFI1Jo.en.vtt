quick<00:00:12.620> I'm<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.710> commercial<00:00:14.070> pilot<00:00:14.700> and<00:00:14.880> a

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
quick I'm a commercial pilot and a

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.510 
quick I'm a commercial pilot and a
licensed<00:00:15.509> aircraft<00:00:15.900> mechanic<00:00:16.470> so<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.100> probably

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
licensed aircraft mechanic so I probably

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
phone models that I see and I'm putting

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.229 
phone models that I see and I'm putting
together<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.410> May<00:00:46.649> 29<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:48.090> there's

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
together this May 29 and there's

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.049 
together this May 29 and there's
something<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:48.750> bothers<00:00:49.410> me<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:50.250> has<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.610> do

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
something that bothers me it has to do

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.840 
something that bothers me it has to do
with<00:00:51.329> this<00:00:51.930> area<00:00:52.289> right<00:00:52.920> here<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
with this area right here it the

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.470 
with this area right here it the
stabilator<00:00:54.449> or<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.079> r<00:00:55.789> attaches<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.090> one

pivoting<00:00:58.140> point<00:00:58.440> you<00:00:58.559> can<00:00:58.739> see<00:00:58.980> right<00:00:59.219> here

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
pivoting point you can see right here

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.490 
pivoting point you can see right here
say<00:00:59.760> it's<00:00:59.940> just<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.840> be<00:01:00.960> glued<00:01:01.289> on

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
say it's just it's going to be glued on

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.520 
say it's just it's going to be glued on
to<00:01:01.620> that<00:01:01.770> plastic<00:01:02.399> pivot<00:01:02.760> point<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.409> then<00:01:04.409> of

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
to that plastic pivot point and then of

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.230 
to that plastic pivot point and then of
course<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:04.890> going<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.159> be<00:01:05.280> attached<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
course it's going to be attached to the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.109 
course it's going to be attached to the
servo<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:07.100> under<00:01:08.100> extreme<00:01:08.520> flight<00:01:08.820> loads

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
servo and under extreme flight loads

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.300 
servo and under extreme flight loads
there's<00:01:09.450> going<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.780> be<00:01:09.840> quite<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.260> bit<00:01:10.590> of<00:01:10.890> load

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
there's going to be quite a bit of load

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.850 
there's going to be quite a bit of load
right<00:01:11.850> here<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.350> know<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.500> foam

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
right here this is just you know a foam

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.980 
right here this is just you know a foam
piece<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.610> overlapped<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.390> glued<00:01:15.659> so

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
piece and it's overlapped and glued so

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.609 
piece and it's overlapped and glued so
I'm<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.650> little<00:01:17.040> concerned<00:01:17.250> if<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:19.229> stock

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
I'm a little concerned if this the stock

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.090 
I'm a little concerned if this the stock
area<00:01:20.040> right<00:01:20.490> in<00:01:20.520> here<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.090> too<00:01:21.689> weak<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.380> let

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
area right in here is too weak and let

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.780 
area right in here is too weak and let
me<00:01:23.280> show<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.610> how<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.140> strengthened<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.580> if<00:01:26.580> you

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
me show you how I strengthened it if you

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.660 
me show you how I strengthened it if you
look<00:01:27.060> closely<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.930> can<00:01:27.960> see<00:01:28.170> these<00:01:28.680> two<00:01:29.100> black

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
look closely you can see these two black

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.899 
look closely you can see these two black
strips<00:01:30.600> right<00:01:30.869> here<00:01:31.939> these<00:01:32.939> are<00:01:33.450> carbon<00:01:34.380> fiber

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:34.909 
strips right here these are carbon fiber

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.319 
strips right here these are carbon fiber
pieces<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.390> flat<00:01:36.930> stock<00:01:37.590> like<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.670> see<00:01:38.909> here

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
pieces of flat stock like you see here

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.950 
pieces of flat stock like you see here
you<00:01:40.290> know<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.439> don't<00:01:40.619> need<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> huge<00:01:41.939> amount<00:01:42.210> of

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
you know I don't need a huge amount of

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.560 
you know I don't need a huge amount of
strength<00:01:43.860> here<00:01:44.310> I<00:01:44.490> don't<00:01:44.610> need<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.180> lot<00:01:45.420> of

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
strength here I don't need a lot of

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.560 
strength here I don't need a lot of
weight<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.890> needed<00:01:47.340> something<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.060> would

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
weight but I needed something that would

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.080 
weight but I needed something that would
prevent<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.380> from<00:01:49.649> breaking<00:01:50.189> off<00:01:50.399> under

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
prevent this from breaking off under

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.080 
prevent this from breaking off under
extreme<00:01:51.659> flight<00:01:52.079> loads<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:52.740> all<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.549> did<00:01:53.729> was<00:01:53.909> I

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
extreme flight loads and all I did was I

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.420 
extreme flight loads and all I did was I
took<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.780> used<00:01:55.229> a<00:01:55.350> straight<00:01:55.590> edge<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:56.040> cut

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
took and used a straight edge and I cut

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.600 
took and used a straight edge and I cut
into<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.790> foam<00:01:57.030> using<00:01:57.899> first<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.710> exacto<00:01:59.430> knife

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
into the foam using first a exacto knife

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.060 
into the foam using first a exacto knife
and<00:01:59.790> then<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.000> used<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.420> little<00:02:00.619> wider<00:02:01.619> little

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
and then I used a little wider little

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.510 
and then I used a little wider little
saw<00:02:02.490> blade<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.090> cut<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.719> foam<00:02:03.960> just<00:02:04.500> enough<00:02:04.799> to

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
saw blade to cut the foam just enough to

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.229 
saw blade to cut the foam just enough to
put<00:02:05.820> that<00:02:06.299> strap<00:02:06.990> piece<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.680> there<00:02:08.099> all<00:02:08.879> the

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
put that strap piece in there all the

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.790 
put that strap piece in there all the
way<00:02:09.360> from<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:09.840> point<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.349> point<00:02:10.440> and

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
way from this point to this point and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.619 
way from this point to this point and
then<00:02:10.950> another<00:02:11.190> shorter<00:02:11.670> piece<00:02:11.849> on<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.300> end

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
then another shorter piece on this end

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.410 
then another shorter piece on this end
and<00:02:12.900> I<00:02:13.680> made<00:02:13.950> sure<00:02:14.250> it<00:02:14.280> fit<00:02:14.730> down<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.209> there

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
now you can see I have a very strength

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.500 
now you can see I have a very strength
joint<00:02:53.560> I<00:02:53.739> would<00:02:54.069> really<00:02:54.489> have<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.819> reef<00:02:55.269> on

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
joint I would really have to reef on

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.390 
joint I would really have to reef on
this<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.900> break<00:02:56.110> this<00:02:56.380> before<00:02:56.860> I<00:02:56.890> added<00:02:57.310> this

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
this to break this before I added this

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.610 
this to break this before I added this
carbon<00:02:57.819> fiber<00:02:58.090> I<00:02:58.390> could<00:02:58.900> just<00:02:59.079> take<00:02:59.260> this<00:02:59.440> with

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
carbon fiber I could just take this with

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.020 
carbon fiber I could just take this with
a<00:02:59.680> little<00:02:59.799> pressure<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:00.370> it<00:03:00.459> would<00:03:00.610> snap

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
a little pressure and it would snap

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.720 
a little pressure and it would snap
right<00:03:01.420> through<00:03:01.720> here<00:03:02.019> so<00:03:02.920> I'm<00:03:03.040> very<00:03:03.069> happy

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
right through here so I'm very happy

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.339 
right through here so I'm very happy
with<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.090> strengthening<00:03:04.629> of<00:03:04.900> this<00:03:05.110> off

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
with the strengthening of this off

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:09.780 
with the strengthening of this off
section<00:03:06.959> for<00:03:07.959> the<00:03:08.200> tail<00:03:08.440> plane<00:03:08.799> now<00:03:09.220> I'm<00:03:09.430> going

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
section for the tail plane now I'm going

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.780 
section for the tail plane now I'm going
to<00:03:09.910> go<00:03:10.030> after<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.540> wings
