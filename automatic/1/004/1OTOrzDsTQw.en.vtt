part<00:00:10.440> we<00:00:10.800> are<00:00:11.099> going<00:00:11.280> to<00:00:11.340> be<00:00:11.429> using<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.759> mac

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
part we are going to be using the mac

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.450 
part we are going to be using the mac
terminal<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.599> create<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.019> database<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.920> some

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
terminal to create a database and some

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.150 
terminal to create a database and some
tables<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.509> then<00:00:16.199> also<00:00:16.410> we're<00:00:16.949> going<00:00:17.100> to

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
tables and then also we're going to

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.060 
tables and then also we're going to
create<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.490> new<00:00:17.640> project<00:00:18.470> with<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.500> necessary

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
create a new project with the necessary

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.820 
create a new project with the necessary
components<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.510> then<00:00:21.720> next<00:00:22.050> tutorial<00:00:22.590> we<00:00:22.650> can

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
components so then next tutorial we can

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.099 
components so then next tutorial we can
start<00:00:23.189> querying<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.939> database<00:00:24.180> through<00:00:24.750> art

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
start querying the database through art

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.720 
start querying the database through art
objective-c<00:00:26.039> code<00:00:27.769> okay<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.130> start<00:00:29.429> we

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
objective-c code okay so to start we

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.420 
objective-c code okay so to start we
need<00:00:29.939> our<00:00:30.269> terminal<00:00:30.779> go<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.260> open<00:00:31.679> that<00:00:31.890> up<00:00:32.189> I

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
need our terminal go and open that up I

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.700 
need our terminal go and open that up I
like<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.600> pros<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> little<00:00:34.860> better<00:00:35.010> anyway

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
like the pros and a little better anyway

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.990 
like the pros and a little better anyway
so<00:00:39.440> start<00:00:40.440> off<00:00:40.590> on<00:00:40.829> once<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:41.340> here<00:00:41.610> windows

and<00:00:45.989> then<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:49.440> tutorial<00:00:50.309> or<00:00:50.550> sorry<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
and then the the tutorial or sorry the

database name my name et total DB always

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.930 
database name my name et total DB always
remember<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.079> add<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> semicolon<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.520> each

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
remember to add a semicolon and each

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.299 
remember to add a semicolon and each
sequel<00:01:00.449> command<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.079> put<00:01:01.350> it<00:01:01.440> within<00:01:01.590> here<00:01:02.129> or

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
sequel command you put it within here or

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.609 
sequel command you put it within here or
else<00:01:03.030> they<00:01:03.239> will<00:01:03.300> not<00:01:03.539> be<00:01:03.750> executed<00:01:04.019> properly

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
else they will not be executed properly

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.380 
else they will not be executed properly
so<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.640> start<00:01:06.030> off<00:01:07.220> you<00:01:08.220> can<00:01:08.400> use<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.729> dot<00:01:08.939> dump

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
so to start off you can use the dot dump

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.120 
so to start off you can use the dot dump
function<00:01:10.020> which<00:01:10.170> is<00:01:10.290> not<00:01:10.470> a<00:01:10.500> sequel<00:01:10.920> light

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
function which is not a sequel light

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.800 
function which is not a sequel light
statement<00:01:11.760> so<00:01:12.240> we<00:01:12.360> don't<00:01:12.479> have<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.659> worry

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
statement so we don't have to worry

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.179 
statement so we don't have to worry
about<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.080> semicolon<00:01:13.619> but<00:01:13.740> if<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.890> just<00:01:14.070> do

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
about the semicolon but if you just do

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.429 
about the semicolon but if you just do
dot<00:01:14.460> dump<00:01:14.790> enter<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:15.990> see<00:01:16.229> what's

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
dot dump enter and you can see what's

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.380 
dot dump enter and you can see what's
within<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.950> state<00:01:17.159> base<00:01:17.369> already<00:01:17.549> which<00:01:18.180> is

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
within the state base already which is

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.660 
within the state base already which is
nothing<00:01:18.650> you<00:01:19.650> see<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.890> begin<00:01:20.189> transaction

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
nothing you see the begin transaction

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.270 
nothing you see the begin transaction
semicolon<00:01:21.570> commit<00:01:21.930> semicolon<00:01:22.680> der<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:22.979> mean

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
semicolon commit semicolon der I mean

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.940 
semicolon commit semicolon der I mean
basically<00:01:23.580> means<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.390> empty<00:01:25.640> so<00:01:26.640> we<00:01:27.210> need<00:01:27.479> to

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
basically means is empty so we need to

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.010 
basically means is empty so we need to
create<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.340> new<00:01:29.490> table<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.450> do<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.780> by

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
create a new table and we do that by

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.990 
create a new table and we do that by
typing<00:01:31.380> in<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:32.280> would<00:01:32.460> be<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> sequel

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
typing in this would be a sequel

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.929 
typing in this would be a sequel
statement<00:01:33.180> by<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.479> way<00:01:33.689> create<00:01:35.659> table<00:01:36.659> names

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
statement by the way create table names

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.940 
statement by the way create table names
and<00:01:38.939> then<00:01:39.150> within<00:01:39.450> parentheses<00:01:40.229> we<00:01:40.439> have<00:01:40.710> our

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
and then within parentheses we have our

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.039 
and then within parentheses we have our
columns<00:01:41.880> and<00:01:42.439> first<00:01:43.439> off<00:01:43.680> for<00:01:44.220> each<00:01:44.899> column<00:01:45.899> we

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
columns and first off for each column we

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.139 
columns and first off for each column we
need<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.320> have<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.500> column<00:01:46.920> name<00:01:47.130> which<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:47.939> in

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
need to have a column name which is in

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.700 
need to have a column name which is in
this<00:01:48.360> case<00:01:48.630> where<00:01:48.840> I'm<00:01:49.049> going<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.259> have<00:01:49.350> an<00:01:49.470> ID

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
this case where I'm going to have an ID

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.230 
this case where I'm going to have an ID
and<00:01:50.189> then<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.899> after<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:52.829> we<00:01:52.950> need<00:01:53.159> its<00:01:53.430> data

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
and then the after that we need its data

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.630 
and then the after that we need its data
type<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:55.259> it's<00:01:55.560> going<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.740> be<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:56.070> type<00:01:56.340> integer

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
type so it's going to be of type integer

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.220 
type so it's going to be of type integer
head<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.270> then

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
head and then

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.880 
head and then
we<00:01:58.650> type<00:01:58.920> values<00:01:59.810> and<00:02:00.810> then<00:02:00.960> we<00:02:01.140> add<00:02:01.260> the<00:02:01.470> value

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
we type values and then we add the value

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.060 
we type values and then we add the value
and<00:02:02.100> let's<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:02.670> call<00:02:02.910> it<00:02:02.940> John<00:02:03.800> this<00:02:04.800> is

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
and let's just call it John this is

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.030 
and let's just call it John this is
named<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:05.970> rather<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.810> semicolon<00:02:07.410> press

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
named and rather the semicolon press

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.250 
named and rather the semicolon press
enter<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:09.060> then<00:02:09.119> let's<00:02:09.540> let's<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:10.050> make<00:02:10.200> a

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
enter and then let's let's just make a

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:15.020 
enter and then let's let's just make a
little<00:02:10.640> insert<00:02:11.640> means<00:02:12.060> it's<00:02:13.050> getting<00:02:14.030> value

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
little insert means it's getting value

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.300 
little insert means it's getting value
and<00:02:17.180> here<00:02:18.180> i'm<00:02:19.140> just<00:02:19.350> making<00:02:19.710> names<00:02:20.010> here

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
and here i'm just making names here

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:26.840 
and here i'm just making names here
cincon<00:02:21.320> enter<00:02:22.320> then<00:02:23.220> if<00:02:23.370> we<00:02:23.490> do<00:02:23.640> dot<00:02:25.040> dot<00:02:26.040> Delta

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
cincon enter then if we do dot dot Delta

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.050

bend we can see what all the commands
we've<00:02:30.300> executed<00:02:31.430> but<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.550> actually<00:02:32.670> see<00:02:32.940> our

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
table we can do select star or select

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.980 
table we can do select star or select
all<00:02:37.620> columns<00:02:37.920> from<00:02:38.630> names<00:02:39.860> semicolon<00:02:40.860> and

all columns from names semicolon and

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.710 
all columns from names semicolon and
we'll<00:02:42.990> get<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.560> list<00:02:43.860> as<00:02:44.670> you<00:02:44.940> can<00:02:45.060> see<00:02:45.240> the<00:02:45.390> ids

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
we'll get a list as you can see the ids

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.650 
we'll get a list as you can see the ids
are<00:02:45.750> Auto<00:02:46.440> incremented<00:02:47.250> so<00:02:47.550> we<00:02:47.700> at<00:02:47.940> first<00:02:48.330> for

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
are Auto incremented so we at first for

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.400 
are Auto incremented so we at first for
we<00:02:49.080> have<00:02:49.200> ID<00:02:49.740> one<00:02:50.190> for<00:02:50.640> John<00:02:50.940> ID<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.750> for<00:02:52.170> Peter

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
we have ID one for John ID to for Peter

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.220 
we have ID one for John ID to for Peter
and<00:02:52.650> then<00:02:53.370> so<00:02:53.880> we're<00:02:54.030> done<00:02:54.060> with<00:02:54.390> our<00:02:54.510> database

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
and then so we're done with our database

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.940 
and then so we're done with our database
we<00:02:55.410> can<00:02:55.530> use<00:02:55.650> type<00:02:56.010> into<00:02:56.310> exit<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.720> will

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
we can use type into exit and that will

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.890 
we can use type into exit and that will
close<00:02:58.950> up<00:02:59.160> our<00:02:59.370> sequel<00:03:00.120> statement<00:03:00.360> so<00:03:00.690> our

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
close up our sequel statement so our

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.660 
close up our sequel statement so our
database<00:03:01.350> is<00:03:01.500> created<00:03:01.680> it's<00:03:02.400> going<00:03:02.550> to<00:03:02.610> be

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
database is created it's going to be

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.890 
database is created it's going to be
stored<00:03:02.940> in<00:03:03.180> a<00:03:03.360> file<00:03:04.110> name<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.740> our<00:03:05.900> filename

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
stored in a file name of our filename

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.620 
stored in a file name of our filename
tutorial<00:03:07.770> DB<00:03:08.430> that's<00:03:08.730> just<00:03:08.910> why<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.090> add<00:03:09.450> the

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
tutorial DB that's just why you add the

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.350 
tutorial DB that's just why you add the
dot<00:03:09.840> DB<00:03:10.320> extension<00:03:11.310> to<00:03:11.520> otherwise<00:03:11.940> i'll<00:03:12.180> just

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
dot DB extension to otherwise i'll just

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.610 
dot DB extension to otherwise i'll just
be<00:03:12.510> just<00:03:13.170> basically<00:03:13.620> no<00:03:14.040> extension<00:03:15.380> file<00:03:16.380> i

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
be just basically no extension file i

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.890 
be just basically no extension file i
believe<00:03:17.660> so<00:03:18.660> go<00:03:19.440> ahead<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.590> go<00:03:19.800> into<00:03:20.010> Xcode

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
believe so go ahead and go into Xcode

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.960 
believe so go ahead and go into Xcode
whoops<00:03:21.900> okay<00:03:22.530> and<00:03:22.739> then<00:03:23.430> we're<00:03:23.670> going<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.850> do<00:03:23.940> a

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
whoops okay and then we're going to do a

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.510 
whoops okay and then we're going to do a
file<00:03:24.360> new<00:03:24.810> projects<00:03:25.500> just<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:26.070> few<00:03:26.250> based

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
file new projects just a few based

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.650 
file new projects just a few based
application<00:03:27.330> choose<00:03:28.190> let's<00:03:29.190> call<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.660> super

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
application choose let's call it super

white<00:03:32.120> safety<00:03:33.120> document<00:03:33.630> save<00:03:33.989> and<00:03:34.770> here<00:03:35.370> it

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
white safety document save and here it

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.360 
white safety document save and here it
is<00:03:36.590> so<00:03:37.590> what<00:03:37.800> we<00:03:37.920> need<00:03:38.130> to<00:03:38.190> do<00:03:38.600> is<00:03:39.600> actually

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
is so what we need to do is actually

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.740 
is so what we need to do is actually
import<00:03:41.370> our<00:03:41.840> sequel<00:03:42.840> light<00:03:43.020> database<00:03:44.750> file

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
import our sequel light database file

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.900 
import our sequel light database file
because<00:03:46.440> when<00:03:46.739> what<00:03:47.310> we<00:03:47.430> are<00:03:47.520> doing<00:03:47.640> the

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
because when what we are doing the

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.699 
because when what we are doing the
terminal<00:03:48.300> is<00:03:48.420> essentially<00:03:48.810> just<00:03:49.020> creating<00:03:49.530> a

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
terminal is essentially just creating a

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.460 
terminal is essentially just creating a
sequel<00:03:50.520> light<00:03:50.700> file<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.840> that's<00:03:52.200> what<00:03:52.350> we

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
sequel light file and that's what we

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.350 
sequel light file and that's what we
need<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.770> import<00:03:53.100> into<00:03:53.250> a<00:03:53.400> project<00:03:53.670> before<00:03:54.090> we

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
need to import into a project before we

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.020 
need to import into a project before we
can<00:03:54.540> actually<00:03:55.140> work<00:03:55.500> with<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.739> database<00:03:56.160> then

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
can actually work with the database then

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.650 
can actually work with the database then
also

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
also

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.770 
also
do<00:03:58.260> in<00:03:58.380> particular<00:03:58.530> but<00:03:59.040> i'll<00:03:59.790> show<00:04:00.480> you<00:04:00.540> that

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
do in particular but i'll show you that

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.840 
do in particular but i'll show you that
later<00:04:00.840> so<00:04:01.320> if<00:04:01.380> you're<00:04:01.530> going<00:04:01.650> to<00:04:01.790> find<00:04:02.790> your<00:04:03.180> um

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
later so if you're going to find your um

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.990 
later so if you're going to find your um
i'm<00:04:05.850> gonna<00:04:06.030> search<00:04:06.330> for<00:04:06.360> a<00:04:06.660> bit<00:04:07.220> tutorial<00:04:08.220> it

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.170 

comes<00:04:12.000> up<00:04:12.240> there<00:04:12.750> it<00:04:12.900> is<00:04:13.220> so<00:04:14.220> you<00:04:14.310> just<00:04:14.730> go

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
comes up there it is so you just go

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.009 
comes up there it is so you just go
ahead<00:04:15.270> and<00:04:15.480> slept<00:04:16.170> it<00:04:16.410> ad<00:04:17.330> and<00:04:18.330> i'm<00:04:18.720> not<00:04:18.870> going

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
ahead and slept it ad and i'm not going

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.710 
ahead and slept it ad and i'm not going
to<00:04:19.080> copy<00:04:19.380> anything<00:04:19.830> this<00:04:20.040> ad<00:04:20.310> so<00:04:21.120> there's<00:04:21.570> a

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
to copy anything this ad so there's a

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.880 
to copy anything this ad so there's a
tutorial<00:04:21.980> DB<00:04:22.980> file<00:04:23.280> now<00:04:24.240> for<00:04:24.930> frameworks<00:04:25.590> we

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
tutorial DB file now for frameworks we

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.940 
tutorial DB file now for frameworks we
need<00:04:26.040> to<00:04:26.160> add<00:04:27.170> framework<00:04:28.170> and<00:04:28.380> it's<00:04:28.710> going<00:04:28.890> to

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
need to add framework and it's going to

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.640 
need to add framework and it's going to
be<00:04:29.160> it's<00:04:29.580> not<00:04:29.970> an<00:04:30.270> objective<00:04:30.420> c<00:04:31.020> friend<00:04:31.350> it's

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
be it's not an objective c friend it's

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.440 
be it's not an objective c friend it's
actually<00:04:31.800> a<00:04:32.070> sea-based<00:04:33.590> set<00:04:34.590> of<00:04:34.880> functions<00:04:35.880> so

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
actually a sea-based set of functions so

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.550 
actually a sea-based set of functions so
we<00:04:36.750> need<00:04:36.900> to<00:04:36.960> find<00:04:37.230> the<00:04:37.530> lid<00:04:38.060> sequel<00:04:39.060> light

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
we need to find the lid sequel light

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:43.940 
we need to find the lid sequel light
whether<00:04:40.560> it<00:04:40.890> is<00:04:41.070> able<00:04:41.730> to<00:04:42.150> flip<00:04:42.600> secret<00:04:43.110> yeah

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
whether it is able to flip secret yeah

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.860 
whether it is able to flip secret yeah
there<00:04:44.160> it<00:04:44.250> is<00:04:44.310> lips<00:04:44.850> equal<00:04:45.210> like<00:04:45.330> three<00:04:45.630> dot

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
there it is lips equal like three dot

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.290 
there it is lips equal like three dot
you<00:04:46.050> I<00:04:46.080> remember<00:04:46.710> you<00:04:46.950> so<00:04:47.610> we<00:04:47.760> just<00:04:47.940> added<00:04:48.090> the

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
you I remember you so we just added the

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.000 
you I remember you so we just added the
frameworks<00:04:48.810> or<00:04:49.140> the<00:04:50.010> framework<00:04:50.520> and<00:04:50.850> our

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
frameworks or the framework and our

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.920 
frameworks or the framework and our
database<00:04:53.210> file<00:04:56.450> so<00:04:57.450> that<00:04:57.480> we<00:04:57.690> can<00:04:57.840> actually

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
database file so that we can actually

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.040 
database file so that we can actually
