over there okay hello so what I have

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.880 
over there okay hello so what I have
here<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> metronome<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.960> speeds<00:00:52.469> up<00:00:52.649> by

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
here is a metronome that speeds up by

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.540 
here is a metronome that speeds up by
five<00:00:53.160> beats<00:00:53.489> per<00:00:53.789> minute<00:00:54.110> every<00:00:55.309> every<00:00:56.309> five

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
five beats per minute every every five

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.330 
five beats per minute every every five
or<00:00:56.730> so<00:00:56.879> minutes<00:00:57.059> every<00:00:57.420> couple<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.750> minutes

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
or so minutes every couple of minutes

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.529 
or so minutes every couple of minutes
first<00:00:59.340> it's<00:00:59.520> like<00:00:59.579> three<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.120> then<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.329> ends

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
first it's like three and then it ends

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.170 
first it's like three and then it ends
up<00:01:00.629> being<00:01:00.809> five<00:01:01.050> later<00:01:01.350> but<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.399> speeds

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
up being five later but it just speeds

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.359 
up being five later but it just speeds
up<00:01:03.449> on<00:01:04.290> its<00:01:04.439> own<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:05.360> just<00:01:06.360> let<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.810> play<00:01:07.250> and<00:01:08.250> I

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
up on its own I just let it play and I

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.969 
up on its own I just let it play and I
pick<00:01:08.610> a<00:01:08.850> lick<00:01:09.270> or<00:01:09.600> a<00:01:09.810> technique<00:01:10.350> or<00:01:10.560> something

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
pick a lick or a technique or something

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.039 
pick a lick or a technique or something
that<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.159> want<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.520> work<00:01:11.670> on<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.630> feel<00:01:12.869> like

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
that I want to work on and I feel like

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.760 
that I want to work on and I feel like
you<00:01:14.010> know<00:01:14.130> sloppy<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.360> or<00:01:15.689> just<00:01:15.960> really

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
you know sloppy and or just really

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.980 
you know sloppy and or just really
anything<00:01:17.009> that<00:01:17.220> I'm<00:01:17.640> compelled<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.570> work<00:01:18.750> on

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
anything that I'm compelled to work on

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.380 
anything that I'm compelled to work on
let's<00:01:19.650> do<00:01:19.860> just<00:01:20.070> alternate<00:01:20.850> picking<00:01:21.060> for

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
let's do just alternate picking for

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.260 
let's do just alternate picking for
example<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.950> start<00:01:23.310> out<00:01:23.430> by<00:01:23.729> playing

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
example and I start out by playing

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.020 
example and I start out by playing
quarter<00:01:24.960> notes<00:01:24.990> with<00:01:25.470> this<00:01:25.680> metronome<00:01:29.030> right

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
quarter notes with this metronome right

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.149 
quarter notes with this metronome right
now<00:01:30.180> I'm<00:01:30.270> just<00:01:30.360> gonna<00:01:30.540> play<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.170> G<00:01:31.470> major<00:01:31.680> scale

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
now I'm just gonna play a G major scale

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:40.999 
now I'm just gonna play a G major scale
alternate<00:01:33.119> picking<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:36.439> I<00:01:37.439> just<00:01:38.119> do<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:40.009> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
alternate picking and I just do this the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:44.090 
alternate picking and I just do this the
track<00:01:41.310> speeds<00:01:41.670> up<00:01:41.909> for<00:01:42.180> me<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:43.680> start<00:01:44.009> out

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
track speeds up for me and I start out

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.660 
track speeds up for me and I start out
so<00:01:44.369> slow<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:45.829> even<00:01:46.829> after<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> whole<00:01:47.460> day<00:01:47.640> of

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
so slow that even after a whole day of

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.270 
so slow that even after a whole day of
driving<00:01:48.090> or<00:01:48.540> traveling<00:01:49.350> I'm<00:01:50.040> not

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
driving or traveling I'm not

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.580 
driving or traveling I'm not
overexerting<00:01:51.090> myself<00:01:51.240> not<00:01:51.990> getting<00:01:52.290> tired

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
overexerting myself not getting tired

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.249 
overexerting myself not getting tired
I'm<00:01:52.979> not<00:01:54.649> enjoying<00:01:55.649> myself<00:01:55.799> after<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.969> know

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
I'm not enjoying myself after you know

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.570 
I'm not enjoying myself after you know
not<00:01:58.259> playing<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> long<00:01:58.979> time

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
not playing for a long time

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.160 
not playing for a long time
jumping<00:01:59.880> right<00:01:59.970> into<00:02:00.150> it<00:02:00.330> I<00:02:00.390> started<00:02:00.840> slowing

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
jumping right into it I started slowing

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.260 
jumping right into it I started slowing
because<00:02:01.500> we<00:02:01.650> could<00:02:01.860> warm<00:02:02.130> up<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.550> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
because we could warm up and the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.630 
because we could warm up and the
metronome<00:02:03.720> increases<00:02:04.560> on<00:02:04.740> its<00:02:05.040> feet<00:02:05.280> on<00:02:05.460> its

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
metronome increases on its feet on its

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.530 
metronome increases on its feet on its
own<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.150> as<00:02:06.690> you<00:02:06.870> can<00:02:06.990> see<00:02:07.170> at<00:02:07.890> eight<00:02:08.220> minutes

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.540 
own and as you can see at eight minutes

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:11.840 
own and as you can see at eight minutes
this<00:02:09.540> is<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.869> temple<00:02:10.200> ride<00:02:10.440> go<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.340> few<00:02:11.550> minutes

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
this is the temple ride go a few minutes

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.600 
this is the temple ride go a few minutes
later<00:02:12.380> or<00:02:13.380> here<00:02:14.120> or<00:02:15.120> here<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.950> keep<00:02:17.190> speeding

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
later or here or here and keep speeding

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.330 
later or here or here and keep speeding
on<00:02:17.760> it<00:02:17.910> eventually<00:02:18.780> when<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.260> gets<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.620> 120

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
on it eventually when it gets to 120

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.370 
on it eventually when it gets to 120
beats<00:02:20.490> per<00:02:20.700> minute<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.240> cuts<00:02:21.480> back<00:02:21.780> to<00:02:21.990> 60

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
beats per minute it cuts back to 60

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.380 
beats per minute it cuts back to 60
again<00:02:22.680> but<00:02:22.860> you<00:02:22.980> can<00:02:23.130> keep<00:02:23.310> speeding<00:02:23.820> up<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.240> at

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
again but you can keep speeding up so at

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.410 
again but you can keep speeding up so at
60<00:02:24.840> you'd<00:02:25.440> be<00:02:25.590> playing<00:02:25.800> sixteenths<00:02:26.640> whereas

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
60 you'd be playing sixteenths whereas

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.990 
60 you'd be playing sixteenths whereas
at<00:02:27.600> 120<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.260> would<00:02:28.380> be<00:02:28.500> playing<00:02:28.740> eighths<00:02:29.040> so

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
at 120 you would be playing eighths so

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.490 
at 120 you would be playing eighths so
you<00:02:30.090> just<00:02:30.330> keep<00:02:30.510> going<00:02:30.900> faster<00:02:31.320> and<00:02:31.380> faster

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
you just keep going faster and faster

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.950 
you just keep going faster and faster
and<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.490> work<00:02:32.670> on<00:02:32.850> this<00:02:33.090> one<00:02:33.330> technique<00:02:33.780> you

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
and you work on this one technique you

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.690 
and you work on this one technique you
focus<00:02:34.410> on<00:02:34.560> just<00:02:34.620> one<00:02:34.950> technique<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.610> you

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
focus on just one technique and you

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.699 
focus on just one technique and you
practice<00:02:36.060> it<00:02:36.240> really<00:02:36.450> well<00:02:36.810> because<00:02:36.990> when<00:02:37.620> you

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
practice it really well because when you

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.140 
practice it really well because when you
have<00:02:37.860> these<00:02:37.980> long<00:02:38.250> days<00:02:38.550> and<00:02:38.820> you<00:02:38.910> need<00:02:39.030> to

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
have these long days and you need to

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.610 
have these long days and you need to
hide<00:02:39.390> away<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:39.810> bathroom<00:02:39.990> late<00:02:40.380> at<00:02:40.500> night

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
hide away in the bathroom late at night

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.800 
hide away in the bathroom late at night
while<00:02:40.800> everyone's<00:02:41.130> asleep<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.790> practice<00:02:42.270> it's

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
while everyone's asleep to practice it's

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.840 
while everyone's asleep to practice it's
better<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.290> just<00:02:43.500> focus<00:02:43.920> on<00:02:44.070> one<00:02:44.310> thing<00:02:44.340> and

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
better to just focus on one thing and

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.000 
better to just focus on one thing and
you<00:02:45.300> know<00:02:45.390> do<00:02:45.570> a<00:02:45.600> good<00:02:45.870> job<00:02:45.930> working<00:02:46.709> on<00:02:46.830> it

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
you know do a good job working on it

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.930 
you know do a good job working on it
rather<00:02:47.400> than<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:49.260> know<00:02:49.290> try<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.830> cram<00:02:50.700> in<00:02:50.910> a

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
rather than you know try to cram in a

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.630 
rather than you know try to cram in a
bunch<00:02:51.270> of<00:02:51.420> practice<00:02:52.110> stuff<00:02:52.380> in<00:02:52.620> at<00:02:53.070> once<00:02:53.340> while

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
bunch of practice stuff in at once while

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.850 
bunch of practice stuff in at once while
you're<00:02:53.870> traveling<00:02:54.870> it's<00:02:55.110> just<00:02:55.440> not<00:02:55.620> an<00:02:55.770> ideal

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
you're traveling it's just not an ideal

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.040 
you're traveling it's just not an ideal
time<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.940> do<00:02:57.209> that<00:02:57.330> anyone<00:02:57.600> want<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.810> spread

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
time to do that anyone want to spread

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.930 
time to do that anyone want to spread
yourself<00:02:58.440> thin<00:02:58.500> this<00:02:58.980> way<00:02:59.160> you<00:02:59.220> get<00:02:59.550> something

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
yourself thin this way you get something

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.240 
yourself thin this way you get something
you<00:03:00.540> get<00:03:00.720> your<00:03:00.900> technique<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.860> know<00:03:01.980> stay

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
you get your technique to you know stay

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.170 
you get your technique to you know stay
sturdy<00:03:02.640> even<00:03:03.060> during<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.450> long<00:03:03.630> travel<00:03:04.110> so

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
sturdy even during the long travel so

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.430 
sturdy even during the long travel so
let's<00:03:06.180> keep<00:03:06.330> speeding<00:03:06.750> up<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:06.989> speeding<00:03:07.140> up

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
let's keep speeding up and speeding up

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.590 
let's keep speeding up and speeding up
and<00:03:07.620> speeding<00:03:07.739> up<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.330> you<00:03:09.330> don't<00:03:09.510> really

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600 
and speeding up and you don't really

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.030 
and speeding up and you don't really
have<00:03:09.720> to<00:03:09.870> think<00:03:10.019> about<00:03:10.200> much<00:03:10.530> just<00:03:10.830> keep

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
have to think about much just keep

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:19.190 
have to think about much just keep
playing<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:17.360> and<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.450> know<00:03:18.480> by<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.840> end<00:03:19.080> you

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
playing so and you know by the end you

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.759 
playing so and you know by the end you
like<00:03:20.269> it<00:03:21.269> gets<00:03:21.480> really<00:03:21.780> fast<00:03:22.050> it<00:03:22.320> just<00:03:22.500> kind<00:03:22.709> of

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
like it gets really fast it just kind of

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.680 
like it gets really fast it just kind of
keeps<00:03:22.950> going<00:03:23.459> for<00:03:23.640> like<00:03:23.730> two<00:03:23.790> hours<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.420> so

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
keeps going for like two hours and so

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.180 
keeps going for like two hours and so
ever<00:03:25.019> long<00:03:25.260> you're<00:03:25.440> interested<00:03:26.100> in

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
ever long you're interested in

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:27.979 
ever long you're interested in
practicing<00:03:26.400> you<00:03:26.910> can<00:03:26.970> practice<00:03:27.450> this<00:03:27.570> way<00:03:27.810> and

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
practicing you can practice this way and

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:30.020 
practicing you can practice this way and
it's<00:03:28.110> safe<00:03:28.350> you<00:03:28.800> don't<00:03:28.830> get<00:03:29.070> injured<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.730> you

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
it's safe you don't get injured and you

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.360 
it's safe you don't get injured and you
