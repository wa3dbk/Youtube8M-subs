00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.319 
thought that almost quite funny I saw
that<00:03:19.769> one<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:19.980> while<00:03:20.190> ago<00:03:20.220> was<00:03:20.940> going<00:03:21.120> to<00:03:21.180> make<00:03:21.299> a

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
that one a while ago was going to make a

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.360 
that one a while ago was going to make a
video<00:03:21.690> on<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:21.959> but<00:03:22.109> for<00:03:22.350> a<00:03:22.560> video<00:03:22.950> on<00:03:23.100> its<00:03:23.220> own

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
video on it but for a video on its own

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.340 
video on it but for a video on its own
wouldn't<00:03:23.670> be<00:03:23.790> very<00:03:24.060> good<00:03:24.209> so<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:24.870> thought<00:03:25.200> I'd

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
wouldn't be very good so I thought I'd

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.199 
wouldn't be very good so I thought I'd
match<00:03:25.709> it<00:03:25.829> up<00:03:25.890> together<00:03:26.100> today<00:03:26.549> that<00:03:26.880> was<00:03:27.030> good

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
match it up together today that was good

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.140 
match it up together today that was good
like<00:03:27.630> my<00:03:28.200> idea<00:03:29.010> so<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.609> next<00:03:29.790> one<00:03:29.970> there's

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
like my idea so the next one there's

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.640 
like my idea so the next one there's
another<00:03:30.180> cool<00:03:30.540> one<00:03:30.690> this<00:03:30.930> is<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.350> hokum

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
another cool one this is the hokum

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.130 
another cool one this is the hokum
Palace<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:33.150> hooker<00:03:33.390> is<00:03:33.540> spelt<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.930> little

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
Palace and the hooker is spelt a little

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.199 
Palace and the hooker is spelt a little
bit<00:03:34.260> different<00:03:34.620> with<00:03:35.010> instead<00:03:35.489> of<00:03:35.640> an<00:03:35.730> ER<00:03:36.060> at

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
bit different with instead of an ER at

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.750 
bit different with instead of an ER at
the<00:03:36.299> end<00:03:36.450> isn't<00:03:36.660> a<00:03:36.930> H<00:03:37.170> so<00:03:37.410> it's<00:03:37.560> like<00:03:37.709> okay<00:03:38.160> but

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
the end isn't a H so it's like okay but

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.270 
the end isn't a H so it's like okay but
is<00:03:39.299> still<00:03:39.510> hooker<00:03:40.019> so<00:03:40.470> if<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.709> can<00:03:40.890> see<00:03:41.100> that

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
is still hooker so if you can see that

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.660 
is still hooker so if you can see that
it's<00:03:41.840> just<00:03:42.840> cool<00:03:43.350> I<00:03:43.620> think<00:03:43.680> they<00:03:43.980> are<00:03:44.069> like

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
it's just cool I think they are like

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.479 
it's just cool I think they are like
Rockstar<00:03:45.569> had<00:03:45.810> done<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.200> fine<00:03:46.799> job<00:03:46.859> putting

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
Rockstar had done a fine job putting

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.819 
Rockstar had done a fine job putting
these<00:03:47.670> in<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.000> game<00:03:48.180> because<00:03:48.870> if<00:03:49.200> you<00:03:49.620> don't

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
these in the game because if you don't

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.069 
these in the game because if you don't
look<00:03:50.760> at<00:03:50.940> em<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.209> won't<00:03:51.329> notice<00:03:51.569> enough<00:03:51.930> that

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
look at em you won't notice enough that

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.449 
look at em you won't notice enough that
make<00:03:52.230> sense<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:52.530> if<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:52.739> don't<00:03:52.920> try<00:03:53.130> looking

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
make sense so if you don't try looking

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.190 
make sense so if you don't try looking
for<00:03:53.670> them<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.359> just<00:03:54.510> take<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.720> glance<00:03:55.019> at

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
for them and you just take a glance at

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.900 
for them and you just take a glance at
it<00:03:55.260> you<00:03:55.440> won't<00:03:55.590> even<00:03:55.829> think<00:03:56.010> about<00:03:56.190> it<00:03:56.489> like

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
it you won't even think about it like

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.030 
it you won't even think about it like
some<00:03:57.209> of<00:03:57.329> these<00:03:57.510> like<00:03:58.049> I<00:03:58.200> was<00:03:58.560> just<00:03:58.769> flying

some of these like I was just flying

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.620 
some of these like I was just flying
around<00:03:59.190> trying<00:03:59.549> to<00:03:59.579> find<00:03:59.760> some<00:04:00.060> funny<00:04:00.420> ones

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
around trying to find some funny ones

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.720 
around trying to find some funny ones

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
and stuff some of them I didn't even get

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.430 
and stuff some of them I didn't even get
until<00:04:03.060> I<00:04:03.090> like<00:04:03.329> looked<00:04:03.660> at<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:03.900> like<00:04:04.019> this<00:04:04.200> one
