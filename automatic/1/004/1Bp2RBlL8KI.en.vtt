00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.360 
older pack now you can see the trading
card<00:02:26.640> game<00:02:26.940> logo<00:02:27.270> is<00:02:27.600> smaller<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.770> blastoise

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
card game logo is smaller the blastoise

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.270 
card game logo is smaller the blastoise
is<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.970> little<00:02:30.300> more<00:02:30.450> faded<00:02:30.920> like<00:02:31.920> a<00:02:31.950> lighter

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
is a little more faded like a lighter

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.270 
is a little more faded like a lighter
color<00:02:32.400> and<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:34.020> 11<00:02:34.350> additional<00:02:34.740> game<00:02:34.920> cards

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
color and the 11 additional game cards

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.700 
color and the 11 additional game cards
is<00:02:35.430> bolder<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.840> there's<00:02:37.020> a<00:02:37.080> chance<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.500> this

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
is bolder so there's a chance that this

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.390 
is bolder so there's a chance that this
could<00:02:37.770> be<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.190> shadowless<00:02:38.790> pack<00:02:39.860> because<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:41.280> is

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
could be a shadowless pack because it is

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.210 
could be a shadowless pack because it is
an<00:02:41.550> older<00:02:41.790> booster<00:02:42.120> pack<00:02:42.360> but<00:02:42.780> you<00:02:43.770> know<00:02:43.890> it's

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
an older booster pack but you know it's

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.810 
an older booster pack but you know it's
you<00:02:44.970> don't<00:02:45.180> know<00:02:45.330> unless<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.650> open<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.100> but

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
you don't know unless you open it but

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.370 
you don't know unless you open it but
it's<00:02:48.270> kind<00:02:48.450> of<00:02:48.480> interesting<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.930> see<00:02:49.200> how

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
it's kind of interesting to see how

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.080 
it's kind of interesting to see how
there's<00:02:49.680> two<00:02:49.890> different<00:02:50.130> you<00:02:50.610> know<00:02:50.730> types
