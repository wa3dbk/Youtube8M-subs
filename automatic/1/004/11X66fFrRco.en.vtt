Brandon pathetic yeah who do you think
you<00:02:00.780> are<00:02:00.989> I'm<00:02:01.289> Brandon<00:02:02.009> no<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:03.420> are<00:02:03.630> Brandon<00:02:04.229> so

you are I'm Brandon no we are Brandon so

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:06.080 
you are I'm Brandon no we are Brandon so
then<00:02:04.920> we<00:02:05.190> can<00:02:05.340> conclude<00:02:05.489> that<00:02:05.819> we're<00:02:05.970> both

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
then we can conclude that we're both

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.449 
then we can conclude that we're both
Brandon<00:02:06.569> if<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:07.050> equals<00:02:07.410> B<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:07.709> B<00:02:07.950> equals<00:02:07.979> C

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
Brandon if a equals B and B equals C

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.550 
Brandon if a equals B and B equals C
therefore<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> equals<00:02:09.599> C<00:02:09.630> it's<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.020> transitive

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
therefore a equals C it's the transitive

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.930 
therefore a equals C it's the transitive
property<00:02:11.390> shut-the-fuck-up<00:02:12.560> wisdom<00:02:13.880> so<00:02:14.880> you

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
property shut-the-fuck-up wisdom so you

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.000 
property shut-the-fuck-up wisdom so you
