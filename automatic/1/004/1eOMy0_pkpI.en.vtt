00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.640
 his name 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.420
 hello to all here we are in the proper sense and devoted to blaine 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.259
 in 3d 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:14.639
 free software for the realization of synthetic images and 3D animation 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:17.810
 through our victory we go through the basics and the 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.810
 knowledge you need to know in order to take full advantage of this software 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.589
 no first part we will discover the interface 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.499
 here is bendera interface its launch 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:29.630
 we first have the taskbar 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.720
 we will be able to 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.150
 create a new document 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.190
 we will not open 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.790
 save 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.020
 add objects so a plan follow 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.949
 but we'll see that in the next few months 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.730
 according to our needs 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.280
 we have here 3d space 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.520
 the cube 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.820
 the camera 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.750
 and more the 3d cursor 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.500
 the ssii for you to see there 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.130
 dotted 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.610
 we have the menu 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:00.810
 dedicated to this 3d space 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.730
 to finish 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.280
 the panel tab 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.370
 we will be able to 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.830
 modify the parameters 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.980
 own break objectives are selected so for example here for 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.980
 the cube so to change it in the shadow of the materials 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.090
 but let's go back 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.790
 another 3d space 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.940
 but offers them multiple duels 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.720
 in what happens 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.380
 let's see that now 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.700
 we are aiming for 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.650
 we also have the front view 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.200
 the side view 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.520
 the opinion of 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.270
 he saw camera 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.470
 more simply 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.910
 as you can see here 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.650
 keyboard shortcuts 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:44.760
 by the faces 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.140
 three side goals 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.140
 seen from above the heroes of a camera 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.390
 from the point of view from above 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.610
 we have two types of view 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.040
 blaine down 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.360
 so for my coming 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.060
 port in the east so we have to be closer to the plane as you see us 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.390
 we decided grid 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.210
 students and perspectives 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.820
 this will show in a year 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.289
 next then real time 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.600
 where we can see 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.019
 really the prospect 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.349
 now let's take a look at the objects on the stage 

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:18.890
 so we have 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.719
 the cube that is preselected as you can see 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.989
 thanks to the borders 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:25.499
 we have the lamp 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:27.339
 which certainly lighting 

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:28.559
 who will then make 

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:31.119
 visible no objects 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:34.159
 it will illuminate more or less c objects on the scene 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:35.850
 we have here 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.539
 the camera 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:40.539
 our eye it is she who will take pictures 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:43.449
 who will film their cancellations 

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:46.799
 and finally we lived spring 3d 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.989
 let's take an example if we add 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.249
 an object the center of gravity of this object will be placed 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.239
 the 3d cursor 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.239
 only those who spring 3d will also serve as andorra passion 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.829
 it could be the meaning of these rotations 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.829
 in depth on the defects of the displacements 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:07.179
 et cetera we'll see that later 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:10.089
 in the next I turn 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:12.809
 now that we have seen all these things we will see how 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:15.809
 arrange our space to defraud according to our needs 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.119
 right button intersection between two windows spyker is rare 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:23.419
 we choose where the splitter 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.419
 and we end up with twice 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:30.539
 my title here I would like to see have several lives 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:32.679
 for the same scene 

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:36.559
 here I would like to have a view from above it is very important to have the 

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:37.449
 cursor 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:38.869
 above this window 

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:40.469
 and press 7 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:42.149
 according to the study of continuation 

00:03:42.149 --> 00:03:45.699
 but that's not enough I would like to have a side view of this scene 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:49.309
 right button spieth hourly 

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:53.709
 I get up above this window I press three so I held well 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.119
 the kick 

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:56.539
 a view from above 

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:58.599
 a front view 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.499
 now I want to come back 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:01.669
 like his feet 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:02.839
 at the beginning 

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:03.899
 so it's simple 

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:05.349
 right button 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:06.989
 at the intersection of two windows 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.159
 young laureates 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.459
 I choose who will crush the other 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.119
 I want it to be those of the psu 

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:13.329
 from below by the oms 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.329
 who take over 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.099
 the second phase 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.699
 since the putsch
