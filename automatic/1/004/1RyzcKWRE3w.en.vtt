00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
that the Eagles saints game definitely

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.399 
that the Eagles saints game definitely
some<00:01:56.430> shootout<00:01:56.820> potential<00:01:57.450> there<00:01:57.659> definitely

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.740 
I think you stick with the community and
go<00:02:02.369> with<00:02:02.490> Macklin<00:02:02.909> on<00:02:03.030> this<00:02:03.240> when<00:02:03.420> I<00:02:03.450> think<00:02:03.689> he

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
I'm going with Jonathan Stewart I think

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.160

they're<00:04:02.060> finally<00:04:02.480> starting<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.870> get<00:04:03.019> him

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
they're finally starting to get him

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.930 
they're finally starting to get him
involved<00:04:03.410> in<00:04:03.590> the<00:04:03.650> passing<00:04:04.100> game<00:04:04.130> more<00:04:04.610> you

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
involved in the passing game more you

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.250 
involved in the passing game more you
know<00:04:05.000> they<00:04:05.060> did<00:04:05.209> that<00:04:05.239> a<00:04:05.360> lot<00:04:05.600> last<00:04:05.870> year<00:04:06.080> and

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
know they did that a lot last year and

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.810 
know they did that a lot last year and
that's<00:04:06.380> where<00:04:06.590> all<00:04:06.739> of<00:04:06.860> his<00:04:06.980> value<00:04:07.370> was<00:04:07.580> and

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
that's where all of his value was and

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.600 
that's where all of his value was and
they're<00:04:08.209> finally<00:04:08.480> joining<00:04:09.140> now<00:04:09.610> Washington

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610 
they're finally joining now Washington

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.370 
they're finally joining now Washington
they<00:04:10.760> can't<00:04:11.030> stop<00:04:11.300> anything<00:04:11.660> through<00:04:12.080> the<00:04:12.200> air

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
they can't stop anything through the air

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.380 
they can't stop anything through the air
so<00:04:12.650> I<00:04:12.680> think<00:04:12.800> Jonathan<00:04:13.430> Stewart<00:04:13.760> you'll

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
so I think Jonathan Stewart you'll

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.940 
so I think Jonathan Stewart you'll
probably<00:04:14.600> catch<00:04:14.780> ins<00:04:14.989> four<00:04:15.170> to<00:04:15.260> six<00:04:15.500> balls<00:04:15.739> I

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
probably catch ins four to six balls I

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.650 
probably catch ins four to six balls I
think<00:04:16.130> he<00:04:16.220> has<00:04:16.370> probably<00:04:16.790> over<00:04:17.030> 50<00:04:17.330> yards

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
think he has probably over 50 yards

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.960 
think he has probably over 50 yards
receiving<00:04:17.989> and<00:04:18.260> anything<00:04:19.070> he<00:04:19.160> does<00:04:19.370> on<00:04:19.549> top<00:04:19.789> of

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
receiving and anything he does on top of

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:20.660 
receiving and anything he does on top of
that<00:04:20.090> with<00:04:20.239> Russia

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
that with Russia

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:21.920 
that with Russia
just<00:04:20.880> going<00:04:21.030> to<00:04:21.090> be<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.180> bonus<00:04:21.360> and<00:04:21.690> you<00:04:21.750> might

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
just going to be a bonus and you might

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.960 
just going to be a bonus and you might
even<00:04:21.960> find<00:04:22.320> the<00:04:22.500> end<00:04:22.650> zone<00:04:22.740> I<00:04:23.070> like<00:04:23.520> Jonathan
