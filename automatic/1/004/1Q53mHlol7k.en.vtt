00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.890 

so<00:03:14.580> here<00:03:14.820> we<00:03:14.910> have<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.420> radius<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:15.870> earth

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
so here we have the radius of the earth

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.740 
so here we have the radius of the earth

- R projected through cosine theta
that's<00:03:42.600> this<00:03:42.810> distance<00:03:43.459> so<00:03:44.459> that<00:03:44.670> we<00:03:44.880> subtract

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
that's this distance so that we subtract

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.360 
that's this distance so that we subtract
off<00:03:45.540> that<00:03:45.750> distance<00:03:47.330> to<00:03:48.330> get<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.600> height<00:03:49.370> or

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
off that distance to get the height or

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.960 
off that distance to get the height or
the<00:03:50.400> drop<00:03:51.180> distance<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:51.780> then<00:03:51.870> X<00:03:52.140> is<00:03:52.550> found<00:03:53.550> by

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
the drop distance and then X is found by

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.470 
the drop distance and then X is found by
R<00:03:54.500> times<00:03:55.500> sine<00:03:55.830> theta<00:03:56.090> so<00:03:57.090> that's<00:03:57.270> this

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
R times sine theta so that's this

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.020 
R times sine theta so that's this
distance<00:03:57.540> now<00:04:01.340> we're<00:04:02.340> going<00:04:02.459> to<00:04:02.520> assume<00:04:02.790> that

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
distance now we're going to assume that

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.600 
distance now we're going to assume that
theta<00:04:03.239> is<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.510> very<00:04:03.750> small<00:04:04.110> angle<00:04:04.350> so<00:04:05.310> we<00:04:05.430> can

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
theta is a very small angle so we can

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.670 
theta is a very small angle so we can
use<00:04:05.880> this<00:04:06.209> expansion<00:04:06.930> these<00:04:07.290> are<00:04:07.410> trig

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
use this expansion these are trig

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:15.260 
use this expansion these are trig

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
expansions cosine of theta is

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.500 
expansions cosine of theta is
approximately<00:04:15.930> 1<00:04:16.919> minus<00:04:17.430> 1/2<00:04:17.700> theta<00:04:18.030> squared

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
approximately 1 minus 1/2 theta squared

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.420 
approximately 1 minus 1/2 theta squared
plus<00:04:18.630> other<00:04:18.989> terms<00:04:19.080> but<00:04:19.950> for<00:04:20.130> very<00:04:20.280> small

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
plus other terms but for very small

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.760 
plus other terms but for very small
theta<00:04:20.880> we<00:04:21.570> just<00:04:21.750> carry<00:04:22.140> these<00:04:22.290> first<00:04:22.590> two

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.680 
terms the 1 and the minus 1/2 theta
squared<00:04:25.280> sine<00:04:26.280> theta<00:04:26.640> is<00:04:27.000> approximately

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
squared sine theta is approximately

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.020 
squared sine theta is approximately
equal<00:04:28.320> to<00:04:28.380> theta<00:04:28.710> and<00:04:29.070> of<00:04:29.550> course<00:04:29.729> this<00:04:29.820> is<00:04:30.000> in

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
equal to theta and of course this is in

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:36.469 
equal to theta and of course this is in
radians<00:04:33.890> and<00:04:34.890> so<00:04:35.580> now<00:04:35.729> we<00:04:35.790> can<00:04:36.030> write<00:04:36.240> a

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
radians and so now we can write a

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.330 
radians and so now we can write a
simplified<00:04:37.470> equation<00:04:38.330> for<00:04:39.330> H<00:04:40.190> because<00:04:41.190> we

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
simplified equation for H because we

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.590 
simplified equation for H because we
have<00:04:41.430> R<00:04:41.640> -<00:04:42.180> R<00:04:42.330> cosine<00:04:42.870> theta<00:04:43.010> and<00:04:44.010> we<00:04:44.100> subtract

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
have R - R cosine theta and we subtract

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.730 
have R - R cosine theta and we subtract
R<00:04:45.710> times<00:04:46.729> 1<00:04:47.729> it<00:04:48.510> gets<00:04:48.690> rid<00:04:48.810> of<00:04:48.870> the<00:04:48.990> first<00:04:49.200> R<00:04:49.470> and

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
R times 1 it gets rid of the first R and

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.540 
R times 1 it gets rid of the first R and
then<00:04:50.250> we<00:04:50.280> subtract<00:04:50.970> a<00:04:51.270> negative<00:04:52.340> 1/2<00:04:53.340> theta

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
then we subtract a negative 1/2 theta

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.240 
then we subtract a negative 1/2 theta
square<00:04:53.970> with<00:04:54.120> r<00:04:54.330> we<00:04:54.479> just<00:04:54.660> have<00:04:55.040> positive<00:04:56.040> R

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
square with r we just have positive R

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.159 
square with r we just have positive R
theta<00:04:56.700> squared<00:04:57.060> over<00:04:57.120> 2<00:04:58.790> x<00:04:59.790> is<00:05:00.169> approximately

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
theta squared over 2 x is approximately

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:05.090 
theta squared over 2 x is approximately
R<00:05:01.830> times<00:05:02.250> theta<00:05:02.960> using<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.229> sine<00:05:04.440> expansion

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 
R times theta using the sine expansion

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:11.150 
R times theta using the sine expansion
and<00:05:06.050> therefore<00:05:07.050> theta<00:05:07.260> is<00:05:07.590> x<00:05:07.979> over<00:05:08.190> R<00:05:09.979> and<00:05:10.979> now

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
and therefore theta is x over R and now

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.010 
and therefore theta is x over R and now
we<00:05:11.220> can<00:05:11.430> write<00:05:11.640> we<00:05:12.510> can<00:05:12.540> put<00:05:12.900> in<00:05:13.220> this<00:05:14.220> equation

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
we can write we can put in this equation

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.100 
we can write we can put in this equation
we<00:05:16.020> can<00:05:16.200> plug<00:05:16.470> in<00:05:16.680> the<00:05:16.830> value<00:05:17.130> for<00:05:17.340> theta<00:05:18.110> which

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
we can plug in the value for theta which

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.290 
we can plug in the value for theta which
is<00:05:19.140> x<00:05:19.440> over<00:05:19.560> R<00:05:19.710> we<00:05:20.040> square<00:05:20.400> that<00:05:20.640> so<00:05:20.970> we<00:05:21.060> have<00:05:21.150> x

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
is x over R we square that so we have x

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.620 
is x over R we square that so we have x
over<00:05:21.539> R<00:05:21.690> squared<00:05:22.110> R<00:05:22.640> and<00:05:23.640> then<00:05:24.300> 2<00:05:24.479> is

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
over R squared R and then 2 is

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:25.310 
over R squared R and then 2 is

now we've got these two equations so we

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.880 
now we've got these two equations so we
can<00:05:39.460> use<00:05:39.610> x<00:05:39.940> equals<00:05:40.420> h<00:05:40.750> equals<00:05:41.170> x<00:05:41.380> squared<00:05:41.770> over

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
can use x equals h equals x squared over

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.750 
can use x equals h equals x squared over
two<00:05:42.190> R<00:05:42.400> and<00:05:43.650> H<00:05:44.650> equals<00:05:44.980> one-half<00:05:45.340> GT<00:05:45.610> squared

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
two R and H equals one-half GT squared

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:51.140 
two R and H equals one-half GT squared
so<00:05:46.390> we<00:05:46.480> have<00:05:46.690> this<00:05:47.260> on<00:05:47.500> the<00:05:47.620> right<00:05:49.620> on<00:05:50.620> the<00:05:50.770> Left

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
so we have this on the right on the Left

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.920 
so we have this on the right on the Left
I've<00:05:52.150> plugged<00:05:52.510> in<00:05:52.810> for<00:05:53.320> X<00:05:54.360> VT<00:05:55.360> so<00:05:55.570> we<00:05:55.690> square

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
I've plugged in for X VT so we square

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.990 
I've plugged in for X VT so we square
that<00:05:56.170> v<00:05:56.410> squared<00:05:56.740> T<00:05:56.920> squared<00:05:57.220> upstairs<00:05:57.640> and

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
that v squared T squared upstairs and

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.020 
that v squared T squared upstairs and
then<00:05:58.900> downstairs<00:05:59.110> to<00:05:59.590> our<00:05:59.800> notice<00:06:00.700> that<00:06:00.940> we

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
then downstairs to our notice that we

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.060 
then downstairs to our notice that we
can<00:06:01.180> cancel<00:06:01.480> the<00:06:01.810> one<00:06:01.960> half<00:06:02.140> T<00:06:02.290> squared<00:06:02.770> on

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.070 
can cancel the one half T squared on

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.780 
can cancel the one half T squared on
both<00:06:03.790> sides<00:06:04.120> so<00:06:04.420> this<00:06:04.570> goes<00:06:04.810> out<00:06:05.050> and<00:06:05.290> this<00:06:05.470> and

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:05.790 
both sides so this goes out and this and

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:09.240 
both sides so this goes out and this and
this<00:06:06.790> goes<00:06:07.000> out<00:06:07.240> and<00:06:07.480> this<00:06:07.990> so<00:06:08.920> we<00:06:09.010> have<00:06:09.100> V

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
this goes out and this so we have V

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.600 
this goes out and this so we have V
squared<00:06:09.550> over<00:06:09.640> R<00:06:09.760> equals<00:06:10.210> G<00:06:10.570> and<00:06:11.400> then<00:06:12.400> we<00:06:12.490> get

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
squared over R equals G and then we get

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.970 
squared over R equals G and then we get
V<00:06:12.850> equals<00:06:13.240> the<00:06:13.420> square<00:06:13.570> root<00:06:13.930> of<00:06:14.110> G<00:06:14.290> R<00:06:14.680> so

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
V equals the square root of G R so

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.460 
V equals the square root of G R so
that's<00:06:15.100> our<00:06:15.310> formula<00:06:15.630> for<00:06:16.630> what's<00:06:17.050> called<00:06:17.230> the

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
that's our formula for what's called the

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:26.430 
that's our formula for what's called the
circular<00:06:17.770> speed<00:06:19.800> or<00:06:20.800> circular<00:06:21.490> velocity<00:06:25.440> so

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:26.440 
circular speed or circular velocity so

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.380 
circular speed or circular velocity so
let's<00:06:26.680> see<00:06:26.860> how<00:06:26.980> this<00:06:27.160> works<00:06:27.400> out<00:06:27.610> with

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.390 
let's see how this works out with

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:36.110 
let's see how this works out with
numbers

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.659 

we'll<00:06:36.720> use<00:06:36.750> the<00:06:37.080> altitude<00:06:37.590> that<00:06:37.740> the<00:06:37.950> Saturn<00:06:38.460> 5

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
we'll use the altitude that the Saturn 5

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.720 
we'll use the altitude that the Saturn 5
went<00:06:39.080> 276<00:06:40.080> kilometers<00:06:40.620> and<00:06:41.010> the<00:06:41.430> radius<00:06:41.639> the

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:41.730 
went 276 kilometers and the radius the

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:45.320 
went 276 kilometers and the radius the
earth<00:06:41.910> will<00:06:42.090> use<00:06:42.530> 6278<00:06:43.530> kilometers<00:06:44.190> so<00:06:45.120> we're

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:45.330 
earth will use 6278 kilometers so we're

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:49.550 
earth will use 6278 kilometers so we're

of the are you happen to be at now if we

of the are you happen to be at now if we
take<00:07:10.490> the<00:07:11.490> value<00:07:11.520> at<00:07:12.770> sea<00:07:13.770> level<00:07:14.100> or<00:07:14.220> at<00:07:14.370> the

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 
take the value at sea level or at the

take the value at sea level or at the
equator<00:07:14.870> 9.8<00:07:15.870> meters<00:07:16.410> per<00:07:16.500> second<00:07:16.860> squared<00:07:18.590> at

equator 9.8 meters per second squared at

equator 9.8 meters per second squared at
a<00:07:19.650> radius<00:07:20.370> of<00:07:21.380> 6378<00:07:22.380> as<00:07:22.650> we<00:07:23.040> go<00:07:23.190> up<00:07:23.430> from<00:07:23.910> that

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.090 
a radius of 6378 as we go up from that

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:28.879 
a radius of 6378 as we go up from that
altitude<00:07:24.479> we<00:07:25.380> will<00:07:25.530> lose<00:07:27.139> acceleration<00:07:28.139> by

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:28.889 
altitude we will lose acceleration by

00:07:28.889 --> 00:07:34.219 
altitude we will lose acceleration by
this<00:07:29.479> R<00:07:30.479> squared<00:07:31.169> R<00:07:32.100> at<00:07:32.760> Earth<00:07:32.970> squared<00:07:33.570> over<00:07:33.990> R

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:34.229 
this R squared R at Earth squared over R

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:37.640 
this R squared R at Earth squared over R
at<00:07:34.590> orbit<00:07:35.430> squared<00:07:35.820> so<00:07:36.330> this<00:07:36.479> is<00:07:36.630> a<00:07:36.750> this<00:07:37.560> is

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:37.650 
at orbit squared so this is a this is

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:39.379 
at orbit squared so this is a this is
basically<00:07:37.979> because<00:07:38.100> of<00:07:38.430> Newton's<00:07:38.820> law<00:07:39.120> that

00:07:39.379 --> 00:07:39.389 
basically because of Newton's law that

00:07:39.389 --> 00:07:42.469 
basically because of Newton's law that
gravity<00:07:39.960> goes<00:07:40.710> with<00:07:40.890> GMM<00:07:41.310> over<00:07:41.400> R<00:07:41.550> squared<00:07:42.060> so

00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 
gravity goes with GMM over R squared so

00:07:42.479 --> 00:07:44.330 
gravity goes with GMM over R squared so
this<00:07:42.630> is<00:07:42.750> how<00:07:42.870> you<00:07:42.930> get<00:07:43.110> the<00:07:43.260> G<00:07:43.560> at<00:07:43.919> different

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:44.340 
this is how you get the G at different

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:46.279 
this is how you get the G at different
altitudes<00:07:44.460> or<00:07:45.120> a<00:07:45.330> different<00:07:45.690> radii<00:07:45.960> I<00:07:46.020> should

00:07:46.279 --> 00:07:46.289 
altitudes or a different radii I should

00:07:46.289 --> 00:07:48.529 
altitudes or a different radii I should
say<00:07:46.470> and<00:07:46.800> it's<00:07:47.550> only<00:07:47.729> nine<00:07:47.970> point<00:07:48.300> two<00:07:48.510> eight

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:48.539 
say and it's only nine point two eight

00:07:48.539 --> 00:07:50.300 
say and it's only nine point two eight
meters<00:07:49.080> per<00:07:49.110> second<00:07:49.620> squared<00:07:49.860> compared<00:07:50.220> to

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:50.310 
meters per second squared compared to

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:53.810 
meters per second squared compared to
nine<00:07:50.460> point<00:07:50.700> eight<00:07:50.970> at<00:07:51.450> the<00:07:51.690> equator<00:07:52.680> so<00:07:53.669> it's

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:53.820 
nine point eight at the equator so it's

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.540 
nine point eight at the equator so it's
a<00:07:53.880> little<00:07:54.000> bit<00:07:54.210> less<00:07:54.479> when<00:07:55.289> you're<00:07:55.410> up<00:07:55.530> at<00:07:55.740> 176

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:56.550 
a little bit less when you're up at 176

00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:59.120 
a little bit less when you're up at 176
kilometers
