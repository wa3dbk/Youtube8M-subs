00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.980
 let's start delineating and filling 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:46.550
 the eyebrows to make a line below 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:54.350

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.040
 more straights let's light up with this 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:09.010
 fifth topic corrector not in that 15 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:11.140
 [Music] 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:17.410
 now let's mark the eye contour 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:19.270
 use a medium brown tone let's create 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.610
 a basis for the shadows and for I'm 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.210
 using a black pencil to be very creamy 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:34.450
 this is from l care light eyeliner in tone 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:36.070
 black and do not worry because 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:42.070
 perfect because we're going to 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:43.720
 blur we are going to put shadow now 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.580
 black in the outer corner and the 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.160
 inner corner on the base that 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.950
 we put for I'm using this color 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.700
 blackout of the smoke palette of 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.700
 wayne de cake 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:03.080
 if they find out I leave the center of 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.470
 eyelid without any color and blurs the 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.470
 borders 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.040
 and now the saint where I did not put any 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.250
 color let's put a blue shadow 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:20.820
 dark metallic and it's colored from the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.290
 color palette and it is dark blue 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:28.870
 that goes in the center 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.870
 [Music] 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.490
 now let's do an outline with 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.400
 frost but if I'm using eye candy 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.010
 in the tube of the gel that is very sticky 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.020
 for the frost and the farc and it is blue 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:53.470
 Dark 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:55.960
 [Music] 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.120
 and by the delineator we are going to guide us with 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.160
 the shadow that we have already done 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.190
 using wet and white america line in 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:07.110
 black tone and we simply turn on the 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.110
 line and we join it to the lashes 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.940
 [Music] 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.310
 now with the same black pencil we are going to 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.960
 delineate the water line of the eyes and 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.960
 the line of the tabs below 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.000
 we seal with black shadow and we put 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:33.150
 concealer around the eye for 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.110
 illuminate and clean any bit of 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.749
 shadow that has fallen on the face 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.749
 [Music] 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.300
 Let us now make a delineated a 

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:52.720
 hairline to use the yellow tone and 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.120
 I'm using the palette flashes colors 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.800
 that is called make up forever and the 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:04.090
 obviously yellow tone the most 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:09.430
 bright and how is a cream tone a 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:11.590
 seal now with shadow let's put 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:23.140
 now the false eyelashes reason for 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:24.940
 magic magic and they are super nice and now 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:27.260
 we enter the tabs to combine 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.050
 the small natural ones with the inserts 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:37.169
 [Music] 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:39.240
 we put a blink on and now we go with my 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.030
 as a favorite for the skin that is going to 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.069
 be light sephora liquid one month with 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:48.590
 a sponge bird and blender contex those of 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:48.590
 marc and applied with a sponge the base 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:05:04.440
 now we put loose powders without color 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:06.570
 to seal the entire base and now we're going to 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.430
 mark the contours we start from below 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:10.250
 of the cheekbones so that the face is a 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:13.139
 little more defined as the factions 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:16.380
 which I am using this green bronze 

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:18.389
 marc in harmony tone let's put it 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.290
 also on the temple how to connect it 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:25.410
 towards the cheekbone 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:25.410
 [Music] 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:31.040
 and we are blurring so you do not notice 

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:37.220
 where the light begins and where it ends 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:37.220
 [Music] 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:46.420
 we obviously do the same to the other side 

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:49.180
 of the face and do not forget the outline 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:51.220
 of the jaw we can also put to 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.260
 the sides of the nose to make it more 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:56.010
 thin and below the tip for 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.010
 breathe the 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.560
 come on now can a blush this but 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:07.620
 also a little glitter is a must 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:10.689
 mineral and it's a loose rumor 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:10.689
 [Music] 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.690
 and here if you realize I'm using a 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.790
 illuminator an eyeliner this is who 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.860
 finish theme and what it is to give as a 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:27.490
 pearl effect to the skin 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.990
 [Music] 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.310
 for the first option of this 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.289
 makeup that is to use the lips a 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.840
 little as natural I'm using a 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:37.630
 dye the dye can put it both 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:40.150
 as a robot as for lips and it's going to last 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:43.270
 much longer than a normal lip 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.270
 [Music] 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:48.500
 and that is the first option of the place 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.500
 [Music] 

00:06:50.729 --> 00:06:54.839
 now we go with the second option that 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:57.749
 They use darker lips for their 

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:59.819
 I'm using the include a velvet in 

00:06:57.749 --> 00:07:09.210
 which is a vial that when dried remains 

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:10.710
 mate and the tone is called wicked and this is 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.860
 the final result with the lips 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.860
 dark 

00:07:14.939 --> 00:07:18.449
