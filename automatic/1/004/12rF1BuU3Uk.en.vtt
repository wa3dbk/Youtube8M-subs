00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:11.730
 we are already with part number 2 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:16.170
 then learn to build do not 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.730
 they knew but well then good here 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.980
 they already build the house has to be fixed 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.920
 through the window of things and the things that 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.630
 have for example site a TV and 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.570
 you work right there then it goes to 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.460
 be much more real than good imagine 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.810
 that is here there was also a pool 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.790
 So, well, I'm going to show you how 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.100
 make a visit because but well done 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.830
 and it's easy to see that a lot of people 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.680
 wrong then well I'm going to 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:43.489
 teach so fast I will not teach it 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.489
 well with designs 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:52.820
 need glass too 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.710
 I do not ask why yet but here already 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.130
 but here is already in good fast camera 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.170
 because it lasted a lot then then 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.690
 first we cut it all the earth and 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.510
 and then we add the little bank the 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.190
 soft sandstone so it looks nice and 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.840
 then we started making three blocks 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.940
 down three blocks down or 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.270
 three locks down throughout the 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.350
 pool and good during the three blocks 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.080
 down 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.850
 the last block to the third one they put the 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.000
 soft sandstone as they will see 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.000
 continuation 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.170
 in the pool and now at the sides I 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.899
 like the land on the sides whatever 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.450
 visible not the one on the corner and we put 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.119
 just as you are now seeing the sandstone 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.950
 this broken half we put it on and peel 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.110
 declines to which they have the form of 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.970
 crime we put it what we fill 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.149
 spaces and then we force the glasses 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.580
 but as if anahÃ­ to the Roman half to the 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.010
 shore or nothing 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.680
 then let's say to the whole shore or 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.080
 glass is added to the entire shore until 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.970
 you see video to the middle not to the shore with 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.590
 there and the pool is ready 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.990
 without current now this will be the video 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.320
 his veto like and favorites until the 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.320
 next
