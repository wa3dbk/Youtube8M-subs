00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.799
 we follow in auto technique radio choir 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.799
 millennium 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.049
 in the previous block we stayed in that 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.670
 let's chat about some way 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:19.040
 Save fuel by luck 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.439
 of intelligent management if the word fits 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.439
 the story which are the worst enemies 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.060
 what is there for fuel consumption 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.680
 real worse enemy than for the consumption of 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.630
 fuels the right foot does not have 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.019
 absolutely no doubt that the thing 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.090
 it happens that you are lord if it is the 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:37.580
 same as he has taken at the wheel with 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.040
 the glasses do not yes sir ask who is 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.070
 commanded by the brain and there they start 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.520
 the problems for serious talking 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.370
 there are two fundamental things the floor of the 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.559
 car affects that we have already spoken and the 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.570
 speed of the car hits directly 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.730
 related to the life cabin I do not know 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.620
 exactly the floor of the moment that 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.289
 it's a mass and you know how much 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.079
 the greater the mass the more force there is that 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.309
 do to make change speed 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.670
 acceleration in acceleration what I 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.380
 it's the speed change basically 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.600
 so where is the problem in the 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.700
 accelerated one of the big problems 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.490
 people like to feel the effect of 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.829
 foot on the accelerator 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.920
 feel the power that has motor weight 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:23.530
 you have to pay it the accelerated ones are paid 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.780
 at the price of fuel that you think 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.979
 that accelerates merrily in a 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.750
 corner and in the next one has a 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.670
 semaphore will have to slow down with the 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.409
 same joy then all the energy 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.570
 what I spend to accelerate the car 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.729
 uselessly it is something that has some 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.640
 chopped with a neighbor will have it 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:43.600
 what to squander and throw in the next 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.640
 braking the more continuous the 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.610
 speed that you can hold 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.409
 while driving, have no doubt 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.850
 that the fuel savings is going to 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.110
 produce 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.610
 Alberto and for example I think 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.399
 interesting to eat look interesting 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.259
 emphasize the theme that is very 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:05.170
 graph dow this you just said in 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.679
 the in the walk in the city and this from 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.729
 stop traffic light 1 forward 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:11.400
 constantly recover again 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.110
 Speed ​​etc. Etcetera Etcetera 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.910
 look so much is reflected that despite 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.700
 that in the city one walks reasonably 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.010
 space consumption in the city usually 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.930
 double to the consumption values in 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.370
 route 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.260
 much higher speed when you do not 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.840
 translates into kilometers per liter in 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.700
 long we take prudently or not but 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.530
 in general the average consumption 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.659
 always if what most affects it in the 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.519
 city the city is to start for 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.650
 start to start delivering energy 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.290
 so that raquel can squander the 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.359
 braking and again the same game is a 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.950
 perverse game without any doubt except 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.170
 when hybrid themes come in 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.889
 function that the braking agrees 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.299
 the previous block braking is one in 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.069
 the system whenever it just 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.389
 takes care of recovering energy and saving 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.120
 new theory to then return it to 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:59.970
 use more than intelligent system the other 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.709
 thing is en route only that in the figures 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:05.340
 that I'm going to give here to the connoted t 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:08.519
 because they are astonished me look at a 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.000
 Normal vehicle of normal weight black 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:14.040
 boy a corsa a device of that type 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.250
 more or less to walk 60 kilometers 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.930
 per hour requires four horses four 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.730
 neither more nor less with the covers 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.169
 correctly infra visualized to 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.139
 constant speed approximately 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:28.650
 four horses that same vehicle if 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:33.370
 you take it to 130 kilometers per hour 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.560
 56 horses is 14 times more if 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.450
 you double a little more double the 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.920
 speed in the whole world could think 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.459
 well I explain the speed doubled the 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.500
 consumption no forgiveness mistake 14 times more for 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.390
 if I do not hear it that exponential does not 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.120
 be that this is a cubic word more 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:50.200
 exactly then extreme that is the 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.500
 speed for speed with the 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.860
 speed three times then if one gets 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.569
 moderate with speed is really 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.840
 impressive the advantage 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.700
 a few days ago we came back with the 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.459
 fellow technician of television 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.739
 the most has broken we came from entrerrios and 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.810
 we came fast and like but we gave 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.130
 account that consumption has said of the 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.360
 waves and we were with very little 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.180
 Fuel us with doubts and 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.859
 we arrived at the next station 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.479
 fuel or not I immediately told him 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.130
 look roberts and what I say for 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:24.729
 television is true slow down 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.740
 in half or a little bit better he 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:28.750
 himself was totally amazed 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.460
 because he stuck in that moment of 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.289
 hole not for consumption but yes for 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.249
 available mileage and we were able 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:37.310
 perfectly arrive 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:39.509
 consequence second thing the speed 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.330
 control the speed 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:44.069
 if you avoid sudden accelerations 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.979
 if you keep at constant speed 

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:50.370
 and a third council of changes 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:52.349
 possible use the lowest not the highest 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.719
 There are people who like to have what they 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:56.639
 call the engine in turns is and take it 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:58.349
 to the engine screaming and follow and answer 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.840
 better if the star responds better 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:02.999
 faster also try to use without 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.529
 be on demanding the vehicle and 

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:05.849
 obviously if you have to surpass 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:07.889
 someone get off the change that is 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:10.979
 necessary but try to use the change 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.699
 higher that's going to help you raise those 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:14.759
 three things 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:16.340
 and believe me you will be amazed in the way 

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:19.349
 in reducing fuel consumption 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.509
 good talking as always of irons 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:24.509
 I invite you to the next blog that 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:26.159
 let's chat with raúl barceló and on the 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:28.610
