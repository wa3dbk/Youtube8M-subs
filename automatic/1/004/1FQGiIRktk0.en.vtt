00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:09.820

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:11.889
 choosing the countertop for the kitchen is a 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.870
 of the most important decisions when 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.539

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:20.350
 I will try to explain the different 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.680
 types of countertops that there are and their 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.680
 advantage 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.329
 compact quartz countertops is a 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.790
 material of great hardness difficult to scratch 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.570

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.410
 on the other hand you have to be careful with 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.450
 the high temperatures is not convenient 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.350
 take anything out of the fire and put it 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.350
 directly above 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.480
 granite and natural stone countertops 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.210

 hits 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.410
 totally resist the heat so 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.660
 you can support the pots and 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.730
 hot pans without any problem 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.010
 you just have to be careful with certain 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:24.370
 liquids like oil that can stop 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.370

 formica countertops and materials 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.049
 synthetic this type of countertops is the 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:40.869
 Cheaper and easier to maintain material 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.869

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.040
 It is an agglomerated material of 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.900
 wood with a top layer that mimics 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.940

 even though they are usually fine 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:16.190
 varnished are very porous so 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:25.249
 the spots penetrate easily
