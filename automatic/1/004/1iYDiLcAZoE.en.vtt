going to rein in speculation are they
not<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:15.929> think<00:00:16.049> that's<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.289> good<00:00:16.320> thing<00:00:16.470> or<00:00:16.680> a

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
not you think that's a good thing or a

not you think that's a good thing or a
bad<00:00:16.830> thing<00:00:17.630> well<00:00:18.630> I<00:00:18.660> mean<00:00:19.080> whether<00:00:19.289> it's<00:00:19.529> a

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
bad thing well I mean whether it's a

good thing or a bad thing I really think

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.140 
good thing or a bad thing I really think
that<00:00:21.930> it's<00:00:22.170> attacking<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.220> symptom<00:00:23.730> not<00:00:24.090> the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
that it's attacking the symptom not the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.660 
that it's attacking the symptom not the
disease<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:25.140> mean<00:00:25.350> neither<00:00:25.859> yesterday's

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
disease I mean neither yesterday's

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.000 
disease I mean neither yesterday's
record<00:00:27.390> prices<00:00:27.720> nor<00:00:28.590> for<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:28.859> matter

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
record prices nor for that matter

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.730 
record prices nor for that matter
today's<00:00:29.730> prices<00:00:30.480> are<00:00:31.019> really<00:00:31.590> about

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
today's prices are really about

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.130 
today's prices are really about
speculators<00:00:32.700> that's<00:00:33.210> putting<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.899> cart

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
speculators that's putting the cart

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.959 
speculators that's putting the cart
before<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.800> horse<00:00:34.950> I<00:00:35.430> think<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.790> real

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
before the horse I think the real

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.900 
before the horse I think the real
question<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.750> why<00:00:37.380> have<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:37.980> many<00:00:38.129> hedge<00:00:38.430> funds

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
question is why have so many hedge funds

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.810 
question is why have so many hedge funds
and<00:00:39.030> speculators<00:00:39.690> piled<00:00:40.500> in<00:00:40.950> too<00:00:41.309> long<00:00:41.460> oil

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
and speculators piled in too long oil

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.150 
and speculators piled in too long oil
positions<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:43.140> think<00:00:43.410> it's<00:00:43.559> because<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
positions and I think it's because the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.729 
positions and I think it's because the
laws<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.370> economics<00:00:44.910> are<00:00:45.570> simply<00:00:46.020> not<00:00:46.200> working

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
laws of economics are simply not working

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.790 
laws of economics are simply not working
in<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.250> oil<00:00:47.280> market<00:00:48.000> higher<00:00:48.539> oil<00:00:48.570> prices<00:00:49.020> are

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
in the oil market higher oil prices are

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.510 
in the oil market higher oil prices are
not<00:00:50.070> bringing<00:00:50.460> about<00:00:51.329> new<00:00:51.989> cheap<00:00:52.410> supply<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
not bringing about new cheap supply the

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.000 
not bringing about new cheap supply the
only<00:00:53.789> supply<00:00:54.149> they're<00:00:54.420> raising<00:00:54.719> is<00:00:55.199> very<00:00:55.739> high

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
only supply they're raising is very high

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.970 
only supply they're raising is very high
costs<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.699> problematic<00:00:57.270> supply<00:00:57.840> by<00:00:58.410> Canadian

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980

oil sands and deepwater oil well and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.990 
oil sands and deepwater oil well and
that<00:01:01.260> encourages<00:01:01.890> speculators<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.640> continue

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
that encourages speculators to continue

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.899 
that encourages speculators to continue

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
to go long well Jeff are you saying that

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.660 
to go long well Jeff are you saying that
the<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.630> way<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.320> market<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.830> structured<00:01:08.460> and

the the way the market is structured and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.880 
the the way the market is structured and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the way speculators can play it

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.469 
the way speculators can play it
investors<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.610> don't<00:01:11.820> care<00:01:11.939> what<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.150> call<00:01:12.420> it

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
investors I don't care what you call it

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.870 
investors I don't care what you call it
but<00:01:12.630> okay<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.380> way<00:01:13.560> investors<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.490> play<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
but okay the way investors can play the

but okay the way investors can play the
oil<00:01:15.060> market<00:01:15.540> makes<00:01:15.930> for<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> great<00:01:16.259> deal<00:01:16.590> of

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
oil market makes for a great deal of

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.460 
oil market makes for a great deal of
volatility<00:01:17.220> prices<00:01:18.000> way<00:01:18.210> up<00:01:18.450> prices<00:01:18.990> way<00:01:19.170> down

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
volatility prices way up prices way down

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.440 
volatility prices way up prices way down
is<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:20.189> what<00:01:20.369> you're<00:01:20.490> saying<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.939> nature<00:01:21.420> of

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
is that what you're saying the nature of

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.770 
is that what you're saying the nature of
the<00:01:21.689> market<00:01:22.140> encourages<00:01:22.740> this<00:01:22.860> volatility

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
the market encourages this volatility

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.690 
the market encourages this volatility
not<00:01:24.780> just<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.290> volatility<00:01:26.040> because<00:01:26.310> most<00:01:26.549> of

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
not just the volatility because most of

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.730 
not just the volatility because most of
the<00:01:26.820> volatility<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.689> on<00:01:27.930> going<00:01:28.350> one<00:01:28.560> direction

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
the volatility is on going one direction

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.249 
the volatility is on going one direction
and<00:01:29.340> that's<00:01:29.520> over<00:01:29.909> cycles<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.689> higher<00:01:30.869> prices

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
and that's over cycles to higher prices

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.770 
and that's over cycles to higher prices
what<00:01:32.220> I'm<00:01:32.400> saying<00:01:32.790> what<00:01:33.030> encourages<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
what I'm saying what encourages the

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.260 
what I'm saying what encourages the
speculators<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.740> come<00:01:34.979> in<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.119> the

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
speculators to come in is that in the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.660 
speculators to come in is that in the
past<00:01:36.540> higher<00:01:37.229> oil<00:01:37.259> prices<00:01:37.710> have<00:01:38.189> bought

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
past higher oil prices have bought

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.450 
past higher oil prices have bought
brought<00:01:39.210> new<00:01:39.600> cheap<00:01:40.020> supply<00:01:40.530> like<00:01:41.009> Prudhoe

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
brought new cheap supply like Prudhoe

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.060 
brought new cheap supply like Prudhoe
Bay<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.030> North<00:01:42.240> Sea<00:01:42.479> oil<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:43.079> that's<00:01:43.799> no

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
Bay and North Sea oil and that's no

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.740 
Bay and North Sea oil and that's no
longer<00:01:44.310> happening<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.270> that's<00:01:45.509> not<00:01:45.689> a

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
longer happening and that's not a

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.530 
longer happening and that's not a
problem<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.439> speculators<00:01:47.130> or<00:01:47.490> markets<00:01:48.030> that's

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
problem of speculators or markets that's

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.990 
problem of speculators or markets that's
a<00:01:48.720> problem<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:49.290> underlying<00:01:49.740> geology<00:01:50.159> well

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
a problem of underlying geology well

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.550 
a problem of underlying geology well
there's<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.210> lot<00:01:51.360> of<00:01:51.420> talk<00:01:51.780> about<00:01:51.810> whether<00:01:52.409> or

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
there's a lot of talk about whether or

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.300 
there's a lot of talk about whether or
not<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.860> should<00:01:52.920> rein<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.970> speculators<00:01:54.750> are

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
not you should rein in speculators are

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.580 
not you should rein in speculators are
speculators<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.610> blame<00:01:56.880> him<00:01:57.030> my<00:01:57.750> position<00:01:58.140> is

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590

I'd<00:01:59.009> love<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.520> see<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.909> margins<00:02:00.630> changed<00:02:01.350> for

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
I'd love to see the margins changed for

I'd love to see the margins changed for
futures<00:02:02.009> oil<00:02:02.340> trading<00:02:02.969> go<00:02:03.329> up<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.600> fifty

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
futures oil trading go up to fifty

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.690 
futures oil trading go up to fifty
percent<00:02:04.229> instead<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.710> ten<00:02:04.920> or<00:02:05.040> twenty<00:02:05.369> percent

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
percent instead of ten or twenty percent

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.910 
percent instead of ten or twenty percent
that<00:02:06.270> would<00:02:06.540> cut<00:02:06.810> down<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.259> volatility

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
that would cut down on the volatility

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.309 
that would cut down on the volatility

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
and that would cut down on the the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.490 
and that would cut down on the the

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
do you say that that may well be the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.440 
do you say that that may well be the

if by muzzling the speculators we drive
down<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.780> price<00:02:21.810> of<00:02:22.260> oil<00:02:22.470> all<00:02:22.860> that<00:02:23.490> means<00:02:23.820> is

down the price of oil all that means is

down the price of oil all that means is

down<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:53.130> problem<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.850> we're<00:02:54.360> going<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.510> have
