00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.319
 hello it's magali and welcome to 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.210
 this new video of the drummer blog 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.980
 beginners so today I have 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.320
 the immense pleasure of welcoming laurent 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.820
 which is battery teacher to the ion and 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.259
 it's also the author of the blog I like 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.460
 a lot that's called battery in 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.680
 ligne.fr so in fact I launched a 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.420
 little challenge to the orange said laurent 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.830
 I would like you to explain this 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.359
 that it's a rhythmic illusion and 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.820
 how to play one of us the drummers 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.640
 beginners then laurent kindly 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.210
 accepted to take up this challenge so I 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:53.520
 proposes without delay to spend the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:54.899
 laurent microphone thank you hello 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.460
 in this video you will discover 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.059
 a rhythmic illusion called the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.530
 shift 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.879
 so first of all what is he denying 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.829
 it's rhythmic ions this simply 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.690
 a feint on the part of the drummer who 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.640
 make the listener believe that the tempo 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.170
 although the heartbeat has changed within 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.060
 of a piece when in fact it does not 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.740
 is nothing and the shift is a 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.960
 illusion that will consist of playing a 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.790
 rhythm then to shift that same rhythm 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.320
 for a while so it can be a 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.909
 crooked a black etc 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.320
 today we will take the pace of 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.939
 base with bass drums on 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.220
 the pond a narrow and snares on 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.900
 the tents 2 and 4 and we will shift this 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.409
 ticking a tick we will delay it 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.909
 a crooked 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.020
 that's why the bass drums and the 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.579
 snare drums instead of falling on 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.229
 times will fall on the hurdles of 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.710
 every time and so as first 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.049
 exercise 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.759
 we will alternate the basic rhythm and the 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.470
 basic rhythm shifted so I'm going to you 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.880
 do it first at 60 beats per minute 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.880
 which has 120 beats per minute 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.500
 for the second exercise we will do 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.209
 exactly as for the first 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.860
 except that instead of alternating a single 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.480
 measure of each rhythm we will alternate 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.069
 two measures of each rhythm that wants 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.230
 to say we're going to do the offbeat rhythm 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.819
 twice as long and so it's going 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.459
 leave more chance for you 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.750
 even you are a victim of luzon and so 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.670
 that's something very important 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.110
 when you play an illusion you have to 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.440
 always that you have the pulsation in 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.180
 head 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.610
 and for that I have some advice to give you 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.519
 it is to mark the pulsation with your 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.170
 heel on the hihat pedal so 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.280
 it's gone for the second rhythm that 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.780
 this time I'm only doing 120 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.220
 beats per minute you obviously 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:59.359
 you can start by doing it at 60 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:03:00.680
 beats per minute once you 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:02.510
 master the second exercise we are going 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.220
 push the vice even further instead 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.410
 to make two measurements of offbeat rhythm 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.220
 we will make 4 measure of the offbeat rhythm and 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.220
 all this we will do it in music 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.829
 Well, that's all for today 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:35.810
 I hope you liked it 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.549
 know that sheet music and music 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.689
 are at your disposal for you 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.459
 can work for that just 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:42.019

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.099
 I hope that Laurence has filled her 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.010
 challenge by the way about that if you have 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.239
 questions you want to know 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.669
 something more about illusions 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.409
 rhythmically come right away soon 

00:03:52.669 --> 00:03:56.720

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.950
 that next time we can do 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:14.659

 here to find all 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:19.250
 explanations of the rhythms and 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.959
 exercises that have been in the video 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.289
 as well as the statement of all that laurent
