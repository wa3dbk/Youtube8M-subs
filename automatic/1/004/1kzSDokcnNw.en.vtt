00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.220 

and<00:05:13.640> they<00:05:13.790> can't<00:05:14.090> goes<00:05:14.360> well<00:05:14.690> I<00:05:14.720> just<00:05:15.050> just

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:15.230 
and they can't goes well I just just

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:17.050 
and they can't goes well I just just
walking<00:05:15.680> through<00:05:15.710> walking<00:05:16.400> through<00:05:16.640> yeah<00:05:16.820> cuz

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
walking through walking through yeah cuz

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.090 
walking through walking through yeah cuz
I'm<00:05:17.180> not<00:05:17.390> gonna<00:05:17.840> do<00:05:18.080> anything<00:05:18.380> it's<00:05:19.010> the

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:19.100 
I'm not gonna do anything it's the

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.610 
I'm not gonna do anything it's the
current<00:05:19.460> isn't<00:05:19.610> really<00:05:19.940> going<00:05:20.150> fast<00:05:20.660> at<00:05:21.050> all

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
current isn't really going fast at all

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.620 
current isn't really going fast at all
so<00:05:22.100> I'm<00:05:22.490> guessing<00:05:22.760> they're<00:05:23.090> gonna<00:05:23.210> be<00:05:23.390> roving

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
so I'm guessing they're gonna be roving

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.530 
so I'm guessing they're gonna be roving
like<00:05:24.140> the<00:05:24.350> fish<00:05:24.560> you're<00:05:24.680> gonna<00:05:24.830> be<00:05:25.040> a<00:05:25.250> bit<00:05:25.910> of<00:05:26.000> a

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:26.540 
like the fish you're gonna be a bit of a

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.420 
like the fish you're gonna be a bit of a
that's<00:05:27.140> where<00:05:27.320> they<00:05:27.380> usually<00:05:27.500> yeah<00:05:27.980> say<00:05:28.370> you

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
that's where they usually yeah say you

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.980 
that's where they usually yeah say you

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
through in the middle and I in the

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:32.140 
through in the middle and I in the
middle<00:05:30.260> because<00:05:30.500> I<00:05:30.770> my<00:05:31.340> accuracy<00:05:31.670> is<00:05:31.880> not<00:05:31.940> the

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
middle because I my accuracy is not the

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.450 
middle because I my accuracy is not the
greatest

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460
