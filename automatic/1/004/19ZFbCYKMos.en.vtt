00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
helps a very brief look into my

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.129 
helps a very brief look into my
Barcelona<00:00:08.460> setup<00:00:09.030> and<00:00:09.210> it<00:00:09.269> isn't<00:00:09.510> that<00:00:09.870> much

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
Barcelona setup and it isn't that much

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.530 
Barcelona setup and it isn't that much
different<00:00:10.769> from<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.250> custom<00:00:11.820> setup<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.480> a

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
different from the custom setup of a

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.299 
different from the custom setup of a
default<00:00:12.990> setup<00:00:13.380> should<00:00:13.679> I<00:00:13.740> said<00:00:13.920> this<00:00:14.070> is<00:00:14.190> my

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
default setup should I said this is my

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.830 
default setup should I said this is my
custom<00:00:14.700> setup<00:00:15.650> go<00:00:16.650> into<00:00:17.039> it<00:00:17.160> you'll<00:00:17.340> see<00:00:17.640> that

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 
custom setup go into it you'll see that

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.380 
custom setup go into it you'll see that
does<00:00:18.840> default<00:00:19.380> formation

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
does default formation

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.439 
does default formation
that's<00:00:21.390> my<00:00:21.570> custom<00:00:22.020> formation<00:00:22.880> now<00:00:23.880> I<00:00:23.910> hate

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
that's my custom formation now I hate

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.310 
that's my custom formation now I hate
that<00:00:24.689> gap<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.380> between<00:00:26.150> the<00:00:27.150> midfield<00:00:27.660> where

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
that gap in between the midfield where

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.209 
that gap in between the midfield where
it<00:00:28.470> looks<00:00:28.650> like<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.789> rather<00:00:30.539> Wow<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.980> I

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
it looks like a you a rather Wow you I

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.190 
it looks like a you a rather Wow you I
don't<00:00:32.640> like<00:00:33.030> that<00:00:33.090> gap<00:00:33.480> I<00:00:33.660> think<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:34.110> it

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
don't like that gap I think that it

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.830 
don't like that gap I think that it
allows<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:35.040> attacking<00:00:35.399> team<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:36.090> work<00:00:36.300> into

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
allows the attacking team to work into

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.560 
allows the attacking team to work into
that<00:00:36.989> little<00:00:37.170> hole<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.800> prefer<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.910> whether

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
that little hole I prefer it whether

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.060 
that little hole I prefer it whether
there's<00:00:39.719> an<00:00:39.780> attacking<00:00:40.110> player<00:00:40.469> at<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.770> front

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
there's an attacking player at the front

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.029 
there's an attacking player at the front
and<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.520> turns<00:00:41.760> into<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.210> V<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.870> very<00:00:43.500> slanted<00:00:43.770> V

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
and it turns into a V a very slanted V

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.130 
and it turns into a V a very slanted V
and<00:00:47.039> he<00:00:47.219> almost<00:00:47.370> covers<00:00:47.910> that<00:00:48.090> hole<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
and he almost covers that hole in the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.740 
and he almost covers that hole in the
middle<00:00:49.340> ok<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.640> particular<00:00:51.300> plate<00:00:51.539> is

front of that and I like to defending
midfielders<00:00:57.899> as<00:00:58.320> opposed<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.640> other<00:00:59.760> way

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
midfielders as opposed to the other way

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.110 
midfielders as opposed to the other way
around<00:01:00.090> where<00:01:00.600> you've<00:01:00.750> got<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.640> defender<00:01:02.640> and

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
around where you've got a defender and

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.160 
around where you've got a defender and
two<00:01:03.390> attackers

I prefer attacker and two defenders in
javi<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.189> Busquets<00:01:08.640> because<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.090> really<00:01:10.080> is

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
javi and Busquets because that really is

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.140 
javi and Busquets because that really is
how<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.890> should<00:01:11.040> be<00:01:11.189> because<00:01:11.310> you've<00:01:11.580> got<00:01:11.760> two

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
how it should be because you've got two

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.570 
how it should be because you've got two
Center<00:01:12.600> defence<00:01:12.869> midfielders<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.560> javi<00:01:14.250> and

Bush<00:01:15.060> quits<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.810> I<00:01:16.350> am<00:01:16.920> aware<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.220> javi<00:01:17.790> is

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
Bush quits I do I am aware that javi is

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.120 
Bush quits I do I am aware that javi is
an<00:01:18.299> all-rounder<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.380> do<00:01:19.439> think<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.979> in

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
an all-rounder but I do think that in

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.740 
an all-rounder but I do think that in
his<00:01:20.250> older<00:01:20.580> age<00:01:20.759> he's<00:01:21.000> lost<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.390> lot<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.600> his

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
his older age he's lost a lot of his

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.910 
his older age he's lost a lot of his
pace<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:23.119> he's<00:01:24.119> better<00:01:24.570> at<00:01:24.780> marking<00:01:25.710> those

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
pace and he's better at marking those

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.149 
pace and he's better at marking those
holes<00:01:26.280> those<00:01:26.670> pockets<00:01:27.270> those<00:01:27.659> those<00:01:28.470> running

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
holes those pockets those those running

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.480 
holes those pockets those those running
lines<00:01:29.400> if<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.759> will<00:01:30.470> because<00:01:31.470> like<00:01:31.860> say<00:01:32.189> he's

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
lines if you will because like say he's

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.039 
lines if you will because like say he's
lost<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:33.000> lot<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.540> his<00:01:34.110> acceleration<00:01:34.619> at<00:01:35.930> 67<00:01:36.930> if

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
lost a lot of his acceleration at 67 if

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.410 
lost a lot of his acceleration at 67 if
T<00:01:37.170> compared<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.829> many<00:01:37.979> Esther<00:01:38.460> who<00:01:38.670> was<00:01:39.390> a

little bit as 76 and a little bit of

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.210 
little bit as 76 and a little bit of
sprint<00:01:42.390> speed<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:43.500> don't<00:01:43.740> want<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:43.950> have<00:01:44.100> he

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
sprint speed you don't want to have he

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.969 
sprint speed you don't want to have he
being<00:01:44.399> caught<00:01:44.790> out<00:01:45.030> at<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:46.020> top<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.740> pitch

being caught out at the top of the pitch

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.450 
being caught out at the top of the pitch
so<00:01:47.399> then<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.880> sit<00:01:48.180> quite<00:01:48.479> deep<00:01:48.750> so<00:01:49.310> Busquets<00:01:50.310> as

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
so then to sit quite deep so Busquets as

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.280 
so then to sit quite deep so Busquets as
wellbut<00:01:50.700> does<00:01:51.119> like<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> lot<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.869> pace<00:01:52.079> at

wellbut does like a lot of pace at

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.819 
wellbut does like a lot of pace at
midfield<00:01:52.520> acceleration<00:01:53.520> 59<00:01:54.409> so<00:01:55.409> you'll<00:01:55.590> find

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
midfield acceleration 59 so you'll find

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.709 
midfield acceleration 59 so you'll find
any<00:01:56.009> Esther<00:01:56.399> coming<00:01:56.700> back<00:01:56.850> quite<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> lot<00:01:57.479> to

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
any Esther coming back quite a lot to

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.600 
any Esther coming back quite a lot to
pick<00:01:57.960> them<00:01:58.170> 12<00:01:58.500> holes<00:01:58.799> but<00:01:59.009> you've<00:01:59.189> got<00:01:59.340> two

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
pick them 12 holes but you've got two

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.210 
pick them 12 holes but you've got two
good<00:01:59.880> half<00:02:00.119> backs<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.810> PK<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.590> Mascherano

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
good half backs in PK and Mascherano

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.850 
good half backs in PK and Mascherano
now<00:02:04.030> obviously<00:02:04.210> I'm<00:02:04.570> gonna<00:02:04.720> play<00:02:05.020> the<00:02:05.590> three

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
now obviously I'm gonna play the three

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.520 
now obviously I'm gonna play the three
up<00:02:05.980> top<00:02:06.310> and<00:02:06.610> again<00:02:07.240> I<00:02:07.600> prefer<00:02:07.810> it<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.200> be<00:02:08.380> that

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
up top and again I prefer it to be that

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.230 
up top and again I prefer it to be that
way<00:02:08.590> around<00:02:08.860> as<00:02:09.250> opposed<00:02:09.610> to<00:02:11.850> that<00:02:12.850> way<00:02:13.090> around

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
way around as opposed to that way around

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.890 
way around as opposed to that way around
which<00:02:13.570> is<00:02:13.600> sort<00:02:14.110> of<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.380> same<00:02:14.620> but<00:02:14.680> I<00:02:15.130> prefer

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
which is sort of the same but I prefer

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.000 
which is sort of the same but I prefer
my<00:02:16.900> wing<00:02:17.110> there's<00:02:17.320> a<00:02:17.380> little<00:02:17.620> bit<00:02:17.740> further

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
my wing there's a little bit further

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.060 
my wing there's a little bit further
back<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.730> little<00:02:19.540> bit<00:02:19.660> deeper<00:02:19.960> so<00:02:20.740> you<00:02:20.770> can

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
back a little bit deeper so you can

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.470 
back a little bit deeper so you can
collect<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.550> ball<00:02:21.760> and<00:02:21.970> run<00:02:22.150> with<00:02:22.180> it

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
collect the ball and run with it

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.620 
collect the ball and run with it
okay<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.770> those<00:02:23.950> plays<00:02:24.280> are<00:02:24.580> Messi<00:02:25.330> and

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
okay and those plays are Messi and

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.110 
okay and those plays are Messi and
Neymar<00:02:26.640> Messi<00:02:28.560> can<00:02:29.560> play<00:02:29.740> there<00:02:29.980> although<00:02:30.460> it

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
Neymar Messi can play there although it

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.090 
Neymar Messi can play there although it
really<00:02:31.210> doesn't<00:02:31.630> matter<00:02:31.750> what<00:02:32.410> I<00:02:32.470> tend<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:32.950> do

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
really doesn't matter what I tend to do

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
and then Messi for the second half okay

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.360

Messi will cut inside and will run from

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.890 
Messi will cut inside and will run from
that<00:02:42.550> position<00:02:42.820> so<00:02:43.240> it<00:02:43.330> really<00:02:43.570> doesn't<00:02:43.810> make

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
that position so it really doesn't make

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.170 
that position so it really doesn't make
too<00:02:44.200> much<00:02:44.230> difference<00:02:44.440> Suarez<00:02:45.340> is<00:02:45.520> better<00:02:45.760> in

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
too much difference Suarez is better in

attack job we can get forward

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.760 
attack job we can get forward
Iniesta<00:04:11.560> can<00:04:12.100> get<00:04:12.280> forward<00:04:12.790> however<00:04:13.360> I<00:04:13.960> don't

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:14.770 
Iniesta can get forward however I don't

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.729 
Iniesta can get forward however I don't
really<00:04:14.950> have<00:04:15.130> them<00:04:15.340> set<00:04:15.700> to<00:04:15.910> always<00:04:16.840> overlap<00:04:17.380> I

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
really have them set to always overlap I

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:19.620 
really have them set to always overlap I
think<00:04:18.160> we<00:04:18.280> do<00:04:18.459> it<00:04:18.580> enough<00:04:18.820> anyway<00:04:19.209> so<00:04:19.269> I<00:04:19.420> just

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
think we do it enough anyway so I just

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:24.750 
think we do it enough anyway so I just

00:05:04.509 --> 00:05:04.519 
a mouth crossing is they don't really

guys I don't really mess with this much
pressure<00:05:10.029> you<00:05:11.029> could<00:05:11.179> probably<00:05:11.509> set<00:05:11.989> that

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 
pressure you could probably set that

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:17.999 
pressure you could probably set that
back<00:05:12.469> to<00:05:12.739> about<00:05:12.949> 50<00:05:13.549> for<00:05:14.019> aggression<00:05:15.019> again<00:05:15.969> 58

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
back to about 50 for aggression again 58

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:20.799 
back to about 50 for aggression again 58
it<00:05:19.009> really<00:05:19.279> depends<00:05:19.699> on<00:05:19.759> how<00:05:20.029> you<00:05:20.059> play<00:05:20.269> if<00:05:20.569> you

00:05:20.799 --> 00:05:20.809 
it really depends on how you play if you

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:22.839 
it really depends on how you play if you
want<00:05:21.019> to<00:05:21.079> repress<00:05:21.499> with<00:05:21.739> the<00:05:21.860> ball<00:05:22.069> if<00:05:22.759> you

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
want to repress with the ball if you

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:24.339 
want to repress with the ball if you
want<00:05:22.999> to<00:05:23.059> press<00:05:23.299> without<00:05:23.539> the<00:05:23.839> ball<00:05:23.989> should<00:05:24.229> I

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349 
want to press without the ball should I

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:26.559 
want to press without the ball should I
say<00:05:24.559> then<00:05:25.009> you<00:05:25.129> want<00:05:25.309> these<00:05:25.489> high<00:05:25.699> if<00:05:26.179> you<00:05:26.239> want

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:26.569 
say then you want these high if you want

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:29.609 
say then you want these high if you want
to<00:05:26.629> sit<00:05:26.839> back<00:05:26.869> and<00:05:27.529> absorb<00:05:28.009> the<00:05:28.159> pressure<00:05:28.399> and

00:05:29.609 --> 00:05:29.619 
to sit back and absorb the pressure and

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:32.559 
to sit back and absorb the pressure and
try<00:05:30.619> and<00:05:30.889> second-guess<00:05:31.729> your<00:05:31.909> opponent<00:05:32.449> and

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:32.569 
try and second-guess your opponent and

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:35.109 
try and second-guess your opponent and
just<00:05:33.019> step<00:05:33.289> back<00:05:33.499> off<00:05:33.769> the<00:05:33.919> ball<00:05:34.159> and<00:05:34.639> let<00:05:34.969> your

00:05:35.109 --> 00:05:35.119 
just step back off the ball and let your

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:36.759 
just step back off the ball and let your
opponent<00:05:35.209> come<00:05:35.719> to<00:05:35.899> you<00:05:36.049> then<00:05:36.229> you<00:05:36.379> want<00:05:36.589> these

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:36.769 
opponent come to you then you want these

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:40.449 
opponent come to you then you want these
lower<00:05:37.959> low<00:05:38.959> stat<00:05:39.709> than<00:05:40.039> what<00:05:40.159> we<00:05:40.249> currently

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:40.459 
lower low stat than what we currently

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:42.369 
lower low stat than what we currently
are<00:05:40.849> like<00:05:41.269> I<00:05:41.299> say<00:05:41.449> the<00:05:41.569> higher<00:05:41.779> they<00:05:41.989> are<00:05:42.019> the

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:42.379 
are like I say the higher they are the

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:43.869 
are like I say the higher they are the
further<00:05:42.679> up<00:05:42.769> the<00:05:42.979> pitch<00:05:43.189> they<00:05:43.459> will<00:05:43.669> defend

00:05:43.869 --> 00:05:43.879 
further up the pitch they will defend

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:46.359 
further up the pitch they will defend
and<00:05:44.359> the<00:05:44.989> same<00:05:45.229> goes<00:05:45.409> for<00:05:45.439> aggression<00:05:45.919> I<00:05:46.189> would

00:05:46.359 --> 00:05:46.369 
and the same goes for aggression I would

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:52.269 
and the same goes for aggression I would
have<00:05:46.549> that<00:05:46.729> on<00:05:46.879> about<00:05:47.179> 56<00:05:48.019> though<00:05:48.729> 60<00:05:50.229> 62<00:05:51.279> teen

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:52.279 
have that on about 56 though 60 62 teen

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:54.970 
have that on about 56 though 60 62 teen
with<00:05:52.489> 65<00:05:53.149> yes<00:05:53.419> about<00:05:53.749> Ray

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:54.980 
with 65 yes about Ray

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:58.090 
with 65 yes about Ray
yeah<00:05:55.460> 61<00:05:56.030> 56<00:05:56.900> so<00:05:57.020> I'd<00:05:57.260> probably<00:05:57.470> go<00:05:57.680> with<00:05:57.710> about

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 
yeah 61 56 so I'd probably go with about

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:01.600 
yeah 61 56 so I'd probably go with about
how<00:05:58.550> about<00:05:58.940> guys<00:05:59.210> and<00:05:59.450> your<00:05:59.570> tactics<00:06:00.610> and

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
how about guys and your tactics and

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.810 
how about guys and your tactics and
that's<00:06:01.850> pretty<00:06:02.420> much<00:06:02.660> it<00:06:02.930> I<00:06:03.410> think<00:06:03.710> I<00:06:04.040> covered

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
that's pretty much it I think I covered

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.340 
that's pretty much it I think I covered
a<00:06:04.850> fitness<00:06:05.120> it<00:06:05.240> was<00:06:05.330> just<00:06:05.480> a<00:06:05.570> quick<00:06:05.750> video<00:06:05.930> in

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
a fitness it was just a quick video in

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.680 
a fitness it was just a quick video in
the<00:06:07.070> hope<00:06:07.370> of<00:06:07.580> getting<00:06:07.820> this<00:06:08.000> out<00:06:08.210> there<00:06:08.480> for

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
the hope of getting this out there for

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:10.840 
the hope of getting this out there for
you<00:06:08.840> to<00:06:09.050> use<00:06:09.350> and<00:06:09.560> try<00:06:09.680> and<00:06:10.160> give<00:06:10.520> me<00:06:10.670> some

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:10.850 
you to use and try and give me some

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.550 
you to use and try and give me some
feedback<00:06:11.060> on<00:06:11.330> let<00:06:11.690> me<00:06:11.810> know<00:06:11.930> what<00:06:12.140> you<00:06:12.260> think

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
feedback on let me know what you think

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.280 
feedback on let me know what you think
let<00:06:13.040> me<00:06:13.100> know<00:06:13.190> how<00:06:13.610> it<00:06:13.970> works<00:06:14.240> these<00:06:14.990> little

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:15.290 
let me know how it works these little

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.450 
let me know how it works these little
changes<00:06:15.620> you<00:06:15.710> don't<00:06:15.830> want<00:06:15.950> to<00:06:16.010> change<00:06:16.160> too

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
changes you don't want to change too

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.370 
changes you don't want to change too
much<00:06:16.760> but<00:06:17.060> I<00:06:17.120> do<00:06:17.180> think<00:06:17.480> these<00:06:17.660> little<00:06:17.960> changes

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:18.380 
much but I do think these little changes

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.830 
much but I do think these little changes
make<00:06:19.010> a<00:06:19.040> lot<00:06:19.310> of<00:06:19.340> difference<00:06:19.850> and<00:06:20.120> hopefully

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:20.840 
make a lot of difference and hopefully

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.060 
make a lot of difference and hopefully
I'll<00:06:20.930> have<00:06:21.080> you<00:06:21.290> winning<00:06:21.590> games<00:06:21.860> I've

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
I'll have you winning games I've
