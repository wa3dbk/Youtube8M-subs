encountered now the problem with

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.580 
encountered now the problem with
resonance<00:00:57.820> is<00:00:58.090> that<00:00:58.420> it<00:00:58.630> really<00:00:58.780> imparts<00:00:59.470> a

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
resonance is that it really imparts a

resonance is that it really imparts a
character<00:01:00.250> to<00:01:00.880> the<00:01:01.000> speaker<00:01:01.480> which<00:01:01.930> obviously

character to the speaker which obviously

character to the speaker which obviously
then<00:01:02.650> is<00:01:02.830> not<00:01:03.010> consistent<00:01:03.430> with<00:01:03.730> our<00:01:03.850> aim<00:01:04.150> of

then is not consistent with our aim of

to optimize the mechanical design and

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.680 
to optimize the mechanical design and
we've<00:01:27.370> improved<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.909> breakup<00:01:28.240> frequency

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
we've improved the breakup frequency

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.230 
we've improved the breakup frequency
from<00:01:28.840> about<00:01:29.020> 23<00:01:29.470> kilohertz<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:30.250> 30<00:01:30.760> kilohertz

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
from about 23 kilohertz to 30 kilohertz

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.110 
from about 23 kilohertz to 30 kilohertz
as<00:01:31.870> in<00:01:32.260> the<00:01:32.440> 800<00:01:32.920> series<00:01:33.159> -<00:01:35.550> we<00:01:36.550> found<00:01:36.820> that

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
as in the 800 series - we found that

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.820 
as in the 800 series - we found that
with<00:01:37.300> each<00:01:37.570> improvement<00:01:38.350> in<00:01:38.409> breakup

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
with each improvement in breakup

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.280 
with each improvement in breakup
frequency<00:01:39.430> the<00:01:40.210> resulting<00:01:40.630> tweeter<00:01:40.900> sounded

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
frequency the resulting tweeter sounded

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.260 
frequency the resulting tweeter sounded
much<00:01:41.440> cleaner<00:01:41.860> now<00:01:42.159> we<00:01:42.640> found<00:01:42.909> it's<00:01:43.030> really

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
much cleaner now we found it's really

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.820 
much cleaner now we found it's really
curious<00:01:43.630> because<00:01:43.870> I've<00:01:43.960> already<00:01:44.260> said<00:01:44.530> you

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
curious because I've already said you

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.860 
curious because I've already said you
can<00:01:44.979> only<00:01:45.070> really<00:01:45.340> hear<00:01:45.790> up<00:01:46.120> to<00:01:46.299> 20<00:01:46.630> kilohertz

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
can only really hear up to 20 kilohertz

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.770 
can only really hear up to 20 kilohertz
what<00:01:47.710> what<00:01:48.220> difference<00:01:48.580> does<00:01:48.729> it<00:01:48.790> make<00:01:49.090> if<00:01:49.330> you

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
what what difference does it make if you

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.780 
what what difference does it make if you
improve<00:01:50.110> a<00:01:50.260> breakup<00:01:50.650> frequency<00:01:51.100> from<00:01:51.220> 23<00:01:51.760> to

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
improve a breakup frequency from 23 to

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.469 
improve a breakup frequency from 23 to
30<00:01:52.150> kilohertz<00:01:52.659> so<00:01:53.590> we<00:01:53.710> started<00:01:54.100> to<00:01:54.250> wonder<00:01:54.880> why

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
30 kilohertz so we started to wonder why

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.530 
30 kilohertz so we started to wonder why
this<00:01:55.540> was<00:01:56.010> and<00:01:57.010> really<00:01:57.340> about<00:01:58.000> ways<00:01:58.240> that<00:01:58.450> we

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
this was and really about ways that we

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.120 
this was and really about ways that we
could<00:01:58.659> improve<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:59.110> breakup<00:01:59.590> frequency<00:01:59.979> much

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
could improve the breakup frequency much

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.640 
could improve the breakup frequency much
further<00:02:00.430> so<00:02:01.390> we<00:02:01.630> started<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.200> look<00:02:02.380> at

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:02.650 
further so we started to look at

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:04.320 
further so we started to look at
alternative<00:02:03.250> materials<00:02:03.760> that<00:02:03.909> we<00:02:04.000> could<00:02:04.150> use

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
alternative materials that we could use

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.120 
alternative materials that we could use
instead<00:02:04.510> of<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:04.840> aluminium<00:02:04.960> and<00:02:05.560> it's<00:02:05.920> quite

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
instead of the aluminium and it's quite

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.890 
instead of the aluminium and it's quite
a<00:02:06.159> few<00:02:06.430> materials<00:02:06.820> that<00:02:06.880> you<00:02:07.000> could<00:02:07.240> use<00:02:07.570> but

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
a few materials that you could use but

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.410 
a few materials that you could use but

point of view is Diamond by using
Diamond<00:02:16.720> we<00:02:16.870> were<00:02:16.989> able<00:02:17.110> to<00:02:17.260> create<00:02:17.500> a<00:02:17.650> tweeter

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
Diamond we were able to create a tweeter

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.670 
Diamond we were able to create a tweeter
that<00:02:18.490> breaks<00:02:18.790> up<00:02:18.970> at<00:02:19.120> 70<00:02:19.720> kilohertz<00:02:20.110> compared

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
that breaks up at 70 kilohertz compared

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.620 
that breaks up at 70 kilohertz compared
with<00:02:20.770> a<00:02:20.830> value<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.459> 30<00:02:21.700> kilohertz<00:02:22.180> with<00:02:22.450> the

and aluminium domes what this means is

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.530 
and aluminium domes what this means is
that<00:02:26.310> when<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.340> compare<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:28.060> response<00:02:28.420> of

kilohertz<00:02:36.700> so<00:02:37.690> we<00:02:37.990> think<00:02:38.110> there's<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.350> dramatic

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
kilohertz so we think there's a dramatic

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.590 
kilohertz so we think there's a dramatic
improvement<00:02:39.390> there's<00:02:40.390> a<00:02:40.450> dramatic

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
improvement there's a dramatic

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.570 
improvement there's a dramatic
improvement<00:02:41.050> in<00:02:41.530> performance<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:42.070> results
