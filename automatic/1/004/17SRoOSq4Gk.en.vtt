00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.270 
only thing I think that's what it's for
and<00:03:10.099> it'll<00:03:10.730> let<00:03:11.180> your<00:03:11.359> breath<00:03:11.659> out<00:03:11.900> I<00:03:12.440> think<00:03:13.129> if

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
and it'll let your breath out I think if

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.670 
and it'll let your breath out I think if
you<00:03:13.400> kind<00:03:13.579> of<00:03:13.700> backwards<00:03:14.209> like<00:03:14.420> this<00:03:14.480> it'll<00:03:15.379> go

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
you kind of backwards like this it'll go

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.509 
you kind of backwards like this it'll go
