stabilization the zoom work very

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.810 
stabilization the zoom work very
smoothly<00:01:03.359> from<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.840> first<00:01:04.110> day<00:01:04.260> onwards<00:01:04.820> but

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
smoothly from the first day onwards but

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.390 
smoothly from the first day onwards but
unfortunately<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.260> focus<00:01:07.710> does<00:01:07.920> not<00:01:08.130> stay

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
unfortunately the focus does not stay

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.789

when you zoom

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.669 
when you zoom
as<00:01:11.399> you<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:11.789> see<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.359> focused<00:01:12.810> path<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.320> based

00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:13.679 
as you can see the focused path is based

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:16.580 
as you can see the focused path is based
around<00:01:13.829> 30-degree<00:01:14.729> very<00:01:15.179> short<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.409> also

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
around 30-degree very short and it also

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.319 
around 30-degree very short and it also
has<00:01:16.859> basically<00:01:17.310> no<00:01:17.640> friction

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
what makes extra red focusing

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.190 
what makes extra red focusing
challenging<00:01:20.700> but<00:01:21.179> not<00:01:21.420> impossible

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200

little<00:02:10.349> bit<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.060> with<00:02:12.060> F<00:02:12.239> 7.1<00:02:13.230> it's<00:02:13.379> basically

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
little bit and with F 7.1 it's basically

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.520 
little bit and with F 7.1 it's basically
gone<00:02:14.359> even<00:02:15.359> when<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.780> looks<00:02:15.989> like<00:02:16.170> a<00:02:16.230> very

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
gone even when that looks like a very

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.309 
gone even when that looks like a very
horrible<00:02:16.880> result<00:02:17.880> for<00:02:18.209> this<00:02:18.420> lens<00:02:18.690> here<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.290> a

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
horrible result for this lens here is a

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.039 
horrible result for this lens here is a
picture<00:02:19.680> with<00:02:20.220> 17<00:02:21.030> millimeter<00:02:21.420> wide<00:02:21.660> angle

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
picture with 17 millimeter wide angle

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.640 
picture with 17 millimeter wide angle
and<00:02:22.170> F<00:02:22.440> 2.8<00:02:23.340> but<00:02:23.639> you<00:02:24.209> basically<00:02:24.660> see<00:02:25.019> no

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
and F 2.8 but you basically see no

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.770 
and F 2.8 but you basically see no
vignetting<00:02:26.310> or<00:02:26.489> color<00:02:26.760> shift<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.510> that's

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
vignetting or color shift so that's

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.780 
vignetting or color shift so that's
really<00:02:28.079> just<00:02:28.200> visible<00:02:28.950> when<00:02:29.130> you<00:02:29.609> have<00:02:29.760> a

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
really just visible when you have a

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.750 
really just visible when you have a
plain<00:02:30.329> wall<00:02:30.870> with<00:02:31.139> the<00:02:31.290> same<00:02:31.500> color<00:02:31.799> I<00:02:32.100> also

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
plain wall with the same color I also

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.819 
plain wall with the same color I also
decided<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.480> test<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.989> sharpness<00:02:34.200> shortly

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
decided to test the sharpness shortly

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.940 
decided to test the sharpness shortly
this<00:02:35.459> is<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.819> lens<00:02:36.030> was<00:02:36.329> 50<00:02:36.750> millimeter<00:02:37.230> and<00:02:37.530> F

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
this is the lens was 50 millimeter and F

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.410 
this is the lens was 50 millimeter and F
2.8<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.690> still<00:02:39.930> picture<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.819> 100%<00:02:41.819> and

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
2.8 and that still picture in 100% and

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.309 
2.8 and that still picture in 100% and
with<00:02:43.049> 7.1<00:02:44.000> again<00:02:45.000> two<00:02:45.329> point<00:02:45.540> eight<00:02:45.720> seven<00:02:46.109> two

one two point eight seven two one and

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.920 
one two point eight seven two one and
yes<00:02:49.680> you<00:02:49.980> can<00:02:50.190> see<00:02:50.430> at<00:02:50.609> least<00:02:50.639> I<00:02:51.030> can<00:02:51.209> see<00:02:51.420> that

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
yes you can see at least I can see that

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.110 
yes you can see at least I can see that
is<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.410> difference<00:02:52.950> of<00:02:53.099> sharpness<00:02:53.489> but<00:02:53.910> it's

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
is a difference of sharpness but it's

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.650 
is a difference of sharpness but it's
not<00:02:54.329> super<00:02:54.750> big<00:02:54.930> I<00:02:55.230> am<00:02:56.069> now<00:02:56.340> not<00:02:56.609> testing<00:02:57.480> all

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
not super big I am now not testing all

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.780 
not super big I am now not testing all
all<00:02:58.169> the<00:02:58.290> corners<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:58.889> everything<00:02:59.160> because

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
all the corners and everything because

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.720 
all the corners and everything because
like<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.060> said<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.510> am<00:03:00.660> NOT<00:03:01.169> a<00:03:01.200> pixel<00:03:01.709> Biba<00:03:02.069> so<00:03:02.459> far

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
like I said I am NOT a pixel Biba so far

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.580 
like I said I am NOT a pixel Biba so far
I<00:03:02.760> was<00:03:03.030> always<00:03:03.239> satisfied<00:03:03.510> with<00:03:03.930> the

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
I was always satisfied with the

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.039 
I was always satisfied with the
sharpness<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.430> picture<00:03:05.940> now<00:03:06.690> let's<00:03:06.870> have<00:03:06.989> a

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
sharpness of a picture now let's have a

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.680 
sharpness of a picture now let's have a
look<00:03:07.230> on<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.530> optical<00:03:08.010> stabilization<00:03:08.370> I<00:03:09.000> took

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
look on the optical stabilization I took

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:11.629 
look on the optical stabilization I took
five<00:03:10.169> pictures<00:03:10.230> without<00:03:10.980> optical

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
five pictures without optical

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.849 
five pictures without optical
stabilization<00:03:11.970> and<00:03:12.510> five<00:03:12.810> pictures<00:03:13.079> fix<00:03:13.530> this

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
stabilization and five pictures fix this

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.789 
stabilization and five pictures fix this
optical<00:03:14.370> stabilization<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:15.599> focal<00:03:16.290> lens<00:03:16.440> was

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
optical stabilization the focal lens was

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.640 
optical stabilization the focal lens was
50<00:03:17.190> millimeter<00:03:17.669> so<00:03:18.180> on<00:03:18.450> full<00:03:18.840> frame<00:03:19.019> it<00:03:19.380> would

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
50 millimeter so on full frame it would

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.620 
50 millimeter so on full frame it would
be<00:03:19.829> 80<00:03:20.040> millimeters<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.239> shutter<00:03:21.449> speed

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
be 80 millimeters and the shutter speed

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.930 
be 80 millimeters and the shutter speed
was<00:03:21.900> always<00:03:22.380> one<00:03:22.680> tenth<00:03:23.070> of<00:03:23.250> a<00:03:23.370> second

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
was always one tenth of a second

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:24.740 
was always one tenth of a second
you

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
you

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.660 
you
fancy<00:03:25.110> that<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.470> pictures<00:03:25.890> this<00:03:26.370> step

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
fancy that the pictures this step

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.480 
fancy that the pictures this step
optical<00:03:27.270> stabilization<00:03:27.600> are<00:03:28.170> much<00:03:29.010> clearer

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
optical stabilization are much clearer

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.940 
optical stabilization are much clearer
than<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.940> ones<00:03:30.150> without<00:03:30.440> this<00:03:31.440> video<00:03:31.830> is

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
than the ones without this video is

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.030 
than the ones without this video is
taken<00:03:32.280> with<00:03:32.610> 50<00:03:33.060> millimeter<00:03:33.590> without<00:03:34.590> optical

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
taken with 50 millimeter without optical

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.750 
taken with 50 millimeter without optical
stabilization<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:36.800> here<00:03:37.800> is<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:38.100> same<00:03:38.520> video

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
stabilization and here is the same video

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.420 
stabilization and here is the same video
trust<00:03:39.270> this<00:03:39.570> optical<00:03:40.200> stabilization<00:03:40.620> taken

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
trust this optical stabilization taken

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.750 
trust this optical stabilization taken
and<00:03:42.290> you<00:03:43.290> can<00:03:43.440> see<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.890> there's<00:03:44.130> much<00:03:44.459> less

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
and you can see that there's much less

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.900 
and you can see that there's much less
shaking<00:03:45.709> coming<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:47.010> conclusion<00:03:47.250> The

shaking coming to the conclusion The
Adventures<00:03:48.570> of<00:03:48.600> this<00:03:49.110> lens<00:03:49.500> are<00:03:49.800> that<00:03:50.370> it<00:03:50.520> has

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
Adventures of this lens are that it has

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.330 
Adventures of this lens are that it has
a<00:03:50.730> constant<00:03:51.209> a<00:03:51.330> patch<00:03:51.570> of<00:03:51.600> F<00:03:52.050> 2.8<00:03:52.770> is<00:03:53.010> simply

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
a constant a patch of F 2.8 is simply

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.600 
a constant a patch of F 2.8 is simply
amazing<00:03:54.200> also<00:03:55.200> it<00:03:55.350> is<00:03:55.500> very<00:03:55.800> well<00:03:56.040> built<00:03:56.250> it

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
amazing also it is very well built it

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.810 
amazing also it is very well built it
includes<00:03:57.480> a<00:03:57.660> back<00:03:58.050> end<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.560> hood<00:03:58.770> the<00:03:59.340> picture

includes a back end the hood the picture

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.060 
includes a back end the hood the picture
quality<00:04:00.300> is<00:04:00.480> very<00:04:00.510> good<00:04:00.900> also<00:04:01.380> the

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
quality is very good also the

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.310 
quality is very good also the
stabilization<00:04:02.820> is<00:04:03.000> good<00:04:03.270> and<00:04:03.480> compared<00:04:04.260> to

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
stabilization is good and compared to

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.180 
stabilization is good and compared to
other<00:04:04.410> lenses<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.610> price<00:04:05.910> is<00:04:06.180> great<00:04:06.420> I

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
other lenses the price is great I

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.949 
other lenses the price is great I
actually<00:04:08.190> just<00:04:08.670> have<00:04:08.910> one<00:04:09.180> disadvantage

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
actually just have one disadvantage

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.840 
actually just have one disadvantage
which<00:04:10.260> is<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.620> focus<00:04:11.010> ring<00:04:11.220> with<00:04:11.489> all<00:04:11.670> its

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
which is the focus ring with all its

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.570 
which is the focus ring with all its
setbacks<00:04:12.090> which<00:04:12.989> I<00:04:13.140> explained<00:04:13.680> in<00:04:13.950> my<00:04:14.010> video

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
setbacks which I explained in my video

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.500
