00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
actually in drop be tuning if you played

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.079 
actually in drop be tuning if you played
it<00:00:12.690> in<00:00:12.840> drop<00:00:13.200> D<00:00:13.230> it's<00:00:13.860> pretty<00:00:14.460> much<00:00:14.610> drop<00:00:14.880> D

another thing about drop B tuning is you
really<00:00:36.719> need<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.960> be<00:00:37.079> playing<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.590> with

really need to be playing this with

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.119 
really need to be playing this with
heavier<00:00:38.190> gauge<00:00:38.370> strings<00:00:39.860> probably<00:00:40.860> 13<00:00:42.920> now<00:00:43.920> I

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
heavier gauge strings probably 13 now I

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.010 
heavier gauge strings probably 13 now I
am<00:00:44.399> playing<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.850> with<00:00:45.030> my<00:00:45.300> standard<00:00:45.629> strings

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
am playing this with my standard strings

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.440 
am playing this with my standard strings
that<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.170> use<00:00:46.440> which<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.890> believe<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:47.940> this<00:00:48.210> I

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
that I use which I believe on this I

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.150 
that I use which I believe on this I
have<00:00:48.480> GHS<00:00:49.289> boomers<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.690> are<00:00:51.690> 10<00:00:52.050> gauge<00:00:52.320> so<00:00:53.039> if

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
have GHS boomers that are 10 gauge so if

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160 
have GHS boomers that are 10 gauge so if
I'm<00:00:53.280> really<00:00:53.610> playing<00:00:53.969> with<00:00:54.480> water<00:00:54.690> gauges

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
I'm really playing with water gauges

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.020 
I'm really playing with water gauges
that<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.350> should<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.340> not<00:00:56.579> going<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.879> sound

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
that I should so it's not going to sound

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.790 
that I should so it's not going to sound
proper<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.020> will<00:00:58.140> kind<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.410> give<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.680> when<00:00:58.770> I

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
proper it will kind of give it when I

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.910 
proper it will kind of give it when I
play<00:00:59.070> with<00:00:59.100> distortion<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.410> play<00:01:01.590> single

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
play with distortion and you play single

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.619 
play with distortion and you play single
notes<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.250> will<00:01:02.340> give<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.640> slight<00:01:03.000> nasally

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
notes it will give it a slight nasally

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.539 
notes it will give it a slight nasally
at<00:01:03.690> home<00:01:04.339> you<00:01:05.339> can't<00:01:05.549> blow<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.030> drop<00:01:06.180> D

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
at home you can't blow this and drop D

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.219 
at home you can't blow this and drop D
fingerings<00:01:08.549> all<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> same<00:01:09.119> it's<00:01:09.600> just<00:01:09.810> not

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
fingerings all the same it's just not

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.890 
fingerings all the same it's just not
going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.470> sound<00:01:10.680> like<00:01:11.040> you're<00:01:11.280> playing<00:01:11.460> it

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
going to sound like you're playing it

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.149 
going to sound like you're playing it
just<00:01:12.900> going<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.080> be<00:01:13.140> playing<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.619> little<00:01:13.950> bit

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
just going to be playing a little bit

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.190 
just going to be playing a little bit
higher<00:01:14.340> than<00:01:14.549> what<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.850> should

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
higher than what it should

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.810 
higher than what it should
so<00:01:17.200> let's<00:01:17.530> go<00:01:17.680> ahead<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:17.980> jump<00:01:18.160> into<00:01:18.460> the<00:01:18.610> song

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
so let's go ahead and jump into the song

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.650 
so let's go ahead and jump into the song
and<00:01:19.120> start<00:01:19.960> learning<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.470> first<00:01:20.860> verse<00:01:21.660> now

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
and start learning the first verse now

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:24.300 
and start learning the first verse now
as<00:01:22.780> always<00:01:22.960> whenever<00:01:23.290> we<00:01:23.440> practice<00:01:23.800> songs<00:01:24.010> we

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
as always whenever we practice songs we

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.800 
as always whenever we practice songs we
need<00:01:24.460> to<00:01:24.550> practice<00:01:24.910> them<00:01:25.030> on<00:01:25.120> a<00:01:25.150> clean<00:01:25.360> Channel

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
need to practice them on a clean Channel

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.200 
need to practice them on a clean Channel
first<00:01:25.990> before<00:01:26.229> it<00:01:26.440> you<00:01:26.860> use<00:01:27.040> any<00:01:27.250> distortion<00:01:27.820> I

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
first before it you use any distortion I

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.880 
first before it you use any distortion I
am<00:01:28.690> going<00:01:28.870> to<00:01:28.930> play<00:01:29.080> this<00:01:29.200> song<00:01:29.380> distorted

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
am going to play this song distorted

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.370 
am going to play this song distorted
right<00:01:30.040> now<00:01:30.479> so<00:01:31.479> you<00:01:31.570> can<00:01:31.720> hear<00:01:31.869> the<00:01:31.990> reference

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
right now so you can hear the reference

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.650 
right now so you can hear the reference
it<00:01:32.560> carried<00:01:33.190> in<00:01:33.310> reference<00:01:33.700> to<00:01:33.760> the<00:01:33.910> song<00:01:34.119> then

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
it carried in reference to the song then

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.790 
it carried in reference to the song then
we'll<00:01:34.780> go<00:01:34.900> ahead<00:01:34.990> and<00:01:35.080> we'll<00:01:35.229> jump<00:01:35.440> into<00:01:35.590> the

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
we'll go ahead and we'll jump into the

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.830 
we'll go ahead and we'll jump into the
plane<00:01:35.979> channel<00:01:36.340> so<00:01:36.910> this<00:01:37.300> is<00:01:37.420> what<00:01:37.570> it<00:01:37.660> sounds

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
plane channel so this is what it sounds

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:56.709 
plane channel so this is what it sounds
like<00:01:37.869> distorted

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.090 

so<00:01:57.719> let's<00:01:58.049> go<00:01:58.170> ahead<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.439> jump<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.799> our<00:01:58.829> clean

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
so let's go ahead and jump to our clean

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.889 
so let's go ahead and jump to our clean
channel<00:01:59.490> now<00:02:00.179> one<00:02:00.450> thing<00:02:00.539> that<00:02:00.600> you're<00:02:00.780> going

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
channel now one thing that you're going

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.859 
channel now one thing that you're going
to<00:02:00.929> notice<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> slight<00:02:02.490> little

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
to notice is that is a slight little

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.080 
to notice is that is a slight little
rhythmic<00:02:03.869> pattern<00:02:04.319> here<00:02:04.880> regards<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.969> what

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
rhythmic pattern here regards to what

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.630 
rhythmic pattern here regards to what
the<00:02:06.240> plan<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.569> the<00:02:06.659> notes<00:02:06.840> which<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.920> typically

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
the plan of the notes which is typically

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.490 
the plan of the notes which is typically
like<00:02:08.970> we'll<00:02:09.179> start<00:02:09.450> with<00:02:09.599> very<00:02:09.810> begin<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
like we'll start with very begin the

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.350 
like we'll start with very begin the
first<00:02:10.830> two<00:02:11.009> sets<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.340> notes<00:02:11.519> which<00:02:12.060> is<00:02:12.150> gonna

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
first two sets of notes which is gonna

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.970 
first two sets of notes which is gonna
be<00:02:12.480> well<00:02:18.170> then<00:02:19.170> you're<00:02:19.290> gonna<00:02:19.410> notice<00:02:19.650> that

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
be well then you're gonna notice that

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.160 
be well then you're gonna notice that
after<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.640> do<00:02:20.879> your<00:02:21.060> 12<00:02:21.360> open<00:02:21.660> you're<00:02:22.080> going

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
after you do your 12 open you're going

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.259 
after you do your 12 open you're going
to<00:02:22.290> go<00:02:22.379> from<00:02:22.709> 12<00:02:23.010> to<00:02:23.220> your<00:02:23.340> next<00:02:23.640> step<00:02:23.790> this

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
to go from 12 to your next step this

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:32.900 
to go from 12 to your next step this
case<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.720> 15<00:02:25.170> followed<00:02:25.980> by<00:02:29.239> no<00:02:30.239> no<00:02:31.190> no<00:02:32.190> jump<00:02:32.760> to

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
case is 15 followed by no no no jump to

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.319 
case is 15 followed by no no no jump to
next<00:02:33.030> note<00:02:33.500> no<00:02:34.500> open<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.670> that's<00:02:35.819> kind<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.180> how

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
next note no open and that's kind of how

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.240 
next note no open and that's kind of how
the<00:02:36.390> whole<00:02:36.660> rhythms<00:02:37.110> going<00:02:37.349> here<00:02:37.650> so<00:02:37.950> I<00:02:38.069> don't

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
the whole rhythms going here so I don't

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.110 
the whole rhythms going here so I don't
know<00:02:38.340> if<00:02:38.400> that's<00:02:38.549> gonna<00:02:38.640> help<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.940> out<00:02:38.970> but

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
know if that's gonna help you out but

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.020 
know if that's gonna help you out but
kind<00:02:39.840> of<00:02:39.900> grasp<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:41.010> concept<00:02:41.579> here<00:02:41.730> I<00:02:41.790> think

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
kind of grasp the concept here I think

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.300 
kind of grasp the concept here I think
it<00:02:42.120> makes<00:02:42.299> it<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.480> little<00:02:42.569> bit<00:02:42.750> easier<00:02:43.140> also<00:02:43.650> all

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
it makes it a little bit easier also all

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.420 
it makes it a little bit easier also all
these<00:02:44.519> notes<00:02:44.790> are<00:02:45.030> picked<00:02:46.129> there's<00:02:47.129> a<00:02:47.190> lot<00:02:47.370> of

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
these notes are picked there's a lot of

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.160 
these notes are picked there's a lot of
people<00:02:47.670> including<00:02:48.329> myself<00:02:48.599> when<00:02:48.870> I<00:02:48.930> was<00:02:48.959> first

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
people including myself when I was first

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.479 
people including myself when I was first
learned<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.920> thought<00:02:50.129> that<00:02:50.310> there<00:02:50.400> was

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
learned this I thought that there was

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.640 
learned this I thought that there was
gonna<00:02:50.610> be<00:02:50.819> in<00:02:50.970> kind<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.390> hammer-on<00:02:52.110> pull-off

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
gonna be in kind of a hammer-on pull-off

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.170 
gonna be in kind of a hammer-on pull-off
effect<00:02:52.980> what<00:02:53.250> they<00:02:55.489> that's<00:02:56.489> not<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.849> case<00:02:57.000> in

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
effect what they that's not the case in

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.349 
effect what they that's not the case in
this<00:02:57.329> song<00:02:58.790> handed<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.850> hammer-ons<00:03:00.239> and

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
this song handed a hammer-ons and

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.090 
this song handed a hammer-ons and
pull-offs<00:03:00.450> not<00:03:01.290> many<00:03:01.470> people<00:03:01.769> are<00:03:01.889> going<00:03:01.980> to

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
pull-offs not many people are going to

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.650 
pull-offs not many people are going to
catch<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.519> side<00:03:02.760> little<00:03:03.000> slurs<00:03:03.239> in<00:03:03.510> there

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
catch the side little slurs in there

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.879 
catch the side little slurs in there
it's<00:03:03.840> not<00:03:04.019> really<00:03:04.230> going<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.410> affect<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.709> song

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:04.889 
it's not really going to affect the song

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:06.170 
it's not really going to affect the song
I<00:03:05.069> actually<00:03:05.250> think<00:03:05.459> it<00:03:05.609> actually<00:03:05.730> sounds<00:03:06.120> a

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
I actually think it actually sounds a

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.620 
I actually think it actually sounds a
little<00:03:06.299> bit<00:03:06.480> better<00:03:06.630> personally<00:03:08.269> but<00:03:09.269> if<00:03:09.540> you

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
little bit better personally but if you

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.360 
little bit better personally but if you
want<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.870> just<00:03:10.049> completely<00:03:10.680> play<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.099> straight

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
want to just completely play it straight

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.330 
want to just completely play it straight
up<00:03:11.549> just<00:03:11.579> like<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:11.970> song<00:03:12.920> so<00:03:13.920> let's<00:03:14.160> go<00:03:14.250> ahead

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
up just like a song so let's go ahead

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:45.590 
up just like a song so let's go ahead
and<00:03:14.549> jump<00:03:14.730> in<00:03:14.940> and

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.050 

and<00:03:46.600> so<00:03:47.470> you<00:03:47.530> do<00:03:47.710> this<00:03:47.830> whole<00:03:48.040> rhythm<00:03:48.370> and

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
and so you do this whole rhythm and

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.830 
and so you do this whole rhythm and
pattern<00:03:49.620> four<00:03:50.620> times<00:03:50.920> so<00:03:51.730> let's<00:03:52.450> go<00:03:52.600> ahead<00:03:52.690> and

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
pattern four times so let's go ahead and

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:10.110 
pattern four times so let's go ahead and
just<00:03:53.020> buy<00:03:53.170> that<00:03:53.320> four<00:03:53.530> times<00:03:53.770> slow

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.490 

this<00:04:11.120> one<00:04:11.510> fingers<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.020> maybe<00:04:12.170> you<00:04:12.260> can<00:04:12.380> see

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
this one fingers and maybe you can see

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:35.980 
this one fingers and maybe you can see
what<00:04:12.620> I'm<00:04:12.710> doing

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.529 

and<00:04:36.990> that<00:04:37.499> is<00:04:37.740> it<00:04:38.069> for<00:04:38.219> the<00:04:38.310> main<00:04:38.550> riff<00:04:38.819> you're

skipping<00:04:57.810> your<00:04:57.930> low<00:04:58.379> beam<00:04:58.620> go<00:04:58.830> to<00:04:59.069> a<00:04:59.279> string

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
skipping your low beam go to a string

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.869 
skipping your low beam go to a string
it's<00:04:59.789> fly<00:05:00.650> and<00:05:01.650> you're<00:05:02.249> just<00:05:02.430> going<00:05:02.610> to<00:05:02.639> park

00:05:02.869 --> 00:05:02.879 
it's fly and you're just going to park

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:06.529 
it's fly and you're just going to park
there<00:05:03.409> and<00:05:04.409> you're<00:05:04.529> gonna<00:05:04.620> go<00:05:05.120> five<00:05:06.120> on<00:05:06.389> your

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
there and you're gonna go five on your

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:21.170 
there and you're gonna go five on your
name<00:05:06.719> a<00:05:07.050> string<00:05:10.669> on<00:05:11.669> your<00:05:11.789> a<00:05:11.939> string<00:05:18.650> so<00:05:20.180> you're

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
name a string on your a string so you're

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.110 
name a string on your a string so you're
gonna<00:05:21.270> start<00:05:21.569> with<00:05:21.629> your<00:05:21.750> five<00:05:22.759> end<00:05:23.759> with<00:05:23.939> it

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
gonna start with your five end with it

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.469 
gonna start with your five end with it
and<00:05:24.629> you're<00:05:24.779> pretty<00:05:24.900> much<00:05:25.080> gonna<00:05:25.289> play<00:05:26.479> on

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
and you're pretty much gonna play on

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:33.260 
and you're pretty much gonna play on
your<00:05:27.930> D<00:05:30.919> and<00:05:31.919> so<00:05:32.279> it's<00:05:32.520> not<00:05:32.610> a<00:05:32.669> hard<00:05:32.819> pattern<00:05:33.180> to

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
your D and so it's not a hard pattern to

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.700 
your D and so it's not a hard pattern to
learn<00:05:33.419> because<00:05:33.719> it's<00:05:33.930> at<00:05:34.050> every<00:05:34.349> other<00:05:34.439> note

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
learn because it's at every other note

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.029 
learn because it's at every other note
it's<00:05:34.860> gonna<00:05:35.009> be<00:05:35.159> that<00:05:35.389> your<00:05:36.389> Dino<00:05:37.110> or<00:05:37.499> your<00:05:37.800> fin

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039
