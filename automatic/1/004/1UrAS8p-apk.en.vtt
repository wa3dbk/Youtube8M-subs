00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.210
 achievement Kvyat at the Hungarian Grand Prix 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.160
 construction historical i hope that 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.920
 it is historical only for the moment 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.269
 and then there will be the podium and win well, 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.269
 we will not look very far 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.270
 almost a week has passed since then 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.859
 emotions are the same i think emotions are all 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.289
 the same because the sores are very long 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.600
 waited since there was a failure of which 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.309
 waited and after that this one 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.170
 unexpected rise then it could be 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.090
 even more important first podium than 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.220
 weston was in the first race the car was 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:46.750
 would be at the level of the fight for the title and so on 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:48.460
 now couleur has become steeper petrov or 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.500
 me in cats because metal and 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.719
 remains the discoverer of it 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.910
 an achievement that will really go down 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.579
 in history to below only in the process 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:00.219
 Now his career and I'll be there 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.829
 yourself start there whale or elephant 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:04.869
 you ask me and klyaty Petrov 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.149
 these are two different people two beautiful 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.249
 man two good riders my two 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:14.619
 friend so each one is valuable 

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:15.810
 proverbs for the pilot red bull for season 1 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.399
 2 places a little 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.920
 such a formulation of course can be 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.569
 little but if a little more 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.819
 understand except to look at 

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:25.659
 finish table and realize that red bull 

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:28.270
 this year 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:31.630
 To put it mildly, not long ago, this is already a lot 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:35.310
 it all depends on the specific ratio 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.310
 forces specific season 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.079
 you expect an answer this season yet 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:45.070
 catwalk 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:52.240
 can singapore but not know very difficult 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:54.399
 here they add or not are you ready 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.969
 now draw parallels between the first 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:02:01.500
 seasons in the genus at Vettel and creator deal 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:04.390
 is that when pedel came in red bull 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.810
 the team was originally on 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.209
 the ascending stage now the team was on 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.230
 downward stage when came there quat 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.510
 and 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:20.970
 he is harder than he was now 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:23.590
 sebastian who has talent with what i liked 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.780
 often ask who is more talented than Schumacher 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.420
 or valuable before asking who 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:34.450
 talented in a bank or schumacher and so 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:36.370
 further who greater whale or elephant if 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.620
 this season period is not spent in red 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.480
 bull in the other team what would 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.400
 result 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.700
 clear to you was carried out on Mercedes then 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.290
 victory has already been 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.260
 if he was mercedes i'm sure that 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.109
 a thief would be now for the title with the same 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.069
 fireplace tone and immediately berg and i'm sure 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:59.049
 that he would ride at 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:01.870
 she's at their level early July you dreamed 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.920
 oh most i like to see victory 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.810
 Daniel Kvyat 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.099
 if this is not possible I would like to see 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.200
 Daniil Kvyat's podium 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.819
 if it is impossible i would like that he 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.530
 regularly scored points every time 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.980
 qualified ahead the river valley and then 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.620
 if it were, would be cool podium and maybe 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.900
 and the victory was well pulled not mushrooms and 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.900
 to Alexey priests finally shaved 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:31.329
 dreams have come true new given that standing 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.939
 on this place dreams come true then 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.760
 perhaps I want tribute to cells in 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:39.959
 this sonic for victory and i want to 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:44.350
 next year red bull 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:47.320
 mostly i dream to 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:52.450
 qualitatively improved translated 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:55.120
 screenings hit one in Russia and we went to 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.130
 super world level and to us 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.830
 any British were jealous of 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:04.300
 italian but note that i 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.840
 shaved it ordinary trimmer it 10 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.840
 millimeters
