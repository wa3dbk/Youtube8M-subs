00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350
 installed in courteranges the company wood and nature is aptly named 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.250
 davidas crespin companies in 2005 eco-construction hiking for 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.570
 it's an obvious balance the raw state of the tree such convoy seek it 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.800
 enfora he's just peeled off to clean a keyboard of their 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.490
 operations 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.320
 Wednesday you have a house in the rough we are people who want to live 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.589
 in an environment 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:28.069
 go to a house that whoever is closest to nature possible I 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:30.479
 think to be afraid we spend very little energy 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:32.680
 it promises to make 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.420
 so to realize a round house 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.420
 science is saying it enough it's very important 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.860
 in relation to a sustainable development approach 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.250
 david works alone eight months are needed to finalize a 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.880
 dwelling of 100 square meters 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.850
 complementary ecological materials like swell wool 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.320
 room the fact of working at the same allow to propose a building site 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.680
 10 to 50 times less polluting than a conventional construction this economy 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.250
 in energy extends throughout the distance of the house we have a wood that 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.470
 isolated 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.850
 against the cold weather is against the branches heat 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.910
 if you have the heat wave that hit the front of the seat say their 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:12.930
 parents remember the evening 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.100
 heat europe has exceeded half of Rwanda 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.900
 if you have the same thickness with time 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.430
 % to 10 065 times on the facade at 14 years has already passed 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.240
 for that it will have to reproduce your house 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:24.410
 it's not like stock market 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.610
 prayer heating his interior is to have an inertia in 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.850
 walls that are still pretty satisfying for all the wood can 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.260
 not absorb the heat and restore it when you have as heating it's a 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.780
 still considerable advantage 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.970
 in this case you save German heating davide followed by 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.820
 six years of training must master its solution 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.450
 at the Chamber of Agriculture I read to find these wood specialists 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.200
 eco-construction since January 2010 a directory looks like being taken from 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.980
 department handpicked and we checked these companies 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.940
 I have skills and qualifications in their field 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.660
 professional can participate in building sites 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.050
 for him if we do not know why but this woman mirka ride on you 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.330
 can look at the pci-dss at some centers in another register 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.250
 reference in the sleeve several times the course of the edition 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:14.539
 there are still no beautiful remains found at home according to 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:18.959
 an application letter in place it works it's really not subscribed yet 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:19.979
 at the site 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:23.419
 This site also offers training sheets for 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:24.410
 professional 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.380
 objective to propose multiple eco-construction solutions that are not rigorous 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.829
 whether it is fair or false tunes of salsa 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:33.200
 it's here 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.539
 the world m 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:37.539
 the holland 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:43.229
 the origin of the explosion 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.459
 everyone left 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.589
 small 

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:53.699
 even though these savings can cushion the shock or purchase 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.859
 this market is almost modest but I hope to complete the directory with 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.060
 new addresses in 2012 new standards of performance 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.040
 entering into force and should facilitate access to 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.879
 green building
