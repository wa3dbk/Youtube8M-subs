00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.720 
so in our player let's scale the size
down<00:02:01.600> to<00:02:01.840> like<00:02:01.990> 0.3<00:02:03.060> for<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.119> x<00:02:04.329> and<00:02:04.570> y

down to like 0.3 for the x and y

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:08.030 
down to like 0.3 for the x and y
all<00:02:06.720> right<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.200> now<00:02:07.290> we<00:02:07.380> have<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.530> ship<00:02:07.770> that's<00:02:07.890> a

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.020 
let's pull it forward like so so let's
just<00:02:18.390> put<00:02:18.720> Z<00:02:19.080> 2<00:02:19.260> 1<00:02:20.000> so<00:02:21.000> now<00:02:21.120> if<00:02:21.240> we<00:02:21.360> hit<00:02:21.510> play<00:02:21.570> oh

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
just put Z 2 1 so now if we hit play oh

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.730 
just put Z 2 1 so now if we hit play oh
you'll<00:02:24.030> see<00:02:24.210> our<00:02:24.330> ship<00:02:24.450> just<00:02:24.810> fell<00:02:25.050> fell<00:02:25.560> out

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
you'll see our ship just fell fell out

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.780 
you'll see our ship just fell fell out
of<00:02:25.770> nowhere<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.160> that's<00:02:26.310> because<00:02:26.550> we<00:02:26.670> have<00:02:26.700> a

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
of nowhere and that's because we have a

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.570 
of nowhere and that's because we have a
rigidbody<00:02:27.210> attached<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.580> leave

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
rigidbody attached to it leave

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.520 
rigidbody attached to it leave
everything<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.510> same<00:02:30.540> on<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.050> rigid<00:02:31.350> body

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
everything the same on the rigid body

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.090 
everything the same on the rigid body
except<00:02:32.010> for<00:02:32.040> gravity<00:02:32.610> change<00:02:33.270> that<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.690> 0<00:02:34.100> all

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
except for gravity change that to 0 all

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.520 
except for gravity change that to 0 all
right<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:36.690> next<00:02:36.810> thing<00:02:36.960> that<00:02:37.140> we're<00:02:37.260> gonna<00:02:37.320> do

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
right the next thing that we're gonna do

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.140 
right the next thing that we're gonna do
is<00:02:37.710> the<00:02:37.830> on<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.040> box<00:02:38.250> Collider<00:02:38.700> make<00:02:38.970> sure

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
is the on the box Collider make sure

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.510 
is the on the box Collider make sure
it's<00:02:39.330> set<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.720> is<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:40.110> trigger<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:41.100> that's<00:02:41.340> all

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
it's set to is a trigger and that's all

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.820 
it's set to is a trigger and that's all
you<00:02:41.700> have<00:02:41.820> to<00:02:41.940> do<00:02:42.060> for<00:02:42.270> that<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:43.440> next<00:02:43.680> thing

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
we're gonna do is be creating a new

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.350 
we're gonna do is be creating a new
script<00:02:46.920> this<00:02:47.310> is<00:02:47.460> a<00:02:47.490> player<00:02:47.820> script<00:02:48.240> that

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
script this is a player script that

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.480 
script this is a player script that
controls<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:48.960> player<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:50.040> right<00:02:50.280> click

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
controls the player so right click

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.290 
controls the player so right click
create<00:02:51.150> new<00:02:52.070> c-sharp<00:02:53.070> script<00:02:53.490> now<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:53.970> reason

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
create new c-sharp script now the reason

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.810 
create new c-sharp script now the reason
why<00:02:54.420> I'm<00:02:54.570> doing<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:55.140> C<00:02:55.380> C<00:02:56.070> sharp<00:02:56.100> script<00:02:56.640> is

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
why I'm doing a C C sharp script is

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.250 
why I'm doing a C C sharp script is
c-sharp<00:02:57.390> can<00:02:57.720> be<00:02:57.960> used<00:02:58.920> in<00:02:59.330> creating<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.900> game

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
c-sharp can be used in creating a game

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.250 
c-sharp can be used in creating a game
for<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.590> mobile<00:03:02.340> device<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:03.390> can<00:03:03.600> be<00:03:03.750> used<00:03:03.960> for<00:03:04.170> a

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
for a mobile device it can be used for a

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.410 
for a mobile device it can be used for a
computer<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.920> can<00:03:05.040> be<00:03:05.100> used<00:03:05.340> for<00:03:05.550> pretty<00:03:06.330> much

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
computer it can be used for pretty much

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.680 
computer it can be used for pretty much
anything<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.320> I<00:03:07.920> personally<00:03:08.670> prefer<00:03:09.120> c-sharp

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
anything and I personally prefer c-sharp

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.020 
anything and I personally prefer c-sharp
when<00:03:09.930> I'm<00:03:10.020> coding<00:03:10.470> so<00:03:11.310> we're<00:03:11.520> gonna<00:03:11.640> be<00:03:11.820> doing

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
when I'm coding so we're gonna be doing

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.830 
when I'm coding so we're gonna be doing
this<00:03:12.120> in<00:03:12.300> c-sharp

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
this in c-sharp

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.020 
this in c-sharp
so<00:03:13.830> we're<00:03:14.160> just<00:03:14.190> gonna<00:03:14.520> call<00:03:14.760> this<00:03:14.910> player

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
we have the moving coordinates where

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.170 
we have the moving coordinates where
it's<00:03:40.350> allowed<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.770> go<00:03:40.920> the<00:03:41.220> boundary<00:03:41.670> we've

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
got the speed and some of the shots for

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.530 
got the speed and some of the shots for
this<00:03:44.720> for<00:03:45.720> our<00:03:45.840> ship<00:03:46.110> we've<00:03:46.800> got<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:48.030> controls

for the sake of the tutorial

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.050 
for the sake of the tutorial
the<00:04:18.850> X<00:04:19.210> minimum<00:04:20.040> make<00:04:21.040> sure<00:04:21.070> you<00:04:21.400> set<00:04:21.640> that<00:04:21.820> to

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
the X minimum make sure you set that to

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.630 
the X minimum make sure you set that to
3<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:23.470> y<00:04:23.710> max<00:04:24.220> is<00:04:24.520> 3<00:04:25.200> y<00:04:26.200> min<00:04:26.590> negative<00:04:27.310> four

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
3 the y max is 3 y min negative four

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.360 
3 the y max is 3 y min negative four
point<00:04:28.000> five<00:04:28.950> and<00:04:29.950> the<00:04:30.880> Y<00:04:31.060> max<00:04:31.450> is<00:04:32.170> 2<00:04:32.470> I'll<00:04:33.220> show

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
point five and the Y max is 2 I'll show

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.280 
point five and the Y max is 2 I'll show
you<00:04:33.460> guys<00:04:33.580> what<00:04:33.760> this<00:04:33.880> does<00:04:34.120> in<00:04:34.240> a<00:04:34.330> second<00:04:34.690> for

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
you guys what this does in a second for

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.860 
you guys what this does in a second for
right<00:04:35.500> now<00:04:35.530> we're<00:04:35.950> gonna<00:04:36.040> leave<00:04:36.220> the<00:04:36.370> shot

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
right now we're gonna leave the shot

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.790 
right now we're gonna leave the shot
shot<00:04:37.870> spawn<00:04:38.260> fire<00:04:38.740> rate<00:04:39.070> and<00:04:39.100> explosion<00:04:39.820> blank

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
shot spawn fire rate and explosion blank

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.210 
shot spawn fire rate and explosion blank
so<00:04:41.800> when<00:04:42.250> you<00:04:42.400> hit<00:04:42.580> play<00:04:43.560> you<00:04:44.560> now<00:04:44.740> can<00:04:45.040> move

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
so when you hit play you now can move

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.630 
so when you hit play you now can move
your<00:04:45.400> ship<00:04:45.640> back<00:04:45.820> and<00:04:46.030> forth<00:04:46.240> but<00:04:46.660> you<00:04:46.750> can<00:04:46.960> see

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
your ship back and forth but you can see

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.270 
your ship back and forth but you can see
it<00:04:48.640> gets<00:04:48.940> stopped<00:04:49.410> on<00:04:50.410> the<00:04:50.680> corners<00:04:51.070> I'm

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 
it gets stopped on the corners I'm

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.090 
it gets stopped on the corners I'm
holding<00:04:52.120> it<00:04:52.210> down<00:04:52.360> I<00:04:52.420> cannot<00:04:52.930> go<00:04:53.140> past<00:04:53.410> this

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
holding it down I cannot go past this

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.970 
holding it down I cannot go past this
barrier<00:04:54.580> and<00:04:55.210> that's<00:04:55.450> what<00:04:55.660> these<00:04:55.810> do<00:04:56.080> and<00:04:56.350> you

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:56.980 
barrier and that's what these do and you

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.280 
barrier and that's what these do and you
can<00:04:57.190> change<00:04:57.430> these<00:04:57.790> and<00:04:58.150> it's<00:04:58.480> for<00:04:59.020> the<00:04:59.110> sake

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
can change these and it's for the sake

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:01.140 
can change these and it's for the sake
of<00:04:59.320> your<00:04:59.560> game<00:04:59.860> or<00:05:00.220> what<00:05:00.370> you<00:05:00.490> want<00:05:00.730> it<00:05:01.000> also

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
works down I can't go past this vice

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:06.060 
works down I can't go past this vice
