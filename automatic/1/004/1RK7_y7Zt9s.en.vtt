00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.630 
way I've been running it is to have my
left<00:01:16.200> foot<00:01:16.380> holding<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> motorcycle<00:01:17.400> battery

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
started up here so it sounds like it's

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.250 
started up here so it sounds like it's
pretty<00:01:24.540> nasty

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
pretty nasty

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.730 
pretty nasty

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.650 

pretty<00:02:07.789> well<00:02:08.030> too

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.810
