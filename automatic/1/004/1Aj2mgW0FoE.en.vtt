playing the game but their rank doesn't

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.820 
playing the game but their rank doesn't
deteriorate<00:01:36.640> so<00:01:37.540> we<00:01:37.840> created<00:01:38.140> a<00:01:38.290> assistant

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
deteriorate so we created a assistant

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.100 
deteriorate so we created a assistant
with<00:01:38.920> valor<00:01:39.220> card<00:01:39.520> when<00:01:39.790> you<00:01:39.820> first<00:01:40.180> load<00:01:40.900> up

both in multiplayer we actually compete

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.680 
both in multiplayer we actually compete
for<00:01:53.890> valor<00:01:54.100> car<00:01:54.400> so<00:01:54.700> when<00:01:54.940> you<00:01:55.150> kill<00:01:55.450> someone

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
actually earn more money than killing

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.030 
actually earn more money than killing
like<00:02:01.270> lonely<00:02:01.720> tubes<00:02:02.020> you<00:02:02.380> actually<00:02:02.530> build<00:02:02.830> up

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
like lonely tubes you actually build up
