00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:09.109 
of the flyaways and stuff because I have

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:13.300 
of the flyaways and stuff because I have
quite<00:01:09.380> thick<00:01:09.709> wavy<00:01:10.459> hair<00:01:10.819> so<00:01:11.270> I<00:01:11.979> need<00:01:12.979> that<00:01:13.130> in

my life then I divide it into three
sections<00:01:16.579> and<00:01:17.569> then<00:01:18.139> just<00:01:18.399> start<00:01:19.399> braiding

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:19.909 
sections and then just start braiding

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:25.269 
sections and then just start braiding
really<00:01:23.709> every<00:01:24.709> so<00:01:24.889> often

00:01:25.269 --> 00:01:25.279 
really every so often

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:27.219 
really every so often

remaining<00:01:27.789> hair<00:01:28.789> and<00:01:29.149> then<00:01:29.450> just<00:01:29.810> carry<00:01:30.139> on

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
remaining hair and then just carry on

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.819 
remaining hair and then just carry on
plotting<00:01:31.340> a<00:01:31.880> brush<00:01:32.869> there<00:01:33.139> just<00:01:33.439> so<00:01:33.560> it's<00:01:33.679> not

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:33.829 
plotting a brush there just so it's not

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:35.769 
plotting a brush there just so it's not
messy<00:01:34.039> obviously<00:01:34.700> you<00:01:34.789> can<00:01:34.939> do<00:01:35.060> this<00:01:35.090> as<00:01:35.329> messy

00:01:35.769 --> 00:01:35.779 
messy obviously you can do this as messy

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:38.469 
messy obviously you can do this as messy
or<00:01:35.990> as<00:01:36.139> neat<00:01:36.349> as<00:01:36.499> you<00:01:36.799> want<00:01:37.039> and<00:01:37.249> I<00:01:37.909> start<00:01:38.240> off

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
or as neat as you want and I start off

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.629 
or as neat as you want and I start off
by<00:01:38.509> having<00:01:38.899> it<00:01:39.499> all<00:01:39.649> kind<00:01:39.920> of<00:01:40.009> flat<00:01:40.399> at<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.579> top

00:01:40.629 --> 00:01:40.639 
by having it all kind of flat at the top

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:45.309 
by having it all kind of flat at the top
and<00:01:41.679> braiding<00:01:42.679> it<00:01:42.969> somewhat<00:01:43.969> neatly<00:01:44.209> and<00:01:44.689> then

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
and braiding it somewhat neatly and then

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:48.370 
and braiding it somewhat neatly and then
I<00:01:45.560> will<00:01:45.979> mess<00:01:46.429> that<00:01:46.759> up<00:01:46.789> slightly<00:01:47.450> just<00:01:48.259> a

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
I will mess that up slightly just a

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.050 
I will mess that up slightly just a
little<00:01:48.619> bit<00:01:48.770> just<00:01:48.919> a<00:01:49.009> little<00:01:49.039> bit<00:01:49.340> okay<00:01:49.999> so

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
little bit just a little bit okay so

little bit just a little bit okay so
once<00:01:50.359> you've<00:01:50.479> done<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:50.749> the<00:01:50.869> majority<00:01:51.229> of<00:01:51.740> the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
once you've done it the majority of the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.330 
once you've done it the majority of the

bit but I won't ice normally sort out at
the<00:02:03.439> very<00:02:03.590> end<00:02:03.829> this<00:02:04.159> is<00:02:04.279> the<00:02:04.310> kind<00:02:04.609> of<00:02:04.759> volume

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
the very end this is the kind of volume

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.690 
the very end this is the kind of volume
area<00:02:06.409> so<00:02:06.619> here<00:02:06.859> is<00:02:06.950> where<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:07.310> do

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
area so here is where you do

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
we'll do click this fast and then I will

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.740 
we'll do click this fast and then I will
sort<00:02:15.680> out<00:02:15.890> the<00:02:16.430> shaping<00:02:17.090> I<00:02:17.269> normally<00:02:17.629> like<00:02:17.720> to

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750

put<00:02:18.050> it<00:02:18.170> just<00:02:18.349> behind<00:02:18.500> my<00:02:18.920> fringe<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:19.489> it<00:02:19.670> will

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
put it just behind my fringe and it will

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.500 
put it just behind my fringe and it will
cover<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.620> crown<00:02:21.620> pulsing<00:02:22.489> area<00:02:22.940> of<00:02:23.090> my<00:02:23.269> head

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
grab a few bits that would be in the

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.350 
grab a few bits that would be in the
fringe<00:02:57.200> kind<00:02:57.560> of<00:02:57.650> like<00:02:57.769> the<00:02:57.920> same<00:02:58.220> line<00:02:58.910> of

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
fringe kind of like the same line of

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.380
