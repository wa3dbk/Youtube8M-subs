a Subaru like to show you the all new
Subaru<00:00:11.990> BRZ<00:00:12.200> STI<00:00:13.070> concept<00:00:13.760> this<00:00:14.210> is<00:00:14.330> a

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
Subaru BRZ STI concept this is a

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.190 
Subaru BRZ STI concept this is a
constant

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:15.200 
constant

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.750 
constant
it's<00:00:15.650> gonna<00:00:15.830> depend<00:00:16.040> of<00:00:16.280> the<00:00:16.370> future<00:00:16.640> where

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
it's gonna depend of the future where

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.580 
it's gonna depend of the future where
we're<00:00:16.880> going<00:00:17.060> with<00:00:17.150> our<00:00:17.300> new<00:00:17.450> BRZ<00:00:17.960> sportscar

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
we're going with our new BRZ sportscar

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.470 
we're going with our new BRZ sportscar
which<00:00:18.830> will<00:00:18.950> be<00:00:19.010> coming<00:00:19.190> out<00:00:19.400> with<00:00:19.430> in<00:00:20.300> about<00:00:20.450> a

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
which will be coming out with in about a

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.840 
which will be coming out with in about a
month<00:00:20.720> or<00:00:20.840> so<00:00:20.900> this<00:00:21.680> concept<00:00:22.250> represents<00:00:22.700> what

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
month or so this concept represents what

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.179 
month or so this concept represents what
we<00:00:22.970> can<00:00:23.119> do<00:00:23.240> beyond<00:00:23.630> the<00:00:23.869> stock<00:00:24.110> car<00:00:24.410> when<00:00:25.099> we

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:25.189 
we can do beyond the stock car when we

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:26.410 
we can do beyond the stock car when we
bring<00:00:25.369> in<00:00:25.550> kind<00:00:25.790> of<00:00:25.849> all<00:00:25.970> of<00:00:26.060> our<00:00:26.150> heritage

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:26.420 
bring in kind of all of our heritage

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.050 
bring in kind of all of our heritage
from<00:00:26.810> STI<00:00:27.170> so<00:00:27.920> our<00:00:28.010> SGI<00:00:28.310> brand<00:00:28.610> out<00:00:28.760> is<00:00:28.880> known

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:29.060 
from STI so our SGI brand out is known

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.240 
from STI so our SGI brand out is known
more<00:00:29.270> for<00:00:29.480> rally<00:00:29.630> cars<00:00:29.930> we<00:00:30.560> can<00:00:30.590> also<00:00:30.830> do<00:00:31.070> a<00:00:31.099> lot

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
more for rally cars we can also do a lot

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.830 
more for rally cars we can also do a lot
of<00:00:31.279> fine<00:00:31.670> road<00:00:32.029> tuning<00:00:32.480> and<00:00:32.599> that's<00:00:32.720> what

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
of fine road tuning and that's what

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.689 
of fine road tuning and that's what
we're<00:00:32.930> looking<00:00:33.170> at<00:00:33.260> here<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:34.220> idea<00:00:34.520> behind

00:00:34.689 --> 00:00:34.699 
we're looking at here the idea behind

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:37.630 
we're looking at here the idea behind
this<00:00:35.030> car<00:00:35.270> is<00:00:35.540> is<00:00:35.960> ultimate<00:00:36.770> handling<00:00:37.160> what<00:00:37.550> we

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:37.640 
this car is is ultimate handling what we

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.130 
this car is is ultimate handling what we
wanted<00:00:37.879> to<00:00:37.940> do<00:00:38.120> was<00:00:38.270> design<00:00:38.420> a<00:00:38.780> very

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
wanted to do was design a very

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.799 
wanted to do was design a very
lightweight<00:00:39.559> four<00:00:40.070> car<00:00:40.370> and<00:00:40.610> optimize<00:00:41.510> our

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
lightweight four car and optimize our

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.140 
lightweight four car and optimize our
low<00:00:41.930> center<00:00:42.199> of<00:00:42.260> gravity<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:43.460> heart<00:00:43.910> and<00:00:44.000> soul

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
low center of gravity the heart and soul

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.540 
low center of gravity the heart and soul
of<00:00:44.269> all<00:00:44.360> supers<00:00:44.780> that<00:00:45.019> our<00:00:45.320> boxer<00:00:45.800> engine<00:00:46.129> and

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
of all supers that our boxer engine and

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.040 
of all supers that our boxer engine and
that<00:00:46.699> engine<00:00:47.120> gives<00:00:47.300> us<00:00:47.479> such<00:00:47.659> an<00:00:47.780> opportunity

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
that engine gives us such an opportunity

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.290 
that engine gives us such an opportunity
to<00:00:48.320> to<00:00:48.739> mount<00:00:48.949> the<00:00:49.220> mount<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:49.820> engine<00:00:49.909> as<00:00:50.120> low

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
to to mount the mount the engine as low

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.270 
to to mount the mount the engine as low
as<00:00:50.449> possible<00:00:50.479> you<00:00:51.379> keep<00:00:51.559> all<00:00:51.769> the<00:00:51.920> weight<00:00:52.070> low

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
as possible you keep all the weight low

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.130 
as possible you keep all the weight low
so<00:00:52.610> our<00:00:52.699> center<00:00:52.909> of<00:00:52.970> gravity<00:00:53.299> in<00:00:53.360> this<00:00:53.449> car<00:00:53.690> is

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
so our center of gravity in this car is

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.860 
so our center of gravity in this car is
better<00:00:54.379> than<00:00:54.589> a<00:00:54.620> Ferrari<00:00:55.100> 458<00:00:55.519> Italia<00:00:55.720> so<00:00:56.720> what

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
better than a Ferrari 458 Italia so what

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.270 
better than a Ferrari 458 Italia so what
that<00:00:56.960> means<00:00:57.140> is<00:00:57.260> we're<00:00:57.409> talking<00:00:57.739> amazing

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
that means is we're talking amazing

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.009 
that means is we're talking amazing
amazing<00:00:58.850> handling<00:00:59.269> then<00:00:59.690> it'll<00:00:59.900> likely

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
amazing handling then it'll likely

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:01.240 
amazing handling then it'll likely
package<00:01:00.559> what<00:01:00.710> we've<00:01:00.830> done<00:01:00.949> that's<00:01:01.010> going<00:01:01.190> to

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
package what we've done that's going to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.740 
package what we've done that's going to
make<00:01:01.339> it<00:01:01.430> as<00:01:01.519> fun<00:01:01.760> to<00:01:01.940> drive<00:01:02.089> as<00:01:02.299> possible

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
make it as fun to drive as possible

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.479 
make it as fun to drive as possible
rather<00:01:03.140> than<00:01:03.290> just<00:01:03.500> go<00:01:03.620> for<00:01:03.799> numbers<00:01:04.070> so<00:01:04.400> if

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
rather than just go for numbers so if

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.310 
rather than just go for numbers so if
you<00:01:04.580> notice<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:05.299> car<00:01:05.540> itself<00:01:05.780> is<00:01:05.930> very<00:01:06.080> low

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
you notice the car itself is very low

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.200 
you notice the car itself is very low
strut<00:01:07.130> towers<00:01:07.460> are<00:01:07.580> very<00:01:07.760> low<00:01:07.940> we've

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
strut towers are very low we've

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.760 
strut towers are very low we've
redesigned<00:01:08.479> a<00:01:08.690> suspension<00:01:09.049> to<00:01:09.229> work<00:01:09.500> within

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
redesigned a suspension to work within

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.990 
redesigned a suspension to work within
that<00:01:09.920> setup<00:01:10.430> we're<00:01:11.060> looking<00:01:11.390> at<00:01:11.510> Italy

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
that setup we're looking at Italy

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.610 
that setup we're looking at Italy
a fun<00:01:13.630> car<00:01:13.840> drive<00:01:14.020> because<00:01:14.170> it's<00:01:14.380> going<00:01:14.470> to<00:01:14.560> be

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
a fun car drive because it's going to be

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.560 
a fun car drive because it's going to be
a<00:01:14.650> rear-wheel<00:01:15.040> drive<00:01:15.070> rather<00:01:15.940> than<00:01:16.240> all<00:01:16.360> will

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
a rear-wheel drive rather than all will

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.910 
a rear-wheel drive rather than all will
drive<00:01:16.750> this<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.140> first<00:01:17.380> three<00:01:17.620> will<00:01:17.740> drive

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
drive this the first three will drive

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.040 
drive this the first three will drive
super<00:01:18.370> we've<00:01:18.520> ever<00:01:18.670> made<00:01:18.820> but<00:01:19.660> we<00:01:19.780> did<00:01:19.900> that

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
super we've ever made but we did that

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.050 
super we've ever made but we did that
base<00:01:20.230> because<00:01:20.560> our<00:01:20.740> target<00:01:20.950> goals<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.850> only

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
we could really get there with my behind

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.719 
we could really get there with my behind
us<00:01:23.470> engine<00:01:23.740> lower<00:01:23.950> than<00:01:24.190> virtually<00:01:24.580> any<00:01:24.610> other

we<00:01:25.930> designed<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.470> suspension<00:01:27.070> the<00:01:27.220> steering

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
we designed the suspension the steering

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.210 
we designed the suspension the steering
everything<00:01:28.210> around<00:01:28.540> that<00:01:28.810> so<00:01:29.350> to<00:01:29.890> try<00:01:30.010> to<00:01:30.100> keep

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
everything around that so to try to keep

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.740 
everything around that so to try to keep
those<00:01:30.369> numbers<00:01:30.580> as<00:01:30.880> low<00:01:31.000> as<00:01:31.150> possible<00:01:31.210> and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
those numbers as low as possible and

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.359 
those numbers as low as possible and
also<00:01:31.869> keep<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.140> weight<00:01:32.290> down<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.950> whole<00:01:33.100> idea

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
also keep the weight down the whole idea

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.430 
also keep the weight down the whole idea
is<00:01:33.460> this<00:01:33.880> is<00:01:34.030> a<00:01:34.060> sports<00:01:34.900> car<00:01:35.110> for<00:01:35.260> the<00:01:35.320> new

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
is this is a sports car for the new

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.600 
is this is a sports car for the new
millennium<00:01:35.590> when<00:01:36.010> we<00:01:36.070> start<00:01:36.280> thinking<00:01:36.400> about
