monthly editor here and flat on his
twister<00:00:21.619> 28<00:00:22.040> cleaver<00:00:22.570> and<00:00:23.590> he's<00:00:24.590> in<00:00:24.800> quite<00:00:25.520> a

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
twister 28 cleaver and he's in quite a

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.330 
twister 28 cleaver and he's in quite a
narrow<00:00:25.849> birth<00:00:26.529> the<00:00:27.529> winds<00:00:27.800> blowing<00:00:28.010> the<00:00:28.189> bow

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
narrow birth the winds blowing the bow

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.269 
narrow birth the winds blowing the bow
on<00:00:28.610> and<00:00:29.509> a<00:00:30.320> little<00:00:30.529> bit<00:00:30.650> of<00:00:30.740> tide<00:00:30.949> from<00:00:31.130> the

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
on and a little bit of tide from the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.520 
on and a little bit of tide from the
stern<00:00:32.170> so<00:00:33.340> he<00:00:34.340> could<00:00:34.550> spring<00:00:34.850> off<00:00:34.970> but<00:00:35.780> it's

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
stern so he could spring off but it's

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:37.900 
stern so he could spring off but it's
going<00:00:36.710> to<00:00:36.770> take<00:00:36.949> a<00:00:36.980> while<00:00:37.280> and<00:00:37.309> it<00:00:37.550> may<00:00:37.730> not

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
going to take a while and it may not

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.200 
going to take a while and it may not
have<00:00:38.090> the<00:00:38.210> grunt<00:00:38.449> that<00:00:38.900> it<00:00:39.020> needs<00:00:39.260> so<00:00:40.150> here's<00:00:41.150> a

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
have the grunt that it needs so here's a

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.900 
have the grunt that it needs so here's a
new<00:00:41.420> idea

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
new idea

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.979 
new idea
you<00:00:43.910> notice<00:00:44.269> that<00:00:44.720> a<00:00:44.780> slip<00:00:45.110> line<00:00:45.290> rig<00:00:46.839> from<00:00:47.839> the

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
you notice that a slip line rig from the

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.180 
you notice that a slip line rig from the
furthest<00:00:48.470> water<00:00:49.780> back<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:50.989> one<00:00:51.140> horn<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:52.159> make

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
furthest water back to one horn to make

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.869 
furthest water back to one horn to make
it<00:00:52.430> easier<00:00:52.729> to<00:00:52.760> slip<00:00:53.589> and<00:00:54.699> here's<00:00:55.699> what

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
it easier to slip and here's what

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:06.080 
it easier to slip and here's what
happened

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:12.210 

so<00:01:07.090> hearing<00:01:07.360> goes<00:01:07.510> forward<00:01:10.770> drops<00:01:11.770> off<00:01:11.950> power

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
so hearing goes forward drops off power

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.290 
so hearing goes forward drops off power
line<00:01:13.980> winds<00:01:14.980> blowing<00:01:15.220> us<00:01:15.370> on<00:01:15.550> so<00:01:15.790> no<00:01:15.910> problem

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:16.300 
line winds blowing us on so no problem

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:24.410 
line winds blowing us on so no problem
there<00:01:19.740> jumps<00:01:20.740> aboard<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:23.320> notice<00:01:23.650> the<00:01:23.800> helm

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
there jumps aboard you notice the helm

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.990 
there jumps aboard you notice the helm
over<00:01:25.420> so<00:01:26.290> the<00:01:26.500> engines<00:01:26.830> revs<00:01:27.100> are<00:01:27.729> going<00:01:27.880> to<00:01:27.940> be

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
over so the engines revs are going to be

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.219 
over so the engines revs are going to be
pushing<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.450> stand<00:01:28.780> out<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.780> out<00:01:34.960> comes

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
pushing the stand out and out comes

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.700 
pushing the stand out and out comes
about<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:37.180> eating<00:01:37.570> all<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:38.200> power<00:01:38.410> of<00:01:38.590> the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
about the eating all the power of the

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.580 
about the eating all the power of the
engine<00:01:38.830> push<00:01:39.790> the<00:01:39.940> nose<00:01:40.090> out<00:01:42.869> we<00:01:43.869> need<00:01:44.140> a<00:01:44.380> power

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
engine push the nose out we need a power

00:01:44.590 --> 00:02:00.710 
engine push the nose out we need a power
far<00:01:44.860> enough<00:01:48.660> up<00:01:49.660> around<00:01:51.030> flip<00:01:52.030> the<00:01:52.270> line

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.450 

easy

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.520
