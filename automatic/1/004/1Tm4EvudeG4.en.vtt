their<00:03:22.349> client<00:03:22.739> to<00:03:22.829> go<00:03:22.980> and<00:03:23.160> get<00:03:23.250> changed<00:03:23.489> and

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
their client to go and get changed and

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.059 
their client to go and get changed and
follow<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.510> trainer<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.019> gym<00:03:25.260> needless

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
follow the trainer to the gym needless

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.440 
follow the trainer to the gym needless
to<00:03:26.160> say<00:03:26.310> this<00:03:26.430> client<00:03:26.790> met<00:03:26.880> his<00:03:27.000> goal<00:03:27.150> is<00:03:27.209> quite

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
to say this client met his goal is quite

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.539 
to say this client met his goal is quite
quickly<00:03:27.690> which<00:03:27.930> is<00:03:28.079> great<00:03:28.319> another<00:03:29.310> thing

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
quickly which is great another thing

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.819 
quickly which is great another thing
that<00:03:29.579> I<00:03:29.760> think<00:03:30.030> makes<00:03:30.630> me<00:03:30.810> unique<00:03:31.109> as<00:03:31.349> a<00:03:31.590> coach

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
that I think makes me unique as a coach

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.440 
that I think makes me unique as a coach
is<00:03:32.160> that<00:03:32.310> I'm<00:03:32.459> pretty<00:03:32.639> hell-bent<00:03:33.030> on<00:03:33.239> making

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
is that I'm pretty hell-bent on making

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.900 
is that I'm pretty hell-bent on making
the<00:03:33.750> process<00:03:33.959> of<00:03:34.349> expansion<00:03:34.739> as<00:03:35.099> fun<00:03:35.730> as

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
the process of expansion as fun as

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.120 
the process of expansion as fun as
possible<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:37.049> I<00:03:37.169> do<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:37.470> often<00:03:37.709> through

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
possible and I do that often through

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.250 
possible and I do that often through
role-playing<00:03:38.639> role-playing<00:03:39.540> doesn't<00:03:39.900> always

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
role-playing role-playing doesn't always

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.110 
role-playing role-playing doesn't always
make<00:03:40.470> sense<00:03:40.530> but<00:03:40.950> what<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:41.430> find<00:03:41.730> is<00:03:42.090> that

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
make sense but what I find is that

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.659 
make sense but what I find is that
practice<00:03:42.989> practice<00:03:43.410> practice<00:03:43.440> helps<00:03:44.250> get

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
practice practice practice helps get

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:47.870 
practice practice practice helps get
clients<00:03:45.440> unstuck<00:03:46.440> and<00:03:46.620> catapults<00:03:47.519> them<00:03:47.669> into

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
clients unstuck and catapults them into

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.690 
clients unstuck and catapults them into
action<00:03:48.269> very<00:03:49.109> quickly<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.769> just<00:03:49.829> as<00:03:50.609> an

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
action very quickly and just as an

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.220 
action very quickly and just as an
example<00:03:50.819> last<00:03:51.329> week<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.660> was<00:03:51.810> working<00:03:52.109> with<00:03:52.169> a

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
example last week I was working with a

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.710 
example last week I was working with a
woman<00:03:52.590> who<00:03:52.859> is<00:03:53.000> refining<00:03:54.000> some<00:03:54.239> of<00:03:54.329> her<00:03:54.419> dating

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
woman who is refining some of her dating

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.740 
woman who is refining some of her dating
skills<00:03:54.959> and<00:03:55.260> so<00:03:55.380> I<00:03:55.620> brought<00:03:55.980> in<00:03:56.190> an<00:03:56.430> actor<00:03:56.819> to

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
skills and so I brought in an actor to

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.479 
skills and so I brought in an actor to
roleplay<00:03:57.959> with<00:03:58.319> her<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.769> she<00:03:59.220> was<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.370> little

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
roleplay with her and she was a little

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.369 
roleplay with her and she was a little
bit<00:03:59.669> uncomfortable<00:03:59.790> and<00:04:00.480> fumbling<00:04:00.780> at<00:04:01.079> first

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
bit uncomfortable and fumbling at first

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.530 
bit uncomfortable and fumbling at first
but<00:04:01.709> eventually<00:04:02.129> she<00:04:02.579> got<00:04:02.730> into<00:04:03.150> it<00:04:03.269> and<00:04:03.480> they

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
but eventually she got into it and they

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.300 
but eventually she got into it and they
started<00:04:04.019> picking<00:04:04.319> each<00:04:04.440> other<00:04:04.560> up<00:04:04.709> they

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
started picking each other up they

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.430 
started picking each other up they
started<00:04:05.579> having<00:04:05.879> conversations<00:04:06.629> asking<00:04:07.349> the

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
started having conversations asking the

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.780 
started having conversations asking the
right<00:04:07.530> kinds<00:04:07.799> of<00:04:07.889> questions<00:04:08.069> and<00:04:08.459> moving<00:04:08.700> the

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
right kinds of questions and moving the

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.420 
right kinds of questions and moving the
date<00:04:08.910> forward<00:04:09.269> and<00:04:09.660> we<00:04:10.590> would<00:04:10.739> stop<00:04:11.069> at<00:04:11.340> the

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
date forward and we would stop at the

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.369 
date forward and we would stop at the
end<00:04:11.579> of<00:04:11.669> every<00:04:11.940> role<00:04:12.150> play<00:04:12.419> and<00:04:12.720> debrief<00:04:13.260> on

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
end of every role play and debrief on

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.800 
end of every role play and debrief on
what<00:04:13.590> worked<00:04:13.859> and<00:04:14.099> what<00:04:14.190> didn't<00:04:14.639> work<00:04:14.760> and<00:04:15.030> I

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
what worked and what didn't work and I

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.659 
what worked and what didn't work and I
think<00:04:16.109> that<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:16.410> fun<00:04:16.769> activity<00:04:16.919> like<00:04:17.489> this

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:17.669 
think that a fun activity like this

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.569 
think that a fun activity like this
interactivity<00:04:18.359> of<00:04:18.599> the<00:04:19.590> exercise<00:04:20.070> really

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
interactivity of the exercise really

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.940 
interactivity of the exercise really
raised<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.150> confidence<00:04:21.659> of<00:04:21.840> my<00:04:22.349> client<00:04:22.800> and

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
raised the confidence of my client and

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.589 
raised the confidence of my client and
it<00:04:23.250> was<00:04:23.340> probably<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.789> most<00:04:23.909> effective<00:04:24.419> way

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
it was probably the most effective way

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.270 
it was probably the most effective way
to<00:04:24.630> move<00:04:25.020> her<00:04:25.200> forward<00:04:25.469> in<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:25.830> fastest

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
to move her forward in the fastest

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.150 
to move her forward in the fastest
way<00:04:26.370> possible<00:04:26.850> so<00:04:27.139> fun<00:04:28.139> and<00:04:28.470> role-playing<00:04:29.010> is

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
way possible so fun and role-playing is

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.530 
way possible so fun and role-playing is
another<00:04:29.370> thing<00:04:29.550> that<00:04:29.610> distinguishes<00:04:29.910> me<00:04:30.360> and

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
another thing that distinguishes me and

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.120 
another thing that distinguishes me and
then<00:04:30.630> the<00:04:30.720> last<00:04:30.870> thing<00:04:31.080> I<00:04:31.380> think<00:04:31.860> that<00:04:31.950> makes

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
then the last thing I think that makes

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.500 
then the last thing I think that makes
me<00:04:32.220> unique<00:04:32.610> is<00:04:32.730> that<00:04:32.790> I'm<00:04:32.970> incredibly

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
me unique is that I'm incredibly

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.320 
me unique is that I'm incredibly
intuitive<00:04:34.070> as<00:04:35.070> a<00:04:35.130> listener<00:04:35.550> I<00:04:35.730> listen<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.210> my

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
intuitive as a listener I listen to my

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.290 
intuitive as a listener I listen to my
clients<00:04:36.810> on<00:04:36.960> many<00:04:37.230> different<00:04:37.410> levels

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
clients on many different levels

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.730 
clients on many different levels
sometimes<00:04:39.300> I<00:04:39.540> have<00:04:39.660> clients<00:04:39.900> who<00:04:40.290> actually

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
sometimes I have clients who actually

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:43.250 
sometimes I have clients who actually
think<00:04:41.250> I<00:04:41.310> can<00:04:41.490> read<00:04:41.669> their<00:04:41.850> minds<00:04:42.360> but<00:04:42.900> in<00:04:43.050> fact

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
think I can read their minds but in fact

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.510 
think I can read their minds but in fact
really<00:04:43.650> what<00:04:43.860> I'm<00:04:43.950> doing<00:04:43.980> is<00:04:44.250> I'm<00:04:44.340> just

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
really what I'm doing is I'm just

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.090 
really what I'm doing is I'm just
listening<00:04:44.970> at<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.210> level<00:04:45.630> so<00:04:46.530> deep<00:04:46.740> that<00:04:46.770> they

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
listening at a level so deep that they

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:49.550 
listening at a level so deep that they
haven't<00:04:47.220> experienced<00:04:47.760> before<00:04:48.139> and<00:04:49.139> so<00:04:49.380> that's

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
haven't experienced before and so that's

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.260 
haven't experienced before and so that's
one<00:04:49.710> of<00:04:49.800> the<00:04:49.860> things<00:04:49.889> that<00:04:50.220> distinguishes<00:04:51.000> me

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
one of the things that distinguishes me

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.840 
one of the things that distinguishes me
and<00:04:51.389> I<00:04:51.419> think<00:04:51.620> intuitive<00:04:52.620> listening<00:04:53.130> is<00:04:53.340> kind

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
and I think intuitive listening is kind

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.100 
and I think intuitive listening is kind
of<00:04:53.910> a<00:04:53.970> cool<00:04:54.120> trick<00:04:54.480> but<00:04:54.630> it's<00:04:54.810> a<00:04:54.870> really

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
of a cool trick but it's a really

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.900 
of a cool trick but it's a really
important<00:04:55.650> one<00:04:55.800> in<00:04:56.010> helping<00:04:56.280> me<00:04:56.400> build<00:04:56.550> trust

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
important one in helping me build trust

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.409 
important one in helping me build trust
with<00:04:57.120> clients<00:04:58.340> my<00:04:59.340> personality<00:05:00.000> is

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
with clients my personality is

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.720 
with clients my personality is
incredibly<00:05:01.350> extroverted<00:05:02.130> i<00:05:02.310> am<00:05:02.400> quite

incredibly extroverted i am quite
