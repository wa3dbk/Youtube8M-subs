bit<00:00:45.730> of<00:00:45.790> background<00:00:46.440> drill<00:00:47.440> cichlids<00:00:47.830> were<00:00:48.040> my

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
bit of background drill cichlids were my

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.360 
bit of background drill cichlids were my
first<00:00:48.489> cichlid<00:00:48.910> I've<00:00:49.030> ever<00:00:49.180> owned<00:00:49.480> out<00:00:49.870> of<00:00:49.989> any

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
first cichlid I've ever owned out of any

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.770 
first cichlid I've ever owned out of any
I<00:00:51.370> thought<00:00:52.090> that<00:00:52.239> they<00:00:52.330> were<00:00:52.390> just<00:00:52.570> going<00:00:52.750> to

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
I thought that they were just going to

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.299 
I thought that they were just going to
be<00:00:52.840> lake<00:00:53.200> cichlids<00:00:53.770> and<00:00:53.920> I<00:00:54.010> bought<00:00:54.190> an

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
be lake cichlids and I bought an

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.780 
be lake cichlids and I bought an
electric<00:00:54.520> yellow<00:00:54.910> and<00:00:55.600> a<00:00:55.990> CEI<00:00:56.710> cichlid<00:00:57.579> I

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
electric yellow and a CEI cichlid I

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.340 
electric yellow and a CEI cichlid I
think<00:00:57.970> that<00:00:58.120> a<00:00:58.240> lotta<00:00:58.600> pronounces<00:00:59.020> so<00:00:59.110> I<00:00:59.140> just

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
think that a lotta pronounces so I just

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.260 
think that a lotta pronounces so I just
say<00:00:59.470> like<00:00:59.620> that<00:00:59.860> and<00:01:00.250> a<00:01:00.790> bunch<00:01:01.000> of<00:01:01.090> other

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
say like that and a bunch of other

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.390 
say like that and a bunch of other
African<00:01:01.690> cichlids<00:01:02.140> that<00:01:02.500> are<00:01:02.739> Lake<00:01:03.100> Malawi

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
African cichlids that are Lake Malawi

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.010 
African cichlids that are Lake Malawi
cichlids<00:01:03.970> and<00:01:04.119> stuff<00:01:04.360> like<00:01:04.540> that<00:01:04.690> and<00:01:04.869> then<00:01:04.989> I

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.020 
cichlids and stuff like that and then I

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.170 
cichlids and stuff like that and then I
had<00:01:05.199> a<00:01:05.229> pair<00:01:05.470> of<00:01:05.500> jewels<00:01:05.800> in<00:01:06.070> there<00:01:06.280> which<00:01:07.060> I

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
had a pair of jewels in there which I

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.400 
had a pair of jewels in there which I
thought<00:01:07.330> were<00:01:07.479> just<00:01:07.540> gonna<00:01:07.750> be<00:01:07.840> normal<00:01:08.259> Lake

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
thought were just gonna be normal Lake

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.650 
thought were just gonna be normal Lake
cichlids<00:01:08.920> but<00:01:09.520> it<00:01:09.610> turned<00:01:09.880> out<00:01:10.000> that<00:01:10.360> they

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:10.660 
cichlids but it turned out that they

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.480 
cichlids but it turned out that they
just<00:01:10.690> murdered<00:01:11.560> every<00:01:11.830> single<00:01:12.100> other<00:01:12.220> fish<00:01:12.460> in

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
just murdered every single other fish in

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.760 
just murdered every single other fish in
the<00:01:12.640> tank<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.930> they<00:01:16.930> became<00:01:17.140> a<00:01:17.200> breeding<00:01:17.500> pair

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
the tank and they became a breeding pair

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.870 
the tank and they became a breeding pair
so<00:01:18.520> I<00:01:18.910> didn't<00:01:19.660> expect<00:01:20.050> this<00:01:20.170> at<00:01:20.350> all<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.880> then

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
so I didn't expect this at all and then

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.550 
so I didn't expect this at all and then
I<00:01:22.030> decided<00:01:22.360> to<00:01:22.450> put<00:01:22.660> some<00:01:22.899> sulfur<00:01:23.229> fishing

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
I decided to put some sulfur fishing

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.980 
I decided to put some sulfur fishing
like<00:01:23.710> a<00:01:23.740> by<00:01:23.979> shear<00:01:24.340> a<00:01:24.369> convict<00:01:25.180> jack<00:01:25.720> dempsey

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
like a by shear a convict jack dempsey

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.050 
like a by shear a convict jack dempsey
and<00:01:26.259> they<00:01:26.560> ended<00:01:27.010> up<00:01:27.100> killing<00:01:27.460> every<00:01:27.760> single

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
and they ended up killing every single

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.680 
and they ended up killing every single
one<00:01:28.180> of<00:01:28.240> them

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
one of them

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.950 
one of them
so<00:01:29.520> these<00:01:30.520> guys<00:01:30.760> are<00:01:30.970> definitely<00:01:31.150> very

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:31.960 
so these guys are definitely very

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.630 
so these guys are definitely very
aggressive<00:01:32.560> fish<00:01:32.799> and<00:01:33.040> should<00:01:33.159> not<00:01:33.370> really<00:01:33.549> be

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
aggressive fish and should not really be

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.270 
aggressive fish and should not really be
kept<00:01:33.909> with<00:01:34.030> anything<00:01:34.570> but<00:01:34.870> themselves<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:38.799> know

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280

breeding these guys is actually quite

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.820 
breeding these guys is actually quite
easy<00:03:16.270> it's<00:03:16.690> similar<00:03:16.990> to<00:03:17.170> what<00:03:17.500> you<00:03:17.560> would<00:03:17.710> do

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
easy it's similar to what you would do

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.420 
easy it's similar to what you would do
if<00:03:17.920> a<00:03:18.010> convict<00:03:19.709> the<00:03:20.709> only<00:03:20.980> difficult<00:03:21.400> part

your fish are sex and convicts is

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.380 
your fish are sex and convicts is
obviously<00:03:26.620> very<00:03:27.010> very<00:03:27.280> easy<00:03:27.640> these<00:03:27.880> guys<00:03:28.120> just

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
obviously very very easy these guys just

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.180

more you know spangles on their tail or

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.150 
more you know spangles on their tail or
something<00:03:49.330> but<00:03:49.840> I<00:03:49.870> found<00:03:50.170> out<00:03:50.440> that<00:03:50.650> that<00:03:50.890> just

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
something but I found out that that just

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.010 
something but I found out that that just
it's<00:03:51.550> just<00:03:51.820> not<00:03:52.209> really<00:03:52.690> going<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:52.900> be<00:03:52.989> that

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
it's just not really going to be that

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.350 
it's just not really going to be that
accurate<00:03:53.500> you<00:03:54.340> could<00:03:54.520> always<00:03:54.700> just<00:03:54.940> throw<00:03:55.270> in

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
accurate you could always just throw in

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.270 
accurate you could always just throw in
the<00:03:55.420> pinion<00:03:55.810> out<00:03:55.959> there<00:03:56.230> or<00:03:56.470> you<00:03:56.890> could<00:03:57.070> take<00:03:57.220> a

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
the pinion out there or you could take a

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.330 
the pinion out there or you could take a
educated<00:03:58.180> guess<00:03:58.480> but<00:03:58.840> really<00:03:59.290> you<00:03:59.800> know<00:03:59.920> some

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
educated guess but really you know some

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.430 
educated guess but really you know some
females<00:04:00.760> that'll<00:04:01.090> have<00:04:01.270> a<00:04:01.300> really<00:04:01.959> beautiful

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
females that'll have a really beautiful

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.170 
females that'll have a really beautiful
spot<00:04:02.739> there's<00:04:03.130> some<00:04:03.370> males<00:04:03.640> that<00:04:03.820> will<00:04:04.030> have<00:04:04.150> a

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
spot there's some males that will have a

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.360 
spot there's some males that will have a
lack<00:04:04.480> of<00:04:04.510> spots<00:04:05.020> it<00:04:05.380> also<00:04:05.530> depends<00:04:06.100> on<00:04:06.190> what

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
lack of spots it also depends on what

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.750 
lack of spots it also depends on what
fish<00:04:06.610> are<00:04:06.730> dominant<00:04:07.239> and<00:04:07.270> the<00:04:07.420> tank

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
fish are dominant and the tank

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.490 
fish are dominant and the tank
that<00:04:07.849> you're<00:04:08.000> looking<00:04:08.299> at<00:04:08.480> you<00:04:09.110> know<00:04:09.260> you<00:04:09.319> have

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
that you're looking at you know you have

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.559 
that you're looking at you know you have
to<00:04:09.560> take<00:04:09.739> all<00:04:09.920> those<00:04:10.129> different<00:04:10.640> aspects<00:04:11.360> into

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:11.569 
to take all those different aspects into

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:12.610 
to take all those different aspects into
consideration

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
consideration

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.740 
consideration
so<00:04:13.099> really<00:04:13.400> sexing<00:04:13.879> these<00:04:14.030> guys<00:04:14.209> isn't<00:04:14.599> very

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
so really sexing these guys isn't very

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.390 
so really sexing these guys isn't very
easy<00:04:14.810> I<00:04:15.170> would<00:04:15.349> recommend<00:04:15.769> maybe<00:04:15.950> you<00:04:16.160> start

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
easy I would recommend maybe you start

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.580 
easy I would recommend maybe you start
out<00:04:16.519> with<00:04:16.549> a<00:04:16.729> group<00:04:17.030> of<00:04:17.209> juveniles<00:04:17.810> and<00:04:18.139> then

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
out with a group of juveniles and then

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.069 
out with a group of juveniles and then
as<00:04:18.769> they<00:04:19.010> pair<00:04:19.280> off<00:04:19.489> select<00:04:20.239> one<00:04:20.510> pair<00:04:20.780> and

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
as they pair off select one pair and

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.360 
as they pair off select one pair and
then<00:04:21.169> just<00:04:21.410> get<00:04:21.590> rid<00:04:21.739> of<00:04:21.799> the<00:04:21.979> other<00:04:22.130> ones

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
then just get rid of the other ones

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.310 
then just get rid of the other ones
because<00:04:22.550> obviously<00:04:22.790> you<00:04:23.210> can't<00:04:23.270> keep<00:04:23.690> more

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
because obviously you can't keep more

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:26.189 
because obviously you can't keep more
than<00:04:24.350> a<00:04:24.500> pair<00:04:24.710> together<00:04:25.070> at<00:04:25.340> least<00:04:25.430> I<00:04:25.699> wouldn't

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:26.199 
than a pair together at least I wouldn't

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.810 
than a pair together at least I wouldn't
just<00:04:27.199> a<00:04:27.289> very<00:04:27.620> bad<00:04:27.800> idea<00:04:27.979> that<00:04:28.310> will<00:04:28.400> kill<00:04:28.610> all

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
just a very bad idea that will kill all

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.120 
just a very bad idea that will kill all
the<00:04:28.940> other<00:04:29.120> ones<00:04:29.419> but<00:04:30.229> even<00:04:30.560> the<00:04:30.650> pair's<00:04:30.889> have

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
the other ones but even the pair's have

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.950 
the other ones but even the pair's have
to<00:04:31.250> be<00:04:31.370> separated<00:04:31.940> at<00:04:32.060> sometimes<00:04:32.570> like<00:04:32.930> my

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
to be separated at sometimes like my

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.110 
to be separated at sometimes like my
breeding<00:04:33.560> pair<00:04:33.770> they<00:04:34.340> were<00:04:34.460> doing<00:04:34.669> fine<00:04:34.910> in

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
breeding pair they were doing fine in

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.659 
breeding pair they were doing fine in
their<00:04:35.270> 30<00:04:35.539> long<00:04:35.840> just<00:04:36.830> bringing<00:04:37.160> away<00:04:37.370> and

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
their 30 long just bringing away and

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.879 
their 30 long just bringing away and
then<00:04:37.910> the<00:04:38.600> male<00:04:38.930> side<00:04:39.229> tried<00:04:39.530> to<00:04:39.620> kill<00:04:39.770> the

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:39.889 
then the male side tried to kill the

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.770 
then the male side tried to kill the
female<00:04:40.250> and<00:04:40.340> completely<00:04:41.000> ripped<00:04:41.240> her<00:04:41.419> tail

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
female and completely ripped her tail

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
she couldn't even swim correctly but she

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.120 
she couldn't even swim correctly but she
