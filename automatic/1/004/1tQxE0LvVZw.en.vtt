00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello everyone got here 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:09.059
 okay camcorder and decided or 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.610
 record a video about your disc 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.670
 grinding machine do well what was he 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:21.529
 without sound there was installed sound 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:25.949
 so the engine power is 180 watts rpm 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:27.289
 1370 is seated on the motor shaft 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.510
 metal disk 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:33.989
 disc thickness 6 millimeters diameter 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.960
 150 millimeter disk to 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.390
 it was comfortable 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:45.170
 I have replaced the sandpaper 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:53.250
 the ability to shoot a table is also a table 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:56.399
 regulated here upside down for that 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:15.810
 to remove the table is enough to unscrew 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:26.040
 Here are these little sheep above 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:29.280
 opportunity to remove the dust collector he 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.979
 adjustable so that when table 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.549
 dropping under 45 degrees could have been 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.710
 miss out 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.270
 or when 90 raises raise in order 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.909
 to maximize 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.030
 there was an effective dust removal 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.880
 dust puller it is from two millimeter 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:52.079
 stainless steel tongue and the whole machine is made 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:54.280
 stainless steel sandpaper on 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:59.789
 I fix the machine with a two-way 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:03.250
 scotch tape 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:08.250
 sandpaper has never even 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:12.060
 she didnâ€™t peel off 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.940
 actually to this 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.940
 I also made a protractor 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.940
 demonstrate 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.980
 so here 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:55.430
 protractor it is made of dural 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.040
 stainless steel sliders 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.130
 bronze 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.410
 if any parts grind under 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:11.980
 a certain angle is enough before 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:11.980
 little pen and put the necessary means 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.990
 engine power for such a drive 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:25.490
 quite enough has never been 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:28.180
 no problem on this side here in 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.790
 the case has a working capacitor 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.860
 engine hooked spam account 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.840
 triangle 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:42.710
 actually here 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:46.510
 works works 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:46.510
 here is a character. installed 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:55.090
 fills actually singing about 7 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.090
 acres 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.830
 everything is balanced here this one 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.830
 Thank you all for your attention
