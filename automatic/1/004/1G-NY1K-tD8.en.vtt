00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.270
 covered again with a cloth 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.970

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.190
 test with the cascada has opel 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.140
 independent model on the market 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.920
 that technically brought on the astra and 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.989
 The insignia based it looks elegant 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.350
 showing with its classic curves 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.329
 but also corners and edges nice details 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.989
 how the gurtbringer make the cabriolet 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.030
 live comfortably under the hood of ours 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.640

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.790
 maximum torque of 260 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.159
 Newton meters on our test bench in the 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.200
 We have a right to adac eco test 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.960
 high average consumption of 7 liters 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.650
 Super measured at 100 kilometers 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.620
 this also means that the CO2 balance is 190 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.990
 Gramm hoch aus so there are only three of 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:27.090
 five stars in the adac eco test until 50 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.070

 open and close the roof and also 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.030
 Otherwise, the car shows well

 thoughtfully and the wind blows 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.670
 relatively few the interior easily 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.400
 succeed the opel cascada too 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.500
 sudden evasive maneuvers the brakes 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.460
 are stable of used cars only 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.190
 around 36 meters to 100 km / h to stand 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.010
 To come overcrowded shows that 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.650
 cockpit of the cascada even if opel already 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.810
 The processing has cleaned up a bit 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.220
 is without blame some details even 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.160
 made really fine

 open air season 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.739
 but he does not only convince by being 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.459
 also look interesting 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.050
 Roof construction and the space available 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.980
 can be seen 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.890
