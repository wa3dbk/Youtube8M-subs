00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:19.020
 hello guys then this is a product 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.930
 I bought it, right? It 's a 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.460
 battery and also a dock station 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.650
 it is only used to keep the 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.539
 foot is not used to charge the device with 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.480
 the battery in it is not 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.790
 and it's a boxing effect before it comes out 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.199
 only when it arrived in the mail 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.780
 only then I realized that I had seen 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.340
 wrong information in the ad, right? 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.860
 I thought he came with a battery 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.140
 extra has also in the previous video I 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.530
 commented that the battery did not come back the 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.380
 ad to look and really said there 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.540
 battery and usb cable not included 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.059
 cable and if I knew battery 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.340
 I was taken by surprise but it was careless. 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.160
 mine was not the company's choice you 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.780
 show the company name that 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.940
 question because I buy I know and already 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.720
 It's been a long time since I've had problems. 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.640
 huh 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.100
 and I found it strange even had no 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.649
 battery problem is almost was not 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.740
 It was not me I read the wrong ad 

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:20.220
 right the company here mpx mix 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.470
 I already bought sp sp of the galaxy note 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.470
 a galaxy battery notes honor with 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.270
 movies for the galaxy note 1.2 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.640
 I've never had a problem with this store. 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.990
 I recommend you guys are there in the market 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.600
 free shipping fast prices good 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.090
 It's when I trust a store and 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:45.960
 I make a recommendation without any problem 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:47.610
 good there is here with the dock is another one 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.990
 thing that caught me by surprise in the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.549
 also because of a lack of attention 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.140
 I did not know that I came with a 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.580
 movie together right 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.159
 I was there in the ad too but I did not 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.020
 Give it to me so it was both my carelessness 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.180
 things have not seen that movie came 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.310
 and did not see that there was no battery 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.619
 It was an interesting surprise. 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.590
 to have been public so I have one more 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.450
 here to leave reservation 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.400
 when I did not have any more 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.989
 because danger is a disposable product and 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.299
 I 'm not going to leave forever. 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.060
 water damages or it is always good to have a 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:20.280
 The more that was cool had we see that 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.000
 the device as he had already done a boxing 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.600
 before it is already here 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:31.450
 I already untangled this side here right? 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.770
 sure we'll see here live within the 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.010
 video box also looked good 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.470
 complicated because I was ripping the 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.100
 things all then the images will stay 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.100
 much worse 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.780
 not strange civilians only the loader 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.120
 because it only comes with age the same cable 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.860
 usb and a charger connect devices 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.480
 not coming together 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:58.630
 Where are you going to have to use the appliance? 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.370
 it is the bi xenon is he has this 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.489
 part here notes for you to place the 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.360
 Theo is not going to lie down. 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.970
 good 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.620
 I was using try a box of 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.870
 old cassette tape 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:16.330
 now has a really cute dock 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:20.590
 to use this to do it he has here 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:24.760
 micro usb connection is for you to connect your 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:28.660
 bread was the focus for you to connect the 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:32.910
 Micro USB cable connects here viewing Cell 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:36.070
 take this part here she opens it 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.820
 here goes the battery right 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.890
 Luckily I have an extra battery I 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.560
 I have a gold battery, that crap. 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.880
 there they never say it lasts the most I do not know 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.760
 how many percent more than 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.560
 normal battery we the truth did not 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.049
 hard damn thing harder to 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.329
 less than the normal battery and can not 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.160
 listen to a fool there in the video saying 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.630
 that had no battery was defective 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.579
 that I should study more about the 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.579
 subject is not 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.530
 Then I put an answer, put it on. 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.150
 a video response showing how much 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.220
 the fat battery 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.209
 but it also shows the screen time 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.730
 connected 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:15.130
 if you do not and show and see the device 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.720
 without the cover without battery cover provides 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.910
 that the drummer in there 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.519
 otherwise I will not believe it 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:24.220
 so far the guy has not put the answer 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.090
 video waiting for the answer in 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.890
 video right guy 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.320
 I have a battery of crap 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.380
 the other goal battery still can 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.120
 break a branch when it's missing 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.520
 when my main battery has been 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.040
 finished so I can perfectly 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.750
 put the gold battery here and if that 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.940
 crap explode at least one 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.760
 exploded the device explode 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.150
 this touch here you do not know 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.130
 battery of doubtful origin 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.550
 you can have it exploding causing 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:58.650
 crashes like on the iphone 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:00.510
 iPhone not say why the problem and 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.490
 promised on the porter it was not like 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.750
 the user himself be playing drums 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:06.210
 it's that easy 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.010
 but as happened on galaxy 4 as 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.560
 happened in other appliances promises 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.370
 used a bad battery or wrong charger 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.140
 huh 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.880
 then in that case here if the battery 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.350
 that crap explodes at least not 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.200
 explodes a device that is much more 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:20.790
 expensive than this touch here right then he 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.990
 will be used to do this he 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.330
 will be used to charge the 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.610
 main battery too but at least 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.730
 do not risk losing my 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:32.880
 device with a boot an extra battery 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:34.620
 of dubious origin and exploding certain 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.810
 I keep using the battery because 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.920
 I already spent money on her. 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.220
 cheap 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.170
 Actually it was cheap, but I spent money 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:47.430
 I'm hardly going to keep throwing it all away. 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:49.350
 so I carry it here without worry and 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.970
 at the same time it has a legal dock for 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.670
 place the appliance here 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:58.440
 It will be great to use it well. 

00:05:53.670 --> 00:06:00.930
 the easier I watch tv series a lot 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.780
 and I have I have tv center month 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.370
 most of the time in the drawings 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.740
 excited because of my daughter then 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:11.280
 I watch some streaming channels 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.750
 bian smartphone and this is going to me 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.490
 I can do this quite simply. 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.100
 cooking while doing some other 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:20.610
 thing or studying or reading or 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:23.640
 preparing my classes not so nice 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:25.740
 there is a tip for those who want to have a 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.260
 more than riding with them always 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.240
 if need be by connecting the USB cable 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.060
 device because it has just one hour 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.200
 wearing usb input give right 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.200
 Thank you for that style.
