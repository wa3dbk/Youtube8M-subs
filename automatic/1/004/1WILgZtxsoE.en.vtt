00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
we see in the actual episode it seems

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.430 
we see in the actual episode it seems
that<00:04:16.910> he<00:04:17.000> mostly<00:04:17.269> stuck<00:04:17.570> with<00:04:17.720> Twilight<00:04:18.200> after

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440

that he mostly stuck with Twilight after
he<00:04:18.530> was<00:04:18.680> hatched<00:04:18.890> but<00:04:19.160> I'd<00:04:19.310> still<00:04:19.489> like<00:04:19.549> to

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
he was hatched but I'd still like to

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.009 
he was hatched but I'd still like to
think<00:04:19.790> that<00:04:20.090> enough<00:04:20.299> of<00:04:20.419> that<00:04:20.450> is<00:04:20.690> up<00:04:20.810> in<00:04:20.930> the

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
think that enough of that is up in the

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.840 
think that enough of that is up in the
air<00:04:21.049> that<00:04:21.380> he<00:04:21.440> still<00:04:21.680> considers<00:04:22.100> Celestia<00:04:22.669> to

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
air that he still considers Celestia to

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:24.580 
air that he still considers Celestia to
be<00:04:23.000> his<00:04:23.090> mom<00:04:23.360> the<00:04:23.810> one<00:04:23.960> thing<00:04:24.169> that<00:04:24.320> I<00:04:24.349> thought

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
be his mom the one thing that I thought

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:25.900 
be his mom the one thing that I thought
was<00:04:24.650> really<00:04:25.010> interesting<00:04:25.130> is<00:04:25.700> how<00:04:25.849> the

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
was really interesting is how the

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.200 
was really interesting is how the
Dragons<00:04:26.479> were<00:04:26.660> treated<00:04:27.050> mostly<00:04:27.380> as<00:04:27.500> villains

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
Dragons were treated mostly as villains

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.909 
Dragons were treated mostly as villains
all<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:28.539> other<00:04:28.660> dragons<00:04:29.169> that<00:04:29.259> we've<00:04:29.440> seen<00:04:29.740> up

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
all the other dragons that we've seen up

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.770 
all the other dragons that we've seen up
until<00:04:30.009> now<00:04:30.400> have<00:04:30.669> pretty<00:04:31.000> much<00:04:31.090> been<00:04:31.240> jerks

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
until now have pretty much been jerks

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.670 
until now have pretty much been jerks
who<00:04:31.930> were<00:04:32.020> concerned<00:04:32.380> with<00:04:32.530> their<00:04:32.650> own

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
who were concerned with their own

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.740 
who were concerned with their own
self-interest<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:33.639> nothing<00:04:34.000> else<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:34.360> in<00:04:34.660> a

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
self-interest and nothing else and in a

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.290 
self-interest and nothing else and in a
way<00:04:34.990> that<00:04:35.020> kind<00:04:35.620> of<00:04:35.830> makes<00:04:35.889> sense<00:04:36.550> except<00:04:37.150> for

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
way that kind of makes sense except for

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.150 
way that kind of makes sense except for
the<00:04:37.389> migration<00:04:38.110> here<00:04:38.470> all<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.740> dragons<00:04:39.099> that

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
the migration here all the dragons that

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.890 
the migration here all the dragons that
we've<00:04:39.340> seen<00:04:39.580> so<00:04:39.819> far<00:04:39.849> have<00:04:40.270> been<00:04:40.389> shown<00:04:40.660> to<00:04:40.690> be

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
we've seen so far have been shown to be

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.779 
we've seen so far have been shown to be
pretty<00:04:41.169> solitary<00:04:41.590> creatures<00:04:42.280> we've<00:04:42.580> only

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:42.789 
pretty solitary creatures we've only

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:45.809 
pretty solitary creatures we've only
ever<00:04:43.000> seen<00:04:43.090> one<00:04:43.720> dragon<00:04:44.319> one<00:04:44.740> cave<00:04:45.099> one<00:04:45.580> nest

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:45.819 
ever seen one dragon one cave one nest

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:48.089 
ever seen one dragon one cave one nest
at<00:04:45.940> a<00:04:46.030> time<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:46.569> in<00:04:46.870> that<00:04:46.930> sense<00:04:47.470> they<00:04:47.710> have<00:04:47.949> to

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
at a time and in that sense they have to

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:49.620 
at a time and in that sense they have to
look<00:04:48.280> out<00:04:48.370> for<00:04:48.400> themselves<00:04:48.669> because<00:04:49.180> no<00:04:49.449> one

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
look out for themselves because no one

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.390 
look out for themselves because no one
else<00:04:49.780> is<00:04:49.960> going<00:04:50.349> to<00:04:50.380> with<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:50.949> teenage

no bones about the fact that what
they're<00:04:56.620> doing<00:04:56.650> is<00:04:57.069> just<00:04:57.099> plain<00:04:57.819> bad<00:04:58.270> it's<00:04:58.750> not

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
they're doing is just plain bad it's not

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.450 
they're doing is just plain bad it's not
even<00:04:59.229> like<00:04:59.349> they're<00:04:59.500> hunting<00:04:59.830> for<00:05:00.009> food<00:05:00.220> or

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
even like they're hunting for food or

trying to hone their skills they
literally<00:05:02.410> just<00:05:02.530> got<00:05:02.979> bored<00:05:03.370> and<00:05:03.550> wanted<00:05:03.910> to

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
literally just got bored and wanted to

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.909 
literally just got bored and wanted to
break<00:05:04.300> something<00:05:04.660> and<00:05:04.990> whether<00:05:05.289> it's<00:05:05.530> an<00:05:05.650> egg

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 
break something and whether it's an egg

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.640 
break something and whether it's an egg
or<00:05:06.130> a<00:05:06.220> pony<00:05:06.639> or<00:05:06.759> a<00:05:06.940> baby<00:05:07.270> dragon<00:05:07.630> they<00:05:08.440> don't

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
or a pony or a baby dragon they don't

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.770 
or a pony or a baby dragon they don't
care<00:05:08.979> that<00:05:09.310> actually<00:05:09.880> makes<00:05:10.090> the<00:05:10.270> ending<00:05:10.599> even

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
care that actually makes the ending even

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.270 
care that actually makes the ending even
more<00:05:11.110> horrible<00:05:11.500> when<00:05:11.770> you<00:05:11.860> realize<00:05:12.250> that

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
more horrible when you realize that

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.339 
more horrible when you realize that
while<00:05:12.729> Spike<00:05:13.090> standing<00:05:13.509> up<00:05:13.630> to<00:05:13.750> them<00:05:13.900> was<00:05:14.139> the

00:05:14.339 --> 00:05:14.349 
while Spike standing up to them was the

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:15.839 
while Spike standing up to them was the
right<00:05:14.500> thing<00:05:14.710> to<00:05:14.800> do<00:05:14.949> he<00:05:15.220> really<00:05:15.250> would<00:05:15.759> have

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:15.849 
right thing to do he really would have

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:17.430 
right thing to do he really would have
gotten<00:05:16.090> his<00:05:16.300> ass<00:05:16.570> kicked<00:05:16.900> of<00:05:17.020> Twilight<00:05:17.410> you

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
gotten his ass kicked of Twilight you

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.020 
gotten his ass kicked of Twilight you
hadn't<00:05:17.710> been<00:05:17.830> there<00:05:17.979> to<00:05:18.039> teleport<00:05:18.610> them<00:05:18.759> away

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.030 
hadn't been there to teleport them away

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.820 
hadn't been there to teleport them away
and<00:05:19.419> I<00:05:19.539> think<00:05:19.780> this<00:05:19.960> comes<00:05:20.199> back<00:05:20.500> to<00:05:20.680> my

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:20.830 
and I think this comes back to my

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.860 
and I think this comes back to my
biggest<00:05:21.130> criticism<00:05:21.849> of<00:05:22.000> the<00:05:22.120> episode<00:05:22.630> the

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 
biggest criticism of the episode the

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.870 
biggest criticism of the episode the
spike<00:05:23.199> settled<00:05:23.560> way<00:05:23.800> too<00:05:23.860> quickly<00:05:24.340> in<00:05:24.580> trying

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:24.880 
spike settled way too quickly in trying

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.399 
spike settled way too quickly in trying
to<00:05:24.940> find<00:05:25.120> some<00:05:25.330> new<00:05:25.449> friends<00:05:25.479> instead<00:05:26.349> of

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:26.409 
to find some new friends instead of

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.559 
to find some new friends instead of
taking<00:05:26.889> just<00:05:26.919> a<00:05:27.190> little<00:05:27.580> bit<00:05:27.759> longer<00:05:28.030> to<00:05:28.300> check

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:28.569 
taking just a little bit longer to check

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:29.999 
taking just a little bit longer to check
out<00:05:28.750> the<00:05:28.900> other<00:05:28.930> groups<00:05:29.409> of<00:05:29.560> dragons<00:05:29.949> that

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
out the other groups of dragons that

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:31.890 
out the other groups of dragons that
were<00:05:30.159> hanging<00:05:30.340> around<00:05:30.550> still<00:05:31.449> though<00:05:31.690> the

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
were hanging around still though the

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.689 
were hanging around still though the
episode<00:05:32.259> has<00:05:32.470> a<00:05:32.500> lot<00:05:32.860> of<00:05:32.889> good<00:05:33.159> qualities

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
episode has a lot of good qualities

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.820

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
going for it it takes a lot of risks and

it is to watch her stand up for spite
the<00:05:43.120> way<00:05:43.210> that<00:05:43.389> she<00:05:43.509> does<00:05:43.659> this<00:05:44.110> is<00:05:44.349> definitely

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
the way that she does this is definitely

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.490 
the way that she does this is definitely
one<00:05:45.070> of<00:05:45.190> the<00:05:45.280> stronger<00:05:45.610> episodes<00:05:46.180> this<00:05:46.419> season
